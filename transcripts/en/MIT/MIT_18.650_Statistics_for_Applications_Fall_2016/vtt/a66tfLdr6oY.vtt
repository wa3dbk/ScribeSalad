00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.770
PROFESSOR: So we've been talking
about this chi square test.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.400
And the name chi square
comes from the fact

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.710
that we build a
test statistic that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.110
has asymptotic
distribution given

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.080
by the chi square distribution.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.460
Let's just give it another shot.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.440
OK.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.210
This test.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.770
Who has actually ever
encountered the chi square test

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.150
outside of a stats classroom?

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.930
All right.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.940
So some people have.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.160
It's a fairly common test
that you might encounter.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.650
And it was essentially
to test, if given

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.900
some data with a fixed
probability mass function, so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.580
a discrete
distribution, you wanted

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.990
to test if the PMF was
equal to a set value, p0,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.000
or if it was different from p0.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.480
And the way the chi
square arose here

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.160
was by looking at Wald's test.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.020
And essentially if you write--
so Wald's is the one that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.120
has the chi square as the
limiting distribution,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.900
and if you invert the
covariance matrix,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.900
the asymptotic covariance
matrix, so you compute

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.108
the Fisher information,
which in this particular case

00:01:36.108 --> 00:01:39.360
does not exist for the
multinomial distribution,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.180
but we found the trick
on how to do this.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.470
We remove the part that
forbid it to be invertible,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.309
then we found this chi
square distribution.

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:47.850
In a way we have
this test statistic,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.550
which you might have learned
as a black box, laundry list,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.280
but going through the math
which might have been slightly

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.010
unpleasant, I acknowledge,
but really told you

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.130
why you should do this
particular normalization.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.470
So since some of you requested
a little more practical examples

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.200
of how those things work,
let me show you a couple.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.210
The first one is you want to
answer the question, well,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.440
you know, when should I
be born to be successful.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.220
Some people believe in zodiac,
and so Fortune magazine

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.870
actually collected the signs of
256 heads of the Fortune 500.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.407
Those were taken randomly.

00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:27.990
And they were collected
there, and you

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.260
can see the count of
number of CEOs that

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.060
have a particular zodiac sign.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.580
And if this was completely
uniformly distributed,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.410
you should actually
get a number that's

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.540
around 256 divided by 12,
which in this case is 21.33.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.870
And you can see that
there is numbers

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.890
that are probably in the
vicinity, but look at this guy.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.360
Pisces, that's 29.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.020
So who's Pisces here?

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.600
All right.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.510
All right, so give
me your information

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.940
and we'll meet
again in 10 years.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.784
And so basically you
might want to test

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:04.950
if actually the fact that
it's uniformly distributed

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.280
is a valid assumption.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.240
Now this is clearly
a random variable.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.230
I pick a random
CEO and I measure

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.570
what his zodiac sign is.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.530
And I want to know, so it's a
probability over, I don't know,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.850
12 zodiac signs.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.330
And I want to know if
it's uniform or not.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.230
Uniform sounds like it
should be the status

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.390
quo, if you're reasonable.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.530
And maybe there's actually
something that moves away.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.950
So we could do this, in view
of these data is there evidence

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.720
that one is different.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.730
Here is another example
where you might want

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.560
to apply the chi square test.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.219
So as I said, the
benchmark distribution

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.260
was the uniform distribution
for the zodiac sign,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.843
and that's usually
the one I give you.

00:03:47.843 --> 00:03:49.890
1 over k, 1 over k,
because well that's

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.930
sort of the zero, the central
point for all distributions.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.354
That's the point, the center
of what we call the simplex.

00:03:57.354 --> 00:03:58.770
But you can have
another benchmark

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.970
that sort of makes sense.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.770
So for example this is an actual
dataset where 275 jurors were

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.360
identified, racial
group were collected,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.890
and you actually
might want to know

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.990
if you know juries
in this country

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.620
are actually representative
of the actual population.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.500
And so here of
course, the population

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.269
is not uniformly distributed
according to racial group.

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:24.810
And the way you
actually do it is you

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.450
actually go on
Wikipedia, for example,

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.700
and you look at the demographics
of the United States,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.570
and you find that the proportion
of white is 72%, black is 7%,

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:41.610
Hispanic is 12, and
other is about 9%.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.080
So that's a total of 1.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.670
And this is what we actually
measured for some jurors.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.120
So for this guy,
you can actually

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.470
run the chi square test.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.630
You have the estimated
proportion, which

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.070
comes from this first line.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.004
You have the tested
proportion, p0,

00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:56.670
that comes from the
second line, and you

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.503
might want to check if
those things actually

00:04:58.503 --> 00:04:59.970
correspond to each other.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.650
OK, so I'm not going
to do it for you,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.240
but I sort of
invite you to do it

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.400
and test, and see
how this compares

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.474
to the quantiles of
the appropriate chi

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.140
square distribution and see what
you can conclude from those two

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.320
things.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.820
All right.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.180
So this was the
multinomial case.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.110
So this is essentially
what we did.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.130
We computed the MLE under
the right constraint,

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.980
and that was our test
statistic that converges

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.130
to the chi square distribution.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.588
So if you've seen
it before, that's

00:05:23.588 --> 00:05:24.790
all that was given to you.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.820
Now we know why the
normalization here

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.310
is p0 j and not p0 j squared or
square root of p0 j, or even 1.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.074
I mean it's not clear
that this should

00:05:35.074 --> 00:05:36.490
be the right
normalization, but we

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.950
know that's what
comes from taking

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.410
the right normalization,
which comes from the Fisher

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.230
information.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.421
All right?

00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:43.920
OK.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.290
The thing I wanted to move
onto, so we've basically covered

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.130
chi square test.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.980
Are there any questions
about chi square test?

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.140
And for those of you who
were not here on Thursday,

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.662
I'm really just--

00:05:57.662 --> 00:05:59.530
do not pretend I just did it.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.730
That's something we
did last Thursday.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.324
But are there any
questions that arose

00:06:03.324 --> 00:06:04.990
when you were reading
your notes, things

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.230
that you didn't understand?

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.952
Yes.

00:06:06.952 --> 00:06:09.412
AUDIENCE: Is there
like a formal name?

00:06:09.412 --> 00:06:12.856
Before we had talked about
how what we call the Fisher

00:06:12.856 --> 00:06:17.776
information [INAUDIBLE],,
still has the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:21.834
because it's the same number.

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:23.250
PROFESSOR: So it's
not the Fisher.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.990
The Fisher information does
not exist in this case.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.992
And so there's no
appropriate name for this.

00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:30.450
It's the pseudoinverse of the
asymptotic covariance matrix,

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.462
and that's what it is.

00:06:32.462 --> 00:06:34.170
I don't know if I
mentioned it last time,

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.230
but there's this entire
field that uses--

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.420
you know, for people who really
aspire to differential geometry

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.095
but are stuck in the
stats department,

00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:43.470
and there's this thing called
information geometry, which

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.220
is essentially studying
the manifolds associated

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.460
to the Fisher information
metric, the metric that's

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.410
associated to
Fisher information.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.810
And so those of course can be
lower dimensional manifolds,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.002
not only distorts the
geometry but forces everything

00:06:58.002 --> 00:06:59.460
to live on a lower
dimension, which

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.410
is what happens when your Fisher
information does not exist.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.350
And so there's a bunch
of things that you

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.900
can study, what this manifold
looks like, et cetera.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.400
But no, there's no
particular terminology here

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.879
about going here.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.670
To be fair, within the
scope of this class,

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.320
this is the only
case where you--

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.970
multinomial case
is the only case

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:26.169
where you typically see a lack
of a Fisher information matrix.

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.460
And that's just because we
have these extra constraints

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.200
that the sum of the
parameters should be 1.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.866
And if you have an
extra constraint that

00:07:31.866 --> 00:07:34.370
seems like it's actually
remove one degree of freedom,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.470
this will happen inevitably.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.040
And so maybe what you
can do is reparameterize.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.240
So if I actually reparameterize
everything function of p1

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.940
to p k minus 1, and
then 1 minus the sum,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.500
this would not have happened.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.200
Because I have only a
k-dimensional space.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.170
So there's tricks
around this to make it

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.060
exist if you want it to exist.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.740
Any other question?

00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.240
All right.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.180
So let's move on to
Student's t-test.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.650
We mentioned it last time.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.390
So essentially you've
probably done it

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.770
more even in the homework than
you've done it in lectures,

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.870
but just quickly this
is essentially the test.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.505
That's the test when we have
an actual data that comes

00:08:15.505 --> 00:08:16.630
from a normal distribution.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.750
There is no Central Limit
Theorem that exists.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.080
This is really to
account for the fact

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.140
that for smaller
sample sizes, it

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.920
might be the case that it's
not exactly true that when

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.860
I look at xn bar minus mu
divided by-- so if I look

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.010
at xn bar minus mu divided by
sigma times square root of n,

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.179
then this thing should have N
0, 1 distribution approximately.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.280
Right?

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.770
By the Central Limit Theorem.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.120
So that's for n large.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:53.780
But if n is small,
then it's still true

00:08:53.780 --> 00:09:00.910
when the data is N
mu, sigma squared,

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.940
then it's true that
square root of n--

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.040
so here it's approximately.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.720
And this is always true.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.930
But I don't know sigma
in practice, right?

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.550
Maybe mu, it comes from my,
maybe mu comes from my mu

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.830
0, maybe something
from the test statistic

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.290
where mu actually is here.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.490
But for this guy I'm
going to have inevitably

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.120
to find an estimator.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.800
And now in this case, for small
n, this is no longer true.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.375
And what the t
statistic is doing

00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:36.875
is essentially telling you what
the distribution of this guy

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:37.780
is.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.050
So what you should say
is that now this guy

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.440
has a t distribution with n
minus 1 degrees of freedom.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.296
That's basically the
laundry list stats

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:48.170
that you would learn.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.860
It says just look at a different
table, that's what it is.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.180
But we actually defined
what a t distribution was.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.510
And a t distribution
is basically

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:03.490
something that has the same
distribution as some N 0, 1,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.040
divided by the square
root of a chi square

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.110
with d degrees of
freedom divided by d.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.750
And that's a t distribution
with d degrees of freedom.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.785
And those two have
to be independent.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.280
And so what I need to check
is that this guy over there

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.030
is of this form.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.120
OK?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.830
So let's look at the numerator.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.986
Well, square root of
n, xn bar minus mu.

00:10:45.986 --> 00:10:47.610
What is the distribution
of this thing?

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.562
Is it an N 0, 1?

00:10:50.562 --> 00:10:52.569
AUDIENCE: N 0, sigma squared?

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.110
PROFESSOR: N 0,
sigma squared, right.

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:00.150
So I'm not going to put it here.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.714
So if I want this
guy to be N 0, 1,

00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:04.130
I need to divide by sigma,
that's what we have over there.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.820
So that's my N 0, 1 that's going
to play the role of this guy

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.300
here.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.970
So if I want to go
a little further,

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:21.090
I need to just say, OK, now I
need to have square root of n,

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.670
and I need to find
something here

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.300
that looks like my square
root of chi square divided

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.119
by-- yeah?

00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:29.452
AUDIENCE: Really quick question.

00:11:29.452 --> 00:11:32.700
The equals sign with the d on
top, that's just defined as?

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.440
PROFESSOR: No, that's
just the distribution.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.207
So, I don't know.

00:11:37.207 --> 00:11:38.290
AUDIENCE: Then never mind.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.800
PROFESSOR: Let's just write
it like that, if you want.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.406
I mean, that's not really
appropriate to have.

00:11:44.406 --> 00:11:46.030
Usually you write
only one distribution

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.310
on the right-hand inside
of this little thing.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.160
So not just this complicated
function of distributions.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.110
This is more like to explain.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.910
OK, and so usually
the thing you should

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.990
say that t is equal to this
X divided by square root of Z

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.660
divided by d where X
has normal distribution,

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.210
Z has chi square distribution
with d degrees of freedom.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.230
So what do we need here?

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.031
Well I need to have something
which looks like my sigma hat,

00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:10.530
right?

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.740
So somehow inevitably I'm going
to need to have sigma hat.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.866
Now of course I need to
divide this by my sigma

00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:19.990
so that my sigma goes away.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.195
And so now this thing here--

00:12:25.195 --> 00:12:27.880
sorry, I should move
on to the right, OK.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:33.270
And so this thing here, so
sigma hat is square root of Sn.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.300
And now I'm almost there.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.090
So this thing is actually
equal to square root of n.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.920
But this thing here
is actually not a--

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.890
so this thing here
follows a distribution

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.530
which is actually a
chi square, square root

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:11.510
of a chi square
distribution divided by n.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.340
Yeah, that's the square
root chi square distribution

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.740
with n minus 1 degrees
of freedom divided

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.360
by n, because sigma hat
is equal to 1 over n sum

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.290
from i equal 1 to n,
xi minus x bar squared.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.750
And we just said
that this part here

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.000
was a chi square distribution.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.770
We didn't just say it, we said
it a few lectures years back,

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.228
that this thing was a chi square
distribution, and the fact

00:13:39.228 --> 00:13:42.160
that the presence
of this x bar here

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.000
was actually removing one
degree of freedom from this sum.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.220
OK, so this guy here has
the same distribution

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.860
as a chi square n
minus 1 divided by n.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.100
So I need to actually still
arrange this thing a little bit

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.170
to have a t distribution.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.850
I should not see n here,
but I should n minus 1.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.396
The d is the same
as this d here.

00:14:06.396 --> 00:14:07.770
And so let me make
the correction

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.880
so that this actually happens.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.700
Well, if I actually write
this to be equal to--

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.950
so if I write square root of
n minus 1, as on the slide,

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:25.200
times xn bar minus
mu divided by--

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.150
well let me write it
as square root of Sn,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.550
which is my sigma hat.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.902
Then what this thing
is actually equal to,

00:14:33.902 --> 00:14:39.030
it follows a N 0, 1,
divided by the square root

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.560
of my chi square
distribution with n

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.150
minus 1 degrees of freedom.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.930
And here the fact
that I multiply

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.439
by square root of
n minus 1, and I

00:14:45.439 --> 00:14:47.730
have the square root of n
here, is essentially the same

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.440
as dividing here by n minus 1.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.600
And that's my tn distribution.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.190
My t distribution with n
minus 1 degrees of freedom.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.200
Just by definition of
what this thing is.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:00.700
OK?

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:22.631
All right.

00:15:22.631 --> 00:15:23.130
Yes?

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.387
AUDIENCE: Where'd you
get the square root from?

00:15:26.387 --> 00:15:27.220
PROFESSOR: This guy?

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.511
Oh sorry, that's sigma squared.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.210
Thank you.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.570
That's the estimator of the
variance, not the estimator

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.440
of the standard deviation.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.939
And when I want to divide it I
divide by standard deviation.

00:15:35.939 --> 00:15:38.480
Thank you.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.194
Any other question or remark?

00:15:40.194 --> 00:15:42.194
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't you
divide by sigma squared?

00:15:42.194 --> 00:15:45.617
The actual.

00:15:45.617 --> 00:15:47.410
The estimator for
the variance is

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:52.480
equal to sigma squared
times chi square, right?

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.975
PROFESSOR: The estimator
for the variance.

00:15:55.975 --> 00:15:56.850
Oh yes, you're right.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.325
So there's a sigma squared here.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.450
Is that what you're asking?

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:00.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:01.874
PROFESSOR: Yes, absolutely.

00:16:01.874 --> 00:16:03.760
And that's where,
it get cancels here.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.860
It gets canceled here.

00:16:10.048 --> 00:16:10.548
OK?

00:16:13.185 --> 00:16:15.310
So this is really a sigma
squared times chi square.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.120
OK.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.740
So the fact that
it's sigma squared

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.240
is just because I
can pull out sigma

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.030
squared and just think
those guys N 0, 1.

00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:33.090
All right.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.960
So that's my t distribution.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.950
Now that I actually have a
pivotal distribution, what I do

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.230
is that I form the statistic.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.480
Here I called it Tn tilde.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.260
OK.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.350
And what is this thing?

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.250
I know that this has a
pivotal distribution.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.150
So for example, I know
that the probability

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:05.660
that Tn tilde in absolute value
exceeds some number that I'm

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.420
going to call q alpha over
2 for the t n minus 1,

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.400
is equal to alpha.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.880
So that's basically,
remember the t distribution

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.700
has the same shape as the
Gaussian distribution.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.920
What I'm finding is,
for this t distribution,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.079
some number q alpha
over 2 of t n minus 1

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.370
and minus q alpha
over 2 of t minus 1.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.610
So those are different
from the Gaussian one.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.290
Such that the area
under the curve

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.530
here is alpha over
2 on each side

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.770
so that the probability that
my absolute value exceeds

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.790
this number is equal to alpha.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.040
And that's what I'm going
to use to reject the test.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:59.270
So now my test becomes, for H0,
say mu is equal to some mu 0,

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:05.015
versus H1, mu is
not equal to mu 0.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.090
The rejection region is going
to be equal to the set on which

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:19.520
square root of n minus 1 times
xn bar minus mu 0 this time,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:25.700
divided by square root of Sn
exceeds, in absolute value,

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.580
exceeds q-- sorry
that's already here--

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:34.130
exceeds q alpha over
2 of t n minus 1.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.200
So I reject when
this thing increases.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.050
The same as the Gaussian case,
except that rather than reading

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.410
my quantiles from
the Gaussian table

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.550
I read them from
the Student table.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.600
It's just the same thing.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.740
So they're just going to
be a little bit farther.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.640
So this guy here is just
going to be a little bigger

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.500
than the one for
the Gaussian one,

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.170
because it's going to require
me a little more evidence

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.060
in my data to be able
to reject because I

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.411
have to account for the
fluctuations of sigma hat.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.800
So of course Student's
test is used everywhere.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.800
People use only t tests, right?

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.190
If you look at any
data point, any output,

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.504
even if you had
500 observations,

00:19:21.504 --> 00:19:23.420
if you look at the
statistical software output

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.220
it's going to say t test.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.630
And the reason
why you see t test

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.420
is because somehow it's felt
like it's not asymptotic.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.850
You don't need to
actually do, you

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.680
know, to be
particularly careful.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.705
And anyway, if n
is equal to 500,

00:19:35.705 --> 00:19:37.730
since the two curves
are above each other

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.019
it's basically the same thing.

00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:40.560
So it doesn't really
change anything.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.320
So why not use the t test?

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.460
So it's not asymptotic.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.040
It doesn't require Central
Limit Theorem to kick in.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.940
And so in particular it be run
if you have 15 observations.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.770
Of course, the drawback
of the Student test

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.228
is that it relies
on the assumption

00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:56.579
that the sample is Gaussian,
and that's something

00:19:56.579 --> 00:19:57.870
we really need to keep in mind.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.710
If you have a small sample size,
there is no magic going on.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.320
It's not like Student t
test allows you to get rid

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.720
of this asymptotic normality.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.520
It sort of assumes
that it's built in.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:14.150
It assumes that your data
has a Gaussian distribution.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:18.580
So if you have 15 observations,
what are you going to do?

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.610
You want to test if the mean is
equal to 0 or not equal to 0,

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.510
but you have only
15 observations.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.900
You have to somehow assume
that your data is Gaussian.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.270
But if the data is given
to you, this is not math,

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.514
you actually have to
check that it's Gaussian.

00:20:32.514 --> 00:20:33.930
And so we're going
to have to find

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:38.840
a test that, given some data,
tells us whether it's Gaussian

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.830
or not.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.320
If I have 15
observations, 8 of them

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.089
are equal to plus 1 and 7 of
them are equal to minus 1,

00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:47.630
then it's pretty
unlikely that you're

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.046
going to be able to conclude
that your data has a Gaussian

00:20:50.046 --> 00:20:51.000
distribution.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.320
However, if you see some sort
of spread around some value,

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.120
you form a histogram
maybe and it sort of

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.710
looks like it's a
Gaussian, you might

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:59.120
want to say it's Gaussian.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.920
And so how do we make
this more quantitative?

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.390
Well, the sad answer
to this question

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.030
is that there will be some
tests that make it quantitative,

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.590
but here, if you think about it
for one second, what is going

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.030
to be your null hypothesis?

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.930
Your null hypothesis,
since it's one point,

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.880
it's going to be
that it's Gaussian,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.290
and then the
alternative is going

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.520
to be that it's not Gaussian.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.860
So what it means is
that, for the first time

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.140
in your statistician
life, you're

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.142
going to want to conclude
that H0 is the true one.

00:21:30.142 --> 00:21:31.600
You're definitely
not going to want

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.016
to say that it's not Gaussian,
because then everything you

00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:36.580
know is sort of falling apart.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.540
And so it's kind of
a weird thing where

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.430
you're sort of going
to be seeking tests

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.140
that have no power basically.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.240
You're going to want to test
that, and that's the nature.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.140
The amount of
alternatives, the number

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.710
of ways you can be not
Gaussian, is so huge

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.569
that all tests are sort of
bound to have very low power.

00:21:56.569 --> 00:21:58.860
And so that's why people are
pretty happy with the idea

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.420
that things are
Gaussian, because it's

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.961
very hard to find
a test that's going

00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:04.790
to reject this hypothesis.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.479
And so we're even going to find
some tests that are visual,

00:22:08.479 --> 00:22:10.020
where you're going
to be able to say,

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.800
well, sort of looks
Gaussian to me.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.760
It allows you to deal
with the borderline cases

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.580
pretty efficiently.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.930
We'll see actually a
particular example.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.280
All right, so this
theory of testing

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.470
whether data comes from
a particular distribution

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.930
is called goodness of fit.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.480
Is this distribution a
good fit for my data?

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.620
That's the goodness of fit test.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.110
We have just seen a
goodness of fit test.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.690
What was it?

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.143
Yeah.

00:22:44.143 --> 00:22:46.090
The chi square test, right?

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.660
The case square test, we
were given a candidate PMF

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.390
and we were testing if this
was a good fit for our data.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.490
That was a goodness of fit test.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.190
So of course multinomial
is one example,

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.500
but really what we have
in the back of our mind is

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.210
I want to test if
my data is Gaussian.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.410
That's basically
the usual thing.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.010
And just like you always see
t test as the standard output

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.220
from statistical software
whether you ask for it or not,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.530
there will be a
test for normality

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:16.500
whether you ask it or not from
any statistical software app.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.020
All right.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.580
So a goodness of fit
test looks as follows.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.340
There's a random
variable X and you're

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.909
given i.i.d. copies
of X, X1 to Xn,

00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:25.450
they come from the
same distribution.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.750
And you're going to ask the
following question: does X have

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.510
a standard normal distribution?

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.520
So for t distribution
that's definitely

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.720
the kind of questions
you may want to ask.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.820
Does X have a uniform
distribution on 0, 1?

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.560
That's different from
the distribution 1

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.110
over k, 1 over k, it's
the continuous notion

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.430
of uniformity.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.950
And for example, you
might want to test that--

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:51.700
so there's actually a
nice exercise, which

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.580
is if you look at the p-values.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.900
So we've defined what
the p-values were.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.710
And the p-value's a number
between 0 and 1, right?

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.270
And you could
actually ask yourself,

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.660
what is the distribution of
the p-value under the null?

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.000
So the p-value is
a random number.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.180
It's the probability-- so
the p-value-- let's look

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.720
at the following test.

00:24:17.995 --> 00:24:25.190
H0, mu is equal to 0, versus
H1, mu is not equal to 0.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.757
And I know that the p-value is--

00:24:28.757 --> 00:24:29.840
so I'm going to form what?

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.832
I'm going to look
at Xn bar minus mu

00:24:34.832 --> 00:24:37.040
times square root of n
divided by-- let's say that we

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.040
know sigma for one second.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.040
Then the p-value
is the probability

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:48.590
that this is larger then
square root of n little xn

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:54.775
bar minus mu, minus 0
actually in this case,

00:24:54.775 --> 00:24:59.600
divided by sigma, where
this guy is the observed.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.510
OK.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.890
So now you could say, well,
how is that a random variable?

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.260
It's just a number.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.380
It's just a probability
of something.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.090
But then I can view this
as a function of this guy

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:23.190
here when I plug it back
to be a random variable.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.040
So what I mean by this is
that if I look at this value

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:34.520
here, if I say that phi
is the CDF of N 0, 1,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.260
so the p-value is
the probability

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.730
that it exceeds this.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.730
So that's the probability
that I'm either here or here.

00:25:44.258 --> 00:25:47.975
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:47.975 --> 00:25:49.266
PROFESSOR: No, it's not, right?

00:25:49.266 --> 00:25:52.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.290
PROFESSOR: This is a big
X and this is a small x.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.685
This is just where
you plug in your data.

00:25:57.685 --> 00:25:59.310
The p-value is the
probability that you

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.180
have more evidence
against your null

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.390
than what you already have.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.820
OK, so now I can
write it in terms

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.190
of cumulative
distribution functions.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.940
So this is what?

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.480
This is phi of this guy, which
is minus this thing here.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.270
Well it's basically
2 times this guy,

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:27.950
phi of minus square root of
n, Xn bar divided by sigma.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.652
That's my p-value.

00:26:31.652 --> 00:26:33.860
If you give me data, I'm
going to compute the average

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.435
and plug it in there, and
it can spit out the p-value.

00:26:36.435 --> 00:26:37.340
Everybody agrees?

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.940
So now I can view this, if I
start now looking back I say,

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.710
well, where does
this data come from?

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.520
Well, it could be
a random variable.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.340
It came from the
realization of this thing.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.664
So I can try to, I can
think of this value,

00:26:54.664 --> 00:26:57.080
where now this is a random
variable because I just plugged

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.840
in a random variable in here.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.240
So now I view my p-value
as a random variable.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.960
So I keep switching from
small x to large X. Everybody

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.740
agrees what I'm doing here?

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.490
So I just wrote it as a
deterministic function

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.135
of some deterministic
number, and now the function

00:27:14.135 --> 00:27:17.520
stays deterministic but
the number becomes random.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.702
And so I can think of this
as some statistic of my data.

00:27:21.702 --> 00:27:23.660
And I could say, well,
what is the distribution

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.560
of this random variable?

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.480
Now if my data is actually
normally distributed,

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.810
so I'm actually
under the null, so

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:37.570
under the null, that means that
Xn bar times square root of n

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.947
divided by sigma has
what distribution?

00:27:48.335 --> 00:27:48.835
Normal?

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.260
Well it was sigma,
I assume I knew it.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.520
So it's N 0, 1, right?

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.080
I divided by sigma here.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.010
OK?

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.500
So now I have this
random variable.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:24.012
And so my random variable is now
2 phi of minus absolute value

00:28:24.012 --> 00:28:24.595
of a Gaussian.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:40.300
And I'm actually interested in
the distribution of this thing.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.620
I could ask that.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.150
Anybody has an idea
of how you would

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.017
want to tackle this thing?

00:28:45.017 --> 00:28:46.600
If I ask you, what
is the distribution

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.930
of a random variable, how
do you tackle this question?

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.360
There's basically two ways.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.880
One is to try to
find something that

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:02.090
looks like the expectation
of h of x for all h.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.790
And you try to write this
using change of variables

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:09.260
and something that looks like
integral of h of x p of x dx.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.540
And then you say, well,
that's the density.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.290
If you can read this
for any h, then that's

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.970
the way you would do it.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.160
But there's a simpler
way that does not

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.805
involve changing
variables, et cetera,

00:29:21.805 --> 00:29:23.930
you just try to compute
the cumulative distribution

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.250
function.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.900
So let's try to
compute the probability

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:34.850
that 2 phi minus N
0, 1, is less than t.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.130
And maybe we can find
something we know.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:38.630
OK.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.713
Well that's equal to what?

00:29:39.713 --> 00:29:43.040
That's the probability
that a minus N 0,

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.968
well let's say that an N 0, 1--

00:29:45.968 --> 00:29:57.590
sorry, N 0, 1 absolute value is
greater than minus phi inverse

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.600
of t over 2.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.477
And that's what?

00:30:05.477 --> 00:30:07.560
Well, it's just the same
thing that we had before.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.990
It's equal to-- so
if I look again,

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.840
this is the probability that
I'm actually on this side

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.550
or that side of this number.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:18.650
And this number is what?

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:25.840
It's minus phi of t over 2.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.080
Why do I have a minus here?

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.880
That's fine, OK.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.220
So it's actually not this,
it's actually the probability

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.830
that my absolute value--

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.340
oh, because phi inverse.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.330
OK.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.460
Because phi inverse is--

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.280
so I'm going to
look at t between 0

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.440
and-- so this number is
ranging between 0 and 1.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.170
So it means that this number
is ranging between 0--

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.230
well, the probability that
something is less than t

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:03.030
should be ranging between the
numbers that this guy takes,

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.500
so that's between 0 and 2.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.750
Because this thing takes
values between 0 and 2.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.824
I want to see 0 and 1, though.

00:31:21.048 --> 00:31:23.533
AUDIENCE: Negative absolute
value is always less

00:31:23.533 --> 00:31:24.776
than [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:29.314 --> 00:31:29.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.979
You're right, thank you.

00:31:30.979 --> 00:31:34.090
So this is always some
number which is less than 0,

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.490
so the probability that
the Gaussian is less

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.710
than this number is always
less than the probability

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.750
it's less than 0,
which is 1/2, so t only

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.890
has to be between 0 and 1.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.940
Thank you.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.380
And so now for t
between 0 and 1, then

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.680
this guy is actually becoming
something which is positive,

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.274
for the same reason as before.

00:31:52.274 --> 00:31:53.065
And so that's what?

00:31:53.065 --> 00:32:04.710
That's just basically 2 times
phi of phi inverse of t over 2.

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.750
That's just playing with
the symmetry a little bit.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.695
You can look at the
areas under the curve.

00:32:11.695 --> 00:32:13.820
And so what it means is
that those two guys cancel.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.320
This is the identity.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.740
And so this is equal to t.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.240
So which distribution
has a density--

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.410
sorry, which distribution
has a cumulative distribution

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:32.040
function which is equal to
t for t between 0 and 1?

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.140
That's the uniform
distribution, right?

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.800
So it means that this guy
follows a uniform distribution

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.130
on the interval 0, 1.

00:32:44.264 --> 00:32:45.680
And you could
actually check that.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.240
For any test you're
going to come up with,

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.448
this is going to be the case.

00:32:48.448 --> 00:32:52.340
Your p-value under the null
will have a distribution

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.330
which is uniform.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:58.070
So now if somebody shows up
and says, here's my test,

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.552
it's awesome, it
just works great.

00:33:00.552 --> 00:33:02.510
I'm not going to explain
to you how I built it,

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:03.926
it's a complicated
statistics that

00:33:03.926 --> 00:33:06.740
involve moments of order 27.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.510
And I'm like, OK,
you know, how am I

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.690
going to test that your test
statistic actually makes sense?

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:16.090
Well one thing I can do
is to run a bunch of data,

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.440
draw a bunch of samples,
compute your test statistic,

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.610
compute the p-value, and
check if my p-value has

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:27.050
a uniform distribution
on the interval 0, 1.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.340
But for that I need
to have a test that,

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.110
given a bunch of
observations, can tell me

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.060
whether they're actually
distributed uniformly

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.410
on the interval 0, 1.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.750
And again one thing I could
do is build a histogram

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.032
and see if it looks
like that of a uniform,

00:33:40.032 --> 00:33:42.240
but I could also try to be
slightly more quantitative

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.232
about this.

00:33:43.232 --> 00:33:44.954
AUDIENCE: Why does
the [INAUDIBLE] have

00:33:44.954 --> 00:33:47.039
to be for a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:48.080
PROFESSOR: For two tests?

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.461
AUDIENCE: For each test.

00:33:51.461 --> 00:33:54.370
Why does the p-value
have to be normal?

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.096
I mean, uniform.

00:33:55.096 --> 00:33:57.620
PROFESSOR: It's
uniform under the null.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.599
So because my test statistic
was built under the null,

00:34:00.599 --> 00:34:03.140
and so I have to be able to plug
in the right value in there,

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.806
otherwise it's going
to shift everything

00:34:04.806 --> 00:34:06.078
for this particular test.

00:34:06.078 --> 00:34:08.203
AUDIENCE: At the beginning
while your probabilities

00:34:08.203 --> 00:34:09.910
were of big Xn, that thing.

00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:11.848
That thing is the p-value.

00:34:11.848 --> 00:34:13.389
PROFESSOR: That's
the p-value, right?

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.038
That's the definition
of the p-value.

00:34:15.038 --> 00:34:15.579
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:17.604 --> 00:34:19.020
PROFESSOR: So it's
the probability

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:23.835
that my test statistic exceeds
what I've actually observed.

00:34:23.835 --> 00:34:26.270
AUDIENCE: So how you run
the test is basically

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.679
you have your
observations and plug them

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.575
into the cumulative distribution
function for a normal,

00:34:33.575 --> 00:34:35.854
and then see if it
falls under the given--

00:34:35.854 --> 00:34:36.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.850
So my p-value is
just this number

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.429
when I just plug in the
values that I observe here.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:43.179
That's one number.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:45.040
For every dataset
you're going to give me,

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.820
it's going to be one number.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:51.820
Now what I can do is generate
a bunch of datasets of size n,

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.436
like 200 of them.

00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:55.060
And then I'm going
to have a new sample

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:59.000
of say 200, which is just
the sample of 200 p-values.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.770
And I want to test if
those p-values have

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.360
a uniform distribution.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:02.930
OK?

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.688
Because that's the distribution
they should be having.

00:35:05.688 --> 00:35:06.676
All right?

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.174
OK.

00:35:12.174 --> 00:35:13.340
This one we've already seen.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.410
Does x have a PMF with
30%, 50%, and 20%?

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.070
That's something I
could try to test.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:27.260
That looks like your grade point
distribution for this class.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.230
Well not exactly, but
that looks like it.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.039
So all these things are known
as goodness of fit tests.

00:35:33.039 --> 00:35:34.580
The goodness of fit
test is something

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.180
that you want to know if the
data that you have at hand

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.390
follows the hypothesized
distribution.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.010
So it's not a parametric test.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:46.790
It's not a test that says, is
my mean equal to 25 or not.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:51.200
Is my proportion of heads
larger than 1/2 or not?

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.494
It's something that
says, my distribution

00:35:53.494 --> 00:35:54.410
this particular thing.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.690
So I'm going to write them as
goodness of fit, G-O-F here.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.940
You don't need to have
parametric modeling to do that.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.760
So how do I work?

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.550
So if I don't have any
parametric modeling,

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.430
I need to have something which
is somewhat non-parametric,

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.860
something that goes
beyond computing the mean

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.630
and the standard
deviation, something

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.900
that computes some intrinsic
non-parametric aspect

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.370
of my data.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:24.400
And just like here we made
this computation, what we did

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.490
is we said well,
if I actually check

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:34.340
that the CDF of my data,
that my p-value is uniform,

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.500
then I know it's uniform.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.840
So it means that the cumulative
distribution function

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.850
has an intrinsic value
about it that captures

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:41.740
the entire distribution.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.200
Everything I need to know
about my distribution

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.320
is captured by the cumulative
distribution function.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.810
Now I have an empirical
way of computing,

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.180
I have a data-driven
way of computing

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.850
an estimate for the cumulative
distribution function, which

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.040
is using the old
statistical trick which

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.190
consists of replacing
expectations by averages.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:04.420
So as I said, the cumulative
distribution function

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.440
for any distribution, for
any random variable, is--

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:17.610
so F of t is the
probability that X

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.600
is less than or
equal to t, which

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.630
is equal to the expectation
of the indicator

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:26.110
that X is less
than or equal to t.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:28.310
That's the definition
of a probability.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.660
And so here I'm just going
to replace expectation

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.390
by the average.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.480
That's my usual
statistical trick.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:42.980
And so my estimator Fn for--

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.940
the distribution is going
to be 1 over n sum from i

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.423
equal 1 to n of
these indicators.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.780
And this is called
the empirical CDF.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.050
It's just the data
version of the CDF.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.423
So I just replaced this
expectation here by an average.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:17.270
Now when I sum
indicators, I'm actually

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.570
counting the number of them
that satisfy something.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:24.070
So if you look at
what this guy is,

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:32.820
this is the number of X i's
that is less than t, right?

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.355
And so if I divide by n, it's
the proportion of observations

00:38:35.355 --> 00:38:36.840
I have that are less than t.

00:38:41.821 --> 00:38:43.570
That's what the empirical
distribution is.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.280
That's what's written here,
the number of data points

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.080
that are less than t.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.670
And so this is going
to be something

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.511
that's sort of trying to
estimate one or the other.

00:38:57.511 --> 00:38:59.010
And the law of large
number actually

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:03.240
tells me that for any given t,
if n is large enough, Fn of t

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.600
should be close to F of t.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.010
Because it's an average.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.610
And this entire thing, this
entire statistical trick,

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.820
which consists of replacing
expectations by averages,

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.610
is justified by the
law of large number.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.610
Every time we used it, that was
because the law of large number

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.560
sort of guaranteed to
us that the average was

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.057
close to the expectation.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.250
OK.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.760
So law of large numbers tell
me that Fn of t converges,

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.010
so that's the strong law, says
that almost surely actually

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.390
Fn of t goes to F of t.

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.260
And that's just for any given t.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.650
Is there any
question about this?

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.329
That averages converge
to expectation,

00:39:48.329 --> 00:39:49.620
that's the law of large number.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.704
And almost surely we
could say in probability

00:39:54.704 --> 00:39:57.120
it's the same, that would be
the weak law of large number.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.960
Now this is fine.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.470
For any given t, the average
converges to the true.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:09.010
It just happens that this
random variable is indexed by t,

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.460
and I could do it for
t equals 1 or 2 or 25,

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.280
and just check it again.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.145
But I might want to check
it for all t's at once.

00:40:18.145 --> 00:40:19.770
And that's actually
a different result.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.960
That's called a
uniform result. I

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.200
want this to hold for
all t at the same time.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.720
And it may be the case that it
works for each t individually

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.200
but not for all t's
at the same time.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.330
What could happen is
that for t equals 1

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.326
it converges at a certain
rate, and for t equals 2

00:40:36.326 --> 00:40:37.950
it converges at a
bit of a slower rate,

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:41.010
and for t equals 3 at a
slower rate and slower rate.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:43.770
And so as t goes to infinity,
the rate is going to vanish

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.360
and nothing is
going to converge.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.290
That could happen.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.600
I could make this happen
at a finite point.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.850
There's many ways where
it could make this happen.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.780
Let's see how that could work.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.780
I could say, well, actually no.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.115
I still need to have this
at infinity for some reason.

00:40:59.115 --> 00:41:01.686
It turns out that this
is still true uniformly,

00:41:01.686 --> 00:41:03.810
and this is actually a much
more complicated result

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.340
than the law of large number.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.740
It's called
Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.270
And the
Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:14.960
tells me that, for all t's
at once, Fn converges to F.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.230
So let me just show
you quickly why

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:22.040
this is just a little
bit stronger than the one

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.900
that we had.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.120
If sup is confusing
you, think of max.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.880
It's just the max
over an infinite set.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:40.500
And so what we know is
that Fn of t goes to F of t

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.270
as n goes to infinity.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.560
And that's almost surely.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.360
And that's the law
of large numbers.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:54.920
Which is equivalent to saying
that Fn of t minus F of t as n

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.700
goes to infinity converges
almost surely to 0, right?

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.823
This is the same thing.

00:42:01.823 --> 00:42:07.217
Now I want this to happen
for all t's at once.

00:42:07.217 --> 00:42:09.300
So what I'm going to do--
oh, and this is actually

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.174
equivalent to this.

00:42:11.174 --> 00:42:12.840
And so what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.590
to make it a little stronger.

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.990
So here the arrow
only goes one way.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:20.660
And this is where the sup
for t in R of Fn of t.

00:42:26.847 --> 00:42:28.930
And you could actually
show that this happens also

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:29.513
almost surely.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.650
Now maybe almost
surely is a bit more

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:39.210
difficult to get a grasp on.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:48.630
Does anybody want to see, like
why this statement for this sup

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.030
is strictly stronger than the
one that holds individually

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.880
for all t's?

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.086
You want to see that?

00:42:54.086 --> 00:42:54.960
OK, so let's do that.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.410
So forget about it almost
surely for one second.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:59.660
Let's just do it in probability.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:09.690
The fact that Fn of t
converges to F of t for all t,

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.300
in probability means that
this goes to 0 as n goes

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.860
to infinity for any epsilon.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.150
For any epsilon in t
we know we have this.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:22.529
That's the convergence
in probability.

00:43:22.529 --> 00:43:24.070
Now what I want is
to put a sup here.

00:43:28.408 --> 00:43:32.920
The probability that the
sup is lower than epsilon,

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:38.080
might be actually always
larger than, never go to 0

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.090
in some cases.

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:42.410
It could be the case
that for each given t,

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:46.440
I can make n large enough so
that this probability becomes

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.640
small.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.950
But then maybe it's an n of t.

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:53.750
So this here means
that for any--

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.570
maybe I shouldn't put,
let me put a delta here.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:02.460
So for any epsilon, for
any t and for any epsilon,

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:09.800
there exists n, which could
depend on both epsilon

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.920
and t, such that the
probability that Fn t

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:25.110
minus F of t exceeding delta
is less than epsilon t.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:29.140
There exists an n and a delta.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.600
No, that's for all delta, sorry.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.100
So this is true.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:40.040
That's what this limit
statement actually means.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.060
But it could be the case that
now when I take the sup over t,

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:47.380
maybe that n of t is
something that looks like t.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.510
Or maybe, well,
integer part of t.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.175
It could be, right?

00:44:56.175 --> 00:44:57.050
I don't say anything.

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.710
It's just an n
that depends on t.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:04.730
So if this n is just t,
maybe t over epsilon,

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:05.930
because I want epsilon.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.610
Something like this.

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.470
Well that means
that if I want this

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:11.510
to hold for all t's
at once, I'm going

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.980
to have to go for the n that
works for all t's at once.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.070
But there's no such n that
works for all t's at once.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:21.830
The only n that
works is infinity.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.350
And so I cannot make this
happen for all of them.

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.420
What Glivenko-Cantelli
tells you,

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.090
it's actually this is not
something that holds like this.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:33.650
That the n that depends on t,
there's actually one largest n

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.150
that works for all the t's
at once, and that's it.

00:45:39.451 --> 00:45:39.950
OK.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:44.150
So just so you know why this is
actually a stronger statement,

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:48.880
and that's basically
how it works.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.567
Any other question?

00:45:50.567 --> 00:45:51.067
Yeah.

00:45:51.067 --> 00:45:53.271
AUDIENCE: So what's
the position for this

00:45:53.271 --> 00:45:54.979
to have, because the
random variable have

00:45:54.979 --> 00:45:57.179
a finite mean, finite variance?

00:45:57.179 --> 00:45:58.664
PROFESSOR: No.

00:45:58.664 --> 00:46:00.580
Well the random variable
does have finite mean

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.580
and finite variance,
because the random variable

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.580
is an indicator.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:04.830
So it has everything you want.

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.621
This is one of the
nicest random variables,

00:46:06.621 --> 00:46:08.410
this is a Bernoulli
random variable.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:11.952
So here when I say law of
large number, that this holds.

00:46:11.952 --> 00:46:12.910
Where did I write this?

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:14.140
I think I erased it.

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.440
Yeah, the one over there.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.570
This is actually the
law of large numbers

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:17.680
for Bernoulli random variables.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.930
They have everything you want.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.320
They're bounded.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:21.820
Yes.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.989
AUDIENCE: So I'm having
trouble understanding

00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:25.194
the first statement.

00:46:25.194 --> 00:46:27.122
So it says, for all
epsilon and all t,

00:46:27.122 --> 00:46:29.540
the probability of that--

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.040
PROFESSOR: So you mean this one?

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:31.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:34.760
PROFESSOR: For all
epsilon and all t.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.110
So you fix them now.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.050
Then the probability that,
sorry, that was delta.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:41.694
I changed this epsilon
to delta at some point.

00:46:41.694 --> 00:46:44.930
AUDIENCE: And then
what's the second line?

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:49.860
PROFESSOR: Oh, so then
the second line says that,

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:53.330
so I'm just rewriting in
terms of epsilon delta

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:56.360
what this n goes
to infinity means.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:01.880
So it means that for
any a t and delta,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.250
so that's the same
as this guy here,

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.284
then here I'm just going
back to rewriting this.

00:47:06.284 --> 00:47:08.450
It says that for any epsilon
there exists an n large

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:11.990
enough such that, well,
n larger than this thing

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:14.370
basically, such that this
thing is less than epsilon.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:21.420
So Glivenko-Cantelli tells us
that not only is this thing

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.150
a good idea pointwise, but it's
also a good idea uniformly.

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.690
And all it's saying
is if you actually

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:30.300
were happy with just
this result, you should

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.290
be even happier
with that result.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.570
And both of those results
only tell you one thing.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.720
They're just telling you
that the empirical CDF

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.196
is a good estimator of the CDF.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:47.720
Now since those indicators
are Bernoulli distributions,

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.390
I can actually do even more.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.130
So let me get this guy here.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:14.220
OK so, those guys,
Fn of t, this guy

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.530
is a Bernoulli distribution.

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:20.494
What is the parameter of
this Bernoulli distribution?

00:48:20.494 --> 00:48:22.410
What is the probability
that it takes value 1?

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:26.989
AUDIENCE: F of t.

00:48:26.989 --> 00:48:28.030
PROFESSOR: F of t, right?

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.484
It's just the probability
that this thing happens,

00:48:30.484 --> 00:48:31.150
which is F of t.

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:40.650
So in particular the
variance of this guy

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.540
is the variance
of this Bernoulli.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.730
So it's F of t 1 minus F of t.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:50.230
And I can use that in my
Central Limit Theorem.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.760
And Central Limit
Theorem is just

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.890
going to tell me that
if I look at the average

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:56.530
of random variables,
I remove their mean,

00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:01.000
so I look at square
root of n Fn of t,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.380
which I could really
write as xn bar, right?

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.730
That's really just an xn bar.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:08.320
Minus the expectation,
which is F

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.290
of t, that comes from this guy.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:16.000
Now if I divide by square
root of the variance, that's

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.950
my square root p1 minus p.

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:22.540
Then this guy, by the
Central Limit Theorem,

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.890
goes to some N 0, 1.

00:49:27.032 --> 00:49:28.740
Which is the same
thing as you see there,

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.865
except that the variance
was put on the other side.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:36.170
OK.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:42.422
Do I have the same
thing uniformly in t?

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:48.630
Can I write something
that holds uniformly in t?

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.940
Well, if you think
about it for one second

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.520
it's unlikely it's
going to go too well.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.650
In the sense that it's
unlikely that the supremum

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:58.530
of those random variables over t
is going to also be a Gaussian.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:08.120
And the reason is that,
well actually the reason

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.790
is that this thing is actually
a stochastic process indexed

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:11.460
by t.

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.870
A stochastic process is just
a sequence in random variables

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:17.060
that's indexed by,
let's say time.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.030
The one that's the most
famous is Brownian motion,

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:24.440
and it's basically a bunch
of Gaussian increments.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.170
So when you go from t to
just t a little after that,

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:30.180
you have add some
Gaussian into the thing.

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:33.770
And here it's basically the
same thing that's happening.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.970
And you would sort of expect,
since each of this guy

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:37.610
is Gaussian, you
would expect to see

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:40.005
something that looks like a
Brownian motion at the end.

00:50:40.005 --> 00:50:41.630
But it's not exactly
a Brownian motion,

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:43.671
it's something that's
called the Brownian bridge.

00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:45.920
So if you've seen the
Brownian motion, if I make

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.160
it start at 0 for example,
so this is the value

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.280
of my Brownian motion.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.110
Let's write it.

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:56.370
So this is one path, one
realization of Brownian motion.

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.350
Let's call it w of
t as t increases.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:04.430
So let's say it starts at 0 and
looks like something like this.

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:06.540
So that's what Brownian
motion looks like.

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:11.010
It's just something
that's pretty nasty.

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:13.710
I mean it looks pretty nasty,
it's not continuous et cetera,

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:19.110
but it's actually very
benign in some average way.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.150
So Brownian motion
is just something,

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:25.820
you should view this as if I
sum some random variable that

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.520
are Gaussian, and then I look at
this from farther and farther,

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.980
it's going to look like this.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.750
And so here I cannot have
a Brownian motion in the n,

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:40.030
because what is the variance
of Fn of t minus F of t at t is

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:40.673
equal to 1?

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.890
Sorry, at t is
equal to infinity.

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:48.390
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:49.460
PROFESSOR: It's 0, right?

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.100
The variance goes from 0
at t is negative infinity,

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:56.940
because at negative infinity
F of t is going to 0.

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.850
And as t goes to
plus infinity, F of t

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:03.590
is going to 1, which means that
the variance of this guy as t

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:06.320
goes from negative
infinity to plus infinity

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.990
is pinned to be 0 on each side.

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:12.200
And so my Brownian
motion cannot,

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.630
when I describe a Brownian
motion I'm just adding more

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:16.880
and more entropy to the
thing and it's going all over

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.450
the place, but here what I want
is that as I go back it should

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:21.920
go back to essentially 0.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:25.280
It should be pinned down to
a specific value at the n.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.322
And that's actually called
the Brownian bridge.

00:52:27.322 --> 00:52:29.030
It's a Brownian motion
that's conditioned

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:32.546
to come back to where
it started essentially.

00:52:32.546 --> 00:52:35.170
Now you don't need to understand
Brownian bridges to understand

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:36.780
what I'm going to
be telling you.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.040
The only thing I want
to communicate to you

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.720
is that this guy here, when
I say a Brownian bridge,

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.010
I can go to any probabilist
and they can tell you

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:51.167
all the probability properties
of this stochastic process.

00:52:51.167 --> 00:52:52.750
It can tell me the
probability that it

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:55.120
takes any value at any point.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.370
In particular, it can tell me--

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:01.040
the supremum between
0 and 1 of this guy,

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.230
it could tell me what the
cumulative distribution

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.813
function of this
thing is, can tell me

00:53:04.813 --> 00:53:07.585
what the density of this thing
is, can tell me everything.

00:53:07.585 --> 00:53:09.710
So it means that if I want
to compute probabilities

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:14.210
on this object here, which is
the maximum value that this guy

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.565
can take over a certain period
of time, which is basically

00:53:17.565 --> 00:53:18.440
this random variable.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.390
So if I look at the
value here, it's

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:22.310
a random variable
that fluctuates.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:25.160
It can tell me where it is
with hyperability, can tell me

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.790
the quantiles of this
thing, which is useful

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:31.440
because I can build a table and
use it to compute my quantiles

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.480
and form tests from it.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.100
So that's what
actually is quite nice.

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.170
It says that if I look at
the square root of n Fn

00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:40.999
hat minus sup over
t, I get something

00:53:40.999 --> 00:53:42.790
that looks like the
sup of these Gaussians,

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:44.290
but it's not really
sup of Gaussian,

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:46.040
it's sup of a Brownian motion.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.290
Now there's something you
should be very careful here.

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:49.210
I cheated a little bit.

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:51.251
I mean, I didn't cheat,
I can do whatever I want.

00:53:51.251 --> 00:53:55.730
But my notation might
be a little confusing.

00:53:55.730 --> 00:54:01.870
Everybody sees that this t here
is not the same as this t here?

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:03.140
Can somebody see that?

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.690
Just because, first of all,
this guy's between 0 and 1.

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:09.550
And this guy is in all of R.

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:12.760
What is this t here?

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.040
As a function of this t here?

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.770
This guy is F of this guy.

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:27.790
So really, if I want it to
be completely transparent

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:32.750
and not save the
keys of my keyboard,

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:42.460
I would read this as sup
over t of Fn t minus F of t

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:46.430
goes to N distribution
as n goes to infinity.

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:50.440
The supremum over t,
again in R, so this guy is

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.655
for t in the entire
real line, this guy

00:54:52.655 --> 00:54:54.620
is for t in the
entire real line.

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:58.440
But now I should
write b of what?

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.710
F of t, exactly.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:04.150
So really the t here is
F of the original one.

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:06.570
And so that's a
Brownian bridge, where

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.870
when t goes to infinity
the Brownian bridge

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.670
goes from 0 to 1 and
it looks like this.

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:16.100
A Brownian bridge at
0 is 0, at 1 it's 0.

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:18.470
And it does this.

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:20.580
But it doesn't stray too
far because I condition

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.860
it to come back to this point.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:26.600
That's what a
Brownian bridge is.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.450
OK.

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:33.527
So in particular, I can find
a distribution for this guy.

00:55:33.527 --> 00:55:35.610
And I can use this to build
a test which is called

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:37.120
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:40.895
The idea is the following.

00:55:40.895 --> 00:55:44.875
It says, if I want to
test some distribution

00:55:44.875 --> 00:55:49.650
F0, some distribution that
has a particular CDF F0,

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:52.360
and I plug it in
under the null, then

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.420
this guy should have pretty
much the same distribution

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.090
as the supremum of
Brownian bridge.

00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:00.790
And so if I see this to be
much larger than it should

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:02.980
be when it's the supremum
of a Brownian bridge,

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:05.020
I'm actually going to
reject my hypothesis.

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:09.290
So here's the test.

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:17.100
I want to test whether
H0, F is equal to F0,

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:22.850
and you will see that most
of the goodness of fit tests

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:24.950
are formulated
mathematically in terms

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:26.960
of the cumulative
distribution function.

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.600
I could formulate them in
terms of personality density

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.270
function, or just
write x follows N 0, 1,

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:34.950
but that's the way we write it.

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.880
We formulate them in terms
of cumulative distribution

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.650
function because
that's what we have

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:42.320
a handle on through the
empirical cumulative

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.330
distribution function.

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:50.300
And then it's versus H1,
F is not equal to F0.

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.370
So now I have my empirical CDF.

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:54.650
And I hope that for
all t's, Fn of t

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:57.900
should be close to F0 of t.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.330
Let me write it like this.

00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:03.740
I put it on the exponent
because otherwise that

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:06.650
would be the empirical
distribution function based

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:07.970
on zero observations.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.011
Now I form the following
test statistic.

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:24.280
So my test statistic
is tn, which

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:28.120
is the supremum over t in
the real line of square root

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:34.494
of n Fn of t minus F
of t, sorry, F0 of t.

00:57:34.494 --> 00:57:35.660
So I can compute everything.

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.450
I know this from
the data, and this

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:39.930
is the one that comes
from my null hypothesis.

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:41.939
As I can compute this thing.

00:57:41.939 --> 00:57:43.480
And I know that if
this is true, this

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.180
should actually be the
supremum of a Brownian bridge.

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.940
Pretty much.

00:57:48.940 --> 00:58:01.620
And so the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test is simply,

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:09.080
reject if this guy,
tn, in absolute value,

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.690
no actually not
in absolute value.

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:13.590
This is just already
absolute valued.

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.960
Then this guy should be what?

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:20.580
It should be larger than the
q alpha over 2 distribution

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.540
that I have.

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:24.870
But now rather than
putting N 0, 1, or Tn,

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:30.016
this is here whatever
notation I have for supremum

00:58:30.016 --> 00:58:31.952
of Brownian bridge.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.710
Just like I did for any
pivotal distribution.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:45.900
That was the same recipe
every single time.

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.970
I formed the test
statistic such that

00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:51.330
the asymptotic distribution did
not depend on anything I know,

00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:54.300
and then I would just reject
when this pivotal distribution

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.080
was larger than something.

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.845
Yes?

00:58:56.845 --> 00:58:59.635
AUDIENCE: I'm not really sure
why Brownian bridge appears.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.542
PROFESSOR: Do you know what
a Brownian bridge is, or?

00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:06.500
AUDIENCE: Only vaguely.

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.100
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:14.320
So this thing here, think
of it as being a Gaussian.

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:18.110
So for all t you have a
Gaussian distribution.

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:27.270
Now a Brownian motion, so
if I had a Brownian motion

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:28.770
I need to tell you what the--

00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:30.300
so it's basically
a Brownian motion

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.730
is something that
looks like this.

00:59:31.730 --> 00:59:34.180
It's some random variable
that's indexed by t.

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:38.610
I want, say, the expectation
of Xt could be equal to 0

00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:40.640
for all t.

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.960
And what I want is
that the increments

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.640
have a certain distribution.

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:53.700
So what I want is that the
expectation of Xt minus Xs

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:58.050
follows some distribution
which is N 0, t minus s.

00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:00.750
So the increments are
bigger as I go farther,

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.580
in terms of variability.

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.880
And I also want some covariance
structure between the two.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:10.320
So what I want is that the
covariance between Xs and Xt

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.750
is actually equal to
the minimum of s and t.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.660
Yeah, maybe.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.220
Yeah, that should be there.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.040
So this is, you open a
probability book, that's

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.370
what it's going to look like.

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:31.710
So in particular, you
can see, if I put 0 here

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:34.390
and X0 is equal to
0, it has 0 variance.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:38.180
So in particular,
it means that Xt,

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.920
if I look only at
the t-th one, it

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.110
has some normal distribution
with variance t.

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:46.050
So this is something
that just blows up.

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:49.230
So this guy here
looks like it's going

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:50.730
to be a Brownian
motion because when

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.700
I look at the left-hand side
it has a normal distribution.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.950
Now there's a bunch of other
things you need to check.

01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:58.325
It's the fact that you have
this covariance, for example,

01:00:58.325 --> 01:01:00.090
which I did not tell you.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.300
But it sure look
somewhat like that.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.590
And in particular, when I
look at the normal with mean 0

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.440
and variance here,
then it's clear

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.420
that this guy does not
have a variance that's

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:16.560
going to go to infinity just
like the variance of this guy.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.620
We know that the variance
is forced to be back to 0.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.290
And so in particular
we have something

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:28.270
that has mean 0 always, whose
variance has to be 0 at 0,

01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:31.870
and variance-- sorry, at t
equals negative infinity,

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:34.890
and variance 1 at t
equals plus infinity.

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:36.920
So a variance 0 at t
equals plus infinity,

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.420
and so I have to basically force
it to be equal to 0 at each n.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.400
So the Brownian
motion here tends

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.830
to just go to
infinity somewhere,

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:47.110
whereas this guy
forces it to come back.

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:48.700
Now everything I
described to you

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.720
is on the scale negative
infinity to plus infinity,

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.620
but since everything
depends on F of t,

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:58.360
I can actually
just put that back

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:02.300
into a scale, which is 0 and 1
by a simple change of variable.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.814
It's called change of time
for the Brownian motion.

01:02:06.814 --> 01:02:07.314
OK?

01:02:07.314 --> 01:02:08.302
Yeah.

01:02:08.302 --> 01:02:09.784
AUDIENCE: So does
a Brownian bridge

01:02:09.784 --> 01:02:13.242
have a variance at each
point that's proportional?

01:02:13.242 --> 01:02:15.382
Like it starts at
0 variance and then

01:02:15.382 --> 01:02:17.688
goes to 1/4 variance
in the middle

01:02:17.688 --> 01:02:21.146
and then goes back
to 0 variance?

01:02:21.146 --> 01:02:23.924
Like in the same
parabolic shape?

01:02:23.924 --> 01:02:24.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:26.180
I mean, definitely.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.873
I mean by symmetry you can
probably infer all the things.

01:02:29.873 --> 01:02:31.706
AUDIENCE: Well I can
imagine Brownian bridge

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:34.904
with a variance that starts
at 0 and stays, like,

01:02:34.904 --> 01:02:38.809
the shape of the variance
as you move along.

01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:40.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so I
don't know if-- there

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.205
is an explicit formula
for this, and it's simple.

01:02:43.205 --> 01:02:45.830
That's what I can tell you, but
I don't know what the explicit,

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:47.756
off the top of my head what
the explicit formula is.

01:02:47.756 --> 01:02:49.708
AUDIENCE: But would it
have to match this F

01:02:49.708 --> 01:02:53.112
of t 1 minus F of t structure?

01:02:53.112 --> 01:02:53.612
Or not?

01:02:53.612 --> 01:02:54.278
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:56.052 --> 01:02:58.510
AUDIENCE: Or does the fact that
we're taking the supremum--

01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:59.700
PROFESSOR: No.

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.390
Well the Brownian bridge, this
is the supremum-- you're right.

01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:06.700
So this will be this form
for the variance for sure,

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.700
because this is only
marginal distributions that

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.920
don't take-- right,
the process is not just

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.360
what is the distribution
at each instant t.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.990
It's also how do those
distributions interact

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:17.657
with each other in
terms of covariance.

01:03:17.657 --> 01:03:19.740
For the marginal distributions
at each instance t,

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:22.950
you're right, the variance
is F of t 1 minus F of t.

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:25.170
We're not going to escape that.

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:27.390
But then the covariance
structure between those guys

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:29.250
is a little more complicated.

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.330
But yes, you're right.

01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:32.201
For marginal that's enough.

01:03:32.201 --> 01:03:32.701
Yeah?

01:03:32.701 --> 01:03:34.701
AUDIENCE: So the supremum
of the Brownian bridge

01:03:34.701 --> 01:03:38.180
is a number between 0
and 10, let's just say.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.244
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
could be infinity.

01:03:40.244 --> 01:03:43.226
AUDIENCE: So it's not
symmetrical with respect to 0,

01:03:43.226 --> 01:03:45.214
so why are we doing all over 2?

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:57.900
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.640
Did say raise it?

01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.230
Yeah.

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:01.974
Because here I didn't say the
supremum of the absolute value

01:04:01.974 --> 01:04:03.890
of a Brownian bridge, I
just said the supremum

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:04.765
of a Brownian bridge.

01:04:04.765 --> 01:04:08.640
But you're right, let's
just do this like that.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.070
And then it's probably cleaner.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.210
So yeah, actually well
it should be q alpha.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:19.630
So this is basically,
you're right.

01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:22.210
So think of it as
being one-sided.

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:25.960
And there's actually no
symmetry for the supremum.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.074
I mean the supremum is
not symmetric around 0,

01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:29.740
so you're right.

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:33.630
I should not use alpha
over 2, thank you.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:35.690
Any other question?

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:36.950
This should be alpha.

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:37.815
Yeah.

01:04:37.815 --> 01:04:39.940
I mean those slides were
written with 1 minus alpha

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.490
and I have not replaced all
instances of 1 minus alpha

01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:43.980
by alpha.

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.392
I mean, except this guy, tilde.

01:04:45.392 --> 01:04:47.100
Well, depends on how
you want to call it.

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.520
But this is still, the
probability that Z exceeds

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.550
this guy should be alpha.

01:04:53.550 --> 01:04:54.160
OK?

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.910
And this can be found in tables.

01:04:55.910 --> 01:05:00.370
And we can compute the p-value
just like we did before.

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:02.320
But we have to simulate
it because it's not

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.236
going to depend on the
cumulative distribution

01:05:04.236 --> 01:05:06.890
function of a Gaussian, like
it did for the usual Gaussian

01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:07.740
test.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.656
That's something that's
more complicated,

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.030
and typically you
don't even try.

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:14.210
You get the statistical
software to do it for you.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:17.650
So just let me skip a few lines.

01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:20.150
This is what the table looks
like for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:21.430
test.

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:25.690
So it just tells you, what is
your number of observations, n.

01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:28.270
Then you want alpha to
be equal to 5%, say.

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:30.320
Let's say you have
nine observations.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.240
So if square root of n absolute
value of Fn of t minus F of t

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.610
exceeds this thing, you reject.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.620
Well it's pretty
clear from this test

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.390
is that it looks
very nice, and I tell

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:50.680
you this is how you build it.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.577
But if you think about
it for one second,

01:05:52.577 --> 01:05:54.160
it's actually really
an annoying thing

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.760
to build because you have
to take the supremum over t.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.150
This depends on computing a
supremum, which in practice

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:03.070
might be super cumbersome.

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:05.360
I don't want to have to
compute this for all values t

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.784
and then to take the
maximum of those guys.

01:06:07.784 --> 01:06:09.950
It turns out that that's
actually quite nice that we

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:11.720
don't have to actually do this.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.060
What does the empirical
distribution function

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.474
look like?

01:06:15.474 --> 01:06:23.350
Well, this thing, remember
Fn of t by definition was--

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:25.590
so let me go to the
slide that's relevant.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.290
So Fn of t looks like this.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.590
So what it means is that when
t is between two observations,

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:44.390
then this guy is actually
keeping the same value.

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:48.210
So if I put my observations
on the real line here.

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:49.940
So let's say I have
one observation here,

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.782
one observation here,
one observation here,

01:06:51.782 --> 01:06:53.740
one observation here,
and one observation here,

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.270
for simplicity.

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:57.730
Then this guy is basically,
up to this normalization,

01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.820
counting how many observations
they have that are less than t.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:05.020
So since I normalize by n, I
know that the smallest number

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:10.480
here is going to be 0, and
the largest number here

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.300
is going to be 1.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.980
So let's say this
looks like this.

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:18.290
This is the value 1.

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:21.800
At the value, since I take
it less than or equal to,

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.530
when I'm at Xi, I'm
actually counting it.

01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:26.570
So the jump happens at Xi.

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:29.000
So that's the first
observation, and then I jump.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.860
By how much do I jump?

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.510
Yeah?

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.670
One over n, right?

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:41.732
And then this value
belongs to the right.

01:07:41.732 --> 01:07:42.690
And then I do it again.

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:54.534
I know it's not going to work
out for me, but we'll see.

01:07:54.534 --> 01:07:55.950
Oh no actually, I
did pretty well.

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:04.130
This is what my cumulative
distribution looks like.

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:05.630
Now if you look on
this slide, there

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:07.870
is this weird notation
where I start putting now

01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:10.390
my indices in parentheses.

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:13.350
X parenthesis 1, X
parenthesis 2, et cetera.

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.910
Those are called the
ordered statistic.

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:18.729
It's just because it might
be, when my data is given

01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:20.422
to me I just call the
first observation,

01:08:20.422 --> 01:08:21.880
the one that's on
top of the table,

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.640
but it doesn't have to
be the smallest value.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.029
So it might be that this
is X1 and that this is X2,

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:31.510
and then this is X3, X4, and X5.

01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:33.374
These might be my observations.

01:08:33.374 --> 01:08:35.290
So what I do is that I
call them in such a way

01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:38.109
that this is actually,
I recall this guy X1,

01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:40.569
which is just really X3.

01:08:40.569 --> 01:08:46.810
This is X2, X3, X4, and X5.

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:48.790
These are my
reordered observations

01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:52.029
in such a way that the
smallest one is indexed by one

01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:54.013
and the largest one
is indexed by n.

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:01.200
So now this is
actually quite nice,

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.170
because what I'm trying to
do is to find the largest

01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:07.210
deviation from this guy to the
true cumulative distribution

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:07.710
function.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.460
The true cumulative
distribution function,

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.729
let's say it's Gaussian,
looks like this.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:19.120
It's something continuous,
for a symmetric distribution

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.520
it crosses this axis at 1/2,
and that's what it looks like.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.330
And the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test is just

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:31.470
telling me how far do
those two curves get

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:35.069
in the worst possible case?

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:37.380
So in particular here,
where are they the farthest?

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.729
Clearly that's this point.

01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:42.490
And so up to rescaling,
this is the value

01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:44.510
I'm going to be interested in.

01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:49.130
That's how they get as far
as possible from each other.

01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:52.399
Here, something just
happened, right?

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:54.695
The farthest distance
that I got was exactly

01:09:54.695 --> 01:09:55.970
at one of those dots.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.600
It turns out this is enough
to look at those dots.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.660
And the reason is, well
because after this dot

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:08.460
and until the next jump,
this guy does not change,

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:11.230
but this guy increases.

01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:15.220
And so the only point where
they can be the farthest apart

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:19.720
is either to the left of a
jump or to the right of a jump.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.540
That's the only place where
they can be far from each other.

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.896
And that means that
only one observation.

01:10:24.896 --> 01:10:26.620
Everybody sees that?

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:29.470
The farthest points, the points
at which those two curves are

01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:31.300
the farthest from
each other, has

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.000
to be at one of
the observations.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.790
And so rather than looking at
a sup over all possible t's,

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:40.920
really all I need to do
is to look at a maximum

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.036
only at my observations.

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:48.960
I just need to check
at each of those points

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.150
whether they're far.

01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:53.090
Now here, notice
that you did not,

01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:57.530
this is not written Fn of Xi.

01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:01.410
The reason is because I
actually know what Fn of Xi is.

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:05.320
Fn of the i-th order
observation is just

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.680
the number of jumps I've
had until this observation.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.290
So here, I know that the
value of Fn is 1 over n,

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:15.520
here it's 2 over n, 3 over
n, 4 over n, 5 over n.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.300
So I knew that the values
of Fn at my observations,

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:22.300
and those are actually the
only values that Fn can take,

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.060
are an integer divided by n.

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:29.680
And that's why you see i
minus 1 over n, or i over n.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.520
This is the difference
just before the jump,

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.450
and this is the
difference at the jump.

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:42.800
So here the key message
is that this is no longer

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.610
a supremum over all
t's, but it's just

01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:46.110
the maximum from 1 to n.

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:49.160
So I really have only
two n values to compute.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.970
This value and this value for
each observation, that's 2n

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:52.850
total.

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:55.760
I look at the maximum and
that's actually the value.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.907
And it's actually equal to tn.

01:11:58.907 --> 01:11:59.990
It's not an approximation.

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.840
Those things are equal.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.060
That's just the
only places where

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.143
those guys can be maximum.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:10.715
Yes?

01:12:10.715 --> 01:12:15.134
AUDIENCE: It seems like since
the null hypothesis [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:15.134 --> 01:12:17.589
the entire
distribution of theta,

01:12:17.589 --> 01:12:19.716
this is like strictly
more powerful than just

01:12:19.716 --> 01:12:23.000
doing it [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.832
PROFESSOR: It's
strictly less powerful.

01:12:24.832 --> 01:12:27.784
AUDIENCE: Strictly
less powerful.

01:12:27.784 --> 01:12:30.490
But is there, is that
like a big trade-off

01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:32.018
that we're making
when we do that?

01:12:32.018 --> 01:12:33.934
Obviously we're not
certain in the first place

01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:35.309
that we want to
assume normality.

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.624
Does it make sense
to [INAUDIBLE],,

01:12:37.624 --> 01:12:39.592
the Gaussian [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.420
PROFESSOR: So can
you, I'm not sure what

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.400
question you're asking.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.360
AUDIENCE: So when we're
doing a normal test,

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.810
we're just asking
questions about the mus,

01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:57.280
the means of our distribution.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.383
[INAUDIBLE] This
one, it seems like it

01:13:00.383 --> 01:13:02.670
would be both at the same time.

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:11.000
[INAUDIBLE] Is this
decreasing power [INAUDIBLE]??

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.470
PROFESSOR: So remember,
here in this test

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.140
we want to conclude to H0, in
the other test we typically

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.670
want to conclude to H1.

01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:21.150
So here we actually don't
want power, in a way.

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:24.619
And you have to also assume
that doing a test on the mean

01:13:24.619 --> 01:13:26.160
is probably not the
only thing you're

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.576
going to end up
doing on your data

01:13:27.576 --> 01:13:31.472
after you actually establish
that it's normally distributed.

01:13:31.472 --> 01:13:33.180
Then you have the
dataset, you've sort of

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.763
established it's
normally distributed,

01:13:34.763 --> 01:13:38.090
and then you can just run the
arsenal of statistical studies.

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:39.540
And we're going
to see regression

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.570
and all sorts of predictive
things, which are not just

01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:44.280
tests if the mean is
equal to something.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.660
Maybe you want to build
a confidence interval

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.530
for the mean.

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:50.052
Then this is not, confidence
interval is not a test.

01:13:50.052 --> 01:13:52.260
So you're going to have to
first test if it's normal,

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.760
and then see if you
can actually use

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.770
the quantiles of a Gaussian
distribution or a t

01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:59.760
distribution to build
this confidence interval.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.510
So in a way you should do
this as like, the flat fee

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:05.670
to enter the Gaussian
world, and then you

01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:09.072
can do whatever you want to
do in the Gaussian world.

01:14:09.072 --> 01:14:11.030
We'll see actually that
your question goes back

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:14.750
to something that's a
little important, is here

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.540
I said F0 is fully specified.

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:21.490
It's like an N 1, 5.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:24.410
But I didn't say, is it
normally distributed,

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:26.440
which is the question
that everybody asks.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.189
You're not asking, is it this
particular normal distribution

01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:31.480
with this particular mean
and this particular variance.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.860
So how would you
do it in practice?

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:34.276
Well you would
say, I'm just going

01:14:34.276 --> 01:14:36.910
to replace the mean by the
empirical mean and the variance

01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:38.720
by the empirical variance.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:41.710
But by doing that you're making
a huge mistake because you

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:45.160
are sort of depriving your
test of the possibility

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.967
to reject the Gaussian
hypothesis just

01:14:46.967 --> 01:14:49.300
based on the fact that the
mean is wrong or the variance

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:49.930
is wrong.

01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:52.600
You've already stuck to
your data pretty well.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.660
And so you're sort
of like already

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:59.320
tilting the game in
favor of H0 big time.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.300
So there's actually a
way to arrange for this.

01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:05.555
OK, so this is about
pivotal statistic.

01:15:05.555 --> 01:15:06.950
We've used this word many times.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:12.272
And So that's how.

01:15:12.272 --> 01:15:13.730
I'm not going to
go into this test.

01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:16.640
It's really, this is a recipe
on how you would actually

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.920
build the table that I
showed you, this table.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.660
This is basically the
recipe on how to build it.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.790
There's another recipe to
build it, which is just

01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:27.730
open a book at this page.

01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:29.770
That's a little faster.

01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:32.870
Or use software.

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:34.050
I just wanted to show you.

01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:36.891
So let's just keep in mind,
anybody has a good memory?

01:15:36.891 --> 01:15:38.390
Let's just keep in
mind this number.

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:44.060
This is the threshold for the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.250
If I have 10 observations
and I want to do it at 5%,

01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:50.060
it's about 41%.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.380
So that's the number that
it should be larger from.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:56.630
So it turns out that if you want
to test if it's normal, and not

01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:59.000
just the specific
normal, this number

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.145
is going to be different.

01:16:00.145 --> 01:16:01.520
Do you think the
number I'm going

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.561
to read in a table that's
appropriate for this is

01:16:03.561 --> 01:16:05.630
going to be larger or smaller?

01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:07.505
Who says larger?

01:16:07.505 --> 01:16:09.130
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what
was the question?

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.588
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, this

01:16:10.588 --> 01:16:20.270
is the number I should see if
my test was, is X, say, N 0, 5.

01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.770
Right?

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:25.630
That's a specific distribution
with a specific F0.

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:27.810
So that's the
number, I would build

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:29.630
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
statistic from this.

01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:32.460
I would perform a test and
check if my Kolmogorov-Smirnov

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.970
statistic tn is larger
than this number or not.

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:36.450
If it's larger I'm
going to reject.

01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:40.940
Now I say, actually, I don't
want to test if H0 is N 0, 5,

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:47.942
but it's just a mu sigma squared
for some mu and sigma squared.

01:16:47.942 --> 01:16:50.400
And in particular I'm just
going to plugin mu hat and sigma

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.680
hat into my F0, run
the same statistic,

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.280
but compare it to
a different number.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.090
So the larger the
number, the more or less

01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:03.660
likely am I to reject?

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.730
The less likely I
am to reject, right?

01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:09.700
So if I just use that
number, let's say

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.660
this is a large
number, I would be more

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.077
tempted to say it's Gaussian.

01:17:14.077 --> 01:17:15.660
And if you look at
the table you would

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.300
get that if you make the
appropriate correction

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.200
at the same number
of observations, 10,

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:26.359
and the same level, you
get 25% as opposed to 41%.

01:17:26.359 --> 01:17:28.650
That means that you're actually
much more likely if you

01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:32.670
use the appropriate test to
reject the fact that it's

01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:34.680
normal, which is bad
news, because that means

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.780
you don't have access
to the Gaussian arsenal,

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.160
and nobody wants to do this.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.920
So actually this is a
mistake that people do a lot.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.570
They use the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:45.810
to test for normality without
adjusting for the fact

01:17:45.810 --> 01:17:48.210
that they've plugged
in the estimated mean

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:50.100
and the estimated variance.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.520
This leads to rejecting
less often, right?

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.490
I mean this is almost half
of the number that we had.

01:17:58.490 --> 01:18:00.990
And then they can be
happy and walk home

01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:03.120
and say, well, I did the
test and it was normal.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.640
So this is actually
a mistake that I

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.130
believe that genuinely at
least a quarter of the people

01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:09.357
do make in purpose.

01:18:09.357 --> 01:18:11.690
They just say, well I want
it to be Gaussian so I'm just

01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.760
going to make my life easier.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.180
So this is the so-called
Kolmogorov Lilliefors test.

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:20.800
We'll talk about it,
well not today for sure.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.650
There's other statistics that
you can test, that you can use.

01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:26.390
And the idea is to
say, well, we want

01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:28.280
to know if the
empirical distribution

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.900
function, the empirical CDF,
is close to the true CDF.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.880
The way we did it is by
forming the difference

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.240
in looking at the worst
possible distance they can be.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:39.880
That's called a sup
norm, or L infinity norm,

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.140
in functional analysis.

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.020
So here, this is
what it looked like.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.630
The distance between Fn and
F that we measured was just

01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:48.520
the supremum distance
over all t's.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.100
That's one way to measure
distance between two functions.

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.170
But there's an
infinite many ways

01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:54.880
to measure distance
between functions.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.840
One is something we're
much more familiar with,

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.510
which is the squared L2-norm.

01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:02.770
This is nice because this
has like an inner product,

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.370
it has some nice properties.

01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:06.740
And you could actually just,
rather than taking the sup,

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:10.280
you could just integrate
the squared distance.

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:14.485
And this is what leads to
Cramier-Von Mises test.

01:19:14.485 --> 01:19:15.860
And then there's
another one that

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:18.770
says, well, maybe I don't want
to integrate without weights.

01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:22.230
Maybe I want to put weights
that account for the variance.

01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:24.500
And this guy is called
Anderson-Darling.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.810
For each of these
tests you can check

01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:29.660
that the asymptotic distribution
is going to be pivotal,

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.420
which means that there will be
a table at the back of some book

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:37.190
that tells you what the
statistic, the quantiles

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:38.730
of square root of
n times this guy

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:40.333
are asymptotically, basically.

01:19:40.333 --> 01:19:41.299
Yeah?

01:19:41.299 --> 01:19:44.197
AUDIENCE: For the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,

01:19:44.197 --> 01:19:48.061
for the table that
shows the value it has,

01:19:48.061 --> 01:19:51.572
it has the value
for different n.

01:19:51.572 --> 01:19:53.390
But I thought we [INAUDIBLE]--

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:54.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:56.649
So that's just to show you that
asymptotically it's pivotal,

01:19:56.649 --> 01:19:59.160
and I can point you
to one specific thing.

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:02.842
But it turns out that this thing
is actually pivotal for each n.

01:20:02.842 --> 01:20:05.300
And that's why you have this
recipe to construct the entire

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.690
thing, because it's actually
not true for all possible n's.

01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:10.700
Also there's the n
that shows up here.

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:13.040
So no actually,
this is something

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.090
you should have in mind.

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:18.350
So basically, let me
strike what I just said.

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:20.330
This thing you can
actually, this distribution

01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:24.119
will not depend on F0
for any particular n.

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:25.910
It's just not going to
be a Brownian bridge

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:28.130
but a finite sample
approximation of a Brownian

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:31.160
bridge, and you can simulate
that just drawing samples

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.500
from it, building a
histogram, and constructing

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.286
the quantiles for this guy.

01:20:35.286 --> 01:20:36.910
AUDIENCE: No one has
actually developed

01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:38.304
a table for Brownian--

01:20:38.304 --> 01:20:39.470
PROFESSOR: Oh, there is one.

01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:42.570
That's the table, maybe.

01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:46.670
Let's see if we see it at the
bottom of the other table.

01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:47.220
Yeah.

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:47.720
See?

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.997
Over 40, over 30.

01:20:48.997 --> 01:20:50.580
So this is not the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov,

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.710
but that's the
Kolmogorov Lilliefors.

01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:54.900
Those numbers that
you see here, they

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:57.060
are the numbers for the
asymptotic thing which is

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.192
some sort of Brownian bridge.

01:20:59.192 --> 01:21:00.184
Yeah?

01:21:00.184 --> 01:21:01.184
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

01:21:01.184 --> 01:21:03.656
If I want to build the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,

01:21:03.656 --> 01:21:08.120
it says that F0 is
required to be continuous.

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.104
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:21:10.104 --> 01:21:13.576
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] If
we have, like, probability

01:21:13.576 --> 01:21:15.560
mass of a particular value.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:18.060
Like some sort of data.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:20.769
PROFESSOR: So then you won't
have this nice picture, right?

01:21:20.769 --> 01:21:22.560
This can happen at any
point because you're

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.335
going to have
discontinuities in F

01:21:24.335 --> 01:21:26.620
and those things can
happen everywhere.

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.120
And then--

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.034
AUDIENCE: Would the
supremum still work?

01:21:29.034 --> 01:21:30.700
PROFESSOR: You mean
the Brownian bridge?

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:35.340
The Kolmogorov test
doesn't say that you

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:37.382
have to be able to easily
calculate the supremum.

01:21:37.382 --> 01:21:39.256
PROFESSOR: No, no, no,
but you still need it.

01:21:39.256 --> 01:21:40.600
You still need it for--

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.832
so there's some finite
sample versions of it

01:21:42.832 --> 01:21:45.040
that you can use that are
slightly more conservative,

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.740
which is in a way good
news because you're

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.250
going to conclude more to H0.

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:52.930
And there's are some,
I forget the name,

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:57.172
it's Kiefer-Wolfowitz, the
Kiefer-Dvoretzky-Wolfowitz,

01:21:57.172 --> 01:21:59.630
an equality which is basically
like Hoeffding's inequality.

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:01.510
So it's basically
up to bad constants

01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:04.900
telling you the same result
as the Brownian bridge result,

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.850
and those are true all the time.

01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:08.830
But for the exact
asymptotic distribution,

01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:11.467
you need continuity.

01:22:11.467 --> 01:22:12.496
Yes.

01:22:12.496 --> 01:22:13.912
AUDIENCE: So just
a clarification.

01:22:13.912 --> 01:22:15.868
So when we are testing
the Kolmogorov,

01:22:15.868 --> 01:22:19.902
we shouldn't test a particular
mu and sigma squared?

01:22:19.902 --> 01:22:22.110
PROFESSOR: Well if you know
what they are you can use

01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:25.259
Kolmogorov-Smirnov, but if
you don't know what they are

01:22:25.259 --> 01:22:26.300
you're going to plug in--

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.758
as soon as you're
going to estimate

01:22:27.758 --> 01:22:29.534
the mean and the
variance from the data,

01:22:29.534 --> 01:22:31.700
you should use the one we'll
see next time, which is

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.200
called Kolmogorov Lilliefors.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.950
You don't have to think
about it too much.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.000
We'll talk about it on Thursday.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.215
Any other question?

01:22:39.215 --> 01:22:40.090
So we're out of time.

01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:45.700
So I think we should stop here,
and we'll resume on Thursday.
