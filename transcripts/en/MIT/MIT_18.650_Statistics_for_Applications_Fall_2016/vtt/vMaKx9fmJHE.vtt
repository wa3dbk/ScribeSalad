00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.380
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: We're talking
about goodness-of-fit tests.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.470
Goodness-of-fit tests
are, does my data

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.472
come from a particular
distribution?

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:28.930
And why would we
want to know this?

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.100
Well, maybe we're
interested in, for example,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.900
knowing if the zodiac signs
of the Fortune 500 CEOs

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.550
are uniformly distributed.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.310
Or maybe we actually
have slightly more--

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.740
slightly deeper endeavors,
such as understanding

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.240
if you can actually apply the
t-test by testing normality

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.121
of your sample.

00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:49.620
All right?

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.900
So we saw that there's
the main result--

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.460
the main standard test for this.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.800
It's called the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.690
that people use quite a bit.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.840
It's probably one of the
most used tests out there.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.570
And there's other versions of
it that I mentioned passing by.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.010
There's the Cramer-von
Mises, and there's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.630
the Anderson-Darling test.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.120
Now, how would you
pick one of such tests?

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.880
Well, they're always are
going to-- they're always

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.700
going to have their
advantages and disadvantages.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.300
And Kolmogorov-Smirnov is
definitely the most widely used

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.130
because--

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.990
well, I guess because
it's a natural notion

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.240
of distance between functions.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.530
You just look for each
point how far they can be,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.150
and you just look
at the farthest

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.830
they can be everywhere.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.670
Now, Cramer-von Mises
involves L2 distance.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.690
So if you're not used to
Hilbert spaces or notions

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.076
of Euclidean spaces, at least
it's a little more complicated.

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:44.700
And then Anderson-Darling
is definitely

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.666
even more complicated.

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.040
Now, each of these
tests is going

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.720
to be more powerful
against other alternatives.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.560
So unless you can really
guess which alternative

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560
you're expecting to
see, which you probably

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.810
don't, because, again, you're
in a case where you want

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.450
to typically declare H0
to be the correct one,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.950
then it's really a
matter of tossing a coin.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.600
Maybe you can run
all three of them

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.170
and just sleep better at night,
because all three of them

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.245
have failed to
reject, for example.

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:12.130
All right?

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.250
So as I mentioned, one of
the maybe primary goals

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.420
to test goodness of fit
is to be able to check

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.534
whether we can apply
Student's test, right,

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:24.325
and if the Student
distribution is actually

00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:25.750
a valid distribution.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.570
And for that, we need to have
normally distributed data.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.470
Now, as I said several
times, normally distributed,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.360
it's not a specific
distribution.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.950
It's a family of
distributions that's

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.467
indexed by means and variances.

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:41.050
And the way I would want to test
if a distribution is normally

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.790
distributed is,
well, I would just

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.460
look at the most natural
normal distribution

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.010
or Gaussian distribution
that my data could follow.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.260
That means that's the
Gaussian distribution that

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.635
has the same mean as my data
and the same empirical variance

00:02:53.635 --> 00:02:55.350
as my data, right?

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.080
And so I'm going to be
given some points x1, xn,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.205
and I'm going to be
asking, are those Gaussian?

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.310
That means this is
equivalent to, say,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:15.800
are they N mu sigma square
for some mu sigma squared?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.600
And of course,
the natural choice

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.610
is to take mu hat to be--

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.720
mu to be equal to mu
hat, which is xn bar.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.520
And sigma squared to be
sigma squared hat to be,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.990
well, Sn hat--

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.580
Sn-- what we wrote Sn, which
is 1/n sum from i equal 1 to n

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.800
of xi minus xn bar squared.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.720
OK?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.152
So this is definitely
the natural one

00:03:44.152 --> 00:03:45.110
you would want to test.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.210
And maybe you could actually
just close your eyes

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.920
and just stuff that in a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.420
OK?

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.490
So here, there's a few
things that don't work.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.657
The first one is that
Donsker's theorem does not

00:03:57.657 --> 00:03:58.490
work anymore, right?

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.906
Donsker's theorem
was the one that

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.840
told us that,
properly normalized,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.460
this thing would
actually converge

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.800
to the supremum of a Brownian
bridge, which is not true.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.969
So that's one problem.

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.760
But there's actually
an even bigger problem

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.730
is that this distribution,
we will check in a second,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.080
actually does not--

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.011
is pivotal itself, right,
the statistic is pivotal.

00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:20.510
It does not have a
distribution that

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.093
depends on the known
parameters, which

00:04:22.093 --> 00:04:24.810
is sort of nice, at
least under the null.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.950
However, the distribution
is not the same

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.010
as the one that had
fixed mu and sigma.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.250
The fact that they come
from some random variables

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.892
is actually distorting
the distribution itself.

00:04:36.892 --> 00:04:39.350
And in particular, the quantiles
are going to be distorted,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.840
and we hinted at that last time.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.070
So one other thing I
need to tell you, though,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.460
is that this thing actually--
so I know there's some--

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.890
oh, yeah, that's where
there's a word missing.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.680
So we compute the quantiles
for this test statistic.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.570
And so what I need
to promise to you

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.810
is that these
quantiles do not depend

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.710
on any unknown parameter, right?

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.660
I mean, it's not clear, right?

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.300
So I want to test whether
my data has some Gaussian

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.930
distribution.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.270
So under the null, all I
know is that my xi's are

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.300
Gaussian with some mean mu
and some variance sigma,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.386
which I don't know.

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.760
So it could be
the case that when

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.220
I try to understand the
distribution of this quantity

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.320
under the null, it depends on mu
and sigma, which I don't know.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.930
So we need to check
that this is the case.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.810
And what's actually
our redemption

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.754
here is actually going
to be the supremum.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.420
The supremum is going
to basically allow

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.726
us to, say, sup out
mu and sigma square.

00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:44.850
So let's check that, right?

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.330
So what I'm interested in
is this quantity, supremum

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.440
over t and R of the
difference between Fn of t

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.210
and, what I write, phi mu
hat sigma squared of t.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.360
So phi mu hat
sigma hat squared--

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.140
sorry, sigma hat squared--

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.320
is the CDF of some Gaussian with
mean mu hat and variance sigma

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.530
hat squared.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:24.680
And so in particular, this
thing here, phi hat of mu hat--

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.170
sorry, phi hat of mu hat
sigma hat squared of t

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.160
is the probability that
some x is less than t,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.870
where x follows some N
mu hat sigma hat squared.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.650
So what it means is that
by just the translation

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.390
and scaling trig
that we typically do

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.930
for Gaussian to turn it into
some standard Gaussian, that

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.660
implies that there
exists some z, which

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.230
is standard Gaussian this
time, so mean 0 and variance 1,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.380
such that x is equal
to sigma hat x--

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.510
sorry, z plus mu hat.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.060
Agreed?

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.570
That's basically saying that x
has some Gaussian with mean mu

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.875
and variance sigma squared.

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:13.930
And I'm not going to say the
hats every single time, OK?

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.220
So OK, so that's what it means.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.260
So in particular, maybe
I shouldn't use x here,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.790
because x is going
to be my actual data.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.920
So let me write y.

00:07:27.988 --> 00:07:29.446
OK?

00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:32.790
So now what is this guy here?

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.430
It's basically-- so phi hat.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:42.360
So this implies that phi mu
hat sigma hat squared of t

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.680
is equal to the probability
that sigma hat z

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.220
plus mu hat is
less than t, which

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.940
is equal to the probability
that z is less than t

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:00.550
minus mu hat divided
by sigma hat, right?

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.470
But now when z is
the standard normal,

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.540
this is really just the
cumulative distribution

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.450
function of a standard
Gaussian but evaluated

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.660
at a point which is
not t, but t minus mu

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.270
hat divided by sigma hat.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.770
All right?

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.525
So in particular, what I know--
so from this what I get-- well,

00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:17.650
maybe I'll remove that,
it's going to be annoying--

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:23.182
I know that phi mu hat
sigma hat squared--

00:08:23.182 --> 00:08:27.000
sorry-- phi mu hat
sigma hat squared of t

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.230
is simply phi of, say, 0, 1.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.559
And that's just the notation.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.730
Usually we don't put those,
but here it's more convenient.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:43.318
So it's phi 0, 1 of t minus
mu hat divided by sigma hat.

00:08:43.318 --> 00:08:45.660
OK?

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.540
That's just something
you can quickly check.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.960
There's this nice way of writing
the cumulative distribution

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.050
function for any
mean and any variance

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.360
in terms of the cumulative
distribution function

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.161
with mean 0 and variance 1.

00:08:59.161 --> 00:08:59.660
All right?

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.795
Not too complicated.

00:09:00.795 --> 00:09:01.295
All right.

00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:04.791
So I know what I'm going to say
is that, OK, I have this sup

00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:05.290
here.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.620
So what I can write is
that this thing here

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.690
is equal to the sup
routine R of 1/n.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.400
Let me write what Fn is--

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.360
sum from i equal 1
to n of the indicator

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:23.910
that xi is less than
t minus phi 0, 1

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.050
of t minus mu hat
divided by sigma hat.

00:09:30.459 --> 00:09:32.410
OK?

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.770
I actually want to make
a change of variable

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.700
so that this thing
I'm going to call mu--

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.990
u, sorry.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.680
OK?

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.660
And so I'm going to
make my life easier,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.830
and I'm going to
make it appear here.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.700
And so I'm just going to
replace this by indicator

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.480
that xi minus mu hat divided
by sigma hat less than t

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.110
minus mu hat divided
by sigma hat, which is

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.880
sort of useless at this point.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.100
I'm just making my
formula more complicated.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.080
But now I see something
here that shows up,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.952
and I will call it u,
and this is another u.

00:10:06.952 --> 00:10:08.450
OK?

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.230
So now what it means is that
suping over t, when t ranges

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.290
from negative infinity
to plus infinity,

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.980
the new range is from negative
infinity to plus infinity,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.130
right?

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.050
So this sup, I can
actually write--

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:34.256
this suping t I can
write as the sup in u,

00:10:34.256 --> 00:10:38.305
as the indicator that xi minus
mu hat divided by sigma hat

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:47.380
is less than u
minus phi 0, 1 of u.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.600
Now, let's pause for one second.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.130
Let's see where we're going.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.230
What we're trying to show
that this thing does not

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.520
depend on the unknown
parameters, say, mu and sigma,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.800
which are the mean and the
variance of x under the null.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.050
To do that, we
basically need to make

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:09.340
only quantities that are sort
of invariant under these values.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.789
So I tried to make this thing
invariant under anything,

00:11:11.789 --> 00:11:14.080
and it's just really something
that depends on nothing.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.570
It's the CDF.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.600
It doesn't depend on sigma
hat and mu hat anymore.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.399
But sigma hat and mu hat will
depend on mu and sigma, right?

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:24.690
I mean, they're actually good
estimators of those guys,

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.650
so they should be
pretty close to them.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.650
And so I need to make
sure that I'm not actually

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.970
doing anything wrong here.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.400
So the key thing here is going
to be to observe that 1/n sum

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.380
from i equal 1 to n of indicator
of xi minus u hat divided

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.650
by sigma hat less than u, which
is the first term that I have

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:48.720
in this absolute value,
well, this is what-- well,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.040
this is equal to 1/n sum from
i equal 1 to n of indicator

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.440
that--

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.810
well, now under
the null, which is

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:06.309
that x follows N mu sigma
squared, for some mu and sigma

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.350
squared that are unknown.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.190
But they are here.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.940
They exist.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.800
I just don't know what they are.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.820
Then xi minus mu can be
written as sigma zi plus mu

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:23.340
minus mu hat divided
by sigma hat, where

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:29.150
z is equal to x minus mu
divided by sigma, right?

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.750
That's just the same
trick that I wrote here.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.494
OK?

00:12:33.494 --> 00:12:34.160
Everybody agree?

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.820
So I just standardize--

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:42.080
sorry, z-- yeah, so zi is xi
minus mu i minus mu divided

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.721
by sigma.

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:43.220
All right?

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.020
Just a standardization.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.780
So now once I write
this, I can actually

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.250
divide everybody by sigma.

00:12:55.246 --> 00:12:55.746
Right?

00:12:55.746 --> 00:12:59.984
So I just divided on top
here and in the bottom here.

00:12:59.984 --> 00:13:02.150
So now what I need to check
is that the distribution

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:08.790
of this guy does not
depend on mu or sigma.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.200
That's what I claim.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.330
What is the distribution
of this indicator?

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.070
It's a Bernoulli, right?

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.260
And so if I want to
understand its distribution,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.680
all I need to do is to
compute its expectation,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.199
which is just the probability
that this thing happens.

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:27.990
But the probability
that this thing happens

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.880
is actually now depending
on mu and sigma.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.310
And the reason is
that mu is what?

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:44.510
Well, it's x bar-- sorry, yeah,
so mu hat-- sorry, is xn bar.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:50.730
So mu hat minus mu,
which under the null

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.810
follows N mu sigma
square over n, right?

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.370
That's the property
of the average.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.990
So when I do mu hat minus
mu divided by sigma,

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.820
this thing is what distribution?

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.720
It's still a normal.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.428
It's a linear
transformation of a normal.

00:14:07.428 --> 00:14:11.006
What are the parameters?

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:11.877
AUDIENCE: 0, 1/n.

00:14:11.877 --> 00:14:13.210
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah, 0, 1/n.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:26.910
But this does not depend
on mu or sigma, right?

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.440
Now, I need to check
that this guy does not

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.920
depend on mu or sigma.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.680
What is the distribution
of sigma hat over sigma?

00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:41.847
AUDIENCE: It's a
chi-square, right?

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:43.680
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah,
it is a chi-square.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.490
So this is actually--

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.700
sorry, sigma hat squared
divided by sigma squared

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:54.309
is a chi-square with n
minus 1 degrees of freedom.

00:14:54.309 --> 00:14:55.600
Does not depend on mu or sigma.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.828
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:03.828 --> 00:15:05.992
AUDIENCE: Or sigma hat
squared over sigma squared?

00:15:05.992 --> 00:15:07.450
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Yeah, thank you.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.810
So this is actually
divided by it.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:11.629
So maybe this guy.

00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:12.670
Let's write it like that.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.211
This is the proper
way of writing it.

00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:14.966
Thank you.

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:21.649
Right?

00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:22.940
So now I have those two things.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.680
Neither of them
depends on mu or sigma.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.079
I these two things.

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:29.620
There's just one
more thing to check.

00:15:32.191 --> 00:15:32.690
What is it?

00:15:35.342 --> 00:15:36.800
AUDIENCE: That
they're independent?

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.790
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: That
they're independent, right?

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.373
Because the dependence
in mu and sigma

00:15:39.373 --> 00:15:41.090
could be hidden
in the covariance.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.540
It could be the case that the
marginal distribution of mu

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.150
does not depend on mu or sigma,
that the marginal distribution

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.100
of sigma--

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.850
of mu hat does not
depend on mu and sigma.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.730
The marginal
distribution of sigma hat

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.290
does not depend on mu or
sigma, but their correlation

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.000
could depend on mu and sigma.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.100
But we also have
that if I look at--

00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.900
so if I look at--

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:10.330
so since mu hat is
independent of sigma hat,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:33.770
it means that the joint
distribution of mu hat divided

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.180
by sigma and sigma
hat divided by sigma

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:46.790
does not depend on blah,
blah, blah, on mu and sigma.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.290
OK?

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.580
Agree?

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.940
It's not in the individual
ones, and it's not

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.940
in the way they interact
with each other.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.743
It's nowhere.

00:16:59.743 --> 00:17:01.951
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
independence be [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:01.951 --> 00:17:02.450
theorem?

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:03.750
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah,
covariance theorem, right.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.359
So that's something we've
been using over and again.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.960
That's all under the null.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.790
If my data is not Gaussian,
nothing actually holds.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.440
I just use the fact
that under the null

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.624
I'm Gaussian for some mean mu
and variance sigma squared.

00:17:17.624 --> 00:17:18.790
But that's all I care about.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.430
When I'm designing
a test, I only

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.910
care about the distribution
under the null, at least

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.420
to control the type I error.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.270
Then to control
the type II error,

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.610
then I cross my
fingers pretty hard.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.110
OK?

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:41.420
So now this basically implies
what's written on the board,

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.270
that this distribution,
this test statistic,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.270
does not depend on any
unknown parameters.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.160
It's just something
that's pivotal.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160
In particular, I could
go at the back of a book

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.220
and check if there's a table for
the quantiles of these things,

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.260
and indeed there are.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.884
This is the table that you see.

00:18:00.884 --> 00:18:02.550
So actually, this is
not even in a book.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:09.970
This is in Lilliefors
original paper, 1967,

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.050
as you can tell from
the typewriting.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.190
And he actually probably
was rolling some dice

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.920
from his office back in
the day and was checking

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.380
that this was-- he
simulated it, and this is

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.120
how he computed those numbers.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.440
And here you also have
some limiting distribution,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.180
which is not the sup of
a Brownian motion over 0,

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.034
1 of-- sorry, of a
Brownian bridge over 0,

00:18:35.034 --> 00:18:36.450
1, which is the
one that you would

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.900
see for the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.050
but it's something that's
slightly different.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:45.727
And as I said, these numbers are
actually typically much smaller

00:18:45.727 --> 00:18:47.310
than the numbers you
would get, right?

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.280
Remember, we got something
that was about 0.5, I think,

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.350
or maybe 0.41, for the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.070
at the same
entrance, which means

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.452
that using
Kolmogorov-Lilliefors test

00:18:58.452 --> 00:18:59.910
it's going to be
harder for you not

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.460
to reject for the same data.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.860
It might be the case that
in one case you reject,

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.660
and in the other one
you fail to reject.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.710
But the ordering is
always that if you

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.410
fail to reject with
Kolmogorov-Lilliefors,

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.370
you will fail to reject with
Kolmogorov-Smirnov, right?

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.720
There's always one.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.850
So that's why people
tend to close their eyes

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.160
and prefer Kolmogorov-Smirnov
because it just

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.365
makes their life easier.

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:27.690
OK?

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.930
So this is called
Kolmogorov-Lilliefors.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.250
I think there's
actually an E here--

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:41.440
sorry, an I before the E.
Doesn't matter too much.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.000
OK?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Are there any questions?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.932
Yes?

00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:45.390
AUDIENCE: Is there
like a place you

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:59.135
can point to like [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:59.135 --> 00:20:00.135
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.

00:20:00.135 --> 00:20:01.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.581
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So the
fact that it's actually

00:20:03.581 --> 00:20:07.120
a different distribution
is that here--

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.970
so if I actually knew
what mu and sigma were,

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.800
I would do exactly
the same thing.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.350
But here, rather than having
this average with mu and sigma,

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.516
I would just have the--

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:19.140
with mu hat and sigma
hat, I would just

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.760
have the average
with mu and sigma.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.630
OK?

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.700
So what it means is
that the key thing

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:29.790
is that what I would compare is
the 1/n sum of some Bernoullis

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.600
with parameter.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.920
And the parameter here would
be the probability that mu--

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.830
xi minus mu over
sigma is less than u,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.500
which is just the
probability that phi--

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.340
sorry, it's a Bernoulli
with probability F of t.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:49.590
Well, let me write
what it is, right?

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:57.440
So that's minus phi 0, 1 of t.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:57.940
OK?

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:04.160
So that's for the K-S test,
and then I sup over t, right?

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.590
That's what I would have
had, because this is actually

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.100
exactly the right thing.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.130
Here I would remove
the true mean.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.150
I would divide by the
true standard deviation.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.320
So that would actually end
up being a standard Gaussian,

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.520
and that's why I'm allowed
to use phi 0, 1 here.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.690
Agreed?

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.220
And these are Bernoullis
because they're just indicators.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.860
What happens in the
Kolmogorov-Lilliefors test?

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.810
Well, here the
Bernoulli, the only thing

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.150
that's going to change
is this guy, right?

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.390
They still have a Bernoulli.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.000
It's just that the parameters
of the Bernoulli are weird.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.066
The parameters of the
Bernoulli looks like it's--

00:21:37.066 --> 00:21:47.735
it becomes the probability that
some N(0, 1) plus some N(0,

00:21:47.735 --> 00:22:02.140
1/n), right, divided by some
square root of chi-squared n

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.550
minus 1 divided by
n is less than t.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.380
And those things
are independent,

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.480
but those guys are not
necessarily independent, right?

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.720
And so why is this
probability changing?

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.480
Well, because this denominator
is actually fluctuating a lot.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.570
So that actually makes
this probability different.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.940
And so that's basically
where it comes from, right?

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.940
So you could probably
convince yourself

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:32.520
very quickly that this only
makes those guys closer.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:38.280
And why does it make
those guys closer?

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.200
No, sorry.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.230
It makes those guys
farther, right?

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.000
And it makes those guys farther
for a very clear reason,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.080
is that the expectation of this
Bernoulli is exactly that guy.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.794
Here I think it's
going to be true

00:22:52.794 --> 00:22:54.710
as well that the expectation
of this Bernoulli

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.690
is going to be that guy,
but the fluctuations

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.700
are going to be much bigger than
just the phi of the Bernoulli.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.780
Because the first
thing I do is I

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.550
have a random parameter
from my Bernoulli,

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.830
and then I flip the Bernoulli.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.670
So fluctuations are going to
be bigger than a Bernoulli.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.211
And so when I take
the sup, I'm going

00:23:06.211 --> 00:23:07.960
to have to [INAUDIBLE] them.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.686
So it makes things
farther apart,

00:23:09.686 --> 00:23:11.560
which makes it more
likely for you to reject.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.060
Yeah?

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.778
AUDIENCE: You also said that if
you compare the same-- if you

00:23:16.778 --> 00:23:19.512
compare the table and you
set at the same level,

00:23:19.512 --> 00:23:24.476
the Lilliefors is like 0.2,
and for the Smirnov is at 0.4.

00:23:24.476 --> 00:23:25.476
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.

00:23:25.476 --> 00:23:26.017
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:26.017 --> 00:23:30.022
So it means that Lilliefors
is harder not to reject?

00:23:30.022 --> 00:23:32.230
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: It means
that Lilliefors is harder

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.020
not to reject, yes,
because we reject when

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.490
we're larger than the number.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.900
So the number being smaller
with the same data, we might be,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.400
right?

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.750
So basically, it
looks like this.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:55.750
What we run-- so here we have
the distribution for the--

00:23:55.750 --> 00:24:05.510
so let's say this is
the density for K-S.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:11.270
And then we have the density for
Kolmogorov-Lilliefors, K-L. OK?

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.040
And what the density
of K-L looks like,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:22.270
it looks like this, right?

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:27.860
And so if I want to
squeeze in alpha here,

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.260
I'm going to have to squeeze
in-- and I squeeze in alpha

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.740
here, then this is the
quantile of order 1 minus alp--

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.270
well, let's say
alpha of the K-L.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.750
And this is the
quantile alpha of K-S.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.270
So now you give me data,
and what I do with it,

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.310
I check whether they're
larger than this number.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.800
So if I apply K-S, I check
whether I'm larger or smaller

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.599
than this thing.

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:51.140
But if I apply
Kolmogorov-Lilliefors,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.390
I check whether I'm larger
or smaller than this thing.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.270
So over this entire range of
values for my test statistic--

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.354
because it is the
same test statistic,

00:24:58.354 --> 00:25:00.020
I just plugged in mu
hat and sigma hat--

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.229
for this entire range, the two
tests have different outcomes.

00:25:04.229 --> 00:25:06.020
And this is a big range
in practice, right?

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.210
I mean, it's between--

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.670
I mean, it's pretty
much at scale here.

00:25:13.614 --> 00:25:14.114
OK?

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:18.994
Any other-- yeah?

00:25:18.994 --> 00:25:21.494
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] when n
goes to infinity, the two tests

00:25:21.494 --> 00:25:24.446
become the same now, right?

00:25:24.446 --> 00:25:25.922
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Hmmm.

00:25:25.922 --> 00:25:27.381
AUDIENCE: Looking
at that formula--

00:25:27.381 --> 00:25:29.546
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah,
They should become the same

00:25:29.546 --> 00:25:30.130
very far.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.740
Let me see, though, because--

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.240
right.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.100
So here we have 8--

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:44.030
so here we have, say,
for 0.5, we get 0.886.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.940
And for-- oh, I don't have it.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.715
Yeah, actually, sorry.

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:51.760
So you're right.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.900
You're totally right.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.650
This is the Brownian
bridge values.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.950
Because in the limit
by, say, Slutsky--

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.070
sorry, I'm lost.

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.694
Yeah, these are
the values that you

00:26:03.694 --> 00:26:04.860
get for the Brownian bridge.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.620
Because in the limit
by Slutsky, this thing

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.720
is going to have no
fluctuation, and this thing

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.054
is going to have no fluctuation.

00:26:11.054 --> 00:26:12.719
So they're just going
to be pinned down,

00:26:12.719 --> 00:26:15.390
and it's going to look like as
if I did not replace anything.

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.980
Because in the limit, I know
those guys much faster--

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.840
the mu hat and
sigma hat converge

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.500
much faster to mu and sigma than
the distribution itself, right?

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.375
So those are actually
going to be negligible.

00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:29.800
You're right.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.330
Actually even, I didn't have--

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.800
these are actually the
numbers I showed you

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.030
for the bridge, the
Brownian bridge,

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.620
last time, because I didn't have
it for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.166
one.

00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:38.666
OK?

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.990
So there's actually-- so those
are numerical ways of checking

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.740
things, right?

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.350
I give you data.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:50.750
You just crank the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.580
Usually you press a 5 on MATLAB.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.940
But let's say you actually
compute this entire thing,

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.740
and there's a number
that comes out,

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.366
and you decide whether it's
large enough or small enough.

00:27:00.366 --> 00:27:02.990
Of course, statistical software
is going to make your life even

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.450
simpler by spitting out a
p-value, because you can--

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.533
I mean, if you can compute
quantiles, you can also

00:27:07.533 --> 00:27:09.060
when compute p-values.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.530
And so your life is
just fairly easy.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:18.630
You just have red is bad, green
is good, and then you can go.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.390
The problem is that those are
numbers you want to rely on.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.085
But let's say you
actually reject.

00:27:23.085 --> 00:27:23.960
Let's say you reject.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.240
Your p-value is actually
just like slightly below 5%.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.910
So you can say, well, maybe
I'm just going to change

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:34.880
my p-value--

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.950
my threshold to
1%, but you might

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.360
want to see what's happening.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.280
And for that you need
a visual diagnostic.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.710
Like, how do I check
if something departs

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:44.580
from being normal, for example?

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.770
How do I check if
a distribution--

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.530
why is a distribution not
a uniform distribution?

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.900
Why is a distribution not
an exponential distribution?

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.060
There's many, many, right?

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.660
If I have an
exponential distribution

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.060
and half of my
values are negative,

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.900
for example, well, there's
like pretty obvious reasons

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.880
why it should not
be exponential.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.780
But it could be
the case that it's

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.540
just the tails
are little heavier

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.700
or there's more
concentration at some point.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.020
Maybe it has two modes.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.610
There's things like this.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.910
But the real thing,
we don't believe

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.400
that the Gaussian is
so important because it

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.280
looks like this close to 0.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.310
What we like about the
Gaussian is that the tails here

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.740
decay at this rate--
exponential minus x

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.445
squared over 2 that we described
in the maybe first lecture.

00:28:28.445 --> 00:28:31.580
And in particular, if there
were like kinks around here,

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.260
it wouldn't matter too much.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.670
This is not what makes
issues for the Gaussian.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:41.860
And so what we want is to have a
visual diagnostic that tells us

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.890
if the tails of my
distribution are

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.350
comparable to the tails of
a Gaussian one, for example.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.700
And those are what's called
quantile-quantile plots,

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.250
and in particular-- or QQ plots.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.090
And the basic QQ plots
we're going to be using

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.640
are the ones that are
called normal QQ plots that

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.310
are comparing your data to
a Gaussian distribution,

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.230
or a normal distribution.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.600
But in general, you could
be comparing your data

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.426
to any distribution you want.

00:29:09.426 --> 00:29:11.050
And the way you do
this is by comparing

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.860
the quantiles of your data,
the empirical quantiles,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.840
to the quantiles of
the actual distribution

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.020
you're trying to
compare yourself to.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.470
So this, in a way,
is a visual way

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.200
of performing these
goodness-of-fit tests.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.040
And what's nice about visual is
that there's room for debate.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.311
You can see something that
somebody else cannot see,

00:29:31.311 --> 00:29:33.810
and you can always-- because
you want to say that things are

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:34.300
Gaussian.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.674
And we'll see some examples
where you can actually say it

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:41.790
if you are good at
debate, but it's actually

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.230
going to be clearly not true.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.730
All right.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.722
So this is a quick
and easy check.

00:29:46.722 --> 00:29:48.180
That's something
I do all the time.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.710
You give me data, I'm
just going to run this.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.085
One of the first
things I do so I

00:29:51.085 --> 00:29:54.000
can check if I can start
entering the Gaussian

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.930
world without compromising
myself too much.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:04.350
And the idea is to say, well,
if F is close to-- if F--

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.590
if my data comes
from an F, and if I

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.080
know that Fn is close
to F, then rather

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.660
than computing some norm,
some number that tells me

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.635
how far they are,
summarizing how far they are,

00:30:14.635 --> 00:30:16.260
I could actually plot
the two functions

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.970
and see if they're far apart.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.870
So let's think for one second
what this kind of a plot

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:23.380
would look like.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.090
Well, I would go
between 0 and 1.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.631
That's where everything
would happen.

00:30:26.631 --> 00:30:29.680
Let's say my distribution is
the Gaussian distribution.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:35.370
So this is the CDF of N(0, 1).

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.950
And now I have this guy
that shows up, and remember

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:39.540
we had this piecewise constant.

00:30:44.172 --> 00:30:46.130
Well, OK, let's say we
get something like this.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:51.770
We get a piecewise constant
distribution for Fn, right?

00:30:54.590 --> 00:31:00.200
Just from this, and even despite
my bad skills at drawing,

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.880
it's clear that it's
going to be hard

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.920
for you to distinguish
those two things,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.960
even for a fairly
large amount of points.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.750
Because the problem is
going to happen here,

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.000
and those guys look pretty
much the same everywhere

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.894
you are here.

00:31:11.894 --> 00:31:14.060
You're going to see differences
maybe in the middle,

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.010
but we don't care too much
about those differences.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.191
And so what's going to
happen is that you're

00:31:19.191 --> 00:31:20.940
going to want to compare
those two things.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.660
And this is basically you
have the information you want,

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.870
but visually it just doesn't
render very well because you're

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.970
not scaling things properly.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:32.060
And the way we actually do it
is by flipping things around.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.230
And rather than comparing the
plot of F to the plot of Fn,

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.300
we compare the
plot of Fn inverse

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.444
to the plot of F inverse.

00:31:41.444 --> 00:31:47.050
Now, if F goes from the real
line to the interval 0, 1,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:52.409
F inverse goes from 0, 1
to the whole real line.

00:31:52.409 --> 00:31:53.950
So what's going to
happen is that I'm

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:57.120
going to compare things on
some intervals, which is the--

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.210
which are the entire real line.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.470
And then what values should I
be looking at those things at?

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.920
Well, technically for
F, if F is continuous I

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.730
could look at F inverse for
any value that I please, right?

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:14.630
So I have F. And if I
want to look at F inverse,

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:17.240
I pick a point here and I look
at the value that it gives me,

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:23.054
and that's F inverse of,
say, u, right, if this is u.

00:32:23.054 --> 00:32:24.470
And I could pick
any value I want,

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.920
I'm going to be able to find it.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.586
The problem is that
when I start to have

00:32:27.586 --> 00:32:30.860
this piecewise
constant thing, I need

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.320
to decide what value I
assign for anything that's

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.920
in between two jumps, right?

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.340
And so I can choose
whatever I want,

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.470
but in practice it's
just going to be things

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.100
that I myself decide.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.580
Maybe I can decide
that this is the value.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.990
Maybe I can decide
that the value is here.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.590
But for all these guys, I'm
going to pretty much decide

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.510
always the same value, right?

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:52.530
If I'm in between--

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:56.710
for this value u, for this
jump the jump is here.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.370
So for this value,
I'm going to be

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.310
able to decide whether I
want to go above or below,

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:05.160
but it's always this value
that's going to come out.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.380
So rather than picking
values that are in between,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.940
I might as well just
pick only values

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.570
for which this is the value
that it's going to get.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.450
And those values are
exactly 1/n, 2/n, 3/n, 4/n.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.160
It's all the way to n/n, right?

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.920
That's exactly where
the flat parts are.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.310
We know we jump
from 1/n every time.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.250
And so that's
exactly the recipe.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.960
It says look at those
values, 1/n, 2/n, 3/n

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.500
until, say, n minus 1 over n.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.450
And for those values,
compute the inverse

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:40.130
of both the empiricial
CDF and the true CDF.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:43.025
Now, for the empirical
CDF, it's actually easy.

00:33:43.025 --> 00:33:45.590
I just told you this is
basically where the points--

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.540
where the jumps occur.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.010
And the jumps occur where?

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:53.010
Well, exactly at
my observations.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:56.420
Now, remember I need to sort
those observations to talk

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.230
about them.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.200
So the one that occurs
for the i-th jump

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:07.030
is the i-th largest observation,
which we denoted by X sub (i).

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.530
Remember?

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.785
We had this formula that we
said, well, we have x1, xn.

00:34:11.785 --> 00:34:13.081
These are my data.

00:34:13.081 --> 00:34:14.580
And what I'm going
to sort them into

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.824
is x sub (1), which is
less than or equal to x

00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:23.801
sub (2), which is
less than x sub (n).

00:34:23.801 --> 00:34:24.300
OK?

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.560
So we just ordered them
from smallest to largest.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.290
And then now we've
done that, we just

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.010
put this parenthesis notation.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:34.850
So in particular,
Fn inverse of i/n

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:38.010
is the location where
the i-th jumps occur,

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.600
which is the i-th
largest observation.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.380
OK?

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.270
So for this guy, these
values, the y-axes

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.460
are actually fairly easy.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.389
I know it's basically
my ordered observations.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:58.100
The x-values are-- well,
that depends on the function

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.090
F I'm trying to test.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.490
If it's the Gaussian,
it's just the quantile

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.400
of order 1 minus 1/n, right?

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.570
It's this Q1 minus 1/n here
that I need to compute.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:11.180
It's the inverse of the
cumulative distribution

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.950
function, which, given
the formula for F,

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.632
you can actually compute or
maybe estimate fairly well.

00:35:16.632 --> 00:35:18.590
But it's something that
you can find in tables.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.770
Those are basically quantiles.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.940
Inverse of CDFs are
quantiles, right?

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.510
And so that's basically the
things we're interested in.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.420
That's why it's called
quantile-quantile.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.560
Those are sometimes referred
to as theoretical quantiles,

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.200
the one we're trying to test,
and empirical quantiles,

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.870
the one that corresponds
to the empirical CDF.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:44.190
And so I'm plotting a plot
where the x-axis is quantile.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.930
The y-axis is quantile.

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:49.010
And so I call this plot a
quantile-quantile plot, or QQ

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:54.330
plot, because, well, just say
10 times quantile-quantile,

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.584
and then you'll see why.

00:35:55.584 --> 00:35:56.572
Yeah?

00:35:56.572 --> 00:35:59.977
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] have
to have the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:35:59.977 --> 00:36:01.560
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Well, that's just--

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.270
we're back to the--

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.030
we're back to the
goodness-of-fit test, right?

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.060
So if you look--

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.060
so you don't do it yourself.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.150
That's the simple answer.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:14.310
You don't-- I'm just telling you
how those plots are going to be

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.760
seen spit out from a software
are going to look like.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.530
Now, depending on
the software, there's

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.240
a different thing
that's happening.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.050
Some softwares are actually
plotting F with the right--

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.480
let's say you want to
do normal, as you asked.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.420
So some software are
just going to use F

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.690
to be with mu hat and
sigma hat, and that's fine.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.150
Some software are actually
not going to do this.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.270
They're just going
to use a Gaussian.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.700
But then they're
going to actually have

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.710
a different reference point.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.960
So what do we want to see here?

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.960
What should happen
if all these points--

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.510
if all my points
actually come from F,

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.700
from a distribution
that has CDF F?

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.560
What should happen?

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.310
What should I see?

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.510
Well, since Fn
should be close to F,

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.710
Fn inverse should be
close to F inverse, which

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.202
means that this point should
be close to that point.

00:37:07.202 --> 00:37:08.910
This point should be
close to that point.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:13.080
So ideally, if I actually
pick the right F,

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:19.000
I should see a plot that looks
like this, something where

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.520
all my points are very
close to the line y

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.904
is equal to x, right?

00:37:26.904 --> 00:37:28.570
And I'm going to have
some fluctuations,

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.710
but something very
close to this.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.260
Now, that's if F is
exactly the right one.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.880
If F is not exactly the
right one, in particular,

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.920
in the case of a Gaussian
one, if I actually

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.410
plotted here the quantiles--

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:52.550
so if I plotted F
0, 1 of t, right?

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.680
So let's say those are
the ones I actually plot,

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.350
but I really don't know
what-- mu hat is not 0

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:59.000
and sigma hat is not 0.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.310
And so this is not the
one I should be getting.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:06.410
Since we actually know that
phi of mu hat sigma hat

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:12.890
squared t is equal to phi 0,
1 of t minus mu hat divided

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:16.610
by sigma hat, there's
just this change

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:19.460
of axis, which is
actually very simple.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.370
This change of axis is just
a simple translation scaling,

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:26.602
which means that
this line here is

00:38:26.602 --> 00:38:28.310
going to be transformed
into another line

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:31.530
with a different slope
and a different intercept.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.400
And so some software
will actually decide

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.900
to go with this curve
and just show you

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.370
what the reference
curve should be,

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.203
rather than actually
putting everything back

00:38:41.203 --> 00:38:43.370
onto the 45-degree curve.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.120
AUDIENCE: So if you
get any straight line?

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.290
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Any
straight line, you're happy.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.600
I mean, depending
on the software.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.180
Because if the software actually
really rescaled this thing

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.880
to have mu hat and sigma square
and you find a different line,

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.510
a different straight
line, this is

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.720
bad news, which is not
going to happen actually.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.040
It's impossible that happens,
because you actually-- well,

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.170
it could.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:07.895
If it's crazy, it could.

00:39:07.895 --> 00:39:09.510
It shouldn't be very crazy.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.010
OK.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.600
So let's see what R does
for us, for example.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:20.380
So here in R, R actually
does this funny trick where--

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.240
so here I did not
actually plot the lines.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.573
I should actually add the lines.

00:39:23.573 --> 00:39:27.839
So the command is like
qqnorm of my sample, right?

00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:28.880
And that's really simple.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.580
I just stack all my data
into some vector, say, x.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:40.150
And I say qqnorm of x, and
it just spits this thing out.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.720
OK?

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.000
Very simple.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.262
But I could actually
add another command,

00:39:44.262 --> 00:39:45.220
which I can't remember.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:50.670
I think it's like qqline,
and it's just going

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.980
to add the line on top of it.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.210
But if you see, actually
what R does for us,

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.830
it's actually doing the
translation and scaling

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.710
on the axes themselves.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:05.587
So it actually changes
the x and y-axis in such a

00:40:05.587 --> 00:40:07.170
way that when you
look at your picture

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.570
and you forget about what
the meaning of the axes are,

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.520
the relevant straight
line is actually

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.185
still the 45-degree line.

00:40:13.185 --> 00:40:17.605
It's Because it's actually done
the change of units for you.

00:40:17.605 --> 00:40:19.230
So you don't have to
even see the line.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.630
You know that, in your mind,
that this is basically--

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:25.520
the reference line is still
45 degree because that's

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.050
the way the axes are made.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.940
But if I actually put my axes,
right-- so here, for example,

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.490
it goes from--

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:32.820
let's look at some--

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:36.310
well, OK, those are all square.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.810
Yeah, and that's probably
because they actually have--

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:41.380
the samples are actually
from a standard normal.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.245
So I did not make
my life very easy

00:40:43.245 --> 00:40:45.120
to illustrate your
question, but of course, I

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.661
didn't know you were
going to ask it.

00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:49.280
Next time, let's just prepare.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.760
Let's script more.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.620
We'll see another
one in the next plot.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.540
But so here what
you expect to see

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.410
is that all the plots should be
on the 45-degree line, right?

00:40:58.410 --> 00:40:59.830
This should be the right one.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.850
And if you see, when I
start having 10,000 samples,

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.480
this is exactly
what's happening.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.930
So this is as good as it gets.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.240
This is an N(0, 1) plotted
against the theoretical

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.300
quantile of an N(0, 1).

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.090
As good as it gets.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.110
And if you see, for the
second one, which is 50,

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.610
sample size of size--

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:19.730
sample of size 50, there is
some fudge factor, right?

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:20.690
I mean, those things--

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.310
doesn't look like there's
a straight line, right?

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:24.851
It sort of appears that there
are some weird things happening

00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:27.810
here at the lower tail.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:29.310
And the reason why
this is happening

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.400
is because we're trying to
compare the tails, right?

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.980
When I look at this picture,
the only thing that goes wrong

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.050
somehow is always at
the tip, because those

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.090
are sort of rare
and extreme values,

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.100
and they're sort of
all over the place.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.610
And so things are never really
super smooth and super clean.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.920
So this is what
your best shot is.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.140
This is what you will
ever hope to get.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.486
So size 10, right, so
you have 10 points.

00:41:52.486 --> 00:41:54.360
Remember, we actually--
well, I didn't really

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.220
tell you how to deal
with the extreme cases.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.720
Because the problem is that
F inverse of 1 for the true F

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.050
is plus infinity.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.350
So you have to make some sort
of weird boundary choices

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.830
to decide what F inverse
of 1 is, and it's something

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.694
that's like somewhere.

00:42:09.694 --> 00:42:11.610
But you still want to
put like 10 dots, right?

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:15.450
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10 dots.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:17.610
So I have 10 observations,
you will see 10 dots.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:21.230
I have 50 observations, you
will see 50 dots, right,

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.230
because I have--

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:26.720
there are 1/n, 2/n,
3/n all the way to n/n.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.010
I didn't tell you the last one.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:29.510
OK.

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:31.490
So this is when things
go well, and this is

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.881
when things should not go well.

00:42:32.881 --> 00:42:33.380
OK?

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.030
So here, actually,
the distribution

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.670
is a Student's t with
15 degrees of freedom,

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:41.180
which should depart somewhat
from a Gaussian distribution.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:44.070
The tails should be heavier.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.700
And what you can see is
basically the following,

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.240
is that for 10 you actually see
something that's crazy, right,

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.980
if I do 10 observations.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.075
But if I do 50
observations, honestly, it's

00:42:55.075 --> 00:42:56.700
kind of hard to say
that it's different

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.560
from the standard normal.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:01.410
So you could still be
happy with this for 100.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:03.840
And then this is what's
happening for 10,000.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.957
And even here it's not the
beautiful straight line,

00:43:06.957 --> 00:43:08.790
but it feels like you
would be still tempted

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:11.580
to conclude that it's a
beautiful straight line.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.800
So let's try to guess.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.420
So basically, there's-- for
each of those sides there's two

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:18.960
phenomena.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.080
Either it goes like this
or it goes like this,

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.960
and then it goes like
this or it goes like this.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.200
Each side corresponds to the
left tail, all the smallest

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.360
values.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.360
So that's the left side.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.984
And that's the right
side-- corresponds

00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:33.040
to the large values.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.540
OK?

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.460
And so basically
you can actually

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:40.050
think of some sort of
a table that tells you

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.310
what your QQ plot looks like.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.650
And so let's say it looks--

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.840
so we have our reference
45-degree line.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.960
So let's say this
is the QQ plot.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.820
That could be one thing.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.380
This could be the QQ plot
where I have another thing.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:08.890
Then I can do this guy,
and then I do this guy.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.690
So this is like this.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:11.642
OK?

00:44:11.642 --> 00:44:13.665
So those are the four cases.

00:44:13.665 --> 00:44:14.950
OK?

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:19.000
And here what's changing
is the right tail,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.970
and here what's
changing is the--

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:24.820
and when I go from here to here,
what changes is the left tail.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.851
Is that true?

00:44:26.851 --> 00:44:27.350
No, sorry.

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.290
What changes here is
the right tail, right?

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:34.110
It's this part that
changes from top to bottom.

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:38.542
So here it's something
about right tail,

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:40.410
and here that's something
about left tail.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.805
Everybody understands what I
mean when I talk about tails?

00:44:46.805 --> 00:44:48.200
OK.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.120
And so here it's
just going to be

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.670
a question of whether
the tails are heavier

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.689
or lighter than the Gaussian.

00:44:54.689 --> 00:44:56.480
Everybody understand
what I mean when I say

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.640
heavy tails and light tails?

00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.600
OK.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.670
So right, so heavy
tails just means

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.880
that basically here
the tails of this guy

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.540
are heavier than the
tails of this guy.

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.785
So it means that if I draw
them, they're going to be above.

00:45:08.785 --> 00:45:10.520
Actually, I'm going to keep
this picture because it's

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.811
going to be very useful for me.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:19.650
When I plug the quantiles
at the same-- so let's

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.180
look at the right
tail, for example.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.610
Right here my picture
is for right tails.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.350
When I look at the quantiles of
my theoretical distribution--

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:28.440
so here you can see
the bottom curve

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.420
we have the
theoretical quantiles,

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.800
and those are the
empirical quantiles.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.090
If I look to the right here,
are the theoretical quantiles

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.770
larger or smaller than
the empirical quantiles?

00:45:47.124 --> 00:45:48.290
Let me phrase it the other--

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.460
are the empirical
quantiles larger or smaller

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.250
than the theoretical quantiles?

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.610
AUDIENCE: This is a graph
of quantiles, right?

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.072
So if it's [INAUDIBLE]
it should be smaller.

00:45:59.072 --> 00:46:01.030
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: It
should be smaller, right?

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:04.190
On this line, they are equal.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:07.180
So if I see the empirical
quantile showing up here,

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.510
it means that here the
empirical quantile is less

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.550
than the theoretical quantile.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:13.890
Agree?

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.410
So that means that if
I look at this thing--

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.540
and that's for the
same values, right?

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.440
So the quantiles are computed
for the same values i/n.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.890
So it means that the empirical
quantiles should be looking--

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:29.840
so that should be the
empirical quantile,

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.470
and that should be the
theoretical quantile.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.390
Agreed?

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.730
Those are the smaller
values for the same alpha.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:41.300
So that implies that the tails--

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.880
the right tail, is
it heavy or lighter--

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.530
heavier or lighter
than the Gaussian?

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:51.140
AUDIENCE: Lighter.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.200
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Lighter, right?

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.033
Because those are the
tails of the Gaussian.

00:46:54.033 --> 00:46:55.650
Those are my
theoretical quantiles.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.580
That means that this is the tail
of my empirical distribution.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:00.870
So they are actually lighter.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:09.250
OK?

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:11.500
So here, if I look
at this thing,

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:18.240
this means that the right
tail is actually light.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.800
And by light, I mean
lighter than Gaussian.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.650
Heavy, I mean heavier
than Gaussian.

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:23.730
OK?

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:27.150
OK, now we can probably
do the entire thing.

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:31.980
Well, if this is light, this
is going to be heavy, right?

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.520
That's when I'm above the curve.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.390
Exercise-- is this light or is
this heavy, the first column?

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:47.900
And it's OK.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.734
It should take you
at least 30 seconds.

00:47:51.734 --> 00:47:53.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
different column?

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.740
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah,
this column, right?

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.240
So this is something
that pertains--

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.080
this entire column is going
to tell me whether the fact

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.620
that this guy is
above, does this

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:06.570
mean that I have lighter
or heavier left tails?

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.050
AUDIENCE: Well, on the
left, it's heavier.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:11.150
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: On
the left, it's heavier.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:12.090
OK.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:12.672
I don't know.

00:48:12.672 --> 00:48:14.130
Actually, I need
to draw a picture.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:17.348
You guys are probably
faster than I am.

00:48:17.348 --> 00:48:19.872
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:48:19.872 --> 00:48:21.330
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Actually, let me

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:23.400
check how much randomness is--

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.430
who says it's lighter?

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:27.450
Who says it's heavier?

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but we're biased.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.852
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:30.852 --> 00:48:32.018
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah, OK.

00:48:32.018 --> 00:48:33.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:34.818
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: All right.

00:48:34.818 --> 00:48:36.760
So let's see if it's heavier.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.786
So we're on the left tail, and
so we have one looks like this,

00:48:40.786 --> 00:48:41.910
one looks like that, right?

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:49.100
So we know here that I'm
looking at this part here.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.070
So it means that here my
empirical quantile is larger

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.320
than the theoretical quantile.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.350
OK?

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:02.030
So are my tails
heavier or lighter?

00:49:06.125 --> 00:49:07.280
They're lighter.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.180
That was a bad bias.

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.299
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:10.299 --> 00:49:11.340
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Right?

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.660
It's below, so it's lighter.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:19.100
Because the problem is that
larger for the negative ones

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.068
means that it's smaller
[INAUDIBLE],, right?

00:49:22.068 --> 00:49:23.550
Yeah?

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:26.514
AUDIENCE: Sorry but, what
exactly are these [INAUDIBLE]??

00:49:26.514 --> 00:49:28.984
If this is the inverse--

00:49:28.984 --> 00:49:32.936
if this is the inverse
CDF, shouldn't everything--

00:49:32.936 --> 00:49:34.912
well, if this is
the inverse CDF,

00:49:34.912 --> 00:49:36.394
then you should
only be inputting

00:49:36.394 --> 00:49:38.864
values between 0 and 1 in it.

00:49:38.864 --> 00:49:40.840
And--

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.900
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Oh,
did I put the inverse CDF?

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.814
AUDIENCE: Like on the
previous slide, I think.

00:49:46.814 --> 00:49:48.230
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
No, the inverse

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.910
CDF, yeah, so I'm inputting--

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:51.339
AUDIENCE: Oh,
you're [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:51.339 --> 00:49:53.630
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah, so
it's a scatter plot, right?

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:56.780
So each point is
attached-- each point

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.990
is attached 1/n, 2/n, 3/n.

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:01.600
Now, for each
point I'm plotting,

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.060
that's my x-value, which
maps a number between 0 and 1

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.690
back onto the entire real line,
and my y-value is the same.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:10.190
OK?

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:14.370
So what it means is that those
two numbers, this is in the--

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:17.330
this lives on the entire real
line, not on the interval.

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.540
This lives on the entire real
line, not in the interval.

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:26.630
And so my QQ plots take values
on the entire real line,

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:28.660
entire real line, right?

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.915
So you think of it as a
parameterized curve, where

00:50:31.915 --> 00:50:34.610
the time steps
are 1/n, 2/n, 3/n,

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.740
and I'm just like putting a dot
every time I'm making one step.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.470
OK?

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.540
OK, so what did we say?

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.356
That was lighter, right?

00:50:46.356 --> 00:50:51.196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:51.196 --> 00:50:54.110
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: OK?

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:58.380
One of my favorite exercises
is, here's a bunch of densities.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.140
Here's a bunch of QQ plots.

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.490
Map the correct QQ plot
to its own density.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:05.980
All right?

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:09.220
And there won't be mingled
lines that allow you to do that,

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.720
then you just have to follow,
like at the back of cereal

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.070
boxes.

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.530
All right.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.165
Are there any questions?

00:51:17.165 --> 00:51:18.540
So one thing--
there's two things

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:19.914
I'm trying to
communicate here is

00:51:19.914 --> 00:51:22.460
if you see a QQ plot, now
you should understand,

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:28.350
one, how it was built, and two,
whether it means that you have

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:30.520
heavier tails or lighter tails.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.760
Now, let's look at this guy.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.800
What should we see?

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.480
We should see heavy on the left
and heavy on the right, right?

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.360
We know that this
should be the case.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:45.130
So this thing actually looks
like this, and it sort of does,

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:46.250
right?

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.860
If I take this line
going through here,

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.620
I can see that this
guy's tipping here,

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.360
and this guy's dipping here.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.670
But honestly-- actually, I can't
remember exactly, but t 15,

00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:01.570
if I plotted the density
on top of the Gaussian,

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:02.776
you can see a difference.

00:52:02.776 --> 00:52:04.900
But if I just gave it to
you, it would be very hard

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.399
for you to tell me if there's
an actual difference between t

00:52:07.399 --> 00:52:08.950
15 and Gaussian, right?

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:11.076
Those things are
actually very close.

00:52:11.076 --> 00:52:12.700
And so in particular,
here we're really

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.640
trying to recognize what
the shape is the fact--

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.140
right?

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.980
So t 15 compared to a standard
Gaussian was different,

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:26.119
but t 15 compared to a Gaussian
with a slightly larger variance

00:52:26.119 --> 00:52:27.910
is not going to actually--
you're not going

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:29.090
to see much of a difference.

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:33.610
So in a way, such
distributions are actually not

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:35.890
too far from the Gaussian,
and it's not too--

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:38.950
it's still pretty benign to
conclude that this was actually

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:42.283
a Gaussian distribution because
you can just use the variance

00:52:42.283 --> 00:52:43.750
as a little bit of a buffer.

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:45.250
I'm not going to
get really into how

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:50.500
you would use a
t-distribution into a t-test,

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:54.420
because it's kind of
like Inception, right?

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.150
So but you could pretend
that your data actually

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:02.010
is t-distributed and then
build a t-distribution from it,

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:03.570
but let's not say that.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.490
Maybe that was a bad example.

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:08.280
But there's like other
heavy-tailed distributions like

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.825
Cauchy distribution, which
doesn't even have a--

00:53:10.825 --> 00:53:12.450
it's not even integrable
because that's

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:14.490
as heavy as the tails get.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:18.760
And this you can really tell
it's going to look like this.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.010
It's going to be like pfft.

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:24.240
What does a uniform
distribution look like?

00:53:30.727 --> 00:53:32.210
Like this?

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:37.890
It's going to be-- it's going
to look like a Gaussian one,

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:38.940
right?

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:41.030
So a uniform-- so
this is my Gaussian.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.130
A uniform is basically
going to look like this,

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:46.260
one side take the right mean
and the right variance, right?

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.480
So the tails are
definitely lighter.

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.640
They're 0.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.570
That's as lighter as it gets.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:55.290
So the light-light is going
to look like this S shape.

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:59.050
So an S-- light-tailed
distribution has this S shape.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:53:59.820
OK?

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.520
What is the exponential
going to look like?

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.500
So the exponential is
positively supported.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.430
It only has positive numbers.

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:11.750
So there's no left tail.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:14.110
This is also as
light as it gets.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:16.480
But the right tail, is
it heavier or lighter

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.230
than the Gaussian?

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:18.420
AUDIENCE: Heavier.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.080
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
It's heavier, right?

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.990
It's only the case like e of the
minus x rather e to the minus

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.860
x squared.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:23.760
So it's heavier.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.620
So it means that on the
left it's going to be light,

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.430
and on the right it's
going to be heavy.

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.870
So it's going to be U-shaped.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:32.370
OK?

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.100
That will be fine.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:39.800
All right.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.840
Any other question?

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.990
Again, two messages,
like, more technical,

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:47.960
and you can sort of fiddle
with it by looking at it.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.670
You can definitely
conclude that this

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:53.456
is OK enough to be
Gaussian for your purposes.

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:53.956
Yeah?

00:54:53.956 --> 00:54:59.591
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:59.591 --> 00:55:01.340
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: I
did not hear the "if"

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.756
at the beginning
of your sentence.

00:55:06.431 --> 00:55:08.472
AUDIENCE: I would want to
be lighter tail, right,

00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:10.436
because that'll be--
it's easier to reject?

00:55:10.436 --> 00:55:11.909
Is that correct?

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:20.272
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So what
is your purpose as a--

00:55:20.272 --> 00:55:21.733
AUDIENCE: I want to--

00:55:21.733 --> 00:55:25.142
I have some [INAUDIBLE] right?

00:55:25.142 --> 00:55:28.551
I want to be able to say
I reject H0 [INAUDIBLE]..

00:55:28.551 --> 00:55:29.525
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yes.

00:55:29.525 --> 00:55:32.203
AUDIENCE: So if you
wanted to make it easier

00:55:32.203 --> 00:55:35.002
to reject H0, then--

00:55:35.002 --> 00:55:37.210
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah, in
a way that's true, right?

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:40.440
So once you've actually factored
in the mean and the variance,

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.190
the only thing that actually--

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.690
right.

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:47.950
So if you have Gaussian tails
or lighter-- even lighter tails,

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:51.460
then it's harder for you
to explain deviations

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.780
from randomness only, right?

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:54.640
If you have a
uniform distribution

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.250
and you see something which is--

00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:59.680
if you're uniform on 0, 1 plus
some number and you see 25,

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:01.960
you know this number is
not going to be 0, right?

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.120
So that's basically
as good as it gets.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:06.610
And there's basically
some smooth interpolation

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:07.940
if you have lighter tails.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.600
Now, if you start having
something that has heavy tails,

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.880
then it's more likely
that pure noise

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.880
will generate large observations
and therefore discovery.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.160
So yes, lighter
tails is definitely

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.440
the better-behaved noise.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.520
Let's put it this way.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.740
The lighter it is, the
better behaved it is.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:27.230
Now, this is good--

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:30.140
this is good for some purposes,
but when you want to compute

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:35.420
actual quantiles,
like exact quantiles,

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:40.070
then it is true in general that
the quantiles of lighter-tail

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:42.520
distributions are going to be
dominated by the-- are going

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:46.236
to be dominated by the--

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:47.610
let's say on the
right tails, are

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:51.410
going to be dominated by
those of a heavy distribution.

00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:52.729
That is true.

00:56:52.729 --> 00:56:54.020
But that's not always the case.

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:54.980
And in particular,
there's going to be

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.627
some like sort of weird points
where things are actually

00:56:57.627 --> 00:56:59.960
changing depending on what
level you're actually looking

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.964
at those things,
maybe 5% or 10%,

00:57:01.964 --> 00:57:04.130
in which case things might
be changing a little bit.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.171
But if you started going
really towards the tail,

00:57:06.171 --> 00:57:10.220
if you start looking at levels
alpha which are 1% or 0.1%,

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.070
it is true that it's always--

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:14.990
if you can actually--
so if you see something

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:16.790
that looks light
tail, you definitely

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:18.581
do not want to conclude
that it's Gaussian.

00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:21.080
You want to actually change
your modeling so that it

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.240
makes your life even easier.

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.400
And you actually
factor in the fact

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.830
that you can see that the
noise is actually more benign

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:30.929
than you would like it to be.

00:57:30.929 --> 00:57:31.429
OK?

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.440
Stretching fingers, that's it?

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.930
All right.

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:38.880
OK.

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.045
So I want to--

00:57:40.045 --> 00:57:43.380
I mentioned at some point that
we had this chi-square test

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.270
that was showing up.

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:47.720
And I do not know what I did--

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:49.260
let's just-- oh, yeah.

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:53.770
So we have this chi-square test
that we worked on last time,

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:54.270
right?

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:57.420
So the way I introduced the
chi-square test is by saying,

00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.520
I am fascinated
by this question.

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.380
Let's check if it's correct, OK?

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.230
Or something maybe
slightly deeper--

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.570
let's check if juries
in this country

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:10.740
are representative of
racial distribution.

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:14.640
But you could actually--
those numbers here

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.046
come from a very specific thing.

00:58:16.046 --> 00:58:16.920
That was the uniform.

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.878
That was our benchmark.

00:58:17.878 --> 00:58:19.320
Here's the uniform.

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.690
And there was this guy,
which was a benchmark, which

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:24.792
was the actual benchmark that we
need to have for this problem.

00:58:24.792 --> 00:58:27.000
And those things basically
came out of my hat, right?

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.230
Those are numbers that exist.

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:33.120
But in practice, you actually
make those numbers yourself.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.360
And the way you do it
is by saying, well,

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.760
if I have a binomial
distribution

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.350
and I want to test
if my data comes

00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:42.969
from a binomial
distribution, you

00:58:42.969 --> 00:58:44.260
could ask this question, right?

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.580
You have a bunch of data.

00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:48.070
I did not promise
to you that this

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:50.920
was the sum of independent
Bernoullis and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.800
And then you can actually check
that it's a binomial indeed,

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.030
and you have binomial.

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:57.580
If you think about where
you've encountered binomials,

00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.380
it was mostly when
you were drawing balls

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:02.490
from urns, which you probably
don't do that much in practice.

00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:02.990
OK?

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:05.639
And so maybe one day you want
to model things as a binomial,

00:59:05.639 --> 00:59:07.430
or maybe you want to
model it as a Poisson,

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:08.800
as a limiting binomial, right?

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.380
People tell you photons arrive--

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.510
the rate of a photon
hitting some surface

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:15.460
is actually a Poisson
distribution, right?

00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:18.330
That's where they
arise a lot in imaging.

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:21.100
So if I have a colleague
who's taking pictures

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.714
of the skies over night, and
he's like following stars

00:59:23.714 --> 00:59:26.380
and it's just like moving around
with the rotation of the Earth.

00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.637
And he has to do this
for like eight hours

00:59:28.637 --> 00:59:30.970
because he needs to get enough
photons over this picture

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:32.150
to actually arise.

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:35.515
And he knows they arrive
at like a Poisson process,

00:59:35.515 --> 00:59:39.830
and you know, chapter 7 of your
probability class, I guess.

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:40.650
And

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:43.330
And there's all
these distributions

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.890
outside the classroom
you probably

00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:46.724
want to check that
they're actually correct.

00:59:46.724 --> 00:59:49.139
And so the first one you might
want to check, for example,

00:59:49.139 --> 00:59:49.725
is a binomial.

00:59:49.725 --> 00:59:52.540
So I give you a distribution,
a binomial distribution

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:56.540
on, say, K trials, and
you have some number p.

00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.140
And here, I don't know
typically what p should be,

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.824
but let's say I know it or
estimate it from my data.

01:00:01.824 --> 01:00:04.240
And here, since we're only
going to deal with asymptotics,

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.000
just like it was the case for
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov one,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.860
in the asymptotic
we're going to be

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:13.086
able to think of the estimated
p as being a true p, OK,

01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:15.340
under the null at least.

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:19.180
So therefore, each outcome,
I can actually tell you what

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.590
the probability of a binomial--

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:21.340
is this outcome.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.920
For a given K and a
given p, I can tell you

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.690
exactly what a binomial
should give you

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:27.800
as the probability
for the outcome.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.670
And that's what I actually use
to replace the numbers 1/12,

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:41.290
1/12, 1/12, 1/12 or the
numbers 0.72, 0.7, 0.12, 0.9.

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:43.420
All these numbers I
can actually compute

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.640
using the probabilities
of a binomial, right?

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:52.600
So I know, for example, that the
probability that a binomial np

01:00:52.600 --> 01:01:02.830
is equal to, say, K is n
choose K p to the K 1 minus p

01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:05.895
to the n minus K. OK?

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.300
I mean, so these are numbers.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.800
If you give me p
and you give me n,

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.710
I can compute those numbers
for all K from 0 to n.

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:14.604
And from this I can
actually build a table.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:22.560
All right?

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.600
So for each K--

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.340
0.

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:31.020
So K is here, and
from 0, 1, et cetera,

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:35.640
all the way to n, I can compute
the true probability, which

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.680
is the probability that my
binomial np is equal to 0,

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.130
the probability that my binomial
is equal to 1, et cetera,

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.440
all the way to n.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.610
I can compute those numbers.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:50.560
Those are actually going
to be exact numbers, right?

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.952
I just plug in the
formula that I had.

01:01:52.952 --> 01:01:54.660
And then I'm going to
have some observed.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.460
So that's going to be p
hat, 0, and that's basically

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:12.430
the proportion of 0's, right?

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:16.542
So here you have to remember
it's not a one-time experiment

01:02:16.542 --> 01:02:18.250
like you do in
probability where you say,

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:22.390
I'm going to draw n
balls from an urn,

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.100
and I'm counting how many--

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.150
how many I have.

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.990
This is statistics.

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:28.990
I need to be able to do
this experiment many times

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:31.910
so I can actually, in the
end, get an idea of what

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:33.810
the proportion of p's is.

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:36.100
So you have not
just one binomial,

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.300
but you have n binomials.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.380
Well, maybe I should
not use n twice.

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.080
So that's why it's
the K here, right?

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.140
So I have a binomial
[INAUDIBLE] at Kp

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.405
and I just seize
n of those guys.

01:02:46.405 --> 01:02:48.280
And with this n of those
guys, I can actually

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.072
estimate those probabilities.

01:02:50.072 --> 01:02:51.530
And what I'm going
to want to check

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:53.280
is if those two
probabilities are actually

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.520
close to each other.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.980
But I already know
how to do this.

01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:58.480
All right?

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.130
So here I'm going
to test whether P

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:02.810
is in some parametric
family, for example,

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:06.700
binomial or not binomial.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.630
And testing-- if I know that
it's a binomial [INAUDIBLE],,

01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:12.870
and I basically just have to
test if P is the right thing.

01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:14.460
OK?

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:17.710
Oh, sorry, I'm actually
lying to you here.

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:18.210
OK.

01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.793
I don't want to test
if it's binomial.

01:03:19.793 --> 01:03:24.220
I want to test the parameter
of the binomial here.

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:24.840
OK?

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.330
So I know-- no, sorry,
[INAUDIBLE] sorry.

01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:28.830
OK.

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.960
So I want to know if
I'm in some family,

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:34.380
the family of binomials, or
not in the family of binomials.

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:35.280
OK?

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.910
Well, that's what I want to do.

01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:39.690
And so here H0 is basically
equivalent to testing

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:42.750
if the pj's are the pj's
that come from the binomial.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:46.170
And the pj's here are the
probabilities that I get.

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:50.180
This is the probability
that I get j successes.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.180
That's my pj.

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:54.370
That's j's value here.

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:54.870
OK?

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:57.600
So this is the example,
and we know how to do this.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.290
We construct p hat,
which is the estimated

01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:03.230
proportion of successes
from the observations.

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:05.750
So here now I have n trials.

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:08.390
This is the actual maximum
likelihood estimator.

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:12.230
This becomes a multinomial
experiment, right?

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:13.430
So it's kind of confusing.

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:17.010
We have a multinomial experiment
for a binomial distribution.

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:19.520
The binomial here
is just a recipe

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.740
to create some
test probabilities.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.654
That's all it is.

01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:24.320
The binomial here
doesn't really matter.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.539
It's really to create
the test probabilities.

01:04:26.539 --> 01:04:28.830
And then I'm going to define
this test statistic, which

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:36.420
is known as the chi-square
statistic, right?

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.910
This was the chi-square test.

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:41.490
We just looked at sum of the
square root of the differences.

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:45.004
Inverting the covariance matrix
or using the Fisher information

01:04:45.004 --> 01:04:46.920
with removing the part
that was not invertible

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.410
led us to actually use
this particular value here,

01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:54.325
and then we had
to multiply by n.

01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:55.040
OK?

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.710
And that, we know,
converges to what?

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:01.510
A chi-square distribution.

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:03.260
So I'm not going to
go through this again.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.218
I'm just telling you you
can use the chi-square

01:05:05.218 --> 01:05:08.090
that we've seen, where we just
came up with the numbers we

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:09.020
were testing.

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:12.350
Those numbers that were in this
row for the true probabilities,

01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:14.224
we came up with them
out of thin air.

01:05:14.224 --> 01:05:15.890
And now I'm telling
you you can actually

01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:19.010
come up with those guys
from a binomial distribution

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:20.905
or a Poisson
distribution or whatever

01:05:20.905 --> 01:05:22.196
distribution you're happy with.

01:05:26.004 --> 01:05:26.956
Any question?

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:31.970
So now I'm creating
this thing, and I

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.790
can apply the entire theory
that I have for the chi-square

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:36.710
and, in particular, that
this thing converges

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:38.846
to a chi-square.

01:05:38.846 --> 01:05:40.970
But if you see, there's
something that's different.

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:42.186
What is different?

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.850
The degrees of freedom.

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:51.990
And if you think about it,
again, the meaning of degrees

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.510
of freedom.

01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:54.020
What does this word--

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.810
these words actually mean?

01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.960
It means, well, to
which extent can I

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.340
play around with those values?

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.230
What are the possible
values that I can get?

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:03.990
If I'm not equal to this
particular value I'm testing,

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:07.500
how many directions can I
be different from this guy?

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.650
And when we had a
given set of values,

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:13.170
we could be any other
set of values, right?

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:16.140
So here, I had this--

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.890
I'm going to represent-- this
is the set of all probability

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:23.910
distributions of vectors
of size K. So here,

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:25.830
if I look at one
point in this set,

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:29.530
this is something that looks
like p1 through pK such that

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:30.360
their sum--

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:36.520
such that they're non-negative,
and the sum p1 through pK

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.190
is equal to 1.

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.690
OK?

01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:40.000
So I have all those points here.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.900
OK?

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:44.930
So this is basically the
set that I had before.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:47.210
I was testing whether I
was equal to this one guy,

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:48.980
or if I was anything else.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.157
And there's many ways
I can be anything else.

01:06:51.157 --> 01:06:53.240
What matters, of course,
is what's around this guy

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.970
that I could actually
confuse myself with.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.050
But there's many ways I
can move around this guy.

01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:00.670
Agreed?

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:04.710
Now I'm actually just testing
something very specific.

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.840
I'm saying, well,
now the piece that I

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:09.180
have had to come
from this-- have

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:13.560
to be constructed from this
formula, this parametric family

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.840
P of theta.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:20.130
And there's a fixed way for--
let's say this is theta,

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:23.340
so I have a theta here.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.150
There's not that many ways
this can actually give me

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:28.430
a set of probabilities, right?

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:31.110
I have to move to another
theta to actually start

01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:32.510
being confused.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:34.940
And so here the number
of degrees of freedom

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:39.200
is basically, how can I
move along this family?

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.630
And so here, this
is all the points,

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:43.160
but there might
be just the subset

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.750
of the points that looks
like this, just this curve,

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.680
not the half of this thing.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:56.210
And those guys on this
curve are the p thetas,

01:07:56.210 --> 01:08:00.020
and that's for all thetas
when theta runs across data.

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:03.060
So in a way, this is just a
much smaller dimensional thing.

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.700
It's a much smaller object.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.860
Those are only the
ones that I can

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:13.100
create that are exactly of this
very specific parametric form.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.410
And of course, not
all are of this form.

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:19.270
Not all probability
PMFs are of this form.

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:20.939
And so that is going
to have an effect

01:08:20.939 --> 01:08:24.060
on what my PMF is going to be--

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:28.830
sorry, on what my--

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:33.689
sorry, what my degrees of
freedoms are going to be.

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:39.149
Because when this thing is
very small, that means when--

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.170
that's happening when
theta is actually,

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:44.670
say, a one-dimensional
space, then there's still

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:46.470
many ways I can escape, right?

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.450
I can be different
from this guy in pretty

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:50.939
much every other direction,
except for those two

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:53.910
directions, just
when I move from here

01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:56.050
or when I move in
this direction.

01:08:56.050 --> 01:09:00.120
But now if this
thing becomes bigger,

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.399
your theta is, say,
two dimensional,

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:06.090
then when I'm here
it's becoming harder

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:07.229
for me to not be that guy.

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:08.812
If I want to move
away from it, then I

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:11.460
have to move away
from the board.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:15.018
And so that means that
the bigger the dimension

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:18.590
of my theta, the smaller
the degrees of freedoms

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:24.810
that I have, OK, because moving
out of this parametric family

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:27.490
is actually very
difficult for me.

01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:30.930
So if you think, for
example, as an extreme case,

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:36.580
the parametric family that I
have is basically all PMFs,

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.069
all of them, right?

01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:39.710
So that's a stupid
parametric family.

01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:41.890
I'm indexed by the
distribution itself,

01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:43.810
but it's still
finite dimensional.

01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:46.810
Then here, I have basically
no degrees of freedom.

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:48.220
There's no way I
can actually not

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:51.250
be that guy, because this
is everything I have.

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:54.220
And so you don't have
to really understand

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:59.050
how the computation comes
into the numbers of dimension

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:01.300
and what I mean by dimension
of this current space.

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.170
But really, what's important is
that as the dimension of theta

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:09.350
becomes bigger, I have
less degrees of freedom

01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:11.640
to be away from this family.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.730
This family becomes big,
and it's very hard for me

01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:14.990
to violate this.

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:17.210
So it's actually shrinking
the number of degrees

01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:18.907
of freedom of my chi-square.

01:10:18.907 --> 01:10:20.490
And that's all you
need to understand.

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:23.240
When d increases, the number of
degrees of freedom decreases.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.304
And I'd like to you to have an
idea of why this is somewhat

01:10:27.304 --> 01:10:28.928
true, and this is
basically the picture

01:10:28.928 --> 01:10:30.068
you should have in mind.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:33.740
OK.

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.920
So now once I have done
this, I can just construct.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.290
So here I need to check.

01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:39.178
So what is d in the
case of the binomial?

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:43.090
AUDIENCE: 1.

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:43.570
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: 1, right?

01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:44.980
It's just a
one-dimensional thing.

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.396
And for most of
the examples we're

01:10:46.396 --> 01:10:48.440
going to have it's going
to be one dimensional.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.360
So we have this weird thing.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.430
We're going to have K
minus 2 degrees of freedom.

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:59.640
So now I have this thing,
and I have this asymptotic.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.310
And then I can just basically
use a test that has--

01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:04.610
that uses the fact that
the asymptotic distribution

01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:05.110
is this.

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.870
So I compute my
quantiles out of this.

01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:08.210
Again, I made the same mistake.

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:11.490
This should be q alpha,
and this should be q alpha.

01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:13.110
So that's just the
tail probability

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:16.699
is equal to alpha when I'm
on the right of q alpha.

01:11:16.699 --> 01:11:18.240
And so those are
the tail probability

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.730
of the appropriate chi-square
with the appropriate number

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:22.030
of degrees of freedom.

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:24.880
And so I can compute p-values,
and I can do whatever I want.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.380
OK?

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:28.510
So then I just like [INAUDIBLE]
my testing machinery.

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:29.010
OK?

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:34.960
So now I know how to test if I'm
a binomial distribution or not.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.080
Again here, testing if I'm
a binomial distribution

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.660
is not a simple goodness of fit.

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.040
It's a composite one
where I can actually--

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.910
there's many ways I can
be a binomial distribution

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:48.260
because there's as
many as there is theta.

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.700
And so I'm actually plugging
in the theta hat, which is

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.380
estimated from the data, right?

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.370
And here, since everything's
happening in the asymptotics,

01:11:57.370 --> 01:12:00.790
I'm not claiming that Tn
has a pivotal distribution

01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:01.849
for finite n.

01:12:01.849 --> 01:12:02.890
That's actually not true.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.514
It's going to depend
like crazy on what

01:12:04.514 --> 01:12:06.150
the actual distribution is.

01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:08.170
But asymptotically,
I have a chi-square,

01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:11.539
which obviously does not
depend on anything [INAUDIBLE]..

01:12:11.539 --> 01:12:13.511
OK?

01:12:13.511 --> 01:12:14.497
Yeah?

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:19.920
AUDIENCE: So in general, for
the binomial [INAUDIBLE] trials.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.371
But in the general
case, the number of--

01:12:23.371 --> 01:12:26.315
the size of our PMF is
the number of [INAUDIBLE]..

01:12:26.315 --> 01:12:27.315
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.

01:12:27.315 --> 01:12:29.287
AUDIENCE: So let's
say that I was also

01:12:29.287 --> 01:12:32.738
uncertain about what
K was so that I don't

01:12:32.738 --> 01:12:37.668
know how big my [INAUDIBLE] is.

01:12:37.668 --> 01:12:48.580
[INAUDIBLE]

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.090
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
That is correct.

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:54.670
And thank you for this beautiful
segue into my next slide.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.290
So we can actually
deal with the case

01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:57.640
not only where it's
infinite, which

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.870
would be the case of Poisson.

01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:00.244
I mean, nobody
believes I'm going

01:13:00.244 --> 01:13:02.620
to get an infinite
number of photons

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:04.210
in a finite amount of time.

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:08.140
But we just don't want to have
to say there's got to be a--

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.910
this is the largest
possible number.

01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:10.870
We don't want to
have to do that.

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:13.078
Because if you start doing
this and the probabilities

01:13:13.078 --> 01:13:16.370
become close to 0, things become
degenerate and it's an issue.

01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:18.220
So what we do is we bin.

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.890
We just bin stuff.

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:20.550
OK?

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:23.860
And so maybe if I have
a binomial distribution

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:28.400
with, say, 200,000
possible values,

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.082
then it's actually maybe
not the level of precision

01:13:32.082 --> 01:13:33.040
I want to look at this.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:33.870
Maybe I want to bin.

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:35.411
Maybe I want to say,
let's just think

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.450
of all things that
are between 0 and 100

01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:40.765
to be the same thing, between
100 and 200 the same thing,

01:13:40.765 --> 01:13:41.710
et cetera.

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:44.064
And so in fact, I'm
actually going to bin.

01:13:44.064 --> 01:13:46.480
I don't even have to think
about things that are discrete.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.120
I can even think about
continuous cases.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.850
And so if I want to test if I
have a Gaussian distribution,

01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:55.420
for example, I can just
approximate that by some,

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:59.590
say, piecewise constant
function that just says that,

01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:03.370
well, if I have a Gaussian
distribution like this,

01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:06.484
I'm going to bin it like this.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:08.650
And I'm going to say, well,
the probability that I'm

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:10.150
less than this value is this.

01:14:10.150 --> 01:14:12.692
The probability that I'm between
this and this value is this.

01:14:12.692 --> 01:14:14.650
The probability I'm
between this and this value

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:18.370
is this, and then this
and then this, right?

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.650
And now I've turned--

01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:24.240
I've discretized, effectively,
my Gaussian into a PMF.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.140
The value-- this is p1.

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.510
The value here is p1.

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.460
This is p2.

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.800
This is p3.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.230
This is p4.

01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:39.150
This is p5 and p6, right?

01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:41.920
I have discretized my Gaussian
into six possible values.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:46.650
That's just the probability that
they fall into a certain bin.

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:47.865
And we can do this--

01:14:47.865 --> 01:14:51.590
if you don't know what
K is, just stop at 10.

01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:54.360
You look at your data quickly
and you say, well, you know,

01:14:54.360 --> 01:15:00.180
I have so few of them that are--
like I see maybe one 8, one 11,

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:01.590
and one 15.

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:03.270
Well, everything
that's between 8 and 20

01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:05.130
I'm just going to
put it in one bin.

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:07.020
Because what else
are you going to do?

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.490
I mean, you just don't
have enough observations.

01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:11.710
And so what we do is
we just bin everything.

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:14.460
So here I'm going to actually
be slightly abstract.

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:16.922
Our bins are going
to be intervals Aj.

01:15:16.922 --> 01:15:18.880
So here-- they don't even
have to be intervals.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.930
I could go crazy and just
like call the bin this guy

01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:23.370
and this guy, right?

01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:27.110
That would make no sense,
but I could do that.

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:30.620
And then I'm-- and of course,
you can do whatever you want,

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.180
but there's going to be some
consequences in the conclusions

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:34.490
that you can take, right?

01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:35.906
All you're going
to be able to say

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:38.790
is that my distribution
does not look like it

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:40.800
could be binned in this way.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.570
That's all you're going
to be able to say.

01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:46.800
So if you decide to just
put all the negative numbers

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.357
and the positive
numbers, then it's

01:15:48.357 --> 01:15:50.190
going to be very hard
for you to distinguish

01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:52.314
a Gaussian from a random
variable that takes values

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.110
of minus 1 and plus 1 only.

01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:57.490
You need to just be reasonable.

01:15:57.490 --> 01:15:57.990
OK?

01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:00.720
So now I have my pj's
become the probability

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.590
that my random variable
falls into bin j.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.290
So that's pj of theta under
the parametric distribution.

01:16:10.290 --> 01:16:14.270
For the true one, whether it's
parametric or not, I have a pj.

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:15.870
And then I have
p hat j, which is

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:19.030
the proportion of observations
that falls in this bin.

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.530
All right?

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:21.030
So I have a bunch
of observations.

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:23.250
I count how many of
them fall in this bin.

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:26.130
I divide by n, and that
tells me what my estimated

01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:29.410
probability for this bin is.

01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:31.444
And theta hat, well,
it's the same as before.

01:16:31.444 --> 01:16:32.860
If I'm in a
parametric family, I'm

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:35.151
just estimating theta hat,
maybe the maximum likelihood

01:16:35.151 --> 01:16:37.690
estimator, plug it
in, and estimate

01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:39.700
those pj's of theta hat.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:43.390
From this, I form my
chi-square, and I have exactly

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.230
the same thing as before.

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:48.680
So the answer to your
question is, yes, you bin.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.690
And it's the answer to
even more questions.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.390
So that's why there
you can actually

01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:56.420
use the chi-square test
to test for normality.

01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:58.850
Now here it's going
to be slightly weaker,

01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:00.800
because there's only
an asymptotic theory,

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.920
whereas Kolmogorov-Smirnov
and Kolmogorov-Lilliefors work

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.230
actually even for
finite samples.

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.600
For the chi-square test,
it's only asymptotic.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.300
So you just pretend you actually
know what the parameters are.

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:15.250
You just stuff them
into a theta, a mu hat,

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:16.670
and sigma square hat.

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:19.280
And you just go to-- you
just cross your finger

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.020
that n is large
enough for everything

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.161
to have converged by the
time you make your decision.

01:17:24.161 --> 01:17:24.660
OK?

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:28.440
And then this is a copy/paste,
with the same error actually

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.710
as the previous slide, where
you just build your test based

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:34.560
on whether you exceed
or not some quantile,

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.721
and you can also
compute some p-value.

01:17:37.721 --> 01:17:38.220
OK?

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.120
AUDIENCE: The error?

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.328
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: I'm sorry?

01:17:40.328 --> 01:17:41.559
AUDIENCE: What's the error?

01:17:41.559 --> 01:17:43.100
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
What is the error?

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.575
AUDIENCE: You said [INAUDIBLE]
copy/paste [INAUDIBLE]..

01:17:45.575 --> 01:17:47.450
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Oh,
the error is that this

01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:48.520
should be q alpha, right?

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.190
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:51.273
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: I've
been calling this q alpha.

01:17:51.273 --> 01:17:53.459
I mean, that's my
personal choice,

01:17:53.459 --> 01:17:54.500
because I don't want to--

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.820
I only use q alpha.

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.644
So I only use quantiles where
alpha is to the right, so.

01:17:59.644 --> 01:18:01.310
That's what statisticians--
probabilists

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:02.970
would use this notation.

01:18:07.041 --> 01:18:07.540
OK.

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:10.000
And so some questions, right?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.820
So of course, in
practice you're going

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.650
to have some issues
which translate.

01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:16.010
I say, well, how do you
pick this guy, this K?

01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:17.610
So I gave you some sort of a--

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:19.810
I mean, the way we
discussed, right?

01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:23.220
You have 8 and 10 and
20, then it's ad hoc.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:27.120
And so depending on whether
you want to stop K at 20

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.610
or if you want to bin those
guys is really up to you.

01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:31.050
And there's going to
be some considerations

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:32.591
about the particular
problem at hand.

01:18:32.591 --> 01:18:34.180
I mean, is it
coarse-- too coarse

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:38.070
for your problem to decide
that the observations between 8

01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:39.644
and 20 are the same?

01:18:39.644 --> 01:18:40.560
It's really up to you.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.476
Maybe that's actually
making a huge difference

01:18:42.476 --> 01:18:45.420
in terms of what phenomenon
you're looking at.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.770
The choice of the bins, right?

01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:48.450
So here there's
actually some sort

01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:51.870
of rules, which are
don't use only one bin

01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:55.200
and make sure there's actually--
don't use them too small

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.710
so that there's at least one
observation per bin, right?

01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:59.010
And it's basically
the same kind of rules

01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:00.360
that you would have
to build a histogram.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.280
If you were to build a
histogram for your data,

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.780
you still want to
make sure that you

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.030
bin in an appropriate fashion.

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.530
OK?

01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:08.052
And there's a bunch
of rule of thumbs.

01:19:08.052 --> 01:19:09.510
Every time you ask
someone, they're

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:11.176
going to have a
different rule of thumb,

01:19:11.176 --> 01:19:13.850
so just make your own.

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:17.580
And then there's the
computation of pj

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.530
of theta, which might
be a bit complicated

01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:21.450
because, in this
case, I would have

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:24.030
to integrate the Gaussian
between this number

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:25.270
and this number.

01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:27.120
So for this case, I
could just say, well,

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.150
it's the difference of the CDF
in that value and that value

01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:31.440
and then be happy with it.

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.606
But you can imagine that
you have some slightly more

01:19:33.606 --> 01:19:34.574
crazy distributions.

01:19:34.574 --> 01:19:36.240
You're going to have
to somewhat compute

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.630
some integrals that might be
unpleasant for you to compute.

01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:40.180
OK?

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.846
And in particular, I
said the difference

01:19:41.846 --> 01:19:44.680
of the PDF between that value
and that value of-- sorry,

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:47.722
the CDF between that value
and that value, it is true.

01:19:47.722 --> 01:19:49.180
But it's not like
you actually have

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:52.480
tables that compute the CDF
at any value you like, right?

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.445
You have to sort of--

01:19:54.445 --> 01:19:56.212
well, there might be
but at some degree,

01:19:56.212 --> 01:19:58.420
but you are going to have
to use a computer typically

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.050
to do that.

01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:01.550
OK?

01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:05.270
And so for example, you
could do the Poisson.

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:07.489
If I had time, if I had
more than one minute,

01:20:07.489 --> 01:20:08.780
I would actually do it for you.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.340
But it's basically the same.

01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.560
The Poisson, you are going
to have an infinite tail,

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.018
and you just say,
at some point I'm

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:16.560
going to cut everything
that's larger than some value.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.060
All right?

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:20.727
So you can play around, right?

01:20:20.727 --> 01:20:23.310
I say, well, if you have extra
knowledge about what you expect

01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:26.000
to see, maybe you can
cut at a certain number

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.530
and then just fold all the
largest values from K minus 1

01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:35.630
to infinity so that
you actually have--

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:37.891
you have everything
into one large bin.

01:20:37.891 --> 01:20:38.390
OK?

01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:39.980
That's the entire tail.

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.350
And that's the way people do
it in insurance companies,

01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.869
for example.

01:20:42.869 --> 01:20:45.410
They assume that the number of
accidents you're going to have

01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:47.300
is a Poisson distribution.

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.620
They have to fit it to you.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.680
They have to know--

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.970
or at least to your pool of
insurance of injured people.

01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:56.390
So they just slice you
into what your character--

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:58.187
relevant characteristics
are, and then they

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:00.270
want to estimate what the
Poisson distribution is.

01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:03.760
And basically, they can
do a chi-square test

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:06.980
to check if it's indeed
a Poisson distribution.

01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:07.480
All right.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.070
So that will be it for today.

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:11.330
And so I'll be--

01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:13.800
I'll have your homework--
