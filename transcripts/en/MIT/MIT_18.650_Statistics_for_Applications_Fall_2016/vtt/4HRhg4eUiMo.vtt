00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:21.410
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: We're
talking about tests.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.720
And to be fair, we
spend most of our time

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.470
talking about new
jargon that we're using.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.710
The main goal is to take a
binary decision, yes and no.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.360
So just so that we're clear
and we make sure that we all

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.980
speak the same
language, let me just

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.570
remind you what the key
words are for tests.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.310
So the first thing is
that we split theta

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.690
in theta 0 and theta 1.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.610
Both are included in theta,
and they are disjoint.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.090
So I have my set of
possible parameters.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.770
And then I have theta 0
is here, theta 1 is here.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.170
And there might be
something that I leave out.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.070
And so what we're doing
is, we have two hypotheses.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.800
So here's our hypothesis
testing problem.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.910
And it's h0 theta belongs
to theta 0 versus h1 theta

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.860
belongs to theta 1.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.620
This guy was called
the null, and this guy

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.410
was called the alternative.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.910
And why we give
them special names

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.230
is because we saw that they
have an asymmetric role.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.070
The null represents
the status quo,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.290
and data is here to bring
evidence against this guy.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.730
And we can really never
conclude that h0 is true

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.420
because all we could conclude is
that h1 is not true, or may not

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.030
be true.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.840
So that was the first thing.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.020
The second thing
was the hypothesis.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.730
The third thing
is, what is a test?

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:17.100
Well, psi, it's a statistic,
and it takes the data,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.500
and it maps it into 0 or 1.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.000
And I didn't really mention it,
but there's some things such

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.390
as called randomized
tests, which is, well,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.920
if I cannot really
make a decision,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.870
I might as well flip a coin.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.952
That tends to be biased,
but that's really--

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.410
I mean, think about
it in practice.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.118
You probably don't
want to make decisions

00:02:36.118 --> 00:02:37.380
based on flipping a coin.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.270
And so what people
typically do--

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.830
this is happening, typically,
at one specific value.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.339
So rather than flipping a coin
for this very specific value,

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:45.880
what people typically
do is they say,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.088
OK, I'm going to side with
h0 because that's the most

00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:50.134
conservative choice I can make.

00:02:50.134 --> 00:02:52.050
So in a way, they think
of flipping this coin,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.380
but always falling
on heads, say.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.410
So associated to this test
was something called, well,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.590
the rejection
region r psi, which

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:15.360
is just the set of data x1
xn such that psi of x1 xn

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.720
is equal to 1.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.170
So that means we rejected
h0 when the test is 1.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.270
And those are the
set of data points

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.140
that actually are going to
lead me to reject the test.

00:03:28.777 --> 00:03:30.860
And then the things that
we're actually, slightly,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.660
a little more important and
really peculiar to test,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.460
specific to tests, were the
type I and type II error.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.820
So the type I
error arises when--

00:03:44.820 --> 00:04:01.390
so type I error is when you
reject, whereas h0 is correct.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.920
And the type II error
is the opposite,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:17.354
so it's failed to reject,
whereas h1 is correct--

00:04:17.354 --> 00:04:20.450
h is correct, yeah.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.770
So those are the two types
of errors you can make.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.820
And we quantified their
probability of type I error.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.720
So alpha psi is
the probability--

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.320
so that's the probability
of type I error.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.190
So psi is just the probability
for theta that psi rejects

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.360
and that's defined
for theta and theta 0,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.390
so for different
values of theta 0.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.380
So h0 being correct means
there exists a theta in theta 0

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.380
for which that actually
is the right distribution.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.060
So for different
values of theta,

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.340
I might make different errors.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.440
So if you think, for example,
about the coin example,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.550
I'm testing if the coin
is biased towards heads

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.770
or biased towards tails.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.830
So if I'm testing
whether p is larger

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.145
than 1/2 or less than 1/2,
then when the true p-- let's

00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:27.290
say our h0 is larger than 1/2.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.900
When p is equal to 1, it's
actually very difficult for me

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.570
to make a mistake,
because I only see heads.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.780
So when p is getting
closer to 1/2,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.850
I'm going to start making more
and more probability of error.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.170
And so the type II error-- so
that's the probability of type

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.670
II--

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.550
is denoted by beta psi.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.750
And it's the function,
well, that does the opposite

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:58.070
and, this time, is defined
for theta in theta 1.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:13.410
And finally, we define something
called the power, pi of psi.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.180
And this time, this
is actually a number.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.220
And so this number is equal to
the maximum over theta n theta

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.879
0.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.920
I mean, that could be a
supremum, but think of it

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.940
as being a maximum of p
theta of psi is equal--

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.580
sorry, that's n0, right?

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.640
Give me one sec.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.270
No, sorry, that's the min.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.740
So this is not making a mistake.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.940
Theta 0 is in theta 2 So
if theta is in theta 1

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.279
and I conclude 1, so
this is a good thing.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:56.570
I want this number to be large.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.860
And I'm looking at
the worst house--

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.770
what is the smallest
value this number can be?

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.040
So what I want to show you
a little bit is a picture.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.770
So now I'm going to take theta,
and think of it as being a p.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.340
So I'm going to take p for some
variable in the experiment.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.690
So p can range between 0
and 1, that's for sure.

00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:24.890
And what I'm going
to try to test

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.200
is whether p is less than
1/2 or larger than 1/2.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.340
So this is going to
be, let's say, theta 0.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.020
And this guy here is theta 1.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.900
Just trying to give you a
picture of what those guys are.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.240
So I have my y-axis, and now I'm
going to start drawing number.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.760
All these things--
this function,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.250
this function, and
this number-- are

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.600
all numbers between 0 and 1.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.750
So now I'm claiming that--

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.350
so when I move
from left to right,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.430
what is my probability
of rejecting going to do?

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.930
So what I'm going to plot is
the probability under theta.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.740
The first thing I want to plot
is the probability under theta

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.400
that psi is equal to 1.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.880
And let's say psi--

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.140
think of psi as being
just this indicator

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:35.270
that square root on n xn bar
minus p over square root xn

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.419
bar 1 minus xn bar is
larger than some constant c

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.840
for a probability chosen c.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.280
So what we choose is that c
is in such a way that, at 1/2,

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.380
when we're testing
for 1/2, what we

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:56.500
wanted was this number to be
equal to alpha, basically.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.115
So we fix this alpha
number so that this guy--

00:09:00.115 --> 00:09:09.430
so if I want alpha of psi
of theta less than alpha

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.360
given in advanced--

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.199
so think of it as being
equal to, say, 5%.

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:16.740
So I'm fixing this
number, and I want

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.050
this to be controlled for
all theta and theta 0.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.440
So if you're going to
give me this budget,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.644
well, I'm actually going to
make it equal where I can.

00:09:29.644 --> 00:09:31.810
If you're telling me you
can make it equal to alpha,

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.650
we know that if I
increase my type I error,

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.590
I'm going to decrease
my type II error.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.280
If I start putting
everyone in jail

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.862
or if I start letting
everyone go free,

00:09:41.862 --> 00:09:43.570
that's what we were
discussing last time.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.460
So since we have this
trade-off and you're

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.372
giving me a budget for one guy,
I'm just going to max it out.

00:09:49.372 --> 00:09:50.830
And where am I
going to max it out?

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.170
Exactly at 1/2 at the boundary.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.400
So this is going to be 5%.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.460
So what I know is that
since alpha of theta

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.550
is less than alpha
for all theta in theta

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:12.580
0-- sorry, that's for theta 0,
that's where alpha is defined.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.676
So for theta and theta 0,
I knew that my function

00:10:14.676 --> 00:10:15.800
is going to look like this.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.380
It's going to be somewhere
in this rectangle.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.426
Everybody agrees?

00:10:20.426 --> 00:10:22.800
So this function for this guy
is going to look like this.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.590
When I'm at 0, when
p is equal to 0,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.620
which means I only
observe 0's, then I

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.350
know that p is going to be
0, and I will certainly not

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.510
conclude that p is equal to 1.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:39.100
This test will never conclude
that p is equal to 1--

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.770
that p is larger than
1/2, just because xn bar

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.120
is going to be equal to 0.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.190
Well, this is actually
not well-defined,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.040
so maybe I need to do
something-- put it equal to 0

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.900
if xn bar is equal to 0.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.871
So I guess, basically, I get
something which is negative,

00:10:55.871 --> 00:10:58.120
and so it's never going to
be larger than what I want.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.370
And so here, I'm
actually starting at 0.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:04.300
So now, this is this function
here that increases--

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.610
I mean, it should
increase smoothly.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.620
This function here is
alpha psi of theta--

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.280
or alpha psi of p, let's say,
because we're talking about p.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.916
Then it reaches alpha here.

00:11:17.916 --> 00:11:19.290
Now, when I go on
the other side,

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.510
I'm actually looking at beta.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.730
When I'm on theta 1, the
function that matters

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:28.540
is the probability of type II
error, which is beta of psi.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.775
And this beta of psi is
actually going to increase.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.500
So beta of psi is what?

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.660
Well, beta of psi should also--

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.940
sorry, that's the probability
of being equal to alpha.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.440
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.960
to look at the
probability of rejecting.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.502
So let me draw this
functional all the way.

00:11:46.502 --> 00:11:48.900
It's going to look like this.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.750
Now here, if I look at
this function here or here,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.320
this is the probability under
theta that psi is equal to 1.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.620
And we just said
that, in this region,

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.600
this function is
called alpha of psi.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.990
In that region, it's
not called alpha of psi.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.340
It's not called anything.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.030
It's just the
probability of rejection.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.770
So it's not any
error, it's actually

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.310
what you should be doing.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:19.680
What we're looking at in this
region is 1 minus this guy.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.780
We're looking at the
probability of not rejecting.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.820
So I need to actually,
basically, look at the 1

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.340
minus this thing, which
here is going to be 95%.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.800
So I'm going to do 95%.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.640
And this is my probability.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.380
Ability And I'm just
basically drawing

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.330
the symmetric of this guy.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.890
So this here is the
probability under theta

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:50.390
that psi is equal to 0,
which is 1 minus p theta

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.360
that psi is equal to 1.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.460
So it's just 1 minus
the wide curve.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.010
And it's actually,
by definition, equal

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.360
to beta of psi of theta.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.360
Now, where do I read pi psi?

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.250
What is pi psi on this picture?

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.020
Is pi psi a number
or a function?

00:13:32.242 --> 00:13:32.950
AUDIENCE: Number.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:33.670
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
It's a number, right?

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.444
It's the minimum of a function.

00:13:35.444 --> 00:13:36.360
What is this function?

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.450
It's the probability under
theta that theta is equal to 1.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:44.070
I drew this entire function for
between theta 0 and theta 1.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.680
I drew-- this is this
entire white curve.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.152
This is this probability.

00:13:48.152 --> 00:13:50.610
Now I'm saying, look at the
smallest value this probability

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.300
can take on the set theta 1.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.060
What is this?

00:14:00.332 --> 00:14:02.060
This guy.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.800
This is where my pi--

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.750
this thing here is pi psi,
and so it's equal to 5%.

00:14:11.462 --> 00:14:13.510
So that's for this
particular test,

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:19.035
because this test has a
continuous curve for this psi.

00:14:19.035 --> 00:14:20.800
And so if I want to
make sure that I'm

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.310
at 5% when I come to the
right of the theta 0,

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.380
if it touches theta
1, then I'd better

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.220
have 5% on the other side if
the function is continuous.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.130
So basically, if
this function is

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:38.189
increasing, which will be
the case for most tests,

00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:39.980
and continuous, then
what's going to happen

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.499
is that the level of the
test, which is alpha,

00:14:42.499 --> 00:14:44.790
is actually going to be equal
to the power of the test.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.110
Now, there's something
I didn't mention,

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.810
and I'm just mentioning
it passing by.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.760
Here, I define the power itself.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.420
This function, this
entire white curve here,

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.510
is actually called
the power function--

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.200
this thing.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.340
That's the entire white curve.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.200
And what you could
have is tests that

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.670
have the entire curve which
is dominated by another test.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.760
So here, if I look
at this test--

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.680
and let's assume I can
build another test that

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.070
has this curve.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:29.024
Let's say it's the same
here, but then here, it

00:15:29.024 --> 00:15:29.690
looks like this.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.130
What is the power of this test?

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.130
AUDIENCE: It's the same.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.505
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
It's the same.

00:15:40.505 --> 00:15:43.330
It's 5%, because this
point touches here exactly

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.530
at the same point.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.970
However, for any other value
than the worst possible,

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.670
this guy is doing
better than this guy.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.750
Can you see that?

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.420
Having a curve higher
on the right-hand side

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.310
is a good thing because
it means that you

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:03.240
tend to reject more when
you're actually in h1.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.516
So this guy is definitely
better than this guy.

00:16:06.516 --> 00:16:07.890
And so what we
say, in this case,

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.660
is that the test
with the dashed line

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.550
is uniformly more powerful
than the other tests.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.390
But we're not going to
go into those details

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.780
because, basically, all the
tests that we will describe

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.010
are already the
most powerful ones.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.090
In particular, this guy is--

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.020
there's no such thing.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.340
All the other guys
you can come up with

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.631
are going to actually be below.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.610
So we saw a couple
tests, then we

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.450
saw how to pick this threshold,
and we defined those two

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.327
things.

00:16:41.327 --> 00:16:42.118
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:16:42.118 --> 00:16:43.076
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yes?

00:16:43.076 --> 00:16:45.541
AUDIENCE: But in that
case, the dashed line,

00:16:45.541 --> 00:16:48.964
if it were also higher
in the region of theta 0,

00:16:48.964 --> 00:16:50.898
do you still consider it better?

00:16:50.898 --> 00:16:51.898
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.

00:16:51.898 --> 00:16:52.890
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.400
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Because
you're given this budget of 5%.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.170
So in this paradigm
where you're given the--

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.450
actually, if the dashed
line was this dashed line,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.030
I would still be happy.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.040
I mean, I don't care what
this thing does here,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.780
as long as it's below 5%.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.730
But here, I'm going
to try to discover.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.460
Think about, again, the
drug discovery example.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.069
You're trying to find--
let's say you're a scientist

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:17.140
and you're trying to prove
that your drug works.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.140
What do you want to see?

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.450
Well, FDA puts on
you this constraint

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.919
that your probability of type
I error should never exceed 5%.

00:17:26.919 --> 00:17:28.710
You're going to work
under this assumption.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.293
But what you're going
to do is, you're

00:17:30.293 --> 00:17:33.720
going to try to find a test that
will make you find something

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.450
as often as possible.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.400
And so you're going to
max this constraint of 5%.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.820
And then you're going to try to
make this curve, that means--

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.780
this is, basically, this
number here, for any point

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.990
here, is the probability
that you publish your paper.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.460
That's the probability
that you can

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.690
release to market your drug.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.710
That's the probability
that it works.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.920
And so you want this curve
to be as high as possible.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:02.550
You want to make sure that if
there's evidence in the data

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.670
that h1 is the truth, you
want to squeeze as much

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.110
of this evidence as possible.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.780
And the test that has the
highest possible curve

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.490
is the most powerful one.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.810
Now, you have to also understand
that having two curves that

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.190
are on top of each other
completely, everywhere,

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.560
is a rare phenomenon.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.450
It's not always
the case that there

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.842
is a test that's uniformly more
powerful than any other test.

00:18:27.842 --> 00:18:29.550
It might be that you
have some trade-off,

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.110
that it might be better
here, but then you're

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.027
losing power here.

00:18:32.027 --> 00:18:33.610
Maybe it's-- I mean,
things like this.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.110
Well, actually, maybe
it should not go down.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.590
But let's say it goes like
this, and then, maybe, this guy

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.660
goes like this.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.560
Then you have to, basically,
make an educated guess

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.170
whether you think that the theta
you're going to find is here

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.880
or is here, and then
you pick your test.

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:51.880
Any other question?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.584
Yes?

00:18:52.584 --> 00:18:53.976
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
the green curve again?

00:18:53.976 --> 00:18:55.255
That's just the type II error?

00:18:55.255 --> 00:18:57.380
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So the
green curve is-- exactly.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.830
So that's beta psi of theta.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.620
So it's really
the type II error.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.730
And it's defined only here.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.420
So here, it's not
a definition, it's

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.215
really I'm just mapping
it to this point.

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:10.340
So it's defined only here,
and it's the probability

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.048
of type II error.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.555
So here, it's pretty large.

00:19:17.555 --> 00:19:19.530
I'm making it,
basically, as large

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.330
as I could because
I'm at the boundary,

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.410
and that means, at the boundary,
since the status quo is h0,

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.394
I'm always going
to go for h0 if I

00:19:29.394 --> 00:19:31.935
don't have any evidence, which
means that what's going to pay

00:19:31.935 --> 00:19:34.268
is the type II error that's
going to basically pay this.

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:38.850
Any other question?

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.000
So let's move on.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.190
So did we do this?

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.220
No, I think we
stopped here, right?

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.120
I didn't cover that part.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.310
So as I said, in
this paradigm, we're

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.040
going to actually fix
this guy to be something.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.620
And this thing is actually
called the level of the test.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.410
I'm sorry, this is,
again, more words.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.920
Actually, the good news is that
we split it into two lectures.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.335
So we have, what is a test?

00:20:09.335 --> 00:20:11.252
What is a hypothesis?

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:11.960
What is the null?

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.429
What is the alternative?

00:20:14.429 --> 00:20:15.470
What is the type I error?

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.553
What is the type II error?

00:20:16.553 --> 00:20:18.650
And now, I'm telling you
there's another thing.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.670
So we define the power, which
was some sort of a lower bound

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.140
on the--

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.390
or it's 1 minus the upper
bound on the type II

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.540
error, basically.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.480
And so it's alternative--
so the power

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.970
is the smallest
probability of rejecting

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.290
when you're in the null.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.200
And it's alternative when you're
in theta 1, so that's my power.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.760
I looked here, and I looked
at the smallest value.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.770
And I can look at this
side and say, well,

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.886
what is the largest probability
that I make a type I error?

00:20:48.886 --> 00:20:51.260
Again, this largest probability
is the level of the test.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.140
So this is alpha
equal, by definition,

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:15.490
to the maximum for theta in
theta 0 of alpha psi of theta.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.340
So here, I just put
the level itself.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.950
As you can see, here,
it essentially says

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.890
that if I'm of level of
5%, I'm also of level 10%,

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.600
I'm also of level 15%.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.160
So here, it's really
an upper bound.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.980
Whatever you guys want to
take, this is what it is.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.861
But as we said, if
this number is 4.5%,

00:21:34.861 --> 00:21:36.360
you're losing in
your type II error.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.200
So if you're allowed to have--

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.420
if this maximum here is 4.5% and
FDA told you you can go to 5%,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.920
you're losing in
your type II error.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.295
So you actually
want to make sure

00:21:46.295 --> 00:21:48.400
that this is the 5%
that's given to you.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.700
So the way it works is
that you give me the alpha,

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.410
then I'm going to go back, pick
c that depends on alpha here,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.300
so that this thing is
actually equal to 5%.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.800
And so of course,
in many instances,

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.840
we do not know the probability.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.290
We do not know how to compute
the probability of type I

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.300
error.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.930
This is a maximum value for the
probability of type I error.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.920
We don't know how to compute it.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.900
I mean, it might be a very
complicated random variable.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.300
Maybe it's a weird binomial.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.500
We could compute it,
but it would be painful.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.960
But we know how to compute
is its asymptotic value.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.330
Just because of the central
limit theorem, convergence

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:28.020
and distribution tells me that
the probability of type I error

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.650
is basically going
towards the probability

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.110
that some Gaussian
is in some region.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.240
And so we're going to
compute, not the level itself,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.500
but the asymptotic level.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:48.320
And that's basically
the limit as n

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:56.830
goes to infinity of
alpha psi of theta.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.540
And then I'm going
to make the max here.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.240
So how am I going
to compute this?

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.440
Well, if I take a test that has
rejection region of the form

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.910
tn--

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.970
because it depends on the
data, that's tn of x1 xn--

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:23.440
my observation's larger
than some number c.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.430
Of course, I can
almost always write

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.402
tests like that,
except that sometimes,

00:23:28.402 --> 00:23:30.860
it's going to be an absolute
value, which essentially means

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.552
I'm going away from some value.

00:23:32.552 --> 00:23:34.260
Maybe, actually, I'm
less than something,

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.090
but I can always put a negative
sign in front of everything.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.780
So this is not without
much of generality.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:47.890
So this includes something
that looks like--

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.290
something is larger than the
constants, so that means--

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:02.330
which is equivalent to--
well, let me write that as tq,

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.510
because then that means that--

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.940
so that's tn.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.040
But this actually
encompasses the fact

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:21.370
that qn is larger than c or qn
is less than c and n minus c.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:22.480
So that includes this guy.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.320
That also includes
qn less than c,

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.840
because this is equivalent
to qn is larger than minus c.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.830
And minus qn is--

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.240
and so that's going to be my tn.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.430
So I can actually encode
several type of things--

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.230
rejection regions.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.020
So here, in this case, I
have a rejection region

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.110
that looks like this,
or a rejection region

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.380
that looks like
this, or a rejection

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.550
region that looks like this.

00:24:57.209 --> 00:24:58.750
And here, I don't
really represent it

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.420
for the whole data, but maybe
for the average, for example,

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.018
or the normalized average.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:23.950
So if I write this, then--

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.470
yeah.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:32.970
And in this case,
this tn that shows up

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.168
is called test statistic.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.730
I mean, this is
not set in stone.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.930
Here, for example, q could
be the test statistic.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.640
It doesn't have to
be minus q itself

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.750
that's the test statistic.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.000
So what is the test statistic?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.170
Well, it's what you're going
to build from your data

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.790
and then compare to
some fixed value.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.167
So in the example we had here,
what is our test statistic?

00:26:01.167 --> 00:26:02.000
Well, it's this guy.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.200
This was our test statistic.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.830
And is this thing a statistic?

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.510
What are the criteria
for a statistic?

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.810
What is the statistic?

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:23.633
I know you know the answer.

00:26:23.633 --> 00:26:25.050
AUDIENCE: Measurable function.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.080
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah,
it's a measurable function

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.064
of the data that does not
depend on the parameter.

00:26:29.064 --> 00:26:32.995
Is this guy a statistic?

00:26:32.995 --> 00:26:33.981
AUDIENCE: It's not.

00:26:35.949 --> 00:26:37.490
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Let's think again.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:45.360
When I implemented the
test, what did I do?

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.490
I was able to compute my test.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.800
My test did not depend on
some unknown parameter.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.640
How did we do it?

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.187
We just plugged in
0.5 here, remember?

00:26:57.187 --> 00:26:59.020
That was the value for
which we computed it,

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.150
because under h0, that was
the value we're seeing.

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.910
And if theta 0 is
actually an entire set,

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.935
I'm just going to take the
value that's the closest to h1.

00:27:09.935 --> 00:27:11.060
We'll see that in a second.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.400
I mean, I did not
guarantee that to you.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.950
But just taking the worst type
I error and bounded by alpha

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.310
is equivalent to taking p and
taking the value of p that's

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:26.836
the closest to theta 1, which
is completely intuitive.

00:27:26.836 --> 00:27:29.460
The worst type I error is going
to be attained for the p that's

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.260
the closest to the alternative.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.510
So even if the null is
actually just an entire set,

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.940
it's as if it was
just the point that's

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.840
the closest to the alternative.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.520
So now we can compute
this, because there's

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.440
no unknown parameters
that shows up.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.210
We replace p by 0.5.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.406
And so that was
our test statistic.

00:27:53.952 --> 00:27:55.410
So when you're
building a test, you

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.000
want to first build
a test statistic,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.230
and then see what threshold
you should be getting.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:08.640
So now, let's go back to our
example where we want to have--

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:16.340
we have x1 xn, their
IID [INAUDIBLE] p.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:25.050
And I want to test if p is
1/2 versus p not equal to 1/2,

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.630
which, as I said, is what
you want to do if you

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:33.560
want to test if a coin is fair.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.560
And so here, I'm going to
build a test statistic.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.180
And we concluded
last time that--

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.790
what do we want
for this statistic?

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.700
We want it to have a
distribution which,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:49.820
under the null, does not
depend on the parameters,

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:54.650
a distribution that I can
actually compute quintiles of.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.150
So what we did
is, we said, well,

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.210
if I look at-- the central limit
theorem tells me that square

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:03.500
root of n xn bar
minus p divided by--

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.871
so if I do central limit theorem
plus Slutsky, for example,

00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:08.120
I'm going to have square root.

00:29:12.006 --> 00:29:13.880
And we've had this
discussion whether we want

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.004
to use Slutsky or not here.

00:29:15.004 --> 00:29:17.900
But let's assume we're taking
Slutsky wherever we can.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.060
So this thing tells me
that, by the central limit

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.510
theorem, as n goes to
infinity, this thing converges

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.190
in distribution to some n01.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.550
Now, as we said, this guy
is not something we know.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.020
But under the null,
we actually know it.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.100
And we can actually
replace it by 1/2.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.300
So this thing holds under h0.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.300
When I write under h0, it
means when this is the truth.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.270
So now I have something
that converges

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.570
to something that has no
dependence on anything I

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:53.170
don't know.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.890
And in particular, if you have
any statistics textbook, which

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.260
you don't because I
didn't require one--

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:04.444
and you should be thankful,
because these things cost $350.

00:30:04.444 --> 00:30:05.860
Actually, if you
look at the back,

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:12.250
you actually have a table
for a standard Gaussian.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.780
I could have anything else here.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.760
I could have an
exponential distribution.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.560
I could have a--

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.320
I don't know-- well,
we'll see the chi squared

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.030
distribution in a minute.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.040
Any distribution from
which you can actually

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.600
see a table that
somebody actually

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.516
computed this thing for
which you can actually

00:30:27.516 --> 00:30:30.430
draw the pdf and start computing
whatever probability you want

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.410
on them, then this
is what you want

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.110
to see at the right-hand side.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.500
This is any distribution.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.380
It's called pivotal.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.880
I think we've
mentioned that before.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.713
Pivotal means it does
not depend on anything

00:30:41.713 --> 00:30:43.610
that you don't know.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.616
And maybe it's easy to
compute those things.

00:30:45.616 --> 00:30:47.990
Probably, typically, you need
a computer to simulate them

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:50.985
for you because computing
probabilities for Gaussians

00:30:50.985 --> 00:30:51.860
is not an easy thing.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.985
We don't know how to solve
those integrals exactly,

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:56.520
we have to do it numerically.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:08.420
So now I want to do this test.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.950
My test statistic will
be declared to be what?

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:17.740
Well, I'm going
to reject if what

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.970
is larger than some number?

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.500
The absolute value of this guy.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.550
So my test statistic
is going to be

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:35.790
square root of n minus 0.5
divided by square root of xn

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.240
bar 1 minus xn bar.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.470
That's my test statistic,
absolute value of this guy,

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.900
because I want to reject either
when this guy is too large

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.150
or when this guy is too small.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.760
I don't know ahead
whether I'm going

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.470
to see p larger than
1/2 or less than 1/2.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:59.190
So now I need to compute c
such that the probability

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:05.210
that tn is larger than c.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:11.290
So that's the probability
under p, which is unknown.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:17.230
I want this probability to be
less than some level alpha,

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.410
asymptotically.

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:24.740
So I want the limit of this
guy to be less than alpha,

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.810
and that's the level of my test.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:32.010
So that's the given level.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.720
So I want this thing to happen.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.280
Now, what I know is
that this limit--

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.397
actually, I should say
given asymptotic level.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.130
So what is this thing?

00:32:54.300 --> 00:33:00.600
Well, OK, that's the
probability that something

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.000
that looks like under p.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.520
So under p, this guy--

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.730
so what I know is that
tn is square root of n

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:15.490
minus xn bar minus 0.5 divided
by square root of xn bar

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.700
1 minus xn bar exceeds.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.882
Is this true that
as n to infinity,

00:33:26.882 --> 00:33:28.840
this probability is the
same as the probability

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.460
that the absolute
value of a Gaussian

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.610
exceeds c of a
standard Gaussian?

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:34.351
Is this true?

00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:39.530
AUDIENCE: The absolute value
of the standard Gaussian.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.113
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Yeah, the absolute.

00:33:41.113 --> 00:33:43.830
So you're saying that this, as
n becomes large enough, this

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:48.500
should be the probability that
some absolute value of n01

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.898
exceeds c, right?

00:33:49.898 --> 00:33:51.990
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.780
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So I claim
that this is not correct.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.077
Somebody tell me why.

00:33:56.077 --> 00:33:57.360
AUDIENCE: Even in the
limit it's not correct?

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.651
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Even in
the limit, it's not correct.

00:34:03.164 --> 00:34:04.334
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:05.917
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
So what do you see?

00:34:05.917 --> 00:34:07.625
AUDIENCE: It's because,
at the beginning,

00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:11.368
we picked the worst possible
true parameter, 0.5.

00:34:11.368 --> 00:34:13.915
So we don't actually know
that this 0.5 is the mean.

00:34:13.915 --> 00:34:15.040
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Exactly.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.500
So we pick this 0.5 here,
but this is for any p.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.360
But what is the
only p I can get?

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.949
So what I want is that this
is true for all p in theta 0.

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:31.750
But the only p that's in theta
0 is actually p is equal to 0.5.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.780
So yes, what you
said was true, but it

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.130
required to specify
p to be equal to 0.5.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.409
So this, in general,
is not true.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:47.909
But it happens to be true if
p belongs to theta 0, which

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:53.489
is strictly equivalent
to p is equal to 0.5,

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:59.320
because theta 0 is really
just this one point, 0.5.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.820
So now, this becomes true.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.760
And so what I need to
do is to find c such

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.140
that this guy is equal to what?

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.020
I mean, let's just follow.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.950
So I want this to
be less than alpha.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.850
But then we said that
this was equal to this,

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:21.970
which is equal to this.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.960
So all I want is that this
guy is less than alpha.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.230
But we said we might as well
just make it equal to alpha

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.540
if you allow me to make
it as big as I want,

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.050
as long as it's less than alpha.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.790
AUDIENCE: So this
is a true statement.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.748
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So
this is a true statement.

00:35:35.748 --> 00:35:38.354
But it's under this condition.

00:35:38.354 --> 00:35:39.104
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:48.680
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So I'm
going to set it equal to alpha,

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:52.310
and then I'm going to
try to solve for c.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.540
So what I'm looking
for is a c such that

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.390
if I draw a standard Gaussian--

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:20.530
so that's pdf of some n01--

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.200
I want the probability that the
absolute value of my Gaussian

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.630
exceeding this guy--

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:29.350
so that means being
either here or here.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.220
So that's minus c and c.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:36.200
I want the sum of those two
things to be equal to alpha.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:53.570
So I want the sum of these
areas to equal alpha.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.240
So by symmetry,
each of them should

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.190
be equal to alpha over 2.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:08.310
And so what I'm looking for
is c such that the probability

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:15.410
that my n01 exceeds c, which
is just this area to the right,

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:20.830
now, equals alpha, which is
equivalent to taking c, which

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:26.020
is q equals alpha over 2,
and that's q alpha over 2

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.240
by definition of q alpha over 2.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.370
That's just what
q alpha over 2 is.

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:34.420
And that's what the tables at
the back of the book give you.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:42.400
Who has already seen a table
for Gaussian probabilities?

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.200
What it does, it's just a table.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.696
I mean, it's pretty ancient.

00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:47.320
I mean, of course,
you can actually ask

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.240
Google to do it for you now.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.180
I mean, it's basically
standard issue.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:56.110
But back in the day, they
actually had to look at tables.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:59.140
And since the values alphas
were pretty standard,

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.510
the values alpha that
people were requesting

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:04.810
were typically 1%,
5%, 10%, all you

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.000
could do is to compute
these different values

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.560
for different values of alpha.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.390
That was it.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:13.450
So there's really
not much to give you.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.750
So for the Gaussian,
I can tell you

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.210
that alpha is equal to--
if alpha is equal to 5%,

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:27.100
then q alpha over 2, q 2.5%
is equal to 1.96, for example.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.840
So those are just
fixed numbers that

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.030
are functions of the Gaussian.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.410
So everybody agrees?

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:37.443
We've done that before for
our confidence intervals.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.040
And so now we know
that if I actually

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:48.460
plug in this guy to be
q alpha over 2, then

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.430
this limit is actually
equal to alpha.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.247
And so now I've actually
constrained this.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:07.800
So q alpha over 2 here for alpha
equals 5%, as I said, is 1.96.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.790
So in the example 1, the
number that we found was 3.54,

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:18.800
I think, or something
like that, 3.55 for t.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:29.290
So if we scroll back
very quickly, 3.45--

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:30.980
that was example 1.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.770
Example two-- negative 0.77.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:40.970
So if I look at tn
in example 1, tn

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:46.040
was just the absolute
value of 3.45, which--

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.390
don't pull out your
calculators-- is equal to 3.45.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:54.500
Example 2, absolute
value of negative 0.77

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.050
was equal to 0.77.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.450
And so all I need to
check is, is this number

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.610
larger or smaller than 1.96?

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:06.530
That's what my
test ends up being.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:12.860
So in example 1,
3.45 being larger

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:18.885
than 1.96, that
means that I reject.

00:40:18.885 --> 00:40:22.790
Fairness of my
coins, in example 2,

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:27.230
0.77 being smaller than 1.96--

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.370
what do I do?

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:30.270
I fail to reject.

00:40:44.084 --> 00:40:45.000
So here is a question.

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:54.270
In example 1, for what level
alpha would psi alpha--

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.090
OK, so here, what's
going to happen

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:04.350
if I start decreasing my level?

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:07.020
When I decrease my
level, I'm actually

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.100
making this area
smaller and smaller,

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:13.360
which means that I push
this c to the right.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.080
So now I'm asking,
what is the smallest c

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.360
I should pick so that now,
I actually do not reject h0?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:29.642
What is the smallest c
I should be taking here?

00:41:29.642 --> 00:41:30.600
What is the smallest c?

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.300
So c here, in the example I
gave you for 5%, was 1.96.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:49.330
What is the smallest c I
should be taking so that now,

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:50.730
this inequality is reversed?

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.990
3.45.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:58.900
I ask only trivial
questions, don't be worried.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.890
So 3.45 is the smallest
c that I'm actually

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.870
willing to tolerate.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:07.870
So let's say this was my 5%.

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.730
If this was 2.5--

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.230
if here, let's say,
in this picture,

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:16.490
alpha is 5%, that means
maybe I need to push here.

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.150
And this number should be what?

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.580
So this is going to be 1.96.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:26.460
And this number here is going
to be 3.45, clearly to scale.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:30.330
And so now, what I
want to ask you is,

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:33.570
well, there's two ways I can
understand this number 3.45.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.120
It is the number
3.45, but I can also

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.340
try to understand what is the
area to the right of this guy.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.780
And if I understand what the
area to the right of this guy

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:47.700
is, this is actually
some alpha prime over 2.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.560
And that means
that if I actually

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.840
fix this level alpha
prime, that would

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.260
be exactly the tipping
point at which I would

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.420
go from accepting to rejecting.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.390
So I knew, in terms of
absolute thresholds,

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.300
3.45 is the trivial
answer to the question.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.040
That's the tipping
point, because I'm

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.350
comparing a number to 3.45.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.330
But now, if I try
to map this back

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.570
and understand what level
would have been giving me

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:18.910
this particular
tipping point, that's

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.430
a number between 0 and 1.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:25.830
The smaller the number, the
larger this number here,

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.280
which means that the more
evidence I have in my data

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.990
against h0.

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:36.140
And so this number is actually
something called the p-value.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.640
And so saying, for
example 2, there's

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.880
the tipping point
alpha at which I

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.150
go from failing to
reject to rejecting.

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:47.990
And that's exactly the number,
the area under the curve,

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:53.990
such that here, I see 0.77.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.710
And this is this alpha
prime prime over 2.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.090
Alpha prime prime is
clearly larger than 5%.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.630
So what's the advantage of
thinking and mapping back

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.170
these numbers?

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:11.790
Well, now, I'm actually going
to spit out some number which

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:12.900
is between 0 and 1.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:18.827
And that should be the only
scale you should have in mind.

00:44:18.827 --> 00:44:20.410
Remember, we discussed
that last time.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:22.750
I was like, well, if
I actually spit out

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:26.200
a number which is 3.45,
maybe you can try to think,

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.230
is 3.45 a large
number for a Gaussian?

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.897
That's a number.

00:44:29.897 --> 00:44:32.355
But if I had another random
variable that was not Gaussian,

00:44:32.355 --> 00:44:33.910
maybe it was a
double exponential,

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:36.220
you would have to have
another scale in your mind.

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:42.880
Is 3.45 so large that
it's unlikely for it

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.680
to come from a
double exponential.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.300
If I had a gamma distribution--

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.508
I can think of any distribution,
and then that means,

00:44:48.508 --> 00:44:51.040
for each distribution, you would
have to have scale in mind.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.290
So of course, you can have
the Gaussian scale in mind.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.270
I mean, I have the
Gaussian scale in mind.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:59.740
But then, if I map it back into
this number between 0 and 1,

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.260
all the distributions
play the same role.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.920
So whether I'm talking about
if my limiting distribution is

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.874
normal or exponential or
gamma, or whatever you want,

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:11.290
for all these guys,
I'm just going

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:13.450
to map it into one
number between 0 and 1.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:16.210
Small number means lots
of evidence against h1.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:21.040
Large number means lots
of evidence against h0.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.210
Small number means very
few evidence against h9.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.800
And this is the only number
you need to keep in mind.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.710
And the question
is, am I willing

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:34.570
to tolerate this number between
5%, 6%, or maybe 10%, 12%?

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:37.720
And this is the only scale
you have to have in mind.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.030
And this scale is the
scale of p-values.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:48.120
So the p-value is the tipping
point in terms of alpha.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:52.050
In words, I can make it
formal, because tipping point,

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.510
as far as I know, is
not a mathematical term.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:58.950
So a p-value of a
test is the smallest,

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:01.740
potentially asymptotic level
if I talk about an asymptotic

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.910
p-value--

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.520
and that's what we do when we
talk about central theorem--

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.410
at which the test rejects h0.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:10.820
If I were to go any smaller--

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.750
sorry, it's the smallest level--

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.360
yeah, if I were
to go any smaller,

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.250
I would fail to reject.

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:25.200
The smaller the level, the less
likely it is for me to reject.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.710
And if I were to
go any smaller, I

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:31.010
would start failing to reject.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:33.210
And so it is a random number.

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:35.790
It depends on what
I actually observe.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.240
So here, of course, I
instantiated those two numbers,

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.202
3.45 and 0.77, as realizations
of random variables.

00:46:44.202 --> 00:46:46.410
But if you think of those
as being the random numbers

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:50.190
before I see my data,
this was a random number,

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.550
and therefore, the area under
the curve to the right of it

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:55.830
is also a random area.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:58.920
If this thing fluctuates,
then the area under the curve

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.090
fluctuates.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.150
And that's what the p-value is.

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:05.950
That's what-- what is his name?

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:06.780
I forget.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.470
John Oliver talks about when
he talks about p-hacking.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:14.150
And so we talked about
this in the first lecture.

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:18.194
So p-hacking is, how do I
do-- oh, if I'm a scientist,

00:47:18.194 --> 00:47:20.360
do I want to see a small
p-value or a large p-value?

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.027
AUDIENCE: Small.

00:47:21.027 --> 00:47:22.359
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Small, right?

00:47:22.359 --> 00:47:24.960
Scientists want to see small
p-values because small p-values

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.020
equals rejecting,
which equals discovery,

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.230
which equals publications,
which equals promotion.

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:34.550
So that's what
people want to see.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:37.970
So people are tempted
to see small p-values.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:41.660
And what's called p-hacking
is, well, find a way to cheat.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.450
Maybe look at your data,
formulate your hypothesis

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:49.840
in such a way that you will
actually have a smaller

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.375
p-value than you should have.

00:47:51.375 --> 00:47:53.000
So here, for example,
there's one thing

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.958
I did not insist on
because, again, this is not

00:47:54.958 --> 00:47:57.200
a particular course on
statistical thinking,

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.420
but one thing that
we implicitly did

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:04.750
was set those theta 0 and
theta 1 ahead of time.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:08.378
I fixed them, and I'm
trying to test this.

00:48:08.378 --> 00:48:11.280
This is to be contrasted
with the following approach.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.350
I draw my data.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.224
So I draw--

00:48:15.224 --> 00:48:16.890
I run this experiment,
which is probably

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:18.840
going to get me a
publication in nature.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:23.010
I'm trying to test
if a coin is fair.

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:24.760
And I draw my data,
and I see that there's

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:31.020
13 out of 30 of my
observations that are heads.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.610
That means that,
from this data, it

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.850
looks like p is less than 1/2.

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:38.560
So if I look at
this data and then

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.870
decide that my alternative
is not p not equal to 1/2,

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:47.300
but rather p less than
1/2, that's p-hacking.

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.550
I'm actually making my
p-value strictly smaller

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.130
by first looking at the
data, and then deciding what

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.660
my alternative is going to be.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:58.770
And that's cheating, because
all the things we did,

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:02.970
we're assuming that this
0.5, or the alternative,

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.240
was actually a fixed--
everything was deterministic.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.164
The only randomness
came from the data.

00:49:07.164 --> 00:49:08.580
But if I start
looking at the data

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.130
and designing my experiment
or my alternatives

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.232
and null hypothesis
based on the data,

00:49:13.232 --> 00:49:15.690
it's as if I started putting
randomness all over the place.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:18.300
And then I cannot control it
because I don't know how it

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:22.960
just intermingles
with each other.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.170
So that was for the
John Oliver moment.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.340
So the p-value is nice.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.500
So maybe I mentioned
that, before, my wife

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.610
works in market research.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.240
And maybe every two
years, she seems

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.370
to run into a statistician
in the hallway,

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:45.070
and she comes home and says,
what is a p-value again?

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:48.190
And for her, a p-value
is just the number

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.080
in an Excel spreadsheet.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.360
And actually, small equals
good and large equals bad.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.820
And that's all she needs
to know at this point.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:01.310
Actually, they do the job
for her-- small is green,

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:02.290
large is red.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:06.590
And so for her, a p-value
is just green or red.

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:08.740
But so what she's
really implicitly doing

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.980
with this color code is just
applying the golden rule.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:16.210
What the statisticians do for
her in the Excel spreadsheet

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.760
is that they take the
numbers for the p-values that

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.440
are less than some fixed level.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.390
So depending on the field
in which she works--

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.410
so she works for
pharmaceutical companies--

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:26.560
so the p-values are
typically compared--

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:31.030
the tests are usually performed
at level 1%, rather than 5%.

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:33.040
So 5% is maybe
your gold standard

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.550
if you're doing
sociology or trying to--

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.970
I don't know-- release
a new blueberry flavor

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:40.990
for your toothpaste.

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:43.630
Something that's not going
to change the life of people,

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.040
maybe you're going to run at 5%.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.150
It's OK to make a mistake.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:47.858
See, people are just
going to feel gross,

00:50:47.858 --> 00:50:50.770
but that's about
it, whereas here,

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:53.296
if you have this p-value
which is less than 1%,

00:50:53.296 --> 00:50:55.420
it might be more important
for some drug discovery,

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.550
for example.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:59.810
And so let's say you run at 1%.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.470
And so what they do in
this Excel spreadsheet is

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:05.800
that all the numbers that
are below 1% show up in green

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.010
and all the numbers that
are above 1% show up in red.

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:09.790
And that's it.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:11.710
That's just applying
the golden rule.

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:13.640
If the number is green, reject.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.024
If the number is
red, fail to reject.

00:51:18.024 --> 00:51:18.524
Yeah?

00:51:18.524 --> 00:51:20.512
AUDIENCE: So going
back to example 2

00:51:20.512 --> 00:51:23.991
where the prior
example where you

00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:26.476
want to cheat by
looking after beta

00:51:26.476 --> 00:51:32.450
and then formulating, say,
theta 1 to be p less than 1/2.

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:33.914
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.

00:51:33.914 --> 00:51:38.306
AUDIENCE: So how would
you achieve your goal

00:51:38.306 --> 00:51:40.804
by changing the theta--

00:51:40.804 --> 00:51:42.470
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
By achieving my goal,

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.826
you mean letting
ethics aside, right?

00:51:45.826 --> 00:51:46.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.930
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Ah,
you want to be published.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:48.555
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:48.555 --> 00:51:54.410
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: [LAUGHS]
So let me teach you how, then.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:58.160
So well, here, what do you do?

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.380
You want to-- at
the end of the day,

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.200
a test is only telling you
whether you found evidence

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.150
in your data that h1 was more
likely than h0, basically.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:12.830
How do you make h1 more likely?

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:18.500
Well, you just basically
target h1 to be what it is--

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.740
what the data is going to
make it more likely to be.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:26.210
So if, for example, I say
h1 can be on both sides,

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:29.177
then my data is going to have to
take into account fluctuations

00:52:29.177 --> 00:52:31.760
on both sides, and I'm going to
lose a factor or two somewhere

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.690
because things
are not symmetric.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:38.240
Here is the ultimate
way of making this work.

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.920
I'm going back to my
example of flipping coins.

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.790
And now, so here,
what I did is, I said,

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:54.690
oh, this number 0.43 is
actually smaller than 0.5,

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:56.640
so I'm just going to
test whether I'm 0.5

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.780
or I'm less than 0.5.

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.050
But here is something
that I can promise you

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:04.380
I did not make the
computation will reject.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.180
So here, this one actually--

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.280
yeah, this one fails to reject.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.080
So here is one that
will certainly reject.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:24.950
h0 is 0.5, p is
0.5, h1p is 0.43.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:27.830
Now, you can try,
but I can promise you

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:32.030
that your data will tell you
that h1 is the right one.

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:36.110
I mean, you can check very
quickly that this is really

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:37.780
extremely likely to happen.

00:53:40.795 --> 00:53:41.670
Actually, what am I--

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:52.220
no, actually, that's
not true, because here,

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.330
the test that I derive that's
based on this kind of stuff,

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:59.960
here at some point,
somewhere under some layers,

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:04.450
I assume that all our tests
are going to have this form.

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.030
But here, this is
only when you're

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:09.030
trying to test one region versus
another region next to it,

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:11.030
or one point versus
a region around it,

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:13.140
or something like this,
whereas for this guy,

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:15.640
there's another test
that could come up with,

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.720
which is, what is the
probability that I get 0.43,

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.786
and what is the
probability that I get 0.5?

00:54:21.786 --> 00:54:23.160
Now, what I'm
going to do is, I'm

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.680
going to just conclude
it's whichever

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.607
has the largest probability.

00:54:27.607 --> 00:54:29.940
Then maybe I'm going to have
to make some adjustments so

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:32.310
that the level is actually 5%.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.690
But I can make this happen.

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:36.890
I can make the level be 5%
and always conclude this guy,

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:38.610
but I would have to
use a different test.

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:40.290
Now, the test that
I described, again,

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.870
those tn larger
than c are built in

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:46.170
to be tests that are resilient
to these kind of manipulations

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.840
because they're
oblivious towards what

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.490
the alternative looks like.

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:51.960
I mean, they're just saying
it's either to the left

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.334
or to the right,
but whether it's

00:54:53.334 --> 00:54:55.440
a point or an entire
half-line doesn't matter.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.200
So if you try to
look at your data

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.520
and just put the data itself
into your hypothesis testing

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:10.745
problem, then you're failing
the statistical principle.

00:55:10.745 --> 00:55:12.120
And that's what
people are doing.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.572
I mean, how can I check?

00:55:13.572 --> 00:55:15.030
I mean, of course,
here, it's going

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:16.488
to be pretty blatant
if you publish

00:55:16.488 --> 00:55:17.820
a paper that looks like this.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.650
But there's ways to
do it differently.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:21.734
For example, one way to
do it is to just do mult--

00:55:21.734 --> 00:55:23.233
so typically, what
people do is they

00:55:23.233 --> 00:55:24.780
do multiple hypothesis testing.

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.570
They're doing 100
tests at a time.

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:30.714
Then you have random
fluctuations every time.

00:55:30.714 --> 00:55:32.130
And so they just
pick the one that

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.422
has the random fluctuations
that go their way.

00:55:34.422 --> 00:55:36.130
I mean, sometimes it's
going in your way,

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:37.879
and sometimes it's
going the opposite way,

00:55:37.879 --> 00:55:39.780
so you just pick the
one that works for you.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.990
We'll talk about multiple
hypothesis testing soon

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:44.860
if you want to increase
your publication count.

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:50.820
There's actually papers--

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:53.040
I think it was a big
news that some papers,

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.720
I think, in psychology
or psychometrics

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.900
papers that actually refused
to publish p-values now.

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:05.880
Where were we?

00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.230
Here's the golden rule.

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:11.970
So one thing that I like
to show is this thing,

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:14.340
just so you know how you
apply the golden rule

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.050
and how you apply
the standard tests.

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:25.450
So the standard paradigm
is the following.

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:29.430
You have a black box,
which is your test.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:32.230
For my wife, this is the
4th floor of the building.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:33.840
That's where the
statisticians sit.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.980
What she sends there is data--

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:41.140
let's say x1 xn.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:43.870
And she says, well, this
one is about toothpaste,

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:45.190
so here's a level--

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:47.220
let's say 5%.

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:50.890
What the 4th floor brings
back is that answer-- yes,

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:53.290
no, green, red, just an answer.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:59.670
So that's the standard testing.

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:02.040
You just feed it the data
and the level at which you

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.330
want to perform the
test, maybe asymptotic,

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:06.580
and it spits out
a yes, no answer.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:15.340
What p-value does, you just
feed it the data itself.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:22.210
And what it spits
out is the p-value.

00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:23.870
And now it's just up to you.

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:27.910
I mean, hopefully your brain
has the computational power

00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:31.090
of deciding whether a number
is larger or smaller than 5%

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:33.790
without having to call
a statistician for this.

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:35.360
And that's what it does.

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.600
So now we're on 1 scale.

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.500
Now, I see some of you nodding
when I talk about p-hacking,

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.095
so that means you've
seen p-values.

00:57:43.095 --> 00:57:45.220
If you've seen more than
100 p-values in your life,

00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.330
you have an entire scale.

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:50.770
A good p-value is less
than 10 to the minus 4.

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:53.440
That's the ultimate sweet spot.

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.830
Actually, statistical
software spits out

00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:01.370
an output which says less
than 10 to the minus 4.

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:02.830
But then maybe
you want a p-val--

00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:08.960
if you tell me my p-value
was 4.65, then I will say,

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.970
you've been doing some
p-hacking until you found

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:12.680
a number that was below 5%.

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.660
That's typically
what people will do.

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.590
But if you tell me--

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:18.800
if you're doing the
test, if you're saying,

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.590
I published my
result, my test at 5%

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:27.020
said yes, that means that
maybe you're p-value was 4.99,

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.762
or you're p-value was 10 to
the minus 4, I will never know.

00:58:29.762 --> 00:58:31.220
I will never know
how much evidence

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.310
you had against the null.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:36.260
But if you tell me
what the p-value is,

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:37.492
I can make my own decision.

00:58:37.492 --> 00:58:39.450
I don't have to tell me
whether it's a yes, no.

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:42.620
You tell me it's 4.99, I'm
going to say, well, maybe yes,

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:45.120
but I'm going to take
it with a grain of salt.

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.100
And so that's why p-values are
good numbers to have in mind.

00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:51.940
Now, I should, as if it
was like an old trick

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.310
that you start mastering
when you're 45 years old.

00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:57.490
No, it's just, how small is
the number between 0 and 1?

00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:00.670
That's really what
you need to know.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.385
Maybe on the log scale--
if it's 10 to the minus 1,

00:59:03.385 --> 00:59:07.240
10 to the minus 2, 10 to
the minus 3, et cetera--

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.790
that's probably the extent
of the mastery here.

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:16.420
So this traditional standard
paradigm that I showed

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:21.160
is actually commonly referred to
as the Neyman-Pearson paradigm.

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.320
So here, it says name
Neyman-Pearson's theory,

00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.970
so there's an entire
theory that comes with it.

00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:27.130
But it's really a paradigm.

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:29.296
It's a way of thinking about
hypothesis testing that

00:59:29.296 --> 00:59:32.530
says, well, if I'm not going
to be able to optimize both

00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:34.750
my type I and type II
error, I'm actually

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:37.780
going to lock in my type
I error below some level

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:42.550
and just minimize the type II
error under this constraint.

00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:45.100
That's what the
Neyman-Pearson paradigm is.

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.490
And it sort of makes sense for
hypothesis testing problems.

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:50.560
Now, if you were doing
some other applications

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.210
with multi-objective
optimization,

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:54.310
you would maybe come up
with something different.

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:58.600
For example, machine learning
is not performing typically

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.120
under Neyman-Pearson paradigm.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.360
So if you do spam filtering,
you could say, well,

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.650
I want to constrain the
probability as much as I can

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.810
of taking somebody's
important emails

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:14.590
and throwing them out as spam,
and under this constraint,

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:17.350
not send too much
spam to that person.

01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:19.290
That sort of makes
sense for spams.

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:23.620
Now, if you're labeling cats
versus dogs, that's probably

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:27.100
not like you want to make
sure that no more than 5%

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.670
of the dogs are labeled
cat because, I mean,

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.469
it doesn't matter.

01:00:31.469 --> 01:00:33.010
So what you typically
do is, you just

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:34.810
sum up the two types
of errors you can make,

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:36.851
and you minimize the sum
without putting any more

01:00:36.851 --> 01:00:38.260
weight on one or the other.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.880
So here's an example where doing
a binary decision, one or two

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.070
of the errors you
can make, you don't

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:47.840
have to actually be like that.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.300
So this example here, I did not.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:55.200
The trivial test psi is
equal to 0, what was it

01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.350
in the US trial court example?

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:03.530
What is psi equals 0?

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:05.500
That was concluding
always to the null.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.000
What was the null?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:08.930
AUDIENCE: Innocent.

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.388
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Innocent, right?

01:01:10.388 --> 01:01:11.340
That's the status quo.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:14.790
So that means that this
guy never rejects h0.

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:16.910
Everybody's going away free.

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.800
So you're sure
you're not actually

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:25.250
going against the constitution
because alpha is 0%, which

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:26.940
is certainly less than 5%.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:30.260
But the power, the fact
that a lot of criminals

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:34.130
go back outside
in the free world

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:37.580
is actually formulated in
terms of low power, which,

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.100
in this case, is actually 0.

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.690
Again, the power is the
number between 0 and 1.

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:43.100
Close to 0, good.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.227
Close to 1, bad.

01:01:45.227 --> 01:01:51.510
Now, what is the
definition of the p-value?

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:54.300
That's going to be
something-- it's a mouthful.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.520
The definition of the
p-value is a mouthful.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.240
It's the tipping point.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.620
It is the smallest level at
which blah, blah, blah, blah,

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.120
blah.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.410
It's complicated to remember it.

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:09.910
Now, I think that my 6th
explanation, my wife,

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:12.994
after saying, oh, so it's the
probability of making an error,

01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:14.910
I said, yeah, that's the
probability of making

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:16.870
an error because,
of course, she can

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:22.270
think probability of making an
error small, good, large, bad.

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:24.940
So that's actually a
good way to remember.

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.521
I'm pretty sure
that at least 50%

01:02:26.521 --> 01:02:28.270
of people who are using
p-values out there

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:31.220
think that the p-value is the
probability of making an error.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.040
Now, for all
matters of purposes,

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.620
if your goal is to just
threshold the p-value,

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.900
this is OK to have this in y.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.220
But when comes, at
least until December 22,

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.830
I would recommend trying
to actually memorize

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:46.780
the right definition
for the p-value.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.240
So the idea, again,
is fix the level

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.112
and try to optimize the power.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.370
So we're going to try to compute
some p-values from now on.

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.900
How do you compute the p-value?

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:10.670
Well, you can actually see it
from this picture over there.

01:03:14.047 --> 01:03:16.130
One thing I didn't show
on this picture-- so here,

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:19.010
it was my q alpha over
2 that had alpha here,

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:21.230
alpha over 2 here.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.580
That was my q alpha over 2.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.870
And I said, if tn is to
the right of this guy,

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:27.746
I'm going to reject.

01:03:27.746 --> 01:03:29.120
If tn is to the
left of this guy,

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.550
I'm going to fail to reject.

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:34.720
Pictorially, you can actually
represent the p-value.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.770
It's when I replace
this guy by tn itself.

01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:44.770
Sorry, that's p-value over 2.

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:47.360
No, actually, that's p-value.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.290
So let me just keep it like
that and put the absolute value

01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:51.790
here.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:58.560
So if you replace the role of
q alpha over 2, by your test

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.630
statistic, the area
under the curve

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:03.160
is actually the
p-value itself up

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.730
to a scale because of
the symmetric thing.

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:09.280
So there's a good way
to see, pictorially,

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.930
what the p-value is.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:13.750
It's just the probability
that some Gaussians--

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:17.680
it's just the probability that
some absolute value of n01

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.370
exceeds tn.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.384
That's what the p-value is.

01:04:24.384 --> 01:04:26.300
Now, this guy has nothing
to do with this guy,

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:32.680
so this is really just 1
minus the Gaussian cdf of tn,

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.650
and that's it.

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:36.460
So that's how I would
compute p-values.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.210
Now, as I said, the
p-value is a beauty

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:43.330
because you don't
have to understand

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:47.050
the fact that your limiting
distribution is a Gaussian.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.264
It's already factored
in this construction.

01:04:49.264 --> 01:04:50.680
The fact that I'm
actually looking

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.880
at this cumulative distribution
function of a standard Gaussian

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.302
makes my p-value
automatically adjust to what

01:04:57.302 --> 01:04:58.510
the limiting distribution is.

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:00.460
And if this was the
cumulative distribution

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:03.520
function of a
exponential, I would just

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.055
have a different function here
denoted by f, for example,

01:05:06.055 --> 01:05:07.866
and I would just compute
a different value.

01:05:07.866 --> 01:05:10.240
But in the end, regardless of
what the limiting value is,

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.540
my p-value would still be
a number between 0 and 1.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:16.650
And so to illustrate
that, let's look

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:20.340
at other weird distributions
that we could get in place

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.620
of the standard Gaussian.

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.980
And we're not going to see
many, but we'll see one.

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.311
And it's not called the
chi squared distribution.

01:05:27.311 --> 01:05:29.310
It's actually called the
Student's distribution,

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:31.920
but it involves the chi
squared distribution

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.320
as a building block.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.820
So I don't know if my phonetics
are not really right there,

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:43.050
so I try to say, well,
it's chi squared.

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:47.190
Maybe it's "kee" squared
above, in Canada, who knows.

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:50.589
So for a positive integer,
so there's only 1 parameter.

01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:52.380
So for the Gaussian,
you have 2 parameters,

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.180
which are mu and sigma squared.

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.350
Those are real numbers.

01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.090
Sigma squared's positive.

01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:59.280
Here, I have 1
integer parameter.

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:05.160
Then the chi
squared distribution

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.642
with d degrees of freedom--

01:06:07.642 --> 01:06:09.600
so the parameter is called
a degree of freedom,

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.700
just like mu is called the
expected value and sigma

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:12.600
squared is called the variance.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.370
Here, we call it
degrees of freedom.

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:17.290
You don't have to
really understand why.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.800
So that's the law
that you would get--

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.300
that's the random
variable you would

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:26.260
get if you were to sum d
squares of independent standard

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:26.890
Gaussians.

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:33.680
So I take the square of an
independent random Gaussian.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.730
I take another one.

01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:36.380
I sum them, and
that's a chi squared

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.370
with 2 degrees of freedom.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.740
That's how you get it.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:46.960
Now, I could define it using its
probability density function.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.150
I mean, after all,
this is the sum

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:51.730
of positive random
variables, so it

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:53.800
is a positive random variable.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.680
It has a density on
the positive real line.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:03.420
And the pdf of chi squared with
d degrees of freedom is what?

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.900
Well, it's fd of x is--

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:13.930
what is it?-- x to the d/2
minus 1 e to the minus x/2.

01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:16.510
And then here, I
have a gamma of d/2.

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:20.470
And the other one is, I
think, 2 to the d/2 minus 1.

01:07:23.158 --> 01:07:26.530
No, 2 to the d/2.

01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:28.690
That's what it is.

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:30.580
That's the density.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.110
If you are very
good at probability,

01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:33.640
you can make the
change of variable

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.789
and write your Jacobian
and do all this stuff

01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:37.330
and actually check
that this is true.

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:40.540
I do not recommend doing that.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:44.070
So this is the density, but it's
better understood like that.

01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:46.270
I think it was just
something that you

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.160
built from standard Gaussian.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.800
So for example, an
example of a chi

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.870
squared with 2
degrees of freedom

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:54.790
is actually the following thing.

01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:56.860
Let's assume I have
a target like this.

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:02.960
And I don't aim very well.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.996
And I'm trying to
hit the center.

01:08:05.996 --> 01:08:07.370
And I'm not going
to have, maybe,

01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:10.380
a deviation, which is
standard Gaussian left, right

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:16.520
and standard Gaussian
north, south.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.710
So I'm throwing,
and then I'm here,

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:22.279
and I'm claiming that this
number here, by Pythagoras

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:24.290
theorem, the square
distance here

01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:25.790
is the sum of this
square distance

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:30.060
here, which is the square
of a Gaussian by assumption.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.854
This is plus the square
of this distance,

01:08:31.854 --> 01:08:34.020
which is the square of
another independent Gaussian.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.486
I assume those are independent.

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:37.819
And so the square distance
from this point to this point

01:08:37.819 --> 01:08:40.580
is the chi squared with
2 degrees of freedom.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:45.029
So this guy here is n01 squared.

01:08:45.029 --> 01:08:48.140
This is n01 squared.

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.120
And so this guy here,
this distance here,

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.285
is chi squared with
2 degrees of freedom.

01:08:53.285 --> 01:08:54.410
I mean the square distance.

01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:58.569
I'm talking about
square distances here.

01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:02.380
So now you can see that,
actually, Pythagoras

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:05.899
is basically why chi
squared [? arrives. ?]

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:07.810
That's why it has its own name.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:10.479
I mean, I could define
this random variable.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.075
I mean, it's actually
a gamma distribution.

01:09:13.075 --> 01:09:15.700
It's a special case of something
called the gamma distribution.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.658
The fact that the special
case has its own name

01:09:17.658 --> 01:09:19.075
is because there's
many times what

01:09:19.075 --> 01:09:20.491
we're going to
take sum of squares

01:09:20.491 --> 01:09:23.140
of independent Gaussians because
Gaussians, the sum of squares

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.330
is really the norm, the
Euclidean norm squared,

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:26.830
just by Pythagoras theorem.

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.319
If I'm in higher
dimension, I can

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.370
start to sum more
squared coordinates,

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:32.119
and I'm going to measure
the norm squared.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.880
So if you want to draw this
picture, it looks like this.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.620
Again, it's the sum
of positive numbers,

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.000
so it's going to be
on 0 plus infinity.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.680
That's fd.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:52.850
And so f1 looks like
this, f2 looks like this.

01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:57.370
So the tails become heavier
and heavier as d increases.

01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:00.560
And then at [INAUDIBLE]
to 3, it starts

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.960
to have a different shape.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.210
It starts from 0 and
it looks like this.

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:06.850
And then, as d
increases, it's basically

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:09.210
as if you were to push
this thing to the right.

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:14.979
It's just like, psh, so it's
just falling like a big blob.

01:10:14.979 --> 01:10:16.270
Everybody sees what's going on?

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:19.637
So there's just this fat
thing that's just going there.

01:10:19.637 --> 01:10:21.470
What is the expected
value of a chi squared?

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:30.900
So it's the expected
value of the sum

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:37.938
of Gaussian random
variables, squared.

01:10:37.938 --> 01:10:40.358
I know I said that.

01:10:40.358 --> 01:10:42.790
AUDIENCE: So it's the sum of
their second moments, right?

01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:43.956
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Which is?

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.570
Those are n01.

01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:50.386
AUDIENCE: It's
like-- oh, I see, 1.

01:10:50.386 --> 01:10:51.386
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.

01:10:51.386 --> 01:10:53.294
AUDIENCE: So n times
1 or d times 1.

01:10:53.294 --> 01:10:55.070
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Yeah, which is d.

01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:56.990
So one thing you
can check quickly

01:10:56.990 --> 01:11:00.280
is that the expected value
of a chi squared is d.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.280
And so you see, that's why the
mass is shifting to the right

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.240
as d increases.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.350
It's just going there.

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:08.320
Actually, the variance
is also increasing.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.180
The variance is 2d.

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.130
So this is one thing.

01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:19.230
And so why do we
care about this?

01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:22.640
In basic statistics,
it's not like we actually

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.140
have statistics much
about throwing darts

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:28.590
at high-dimensional boards.

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:31.380
So what's happening is that if
I look at the sample variance,

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:36.590
the average of the sum of
squared centered by their mean,

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:38.480
then I can actually
expend this as the sum

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.320
of the squares minus
the average squared

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.680
It's just the same
trick that we have

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.360
for the variance-- second moment
minus first moment square.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.785
And then I claim that
Cochran's theorem--

01:11:53.785 --> 01:11:56.640
and I will tell you in a second
what Cochran's theorem tells me

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.390
is that this sample
variance is actually--

01:11:58.390 --> 01:12:01.330
so if I had only this--

01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:04.560
look at those guys.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.170
Those guys are Gaussian
with mean mu and variance

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:08.370
sigma squared.

01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:13.290
Think for 1 second mu being
0 and sigma squared being 1.

01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:16.920
Now, this part would be a
chi squared with n degrees

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.162
of freedom divided by n.

01:12:19.162 --> 01:12:21.300
Now I get another
thing here, which

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.850
is the square of something that
looks like a Gaussian as well.

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:27.750
So it looks like I have
something else here, which

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:29.580
looks also like a chi squared.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.890
Now, Cochran's theorem is
essentially telling you

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:35.130
that those things
are independent,

01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:39.720
and so that in a way, you can
think of those guys as being,

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.780
here, n degrees of freedom
minus 1 degree of freedom.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:47.820
Now, here, as I said, this
does not mean 0 and variance 1.

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.730
The fact that it's not
mean 0 is not a problem

01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:54.790
because I can remove the mean
here and remove the mean here.

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.130
And so this thing has
the same distribution,

01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:59.100
regardless of what
the actual mean is.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.600
So without loss of
generality, I can

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.097
assume that mu is equal to 0.

01:13:02.097 --> 01:13:03.930
Now, the variance, I'm
going to have to pay,

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:06.660
because if I multiply
all these numbers by 10,

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.647
then this sn is going
to multiplied by 100.

01:13:09.647 --> 01:13:11.730
So this thing is going to
scale with the variance.

01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:13.813
And not surprisingly, it's
scaling like the square

01:13:13.813 --> 01:13:15.550
of the variance.

01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:18.120
So if I look at sn,
it's distributed

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.960
as sigma squared
times the chi squared

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.060
with n minus 1 degrees
of freedom divided by n.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:28.230
And we don't really write
that, because a chi squared

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:30.650
times sigma squared divided
by n is not a distribution,

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:32.292
so we put everything
to the left,

01:13:32.292 --> 01:13:34.500
and we say that this is
actually a chi squared with n

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.880
minus 1 degrees of freedom.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.570
So here, I'm actually
dropping a fact on you,

01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:43.810
but you can see
the building block.

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:46.750
What is the thing that's
fuzzy at this point,

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:48.820
but the rest should be
crystal clear to you?

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:52.060
The thing that's fuzzy is
that removing this squared guy

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:55.770
here is actually removing
1 degree of freedom.

01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:59.122
That should be weird, but that's
what Cochran's theorem tells.

01:13:59.122 --> 01:14:00.800
It's essentially
stating something

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.760
about orthogonality of
subspaces with the span

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.580
of the constant vector,
something like that.

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.770
So you don't have to
think about it too much,

01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:11.630
but that's what it's telling me.

01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:15.170
But the rest, if you plug in--
so the scaling in sigma squared

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:18.450
and in n, so that should
be completely clear to you.

01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:20.810
So in particular, if
I remove that part,

01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:24.950
it should be clear to you
that this thing, if mean is 0,

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:27.240
this thing is
actually distributed.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.153
Well, if mu is 0, what is
the distribution of this guy?

01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:37.739
So I remove that
part, just this part.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.700
So I have xi, which
are n0 sigma squared.

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.505
And I'm asking, what is the
distribution of 1/n sum from i

01:14:53.505 --> 01:14:57.382
equal 1 to n of xi squared?

01:14:57.382 --> 01:15:00.350
So it is the sum of their IID.

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:03.620
So it's the sum of independent
Gaussians, but not standard.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.300
So the first thing
to make them standard

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.450
is that I divide all of
them by sigma squared.

01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:17.050
Now, this guy is of the form
zi squared where zi is n01.

01:15:20.710 --> 01:15:25.740
So now, this thing here
has what distribution?

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.420
AUDIENCE: Chi squared n.

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:30.198
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Chi squared n.

01:15:30.198 --> 01:15:33.450
And now, sigma squared over
n times chi squared n--

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:35.940
so if I have sigma squared
divided by n times chi

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.830
squared--

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:41.970
sorry, so n times n
divided by sigma squared.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:45.570
So if I take this
thing and I multiply it

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:48.360
by n divided by sigma squared,
it means I remove this term,

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.860
and now I am left
with a chi squared

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.130
with n degrees of freedom.

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:55.320
Now, the effect of centering
with the sample mean here

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.450
is only to lose 1
degree of freedom.

01:15:57.450 --> 01:15:58.108
That's it.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.210
So if I want to do a test
about variance, since this

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:08.000
is supposedly a good
estimator of variance,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.880
this could be my
pivotal distribution.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.710
This could play the
role of a Gaussian.

01:16:12.710 --> 01:16:16.100
If I want to know if my variance
is equal to 1 or larger than 1,

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:21.720
I could actually build a test
based on this only statement

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:23.910
and test if the variance
is larger than 1 or not.

01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:25.451
Now, this is not
asymptotic because I

01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:28.470
started with the very
assumption that my data was

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:29.160
Gaussian itself.

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:33.830
Now, just a side
remark-- you can

01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:37.220
check that this chi squared 2,
2 is an exponential with 1/2

01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:38.990
degrees of freedom,
which is certainly not

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:42.350
clear from the fact that
z1 squared plus z2 squared

01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:44.690
is a chi squared with
2 degrees of freedom.

01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:46.440
if I give you the
sum of the square

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:50.540
of 2 independent Gaussian, this
is actually an exponential.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.140
That's not super clear, right?

01:16:53.140 --> 01:17:00.260
But if you look
at what was here--

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:03.430
I don't know if you took notes,
but let me rewrite it for you.

01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:08.760
So it was x to the d/2 minus
1 e to the minus x/2 divided

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:14.470
by 2 to the d/2 gamma of d/2.

01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:18.200
So if I plug in d is
equal to 2, gamma of 2/2

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.920
is gamma of 1, which is 1.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.750
It's factorial of 0.

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:26.290
So it's 1, so this
guy goes away.

01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:33.310
2 to the d/2 is 2 to
1, so that's just 1.

01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:36.490
No, that's just 2.

01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:40.990
Then x the d/2 minus 1
is x the 0, goes away.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:47.080
And so I have x minus x/2
1/2, which is really, indeed,

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.050
of the form lambda e
to the minus lambda

01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:53.290
x for lambda is equal
to 1/2, which was

01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.851
our exponential distribution.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:05.290
Well, next week is,
well, Columbus Day?

01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:08.510
So not next Monday--

01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:12.310
so next week, we'll talk
about Student's distribution.

01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:15.430
And so that was
discovered by a guy

01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:19.400
who pretended his name was
Student, but was not Student.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.260
And I challenge you to
find why in the meantime.

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:24.940
So I'll see you next week.

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:28.090
Your homework is
going to be outside

01:18:28.090 --> 01:18:31.733
so we can release the room.
