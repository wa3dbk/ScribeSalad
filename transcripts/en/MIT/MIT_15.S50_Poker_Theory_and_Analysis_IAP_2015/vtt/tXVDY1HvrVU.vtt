00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:24.490
PROFESSOR: Welcome back everyone
to Poker Theory and Analytics.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.140
We're lucky today to have a
guest speaker, Joel Freed,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.354
coming to talk to us
about PokerTracker.

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:32.020
As you know, we have
a great partnership

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.440
going with PokerTracker
in this class.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.000
They sent along Joel Freed
to teach us analytics.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.290
Joel is a VIP support director
for Max Value Software, who's

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.750
the parent company
of PokerTracker.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.490
He has taught
analytical techniques

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.170
to some of the biggest
names in the poker industry.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.550
And he's come by to teach
us that sort of thing, also.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.934
So with that, I'm going
to pass it along to Joel.

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:55.140
JOEL FREED: Thanks.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.380
I hope you all have had a chance
to install PokerTracker by now.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.770
PokerTracker is the
industry leading analysis

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.010
and tracking software
for online poker players.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.569
We've been around since 2001.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.340
So we've been able to grow as
the poker economy has grown.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.340
It started out as
software only for people

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.450
who played limit hold 'em.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.480
And it has exploded.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.140
We do Omaha now-- obviously,
no-limit and pot limit

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.789
hold 'em.

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.080
And we have extensive tournament
support, some of which

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.690
we'll be talking about today.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.150
What PokerTracker does is it can
help you identify and analyze

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.510
similar decision points to
help you improve your game.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.870
So PokerTracker's not
going to do it all for you,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.870
but it's going to help you find
the spots where you can improve

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.580
and make better decisions.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.790
So what do I mean when
I say, decision point?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.960
A decision point is
any time in a hand

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.760
where you can make some action.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.840
So you can check.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.550
You can bet.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.267
You can call.

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:44.850
You can raise.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.530
Or, you can fold.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.488
At any point in the hand
where you can do that,

00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:49.760
I'm going to call
that a decision point.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.574
And when you play poker, after
you've played for a while,

00:01:52.574 --> 00:01:54.240
or if you've already
played for a while,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.930
you'll realize you naturally
remember similar decision

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.640
points.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.390
If you're the short
stack in a tournament,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.230
and it's folded to you
and the small blind,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.920
you're going to be able to lump
all of those kinds of decisions

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.000
together so that, when you face
that decision the next time

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.470
around, you already have some
kind of history to build on.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.390
And using PokerTracker
to analyze

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.020
the interesting decision points
is really a very effective way

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.080
to improve your game
because, the next time you

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.320
come to a similar
decision, you will already

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.020
have some memory of
what you believed

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.870
to be right last time you were
doing something like this.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.115
So what makes a decision
point interesting?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.480
It's interesting when you aren't
sure what the right answer is.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.970
And that may seem
kind of obvious.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.977
But when the expectation
of the outcomes

00:02:42.977 --> 00:02:45.435
is really close together, you're
going to sit at the table,

00:02:45.435 --> 00:02:46.820
and you're going
to agonize over it.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.730
And that's where you see
people on television, where

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.938
they're sitting there for
minutes, and they're going,

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:52.970
ah, I don't know what to do.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.190
And those are the
interesting decision points.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.600
And as you start out, you will
find that you really don't

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.002
know what you're doing a lot.

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:02.960
All decision points are
going to be interesting

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.490
until you start to have
some kind of heuristic,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.500
some kind of rubric for
when to call, when to fold.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.380
So here is a situation.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.030
We are in the big blind.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.650
It's 100/200 blinds.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.250
This is a tournament.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.240
In this tournament, it was
a single table tournament.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.800
Let's say you bought in for $10.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.510
$50 goes to first place,
$30 goes to second place,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.830
and $20 goes to third place.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.870
So there's four
players left here.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.190
You have a chip
stack of 1,430 chips.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.190
And the cutoff
here, this player,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.060
opened all in for 5,700 chips.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.900
The player on the button folded.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.540
And this player called
for 2,980 chips.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.640
So these two guys
are already all in.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.244
You have ace, queen of clubs.

00:03:50.244 --> 00:03:51.410
So you're ace, queen suited.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.109
And you have 1,430
chips back in this spot.

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.275
I want you to take a second.

00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:58.365
And I want you to think
about this decision

00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:00.949
and, whether in this spot,
knowing nothing about these two

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.490
players, you don't really know
too much about them right now,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.980
we'll get into that
a little bit later.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.188
But without knowing anything
really about these guys,

00:04:07.188 --> 00:04:09.500
they're just your average
players in the game,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.397
would you be calling or folding?

00:04:11.397 --> 00:04:13.230
I want you to think
about that for a second.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.740
So I'll point out
another feature here.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.019
For those of you who are
familiar with pot odds.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.400
Your odds here are
3.35 to 1 to call.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.490
If this was a cash
game and if you

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.130
had 23% equity against
both of those hands,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.567
you could call profitably.

00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:33.150
Obviously, this is a tournament
situation which affects things

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.100
drastically right here.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.810
So the total pot size is 4,810.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.670
We have 1,430 to call.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.720
So if you believe that this
is a very easy decision,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.730
raise your hand.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.670
One, two-- we've got a few.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.170
Awesome.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.410
You guys are right.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.890
If you think it's a call, I
want you to raise your hand.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.020
One call.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.130
For the people think it's
close, if you think it's a call,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.686
raise your hand.

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:10.870
One, two.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.160
Got a few.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.507
It's not even close.

00:05:14.507 --> 00:05:15.090
And it's fold.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.100
Let me talk a little bit about
what's going on in this view.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.560
This is from our ICM quiz.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.360
PokerTracker has a
feature that lets

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.000
you practice in these end of
tournament situations, which

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.550
you can access through the Tools
menu bar-- Tools, ICM, Quiz.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.290
And in this spot, what it's
telling you is, if you push,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.450
based on an average player
model for these two players,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.190
your equity in the
tournament is 9.49%

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.820
based on the expectation of this
hand against these two players

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.450
when they're all in,
for average opponents.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.180
That means that you could expect
to make $9.49 with the prize

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.930
we've picked out.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.630
If you fold, however, you
have an expectation of 18.67%

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.020
And the reason for
this is that it's

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.369
reasonably likely that the
player with 2,980 chips

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:11.160
is going to go out.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.930
And once you do that, you
are guaranteed third place.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.700
So this is a clear fold.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.350
It's even, in fact, a clear
fold if you have kings.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.480
And you can go further in
the poker tracker ICM tool.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.600
If you click the Results
link that's right here,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.680
it will bring up the
full math, and I'm not

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.805
going to go through the
ICM math right now for you.

00:06:31.805 --> 00:06:33.388
I know you're going
to go through that

00:06:33.388 --> 00:06:34.300
later in the course.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.700
But what you can do is you
can change their ranges, right

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.580
here, by clicking these buttons.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.470
And so I've set
them to 100% range.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.180
That means these players
are playing any two cards.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.769
So even if you knew before the
hand, they pushed all in blind,

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:48.310
they didn't even
look at their hands,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.480
they could have any two
cards, either one of them,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.250
it's still a fold because fold
equity still is close to 19%,

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.730
and your push equity is
15%, even though you're

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.550
going to win half of all hands
against two random cards.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.540
So before we talk
a little bit more

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.690
about how to use PokerTracker
to analyze your game

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.140
and see where you
can improve, I wanted

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.680
to talk a little
bit about how you

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.370
can use PokerTracker and not
get better poker because there's

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.420
some great and interesting
stuff in PokerTracker

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.290
that you can spend
lots of time looking

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.430
at that will not help you at
all make a better decision.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.517
So looking at graphs.

00:07:27.517 --> 00:07:29.350
People love looking at
their results graphs.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.800
And here's a nice results graph.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.160
You started off at hand one.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.612
You had a nice run here.

00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:35.070
You went steady
for a little while.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.370
You won a few big hands
around hand 183,000.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:45.170
And then you end up
about plus 860,000 Euros.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.510
Since poker is a series
of decision points,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.170
the question is, which decisions
would you make differently

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.010
based on this graph.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.810
And the answer is
absolutely none of them.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.730
Knowing that you did
this well in this spot

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.230
is not going to help you make
better decisions in the future.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.600
It may allow you to buy a
house in the Boston area,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.570
but it will not help you
actually play better poker.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.130
Another way you will
not get better at poker

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.730
by using PokerTracker is by
looking at hands, which we call

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.640
walks.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.150
A walk is when you're in the
big blind and everyone folds

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.675
to you.

00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:20.810
You win the small
blind, which is nice.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.270
But you didn't do anything.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.270
There's no way in which
you could make a better

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.740
play in that hand.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.445
And I know a lot
of heads up, sit

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:30.060
and go players who play
two player tournaments like

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.490
to look at those kinds of
spots and they want to know,

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.782
how much am I winning there.

00:08:33.782 --> 00:08:35.240
And the answer is
it doesn't matter

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.721
because you can't change your
play based on who folds to you.

00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:41.970
Another thing that people
want to do with PokerTracker

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.680
that won't help them get better
at poker is analyzing luck.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.690
We have several tools
for luck in PokerTracker.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.370
This graph is from
the cash game side.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.050
It is actually-- you'll
notice the normal curve.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.590
This is actually normalized.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.900
So what you're seeing
here is each dot

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.850
tells you how often you're
hitting your draws relative

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:01.710
to expectations.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.360
So this player is more
than one standard deviation

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.730
above the mean at flopping
three of a kind when

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.080
he holds a pocket pair,
which we call flopping a set.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.980
And that's fantastic.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.935
He's probably
making lots of money

00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:15.060
when he has these pocket
pairs because making a set

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.250
is a very powerful hand.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.690
However, he's not going
to be able to change

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.270
the way he plays by knowing
that he's been lucky in the past

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.930
because he may or
may not continue

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.300
to be lucky in the future.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.740
I also have a friend who
spent lots of time building

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.880
lots of reports to see if he
was getting dealt aces more

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.770
regularly than average.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.964
And while it's great
to be dealt aces

00:09:35.964 --> 00:09:38.130
more regularly than average--
and you will make lots

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.713
more money if you get dealt aces
more regularly than average--

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:44.220
knowing what happened last week
will not help you the next time

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.160
you're sitting at
the poker table.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.740
The last thing I'm going to say
about PokerTracker-- and this

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.680
is a little bit trickier--
there are lots of statistics,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.270
and lots of numbers
in PokerTracker.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.290
I think that we have easily
over 1,000 different statistics

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.360
you can look at, especially
when you consider combinations

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:02.970
of position.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.980
And if you add stack size,
it's in the thousands for sure.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.590
And the problem is, some are
not relevant to the spot you're

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.210
looking at.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.860
And some will lack
a sufficient sample.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.990
So I'm going to use
this hand to illustrate

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.450
both of those points.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.230
This is a cash game hand
from a from real poker site

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.550
from about four years ago.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.080
The player, hero,
here was on the button

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.900
and was dealt ace of
spades, 10 of hearts.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.000
So he had ace, 10 off suit.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.670
Before the flop,
villain16 made a raise.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.070
And hero called.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.940
The flop was two of
spades , four of spades,

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.320
three of diamonds.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.040
villain16 made a bet.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.210
And hero made a call.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:44.020
I'm not going to go into whether
or not that was a good play.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.070
There are reasons for it.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.278
There are reasons against it.

00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:48.240
But for the purposes
of this hand,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.990
it's important to note
that that happened.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:55.236
On the turn, villain16 also
bet, and hero also called.

00:10:55.236 --> 00:10:57.110
The turn was the 10 of
diamonds and the river

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.040
was the ace of hearts.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.637
So now, we have two pair--
top two pair in fact.

00:11:01.637 --> 00:11:02.970
And villain16 makes another bet.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.830
The bet was 1,550
British pounds.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.084
And the pot was 1,975 pounds.

00:11:09.084 --> 00:11:10.000
So we're sitting here.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.760
We're getting 2.27 to 1 odds.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.850
So if we call and we're ahead
31% of the time or more,

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.240
it's a good call.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.130
We can fold.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.980
Our stack is 3,350, so we
could also make a raise

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.490
to like 1,700, 1,800.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.089
Now we have lots of
stats here on the table.

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:30.630
I'm not going to go
through them all.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.870
This is our heads up display.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.590
So we're looking, right now,
at the PokerTracker replayer.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.760
The important ones to
note for this purpose

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.170
is this red number
here-- this 97--

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.960
this is the number of hands of
data we have on this player.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.110
So if you were
sitting at a casino,

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.077
you get about 30
hands an hour, so this

00:11:47.077 --> 00:11:48.910
would be the equivalent
of about three hours

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.980
of live play against somebody.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.330
Online, it's more like
an hour and a half

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.250
because online hands tend
to come a bit faster.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.870
So we've got some data.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.630
It's not a huge sample.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.640
VP is the VPIP number that
was talked about last time.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.290
That's the percentage
of hands he's playing.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.480
So he's been playing
about 2 out of 3 hands.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.820
So he's been in a lot of pots.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.250
So we know that about this guy.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.880
And PR is Preflop Raise.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.330
That's how often he's
coming in for a raise,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.380
or raising at some
point in the hand.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.710
And that's 45%.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.910
So 2/3 of the time--
because 45 over 65

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.850
is 2/3, roughly--
he's making raises.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.274
So he's aggressive and
he's playing lots of hands.

00:12:31.274 --> 00:12:32.440
And here we're in this spot.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.850
We're facing a big
bet on the river.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.080
So we've got his river stats.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.529
So if you click
on the HUD, you're

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:41.570
going to get this pop-up.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.740
There's a bunch of tabs here,
Tools, Preflop, Flop, Turn,

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.320
River.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.040
Since this is a river spot, I've
just got the River tab open.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.640
I didn't want to
overwhelm you guys yet.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.010
And we can see his bet stats.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.090
So on the river, in
our entire sample,

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.160
he's had eight chances
to bet the river.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.410
And he bet three
of those chances.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.910
And I'm going to tell you
that that number is completely

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.930
and totally irrelevant
to this situation

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.050
because we can also see
this number for cbet.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.190
Now cbet is a poker term.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.890
Is called a continuation bet.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.610
That means that a player has
been aggressive the entire hand

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.360
up till now.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.260
So a cbet on the flop, he
was the last raiser preflop.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.760
He gets a chance to open the
action on the flop and he does.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.190
That's a flop continuation.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.510
A turn continuation bet--
he made a flop cbet,

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.590
and he now has a chance
to bet on the turn,

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.460
he makes a turn bet.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.560
So that's a turn cbet.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.582
A river cbet is he
makes a turn cbet.

00:13:31.582 --> 00:13:33.290
And now he has a chance
to bet the river.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.070
And we have never, not
once, seen him get a chance

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.750
to make a river cbet.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.600
So if we tried to use this
38% here, and we said,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.610
well, he only bets
38% of the river,

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.380
so he must have a
really big hand here,

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.330
we would be basing it
on wrong information

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.200
because he could have gotten
to the river in any way

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200
for these bets to count.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.317
He could have been
calling-- a calling down

00:13:55.317 --> 00:13:57.150
in position, and then
it was checked to him,

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.710
and that that would count.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.780
He could've been raising.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.654
He could've raised
preflop, checked the flop,

00:14:01.654 --> 00:14:02.390
checked the turn.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.098
That would count.

00:14:03.098 --> 00:14:04.110
Any combination.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.090
And his hand strength
is going to be

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.330
vastly different
those times he is

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.880
bet the entire way
than those times

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.610
where he's done other things.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.330
So since we have a sample
of zero cbets here,

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.940
these river stats
are not actually

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.440
that useful for
analyzing this spot.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.930
You're much better off
looking at the board

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.040
and trying to figure
out, based on his preflop

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.590
numbers and his flop numbers,
what kind of hand gets here.

00:14:30.164 --> 00:14:31.830
I could talk about
this hand a lot more,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.099
but that's our PowerPoint here.

00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:37.390
Now we've talked about ways
that you can not get better

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.750
at poker using PokerTracker.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.270
Let's get to the
interesting stuff.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.180
How do you get better at
poker using PokerTracker 4?

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.910
And I'm going to say
it's a five step process.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.930
Step one, use
PokerTracker for reports

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.420
and filters to look at very
specific kinds of decision

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.280
points.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.470
Find those times you
find interesting.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.830
Find those times where
you don't know the answer,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.750
and those are the
ones we're going

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.749
to look-- you should be
looking at because those

00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:03.852
are ones that are going to
help you get better at poker.

00:15:03.852 --> 00:15:06.310
The next thing to do is create
mental models of the players

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.010
in a specific situation.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.050
So that means you should have
an idea of what you think

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.140
those players are doing here.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.660
Now even though they're looking
at similar kinds of decision

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.070
points, you're not always
going to have similar kinds

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.197
of players in those hands.

00:15:21.197 --> 00:15:23.530
If you want to look at all
times you were facing a river

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.610
continuation bet, you're
going to have sometimes you're

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.568
against aggressive players
and sometimes you're

00:15:27.568 --> 00:15:28.830
against passive players.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.130
You're going to have times where
the river made a draw come in.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.630
You're going to have times where
the river paired the board.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.180
All these are
slightly different.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.763
And not necessarily
different enough--

00:15:37.763 --> 00:15:40.280
you wouldn't want to lump
them together for point 1,

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.310
but enough that you
need to definitely think

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.320
about the players in
this specific situation

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.990
and try to get an idea what's
this player doing right here.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.051
This is exactly what you
would do at a live table

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:52.550
when you're sitting
across the table

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.549
from somebody trying to
figure out what is going

00:15:54.549 --> 00:15:57.580
through his mind right now.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.970
Then you adjust that
model that you've just

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.556
built based on any relevant
statistics that you

00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:05.180
do happen to have-- if you have
notes on the player or anything

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.120
else.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.530
If you know that this guy
lost a big hand two hands ago,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.110
and he might be, what's called
in the poker world, steaming.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.740
He is really mad.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.390
And he is just going to be
way more aggressive right now,

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.250
that's relevant information.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.300
If you're sitting
in a casino and you

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.360
know that guy has just
finished his fifth bear

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.300
and he's slurring his
words a little bit,

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.550
that's relevant information.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.060
Anything that you can do to
adjust the model that you've

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.227
built to be more
relevant, that's good.

00:16:32.227 --> 00:16:34.310
Then you evaluate your
different decision options.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.525
So if you're in a
spot where, let's say,

00:16:36.525 --> 00:16:37.900
you can just either
call or fold.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.460
You have to think about what
kind of hand does he have.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.610
Will I win if I
make a call here?

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.090
If I fold, obviously,
I'm out of the hand.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.640
For tournaments, what chip
stack will I have remaining?

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.050
How does this affect
everyone else's standings

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:52.840
in the tournament?

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.430
There's a lot of considerations
for tournaments that affect,

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.670
especially, your
preflop decisions.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.590
And then, once you've done
all four of these things,

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.060
go to step one and do it again.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.869
Continue to do this
over and over again,

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.035
every time you have an
interesting kind of decision,

00:17:08.035 --> 00:17:11.710
and you will find that you are
able to make better decisions

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.050
because you understand the
different decision points

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.040
that you're facing.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.480
So let's talk about
how to navigate

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.207
PokerTracker 4 a little bit.

00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:21.790
For those of you who
have it installed

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.164
and have your
computer here, feel

00:17:23.164 --> 00:17:27.869
free to open up PokerTracker
and follow along with me.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.200
So what I'm calling a
report is any kind of way

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.670
in which PokerTracker
is showing you data.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.900
On the top left
here, this community,

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.500
which launches our
community page,

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.060
you can look at our forums.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.790
You can download custom stats,
all sorts of other fun stuff.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.290
Play Poker.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.640
This is where you go when
you want to actually play.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.430
So for those of you
who haven't actually

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.510
done any importing in
any of the tournaments

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.890
yet, when you want to
play, you go to Play Poker

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.520
and you click the Gets
Hands While Playing button.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.530
And View Stats here,.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.340
This is where all
of your information

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.390
is going to be displayed.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.120
T is for tournament,
which is going to be

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.411
all you guys are interested in.

00:18:02.411 --> 00:18:04.860
And we have four options,
Result, Statistics, My Reports,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.360
and Graphs.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.193
And I'm not going to
talk about Graphs today

00:18:07.193 --> 00:18:12.100
at all just because there
really isn't enough time.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.090
So there's this left
hand side bar here.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.930
And some people
have liked closing

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.060
it to make things bigger.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.870
And you should not
forget that it is there.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.630
A lot of the navigation
options are in that sidebar.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.730
And there is a huge
amount of value

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.780
in being able to change reports.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.250
So right now, we're looking
at the overview report.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.175
It's got a nice graph.

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:31.883
You can change different
kinds of graphs.

00:18:31.883 --> 00:18:34.570
You can show your ROI, your ITM.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.210
ROI is Return On Investment.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.557
ITM is In The Money percentage.

00:18:37.557 --> 00:18:39.140
You can show those
on this graph, too.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.840
You can see your
results-- how much

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.670
you've won, how many
tournaments you've played.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.720
And down here-- so
this is a report.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.400
Right now, we're looking
at the basic By Description

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.230
report, which is showing
you one row per description

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.610
of tournament type.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.220
For you guys, honestly, just
looking at By Tournament

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.346
is probably going to be OK.

00:18:58.346 --> 00:19:00.553
That will give you one row
per individual tournament.

00:19:00.553 --> 00:19:02.200
You're not going to
have so much data

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.490
that it's going to be hard
to group things together.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.730
And most of your tournaments
are relatively similar.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.980
If you choose Advanced rather
than Basic, all it does

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.840
is give you more stats.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.040
So you might want to
spend some time looking

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.170
at what these numbers
mean in Basic before you

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.130
flip to Advanced.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.420
And it's also important to
know-- so you can change

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.952
any report from this drop down.

00:19:22.952 --> 00:19:24.910
And I'll talk about what
the different ones are

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.380
in a little bit.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.952
But the Overview Report
has one really cool feature

00:19:28.952 --> 00:19:30.910
that is not obvious, and
that is you can double

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:32.380
click to get more detail.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.160
So if you want to know more
about these 392 tournaments

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.770
because those are
the ones you're

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.492
going to start playing
tomorrow and those

00:19:38.492 --> 00:19:40.200
are the ones that are
really interesting,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.450
then you double click.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.120
And now you see each one
of those 392 tournaments,

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.602
one tournament per row.

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:47.060
And you get to see
how much you won

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.360
in that tournament, how
long it was, your finish

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.135
position, all kinds of stuff.

00:19:51.135 --> 00:19:52.510
And it does say
here on the side,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.380
double click a row
for more details.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.840
And you can go back by
choosing Back By Description

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.190
or choosing Remove All
filters and Return to Route.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.220
If that's not enough,
you can then double

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.100
click the individual
tournament and it

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.090
will show you the hands,
one hand at a time.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.930
So you're going to get
a row for each hand

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.320
as the tournament went through.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.380
It will show you most
recent 100 by default.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.930
If the tournament
ran more than 100,

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.120
you can feel free
to change that.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.790
We just have that set
so that it doesn't

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.690
choke too hard if you have
a 1,500 hand tournament

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.350
or something.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.860
You can also sort by clicking
any of the column headers,

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.580
just like any other
reporting software.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.650
So you've got one
row per line here.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:37.350
You can also right click, which
has a lot of useful features.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.900
It's a context menu.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.150
And you can use that to
add or remove statistics

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.960
from your report.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.160
So when you get into
your VPIP and your PFR

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.660
and those kinds of
things, you might

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.170
want to add or remove a bunch
of different custom stats.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.750
So you can do that with
Configure Report here.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.540
But you can also replay-- this
is how you'd replay hands.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.480
If you want to export videos and
put them on YouTube directly,

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.480
you could just right
click, choose Export Video,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.940
put it on YouTube, post
YouTube video on Facebook,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.080
and everyone can see
your awesome play,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.380
which is always fun.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.290
And if you want to look
at multiples at a time,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.847
you can use Control
or Shift-Click.

00:21:10.847 --> 00:21:13.055
So Control-Click will
highlight one extra individual,

00:21:13.055 --> 00:21:15.357
and Shift-Click will
highlight a range.

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:17.440
If you click here, you
hold shift, you click here,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.000
it'll highlight
everything in between.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.070
And then you could
say replay hand.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.820
You could say replay
all hands and report.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.960
And it will load everything
up in the replayer.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.460
This would be the
way, if you wanted

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.780
to replay an entire tournament.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.571
You had such a great
tournament, you really

00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:30.910
want to watch it again,
right now, you can just

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.430
replay all hands and report.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.970
And presto.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.720
You can just click
Play and sit back.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.370
And the whole tournament
will play through.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.900
So another report on
the statistics side

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.950
that I wanted to highlight
for you is summary.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.100
And the reason summary
is interesting and useful

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.320
is that summary allows you to
do different kinds of grouping.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.640
In particular, for you, I
think starting hands hold 'em,

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.970
as shown here on the
right, and position

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.142
will be your most useful ones.

00:22:00.142 --> 00:22:02.100
So what happens in starting
hand hold 'em here,

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.000
you have one row per hand type.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.180
So you can see here,
we had aces 131 times.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.610
This is how many big
blinds we won, adjusted

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.690
for luck-- for all in equity.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.450
The VPIP is 100%.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.320
Congratulations, if
you did not know it,

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.490
you will almost
certainly, voluntarily

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.730
put money in the pot 100% of the
time when you get dealt aces.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.500
If this number is
not 100% of the time,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.890
I recommend going back and
rethinking your decision

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.460
process, because aces is
the best hand in Texas

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.630
hold 'em, for certain.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.280
And nobody will say
anything else about that.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.720
You can see different rows
for all the different types.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.930
And that is going
to be the best way

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.295
to see-- if you feel
like I'm playing

00:22:41.295 --> 00:22:43.920
some of these suited connectors
a little-- maybe it's too much.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.180
Maybe I'm not sure.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.200
Am I playing jack,
ten suited too much?

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.910
Am I playing king,
queen off suit too much?

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.630
If you're not sure,
come here and you

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.588
can start looking at the
hands because whatever

00:22:53.588 --> 00:22:55.560
row you have here, the
hands from that row

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.956
will display in the bottom.

00:22:56.956 --> 00:22:58.830
And it works just like
the other hand report.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.050
You can replay them.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.170
You can double click for
more information on one.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.770
They're all right here.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.150
And Position and Groups.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.450
I don't have an image of it, but
it groups one row for position.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.970
And when I say position, I mean
if you're in the big blind,

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.450
if you're in the small blind,
if you're on the button.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.540
So if you feel like someone
is beating up on my big blind.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.670
Man, I sit there, and every
time I get my blinds raised,

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.605
and I have to fold,
and I hate it.

00:23:24.605 --> 00:23:25.612
Can I play back?

00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:27.820
Or am I doing it right, and
it just feels wrong to me

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.060
because sometimes your
memory of the situation

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.590
isn't really the truth.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.760
You can come in and load
up the Position Report,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.190
and you'll be able to see
exactly what's happening.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.590
Another really awesome report
is the Hold 'em Hand Range

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.190
Visualizer.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.570
This is in Statistics as well.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.490
And it looks like a lot, but
it's not actually as crazy

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.410
as it looks.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.740
So first off, over here, we have
various different statistics.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.530
So when you choose
a statistic, you're

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.770
getting information based
on your values in this spot.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.740
So let me talk about
what three betting is.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.640
Three betting means someone
has made a first raise.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.010
That's the two bet.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.900
And then you made
the second raise.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.937
And we're talking about
preflop only right now.

00:24:08.937 --> 00:24:10.020
So you made the three-bet.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.350
So someone raised
and you reraised.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.995
That's all we know about
these hands right now.

00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:17.556
But we're looking at only
those spots, right now,

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:18.180
in this report.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.780
And you can look at all
kinds of different spots.

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.060
And this little wrench
here lets you configure.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.726
If you want to put
different stats here,

00:24:23.726 --> 00:24:26.240
you can do that, too.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.710
Right now, we're
looking at range.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.280
So here it says,
Range and Value.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.240
So when I say range, I mean
these are the hands that you

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.470
have actually done this with.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.530
These numbers here
are percentages.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.280
And each one tells
you what percentage

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.170
of all of the hands that I
have made a three-bet with

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.520
does this comprise.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.860
Let's look at pocket 10s.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.760
This player made a
reraise with pocket 10s--

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.170
of hands he made a
reraise, 2.244% of those,

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.530
he had pocket 10s.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.420
So you can think about this
as, if I made this raise,

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.292
and someone else was against me,
what could they expect to see.

00:25:03.292 --> 00:25:04.750
About almost 4% of
the time, they'd

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.580
expect to see ace,
queen offsuit.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.980
4.28% of the time, they'd
expect to see ace, king.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.340
2 and 1/2% of the time, aces.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.470
So this is what your
actual range looks like.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.030
And in poker, we use
range as the term

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.850
for-- if you think of the
domain as all hole cards--

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:24.020
so those are all hole cards
you could be playing--

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.120
your heuristics, your mental
processes at playing poker

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.760
is the function that takes
a hand from the domain

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.660
and puts it in the range.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.570
So this is your range.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.410
You can change this
from Range to Value.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.640
And this is where it gets cool.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.370
This is the percentage
that this player

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.790
made a three bet, given
that he had a chance to

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:45.832
with each of these hands.

00:25:45.832 --> 00:25:48.123
And so you're going to notice
something very different,

00:25:48.123 --> 00:25:48.690
right away.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.980
We have a whole lot
of the 100s here.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.870
This player has made a three
bet 100% with ace king suited,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.400
ace queen suited, ace jack
suited, ace 10, and ace

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.180
nine suited.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.120
Every time he had those
hands, and he had a chance

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.280
to make a reraise, he did it.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.480
Every single time.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.744
But if you look at the
actual percentages,

00:26:05.744 --> 00:26:06.660
they are not the same.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.789
0.84, 0.931, 1.49.

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:11.080
So you can tell also that he
got dealt ace, jack suited

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.560
in these kinds of
spots a little bit more

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.240
because he's still doing
it 100% of the time.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.770
So this report is fantastic
for helping you figure out,

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:26.360
first of all, what would an
opponent be seeing me do.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.000
What am I looking like?

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.540
And then, well, what am
I actually doing when

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.050
I get my hands in these spots?

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.170
If you think, you know what, I
should never be making reraises

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.532
with king, jack offsuit.

00:26:36.532 --> 00:26:38.240
And you come here,
and you go, well, I've

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.250
been doing it 75% of the time,
you immediately know something

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.990
that you can use next
time you have king, jack

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.130
offsuit in that situation
to make a different play.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.580
That will let you
change your poker.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.009
And again, you can pick any
of our statistics from here.

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:56.050
And you can look at them.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.508
Anything that shows
percentage-wise

00:26:57.508 --> 00:26:59.840
will work in this report.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.020
Another really important
report for tournament play

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.040
in particular is
facing preflop action.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.800
So again, we're in
Statistics section,

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.270
and it's the Facing
Preflop Action Report.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:14.100
What you're seeing here is
one row per kind of situation

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.310
that you could be in your very
first action before the flop.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.430
You get dealt your cards,
stuff happens before you.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.620
And now it's your
first decision.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.310
Well, the question is,
what happened until then.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.840
If it's an unopened pot, that
means everybody folded to you.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.020
So it's a similar
kind of situation.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.350
So here, we can see we
have 10,434 hands where

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.530
this player was the first
to be able to open the pot.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.230
You can see the
winning percentage,

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.960
you can see their VPIP and PFRs.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.200
So again, they're playing
a little more than 70%

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.160
of hands in that spot,
raising 60%-- a little more.

00:27:52.876 --> 00:27:54.000
But you can see one limper.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.824
Now a limper means someone
just called the big blind.

00:27:56.824 --> 00:27:57.740
It's a technical term.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.200
It means there's one person
who just called the big blind.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.060
And it's to them.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.950
We have 1,945 hands for that.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.840
You can see how
their VPIP changes.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.150
Suddenly, they're not putting
in nearly as much money.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.900
Part of the reason for
this is this sample

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.280
is based on heads up play.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.910
So when you check
in the big blind,

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.110
it's not considered voluntarily
putting money in because you

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.360
haven't put any more money in.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.150
And you can only
VPIP before the flop.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.120
After the flop is a
totally different animal.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.034
So VPIP preflop only.

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:24.700
And that's a good
thing to keep in mind.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.124
So that's why you see
this kind of big drop.

00:28:28.124 --> 00:28:30.290
But you can already see
how, looking at this report,

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.373
I can tell you something
about this player's play.

00:28:32.373 --> 00:28:35.350
They check a lot when
it's limped to them,

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.142
and they're in the big
blind, and its heads up play.

00:28:38.142 --> 00:28:40.100
So you can use these and,
of course, this works

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.240
like the other reports.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.990
And all of your
hands are down here.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.190
And so you can
replay these hands.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.680
You can do other filtering
in addition to this.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.300
And it will help
you figure out what

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.240
your play is in different
first situation spots.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.970
And tournament
play-- this is going

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.440
to be huge because, when you're
facing an all in before you get

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.270
a chance to act, your range
is going to be very different,

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.060
you're going to want to make
different decisions than you

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.840
will if everyone folds
to you because you're

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.110
able to steal the blinds
a lot more liberally.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.250
And you're going to see,
later in the course,

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.070
how aggressive you
can actually be

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.350
as your chip stack gets small.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.641
So being able to look at
these different kinds of spots

00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:19.480
will help you fine
tune your game

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.610
and look at what you've actually
been doing in those situations.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.560
So I've mentioned
lots of reports.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.220
Do you need more than that?

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.140
I'm glad you do because you can
create custom reports in the My

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.630
Reports section.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.060
In here, you can choose the
type of report, how to group

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.967
the report, and how to show
exactly what you want to see.

00:29:36.967 --> 00:29:39.050
So any of our stats can
be added to these reports.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.130
There's three kinds.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.419
A player report starts
out by looking at hands

00:29:43.419 --> 00:29:44.210
that you've played.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:45.626
You're looking at
groups of hands.

00:29:45.626 --> 00:29:49.030
So a stat like VPIP
looks at groups of hands

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.000
because it's a how
often you voluntarily

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.440
put money in the pot
over a sample of hands.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.200
That's to contrast with a
Hand Report, which is going

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.840
to show you one row per hand.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.259
So if you wanted to
make a report that

00:30:01.259 --> 00:30:03.550
was going to show you all
hands where you faced a river

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.900
continuation bet, you could
do that as a hand report,

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.460
and save it, and load that
up really quickly next time.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.304
An All Players Report,
is like a Player Report,

00:30:11.304 --> 00:30:12.720
except it's not
just for you, it's

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.100
for everybody in your database.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.174
You're going to get
one row per player.

00:30:16.174 --> 00:30:18.340
And you can put whatever
stats you want on it there.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.850
For Player Report, we also have
lots of different groupings,

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.400
some of which you will not
see anywhere else by default

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.440
in PokerTracker.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.980
And I want to specifically
highlight preflop stack size

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.030
for you guys because,
as tournament players,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.260
this kind of custom
report has a lot of value

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.420
for you because preflop
stack size is going

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.280
to be the determining factor
in a lot of situations

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.270
in your tournament play.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.140
So let's see what that
report looks like.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.729
You get one row per
different stacks.

00:30:43.729 --> 00:30:44.770
You get different ranges.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:45.810
These are in big blinds.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.780
They're not in m.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.240
You get a pretty
nice nice range.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.190
And you can kind
of approximate m

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:58.260
by multiplying that
by 2/3 because you're

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.100
going to be dividing it
by the small blind, too.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.600
So you can see here,
this player had

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.140
the stack less than two
big blinds 59 times.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.825
And this is how
often they raised

00:31:06.825 --> 00:31:07.950
when it was folded to them.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.270
And you can see it's 47%.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.900
So you can see, in this
spot, how someone's raising

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.079
range is going to change
based on their stack size.

00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:18.120
And you can see we have
different samples for all

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.420
the different stack sizes.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.360
Based on the tournaments you
guys are actually playing,

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.220
you're going to be seeing
numbers much more in this area,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.920
and a lot less in
this area because you

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.420
need to be really,
really deep to be

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.690
able to have 100 big blinds.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.481
And in the turbo
tournament, it just really

00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:32.790
doesn't happen that much.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.484
But, in addition to be
able to just look at this,

00:31:35.484 --> 00:31:37.400
you can then come in
here to this blue Filters

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.450
link-- it will be blue for you
until you've clicked it once.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.930
It's gray for me here.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:44.136
And then you can make
individual filters,

00:31:44.136 --> 00:31:45.760
and you can save that
with this report.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.450
So you could come
in here, and you

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.990
could take this report,
and filter for times

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.920
you're facing an all in.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.110
And you would then see times you
were facing an all in by stack

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.760
size, and see what
your stats are.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.860
And you could save that.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.470
And it would show
up in this dropdown.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:00.500
And you could look at it later.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.208
And you wouldn't need
to redo everything.

00:32:02.208 --> 00:32:06.470
And it will be really helpful
for analyzing your own play.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:10.430
So I've talked a lot about
filtering-- how do you do that.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.500
This button here,
More Filters, is

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.220
the gateway to all of
the filtering everywhere.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.100
And other than the
doing specific stuff

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.660
for custom reports,
this is the place

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.326
where you're going
to go if you want see

00:32:21.326 --> 00:32:23.820
specific subsets of your data.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.742
So when you click it, you're
going to get this window.

00:32:27.742 --> 00:32:29.950
There are five sections over
here, Game Details, Hand

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.380
Details, Hand Values,
Board Texture,

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.660
and Actions and Opportunities.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.630
And each one of these has
different kinds of filters.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.660
And we tried to break it down
as intuitively as possible.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.980
So Game Details is
all stuff for how

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.400
to filter out the game level.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.670
What day did I play it on;
what currency was it in;

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.360
what was the speed;
was it a turbo;

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.430
was it as a hyper turbo;
was it a super turbo;

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.269
what was the buy in; what
was its description; what

00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:56.560
was the table size; were
there six players at a table--

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.270
10 players at the table.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.739
You can also filter for
the specific blind levels.

00:33:00.739 --> 00:33:02.780
So if you wanted to look
at a hand at the 100/200

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.870
blind levels, that
would be there.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.934
You navigate this by--
you choose your section

00:33:08.934 --> 00:33:09.850
on the left hand side.

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:12.470
Anytime you see the greater
than symbol, you can click.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.389
So any of these options
here, you can click.

00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:15.930
And you'll get the
individual filters

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:16.700
you can turn on and off.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.140
And I'll show you a
few of those later.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.837
When you go down, you
can click up here,

00:33:19.837 --> 00:33:21.170
where it says cancel, right now.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.092
It will change up to
the previous section.

00:33:24.092 --> 00:33:25.800
And when you turn
everything you want on,

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.950
you click add to filters.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:30.760
And then it adds
them all together.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.030
Here's Hand Details.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:37.720
Hand Details is filters about
the whole hand altogether.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.530
So what was the maximum
preflop raise that occurred?

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:41.982
Was there a three bet at all?

00:33:41.982 --> 00:33:44.190
If you want all hands where
someone made a three bet,

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:46.620
you'd come here,
which can be great

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.510
if you want to look
at times when you made

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:49.968
a raise and someone
made a reraise,

00:33:49.968 --> 00:33:51.270
but you don't really care who.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:52.800
You just want to look
at all three-bet hands.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.530
You can come in here.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.150
If you want to look at hands
where there was limping,

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.520
you can turn that on.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.187
If you want to look
at hands by pot size

00:33:58.187 --> 00:34:00.311
or stack depth-- so you
want to look at hands where

00:34:00.311 --> 00:34:01.364
you had a certain m.

00:34:01.364 --> 00:34:02.280
You can come in there.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.520
How many players
were at the table.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.710
If you want to look bubble
hands, you'd look there.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.080
What was the position
of different players?

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.400
Who made the first raise?

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.790
Where was I sitting?

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.350
All that's in player position.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.659
This is mostly for
custom reports and notes.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.047
If you made tags
on the hand, you

00:34:18.047 --> 00:34:19.630
can tag hands in the
right-click menu.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:20.650
You can do that there.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.199
How much you won or lost
in the hand; how much

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.532
you contributed to the pot;
did the hand go to showdown.

00:34:24.532 --> 00:34:26.090
There's tons of options.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.819
Hand Values is
another way you're

00:34:27.819 --> 00:34:29.110
going to want to look at hands.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.960
And that is your hole
cards, your hand strength,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.949
and your draw strength.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:34.739
So let's go through those.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.210
This is what the hole
card filtering looks like.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.929
You've got the chart of all the
different hole card options.

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:41.340
So there are several
ways you could do it.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.330
If you want, you can just
click on individual hole cards.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.480
So if you just wanted to
pick, say, pocket 10s,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.250
you click right there, add
to filter, you're done.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.429
You only see data
from pocket 10s.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.715
If you wanted to see
the top 15% of hands,

00:34:52.715 --> 00:34:54.090
you can come down
to this slider,

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.929
and you can slide
it over to 15%.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:00.990
My top 15% of hands and your top
15% of hands may be different.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.590
That's why we have
this Model option.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.080
So we're using, by default,
this Glanksky-Carlson model,

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.120
which was invented
by them in response

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.620
to a very specific math problem,
which I think you guys will

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.880
talk about later in the course.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.595
We use that as the default
model to rank hands.

00:35:16.595 --> 00:35:18.720
But if you don't like that,
you can actually go in,

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.930
and you make your
own custom model.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.300
You can say, you
know what, I want

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.341
three, two suited to be
the best hand in the deck

00:35:23.341 --> 00:35:24.190
because I love it.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.890
You can do that.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.530
You can put that at the top.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:30.100
We also have hand versus three
randoms as a default model.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.690
It ranks hands based on
their equity against three

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:33.804
random sets of hole cards.

00:35:33.804 --> 00:35:35.220
It's going to look
very different.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.524
It's going to be a lot more
skewed towards high cards.

00:35:37.524 --> 00:35:39.190
So you're going to
see things like king,

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.898
jack offsuit and queen,
jack offsuit long

00:35:40.898 --> 00:35:43.170
before you see low pocket pairs.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.730
So that's going to make things
radically different in terms

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:46.867
of using the percentages.

00:35:46.867 --> 00:35:48.450
There's also this
Group Select button,

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.336
which will save you time.

00:35:50.336 --> 00:35:51.960
If you want to do
any ace, you can just

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.150
click Group Select, Any Ace.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.527
Of if you wanted to do any
pair, Group Select, Any Pair.

00:35:55.527 --> 00:35:57.110
If you want to invert
it, you can just

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.970
click Group Select and Invert,
and anything that's turned on

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:00.870
will be turned off.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:01.930
So you have lots
of options there.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.700
Once you set whatever you want,
you just click Add to Filter.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.300
Hand Strength.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.810
So once you see the flop,
you have some hand strength.

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:11.689
So all of these do imply
having some sort of hand.

00:36:11.689 --> 00:36:12.730
Did you have a high card?

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:14.259
That means you
don't have any pair.

00:36:14.259 --> 00:36:16.300
You just look at what your
high card strength is.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.800
One pair, two pair,
three of a kind.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.540
All the way down.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.934
There are multiple, multiple,
options in each of these.

00:36:20.934 --> 00:36:22.600
I'm just going to
look at straight, just

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.239
to save a little bit of time.

00:36:24.239 --> 00:36:26.530
So what you would pick is
what straight you made it on.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.140
So if you wanted to
look at only times

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.665
you made the straight on the
river, you could pick that.

00:36:31.665 --> 00:36:33.082
If you wanted to
see any straight,

00:36:33.082 --> 00:36:34.790
if you wanted to see
all three straights,

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.560
you can just change
that and turn it on,

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.880
How many hole cards you used.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.450
If you wanted both
of your hole cars

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:40.824
to be used to make
this straight,

00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:43.610
you can turn that on right here.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:47.100
A non-nut straight means it's
the best possible straight

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.150
versus a better
straight could be made.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.840
So if you have ace, king, and
the board is queen, jack, 10,

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.940
you have the nut straight.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.430
No one can have a
better straight.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.009
You have the absolute
best straight.

00:36:56.009 --> 00:36:57.800
If you have nine, eight
on that same board,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:02.320
you still have a straight,
8, 9, 10, jack, queen,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.480
but ace, king still is a
better straight than you.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.630
So you would have
the non-nut straight.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.520
Backdoor straight is when
you don't have a straight

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.450
until the river.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.750
And you didn't have a straight
draw on the flop either.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.250
So if you had ace, jack,
with a king on the board,

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:18.750
and it came queen, 10 to bust
some opponent on the bubble,

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.360
you just completed
a backdoor straight

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.670
and made somebody very unhappy.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:24.920
Draw Strength.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.310
So these are how you
would look at if you

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:29.537
wanted to look at my straight
draws, my flush draw.

00:37:29.537 --> 00:37:31.120
You pick which
straight you had it on,

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.380
which can be any flop, turn,
or both because you never

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.380
have draws on the river.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.910
Your hand is made or not.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:38.910
And we have the different
kinds of draw options.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.370
So for straight
draws, you can have

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:43.200
either draw to one card,
which makes you four outs,

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.466
or draw to two cards,
which makes you eight out.

00:37:45.466 --> 00:37:47.340
And we let you pick here
whether the outs are

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.910
the best possible straight or
outs to some straight that's

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:52.770
not the best depending on
whether it's open ended

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.696
or double gutshot.

00:37:53.696 --> 00:37:56.070
Also you could filter for
backdoor straight draw or hands

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.870
where you didn't have
any straight draw ever.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:59.411
So you can imagine,
these can combine

00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:01.190
for lots of different things.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:05.540
Board Texture is how the
cards are working together

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.580
on the flop.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.747
If you wanted to look
for a flop with any ace,

00:38:08.747 --> 00:38:11.330
you'd go into Board Cards, and
you could pick ace on the flop.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.200
If you wanted to look
for the turn paired

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.970
the board with
the flop, you'd go

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.570
into board pairing to the turn
section, and that one's there.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:20.620
If you wanted to look for times
the flop was all three clubs,

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.910
so you want monotone, you
would go into board suits

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:26.020
and you'd pick all three cards
of one suit for the flop.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.550
Board Connectedness
is like 10, 9 ,

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.180
8 is considered
a connected flop.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.730
10, 9, 7 is a little
less connected.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.280
So all those kinds of
options are in there.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.950
You can be really specific about
picking the situations you're

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:37.280
filtering for.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.822
And Actions and Opportunity
is the last section.

00:38:39.822 --> 00:38:41.530
But in some ways, it's
almost the biggest

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.780
because these are actions you
had, or opportunities you had,

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.230
in hands you played.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.860
So this includes
bets and sizing,

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.250
raises, raises faced,
raise sizing, calls, folds,

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:53.406
opportunities, you name it.

00:38:53.406 --> 00:38:54.780
So we're going to
look at preflop

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.454
just quickly so that
you get an idea.

00:38:56.454 --> 00:38:58.870
If you want to look at hands
where you voluntary put money

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.370
in the pot, turn that on.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:03.440
Posted blinds, raises,
calls, folds, opportunities,

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.769
all of these are here
to let you filter

00:39:06.769 --> 00:39:08.310
for times you made
a three-bet, times

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.920
you faced a three-bet, times
you folded to a three-bet,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.878
times you had a chance
to face an all in-- that

00:39:12.878 --> 00:39:13.970
would be in opportunities.

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:14.910
Action Sequences.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:15.860
Your specific action.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.030
So your first action is raising.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.155
Your second action is call.

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:19.490
Let's bring those up.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.440
Bet Sizing.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.034
I want to look at times I made
a three big blind open raise.

00:39:23.034 --> 00:39:23.950
We can bring those up.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.100
Actions and Counter with Sizes.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.000
What someone else did
it and it came to me.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.040
So they made an open
raise of three big blinds

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.002
and it came to me.

00:39:30.002 --> 00:39:30.960
That would be in there.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.690
And we have those for
flop, turn, and river, too.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:37.240
If that's not enough
and you need more stuff.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.240
You can combine these.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.350
So you can highlight them.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:41.919
So this is what it looks like
after you click Add to Filters.

00:39:41.919 --> 00:39:42.710
So we've added two.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.550
Sizes calculated in big blinds.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:47.070
Actions faced, two-bet
preflop between two and three.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.350
So that means that someone
made a two to three

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.290
big blind open before the flop.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.890
And we faced that raise.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.180
That's that filter.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.800
And this is, we made
a first raise preflop

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.680
with between two and
three big blinds.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.134
Now it should be obvious, these
will never happen together.

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:04.550
So if you leave
these on with AND,

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.383
and you click save and
apply to all filters,

00:40:06.383 --> 00:40:09.860
you will see no data anywhere
because that can never happen.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.680
What you might want,
however, is you want

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.250
to see any of these two times.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.000
So you're looking
for hands where

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.440
someone made that two
to three big blind open.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.307
I want to see how that affects
things on the turn, let's say,

00:40:20.307 --> 00:40:22.390
because those are the spots
I want to look at now.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.370
That's with the OR select.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.036
So you'd use OR.

00:40:24.036 --> 00:40:25.300
This is inclusive OR.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.800
So any of the times that match
either one of these two spots

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.591
will come together.

00:40:28.591 --> 00:40:30.890
And when you click
that, it says OR.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.680
And you get the two
filters together.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.475
And you can also click
Ungroup, once things

00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:35.350
are grouped together.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.040
And you can split it back up.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.750
You can use AND if you want to
to make nested deeper logic.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.479
And NOT will negate things.

00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:43.270
So if you wanted to
look at-- if you wanted

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.530
to negate times you made
a two-bet of that size,

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.810
you could just click on
that one and click NOT.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:50.351
It's not highlighted
here because you

00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:51.760
can't NOT two things at once.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.870
And you would see all other
times, all other situations.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.490
So as you can imagine, making
a complicated situation

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.964
is going to take you some time.

00:41:00.964 --> 00:41:03.130
And it's going to you little
work to get used to it.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.530
That's why we added this
Save As Quick Filter option.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:07.240
So once you've
made it, you don't

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.949
have to make it again,
which is fantastic

00:41:08.949 --> 00:41:11.323
because if you spend half an
hour on one of these things,

00:41:11.323 --> 00:41:13.880
you don't want to click Clear
Filters and never see it again.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.860
So you just click Save As Quick
Filter, and type your Quick

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.050
Filter name, and click OK.

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.100
And then you're done.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.780
It is now saved for the future.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.790
You will see it on a
dropdown, which I'll

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:23.240
show you in a couple of slides.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.070
And you will just be able
to load that right up on any

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.834
of your reports, instantly.

00:41:27.834 --> 00:41:30.250
On the other side, we have
this Edit Quick Filters button.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.920
And when you click
that, it shows

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.509
any saved Quick
Filters you have.

00:41:33.509 --> 00:41:35.550
When you click on it, it
shows you what they are.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.572
And you can rename
them, delete them.

00:41:37.572 --> 00:41:39.030
You can load them,
which is awesome

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.066
when you have multiples.

00:41:40.066 --> 00:41:41.440
If you want to
put them together,

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.210
you can load one and come over
here and load the other one.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.060
You can append them together.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.560
You can make several
pieces and then

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.810
put them together really fast.

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.900
We also have available for
free download on our website.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.460
Then you would import
them right here.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.350
If you wanted to export them
and give them to your friends--

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.590
you said, let's all make a
group of filters together.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.824
We'll split up the sample.

00:42:01.824 --> 00:42:03.990
And you make these, you
make these, I'll make these,

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:05.630
and then you want to give
them all to each other, great.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:07.546
You just export them,
give them to each other,

00:42:07.546 --> 00:42:09.500
it saves you a
whole bunch of time.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.994
And this is the
dropdown in the sidebar.

00:42:11.994 --> 00:42:13.910
So you see, once we've
made this Quick Filter,

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:16.366
you just pick it, click
that, and you're done.

00:42:16.366 --> 00:42:18.240
Now that filter applies
to all of the reports

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.900
on the other side.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.760
So I've talked a
lot about stats.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.050
And I hope you're
sitting there wondering,

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.780
what are these things.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.360
How can I find out
more about them?

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.550
I want to know about it, but
there's so much going on.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.650
So the way these work is
the vast majority of stats

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.990
in our software
will tell you what

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.180
percentage of the time
somebody did something,

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.590
given that he had a chance to.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:43.930
So it's this very simple
mathematical formula.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.800
How often did do
it, how often did he

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.891
have a chance do it, turn
it into a percentage.

00:42:47.891 --> 00:42:48.390
Done.

00:42:51.892 --> 00:42:53.350
How often did he
actually three-bet

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.610
divided by how often he
had a chance to three-bet.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.030
Multiply by 100.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.595
If it's 1% of the time when
he three bets, he has a hand.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.420
So let's go through
a few examples.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.304
VPIP, we've already
talked about a bunch.

00:43:07.304 --> 00:43:08.720
So it's the
percentage of the time

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.130
a player chose to put
money in before the flop.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.450
This is considered one
of the staple stats

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:18.617
because it really speaks
to how much a player is

00:43:18.617 --> 00:43:19.450
involved in the pot.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:22.425
If you've been sitting at
a casino and you see a guy

00:43:22.425 --> 00:43:24.290
that's just splashing
money every hand.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:25.290
He's playing every hand.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.390
He doesn't care.

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.070
His VPIP is very high.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.970
And it's easier to
think about that player

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.850
when you start building
models in your mind of what

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.070
do players who have VPIPs do.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:39.370
And you can start to categorize
players by VPIP numbers.

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.990
So someone who has
a VPIP of 40 is

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:45.820
going to have similar kinds
of play style to someone

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.464
else who has a VPIP
of 40, even if you

00:43:47.464 --> 00:43:49.880
don't know a whole lot else
because this one will converge

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.970
pretty quickly since
they will VPIP or not

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:54.490
pretty much every hand.

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:56.519
Raise First In is a little
bit more restrictive,

00:43:56.519 --> 00:43:58.560
but I think it's one that's
really useful for you

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.950
guys in tournament play.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.370
If the percentage
of time a player

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.290
raises on their
first action, when

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:05.910
everyone has folded to them.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.830
So if everyone folds
to you and you raise,

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:10.160
you raised first in the pot.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.710
So if you see that
be 40% for somebody,

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:14.582
they are raising a ton.

00:44:14.582 --> 00:44:16.290
They're raising almost
half of all hands.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.384
It's a huge number.

00:44:18.384 --> 00:44:19.300
And these can combine.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.424
These work together, right?

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:24.290
So if someone has a VPIP of 70
and a Raise First In of two,

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.860
they are calling all the time,
but they are not raising ever.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.950
So this starts to give you an
idea of what kind of player

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:29.560
they are.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.150
They're the kind of
player who puts money in,

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:33.180
but they are not willing
to commit to a raise.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.080
They don't want to
bring the stakes higher.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.990
They just want to go along
with whatever's happening.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:40.640
And some stats can be
super crazy specific.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.820
So we've already talked
about what three-bets are.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.730
We've already talked
about what cbets are.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.250
There is a stat in
our system called

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:49.360
Fold To Raise After Flop Cbet
in a Three-bet or Higher Pot.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.870
That's what 3upplus means.

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:51.730
Three-bet or higher.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.130
So let's break this one down.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:57.060
It means that we made
a three-bet or higher

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:57.820
before the flop.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.460
That is, we either three-bet
or we four-bet or we fivr-bet,

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:04.290
or we six-bet-- anything higher,
but we made the last raise

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:06.470
because we made a
cbet on the flop.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.580
So we made some
last raise preflop

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.710
that was at least a reraise.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.200
And on the flop, we
had a chance to bet,

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.770
and we bet, and they raised
us-- because they raised--

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:20.250
and we folded to
that specific raise.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.900
You will not see this
happening in your tournaments

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.720
because you are going to
be too short to really get

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.670
these situations.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.420
In a cash game, this
can be really useful,

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.610
once you have a few
thousand hands on somebody.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:34.610
But as you can imagine,
if we have this,

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.970
we have a lot of other
really specific stats.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.660
So if you find something
you want to know more about,

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.470
you can go through
out stat list and find

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.640
if there's something there
that already does it.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.326
And this is one
where you might not

00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:47.450
want to pay attention to
it until you have a really

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.910
good sample size on somebody.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:52.074
So how do you find
all the stat list?

00:45:52.074 --> 00:45:53.740
If you click Configure
from the menu bar

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.420
and you choose
Statistics, it's going

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.630
to pop open this window,
which is going to show you

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.770
our entire stat list.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.020
So you guys are going to
want to change to tournament.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.710
And there are players
stats and hand

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.560
stats for the different
kinds of reports.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.780
And you choose Stats here.

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.952
So we're looking at
tournament player stats.

00:46:07.952 --> 00:46:09.360
You could see we have this list.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.182
We're just looking at
the call stats here.

00:46:11.182 --> 00:46:12.390
You could see the scroll bar.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:13.494
So we have a lot.

00:46:13.494 --> 00:46:15.160
If you want to search
for specific ones,

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.743
you can just type-- if you type
three-bet in here you suddenly

00:46:17.743 --> 00:46:19.160
see only three-bet stats.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.860
So we're looking at a stat
called call preflop squeeze.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.390
If you were looking through
the stats and you saw this.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.270
And you said, well,
what is that situation.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:27.960
Well that situation
is described here

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.190
in details in the
detailed description.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:33.720
A squeeze is when someone has
made a raise and someone else

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.720
made a call.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.530
And then, somebody
three-bets both of them.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.944
That projects an image
of a lot of strength.

00:46:39.944 --> 00:46:41.860
This is talked about in
Harrington on Hold 'em

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.400
as a great way to make a
move because if someone makes

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.817
an open raise for three big
blinds and someone else calls,

00:46:47.817 --> 00:46:49.566
and you're sitting
there for 10 big blinds

00:46:49.566 --> 00:46:51.770
and you shovel all in,
the first player needs

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:55.600
to decide what's the guy behind
me who called going to do,

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.200
and what's this guy doing.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.750
He's got to have
a big hand if he's

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.740
able to shove all
in over both of us.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.200
So that raise is
call to squeeze.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.160
If you face a squeeze,
and you call it,

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.390
it will count for
this situation.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.722
If the player who made
the first raise folds,

00:47:08.722 --> 00:47:10.430
you still face the
squeeze if you called.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.411
So those are the two spots here.

00:47:12.411 --> 00:47:14.660
And you can see, we have the
detailed description that

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.340
explains exactly what it was.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:21.232
And the formula gives you
the actual numbers we used.

00:47:21.232 --> 00:47:22.815
We don't say multiply
by 100 here just

00:47:22.815 --> 00:47:24.149
to keep it a little bit simpler.

00:47:24.149 --> 00:47:25.606
We have these
detailed descriptions

00:47:25.606 --> 00:47:27.160
for every stat on the list.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.830
So if you are so inclined, you
can spend several hours reading

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:30.820
through our entire stat list.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.403
And I think you will probably
be the first person who has ever

00:47:33.403 --> 00:47:35.910
actually done it besides me.

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.260
So all right.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.860
We've talked a lot
about opponents

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.820
and what opponent stats can be.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.050
How do you find them?

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.050
How do I look at opponent
stats in PokerTracker?

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:47.260
This is going to be
important because you

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.270
need to figure out
what these numbers mean

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.700
for your various opponents.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.987
So the first way is in
the results section.

00:47:54.987 --> 00:47:56.320
We have a player summary report.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.980
We saw it in that
dropdown earlier.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.700
When you choose
this report, you're

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.130
going to get one
row per player--

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:02.630
and I blocked out
the players' names

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.130
for confidentiality reasons.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.505
But you can then see how many
tournaments they played in,

00:48:06.505 --> 00:48:08.320
what their VPIP is,
what their PFR is,

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.024
what their three-bet
is, how often were

00:48:10.024 --> 00:48:11.190
their three-bets successful.

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:13.210
That is how often they
three-bet and everyone

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.580
folded to it, which is really
fun because if you have

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.507
a really high
three-bet success, that

00:48:17.507 --> 00:48:19.340
means you can really
three-bet with impunity

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.464
because everyone's folding.

00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:22.150
And it's great.

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.530
So you pick up the open
raise, you pick up the blinds,

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.194
you can make lots of money.

00:48:26.194 --> 00:48:28.110
You can see this guy is
good at picking spots.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:30.210
He's got 64%, 65%.

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.150
This guy's terrible
at picking spots.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.300
He's only been successful
one time in three.

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.890
With 17 tournaments,
it's probably

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:39.060
some number like that,
two in six, one in three.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.810
So you want to go
deeper than that?

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:42.520
I thought you did.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.570
We've got the hero
versus villain report.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:48.320
And what this does is each
row again shows one player,

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.240
but it specifically
targets the hands

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.840
where you both put money in.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.620
So these are hands
you won money from him

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.130
or he won money from you.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:56.900
It breaks down by
different sizes,

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.358
so you can see if you won lots
of big hands or small hands.

00:48:59.358 --> 00:49:01.330
So like, we lost three
reasonable sized pots

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:01.830
to this guy.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:05.720
We don't have any big losses,
which is nice in this report.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.540
We don't have any
big wins either.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.142
We took three pretty
good sized pots from him.

00:49:10.142 --> 00:49:11.850
So if you highlight
one of these reports,

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.310
you're going to get the
hands you were involved

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:14.720
with this person in the bottom.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.125
So if one of your
friends has been

00:49:17.125 --> 00:49:18.750
playing in these
tournaments and saying

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:22.140
he's been beating up on you,
you can go look in PokerTracker

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.890
at the exact hands
you've played together,

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:27.450
and tell him you're full of
it because here our hands,

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:30.010
and I can see that you
did not beat me up.

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:33.306
Look, you three-bet me
once and I had four, two.

00:49:33.306 --> 00:49:34.930
I'm clearly not
calling your three bet.

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:37.820
That has nothing to do with you.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:42.160
So I'm sure you want to go
even deeper than that, right?

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.330
On the sidebar, we also
have this player box.

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:46.500
And you can choose a
new player, and you can

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.510
choose any of your opponents.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:50.880
And when you load them
in here, what you're

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.259
going to look at now is
all of the data in all

00:49:53.259 --> 00:49:55.050
of the reports of
PokerTracker-- everything

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:56.925
we've been talking about,
you will be looking

00:49:56.925 --> 00:49:58.160
at from his perspective.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.040
So you are looking at all of
the data through his eyes.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.350
And the only thing you need
to really keep in mind when

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:05.490
looking at data through
another player's eyes

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:08.646
is that you only get hole card
data when he reaches showdown.

00:50:08.646 --> 00:50:10.020
If he doesn't
reach showdown, you

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.640
don't know what his hole cards
are because the hand's not

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.520
going to tell you.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.200
But anything else, for all
hands that reach showdown,

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.310
you have full information.

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:23.370
You have all of our reports, all
of our stats, all the filters.

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:27.220
And if that is not enough for
you, I don't know what will be.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.797
So let's look at an example.

00:50:29.797 --> 00:50:31.630
We're going to look at
one example analysis.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.921
And hopefully, that will show
you how all of this stuff

00:50:33.921 --> 00:50:35.330
works together.

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:38.197
Let's say, there's one situation
that was really bugging us.

00:50:38.197 --> 00:50:40.030
We've been playing in
these tournaments that

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.863
are called Fifty50s.

00:50:40.863 --> 00:50:43.950
Fifty50 And the way
these work is that they

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:45.570
pay out the top 5 places.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.240
10 people start,
five people get paid.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.067
Once it gets down
to five players,

00:50:50.067 --> 00:50:51.400
everyone gets their buy in back.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.170
So if you've bought it for
$10, once you get in the top 5,

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:56.100
you definitely
get your $10 back.

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.550
And everybody who
is in the top 5

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.300
has some amount of chips left.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.700
So it takes the other
half of the prize pool

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.200
and gives it out
to all the players,

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.640
based on how many
chips they have.

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.910
So that that's how a
Fifty50 tournament works.

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:11.450
And we want to look at
times we're in the big blind

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:13.710
because we're been playing
a lot of these; times we

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:14.392
were six handed.

00:51:14.392 --> 00:51:15.350
So we're on the bubble.

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:18.430
Once one more player goes
out, the tournament is over.

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:20.000
That is the end
of the tournament.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.333
And we want to look at times
we have king, queen offsuit

00:51:22.333 --> 00:51:24.110
because that hand's
been bugging us.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:26.200
We don't need any
other reason, but we

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.890
have a real situation here.

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:30.370
So you go into the sidebar.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:31.800
You pick your Fifty50 flag.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.110
That will limit it to
Fifty50 tournaments.

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:37.170
You go in to Hand Details,
Number of Players.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:38.740
Players dealt in a
hand, six to six.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.156
So now we're looking
at six handed

00:51:40.156 --> 00:51:41.750
play in Fifty50 tournaments.

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:45.860
Actions and Opportunities,
Preflop, Post Big Blind--

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:47.360
bang-- add that to filter.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.200
Now we're looking at big blind
play in a Fifty50 tournament

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.250
six handed.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.950
Hand Values.

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:54.840
We just turn on king, queen.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.240
That's king, queen
offsuit there.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.420
King, queen suited
is on the other side.

00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:59.140
And we go into Actions and
Opportunities, Preflop,

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.369
and turn on Opportunities,
and turn on Faced All In.

00:52:01.369 --> 00:52:01.910
We add those.

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.740
We have all of our
filters right here.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.870
And so now, we have picked
out our situation entirely.

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.150
And we can look at our spot.

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.630
We have two hands in our
database that match that.

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.474
It may have felt like
you had a lot of data,

00:52:14.474 --> 00:52:16.390
but sometimes, when you
go and you look at it,

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:18.514
it turns out you don't have
as much as you thought.

00:52:18.514 --> 00:52:19.210
And that's OK.

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:21.209
We're still going to look
at one of those hands.

00:52:21.209 --> 00:52:22.372
We've got two hands here.

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:23.580
We'll look at the second one.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.621
We're going to replay it.

00:52:24.621 --> 00:52:26.910
We're going to see it in
the PokerTracker replayer.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:30.310
So here is our spot.

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.310
Let's take a moment to look at.

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:34.390
We're in the big blind,
just like we said.

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:36.510
We have king and a queen.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:38.800
Fold, fold, fold, fold.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.180
And this guy pushes all in.

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.450
So we're facing our
all in from him.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:46.690
So our chip stack is 1,955.

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:48.430
His chip stack was 725.

00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:50.610
Our blinds were 60 and 120.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:52.990
And there was a 15 chip ante.

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.910
So we have 90 chips.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:56.230
These were from the ante here.

00:52:56.230 --> 00:53:00.260
So we have to choose if we
want to call his 605 chip bet,

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.500
or we want to fold to it with
king, queen here in this spot.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.060
So I want you to take
a second and think

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.070
about whether you would call
here or whether you would fold.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:12.330
Remember, if you call
and you bust him,

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:14.180
the tournament is over.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.610
You definitely win
money because he's out.

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.390
You are in the top,
and you get more money

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:22.300
based on your chip
stack plus your but-in.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:26.740
If you fold here, he
now picks up 210 chips.

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.640
He now has 935 chips.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.790
He's still the short stack, and
we're going to keep playing.

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:34.010
You have a king and a queen.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:37.070
I want you to just take a second
and think about our situation.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.770
The first thing you
should be thinking about,

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.228
and I hope you were
thinking about,

00:53:46.228 --> 00:53:48.390
right now, is what
hands would he

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:51.950
be playing to make
this all in raise with.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:53.870
Obviously, he could have aces.

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:55.680
Obviously, he could have kings.

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.630
What other hand?

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:58.860
How far down is he
going to go when

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.770
he makes this all in range?

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.290
And before we can make any
adjustments based on stats,

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:05.920
we have to have a baseline
because if we think

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.790
the baseline player is playing
all in with any two cards here,

00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:12.300
it's going to radically
change how we adjust based

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.880
on his stats because if
he's tighter than average,

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.890
tighter than average
of 100% is going

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:20.630
to be very different than
tighter than average of 10%.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:23.840
So think about what you think
an unknown player would play.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.900
Start to build this
model in your head.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.390
This is what all the
big name pros will do.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.980
They are able to
have a baseline model

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:34.587
and then adjust based on
individual characteristics.

00:54:34.587 --> 00:54:35.420
So think about that.

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.860
Think about what kinds
of hands he would play.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.596
Now let's add some stats.

00:54:40.596 --> 00:54:41.970
Now we're going
to start refining

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:43.121
our model on this player.

00:54:43.121 --> 00:54:45.620
We've got a baseline idea in
our head of what kinds of hands

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:46.660
he's going to play.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:47.285
Now let's look.

00:54:47.285 --> 00:54:48.750
We have 73 hands of data.

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:51.010
His VPIP is 11.

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.964
So in this 73 hands
that this guy's

00:54:52.964 --> 00:54:55.380
been playing, so it's probably
about two tournaments worth

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.850
given the length of these terms.

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.690
In two tournaments'
worth, he has put money

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.710
in 11% of the time-- 1 hand
in 9, this guy is playing.

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.250
That's it.

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:06.344
Preflop raise, 1%.

00:55:06.344 --> 00:55:08.260
And I can tell you because
I did double check.

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:12.120
This means, of his 73 hands,
he raised preflop before this

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.140
exactly in only one time.

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:15.100
That's it.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:15.934
Only once ever.

00:55:15.934 --> 00:55:17.600
In both tournaments
we've seen him play,

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.850
he's only ever
raised once before.

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:24.160
I hope that that changes
what hands you think this guy

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.140
is going to play, at
least a little bit.

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:31.350
Now we can look a little
bit deeper in his stats

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:33.682
and try to see if there's
any information there.

00:55:33.682 --> 00:55:35.390
Let's look at his
small blind statistics.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:37.572
This is the Tools pop-up here.

00:55:37.572 --> 00:55:39.030
We're just looking
at the top half.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.405
There's some stuff
in the bottom,

00:55:40.405 --> 00:55:43.250
but it's all postflop stuff,
so it's not relevant right now.

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:45.300
So let's just look
at small blind here.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.790
His VPIP from the
small blind is 13%.

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:50.470
So one time out of eight, he put
money in from the small blind.

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:52.720
He has never raised
from the small blind,

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.470
ever, ever-- not once.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:58.890
So he did no raises of any kind.

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:00.740
He seems to call
across all positions.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.520
So here are his callings.

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.230
These are from the
preflop section.

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.290
You can see he calls
from everywhere.

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:08.190
He's called 4 out of 25 hands.

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:09.850
He's called cold
twice, which means

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:11.510
you call without having
put money in the pot.

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:12.968
You can't call cold
from the blind.

00:56:12.968 --> 00:56:15.570
That's why these are
going to be zeros.

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.700
He limps behind
limpers 1 out a 7.

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.230
So he's not attacking people
who just called big blind.

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:24.900
He's not attacking people
who are acting weak.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.230
He is folding to a
blind steal twice.

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:29.370
When he's in a blind,
he's perfectly happy

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:30.780
to give his blinds up.

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.150
A blind steal is when you're
in a blind and someone

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:34.990
in the cutoff, or the
button, the last two

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:37.614
positions who haven't put blind
money in-- they make a raise.

00:56:37.614 --> 00:56:39.280
So when you're facing
a raise from them,

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.940
it's called facing a steal.

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.290
He's done that twice and
he folded both times.

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:45.510
So you can start to
a piece all of this

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:46.640
together and get an idea.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.080
But this sample is not huge.

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.750
So think about what hands
this specific player

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:57.400
is likely to raise
all in with, now

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.370
that we have all of
this information.

00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:04.940
Remember, his tournament
life is on the line.

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:07.780
If he is called, and he loses,
he is out of the tournament,

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.800
he wins absolutely nothing.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.990
But he's the short stack.

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:19.070
He has an m of about 2.7.

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:21.521
He could go less than three
orbits before he is completely

00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:22.770
out of chips, just by folding.

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:24.510
So he has to make a
move at some point.

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:26.965
He has to pick a hand
and make a stand soon.

00:57:26.965 --> 00:57:29.090
So the fact that his
tournament life is on the line

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.460
is going to make him
tighter because he doesn't

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:32.660
want to lose the tournament.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:34.910
The fact that he is so
short with such a short m,

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:36.300
is going to make him looser.

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.550
So these kind of are in
conflict with one another.

00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:39.925
And as you play
more tournaments,

00:57:39.925 --> 00:57:43.070
you're going to find
out how they poll.

00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:46.990
Do you think this guy is going
to play low pocket pairs?

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:49.100
Do you think he's going
to pick deuces here,

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:52.200
and happy to play a coin
flipper for his tournament life?

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.620
I see one person
shaking his head.

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:55.720
What about weak aces?

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.470
Do you think ace,
four offsuit is OK?

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:00.750
Do you think he's willing
to take his tournament

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:04.952
life into his hands with
just a really weak ace?

00:58:04.952 --> 00:58:05.910
What about king, queen.

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:07.284
Could we have the
same hand here?

00:58:07.284 --> 00:58:09.200
Would he make this
shove with my hand?

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.000
King, 10?

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.890
Could we have him
completely dominated?

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:13.560
So that's another poker term.

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.270
If you have the same
card and your other card

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:19.330
is better than theirs,
it's called dominating.

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:22.920
You're 70 to 30 favorite in
that spot-- something like that.

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.560
A queen, jack-- same
kind of situation.

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.230
If he's willing to do
it with these hands,

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:31.540
then we're in a really
great spot, right?

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:36.690
We have to decide what this
player would open raise with.

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:39.390
So now we're starting
to build that model.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:44.380
Remember, his VPIP is 11%,
so let's start-- first,

00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:48.970
if you want to convert
percentages to actual hands,

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:50.680
the equity calculator
in PokerTracker

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.150
will help you with
this because it's

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:55.631
kind of hard to know
what 11% of hands is.

00:58:55.631 --> 00:58:57.630
Especially if you don't
have experience with it,

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.160
you're like, I don't know.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.020
So you can come into
the equity calculator.

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.485
And you can pop that open.

00:59:03.485 --> 00:59:05.110
And you can choose
Hand Range Selector.

00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:06.776
And then you can use
the slider, and you

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:08.070
can see what the model says.

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:09.653
Again, we're still
in Glansky-Carlson.

00:59:09.653 --> 00:59:11.760
You can play between the models.

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:14.090
So this is 15%.

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:16.230
So think about the
hands that you've just

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:18.530
decided this guy's
willing to go all in with.

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:22.210
Here's a 15% range according
to Glansky-Carlson.

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:23.161
Wider.

00:59:23.161 --> 00:59:23.660
Looser.

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:30.180
So this guys is down to ace,
four suitedl down to king,

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:33.280
10 suited; pairs, down to three
not twos; and down to ace,

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:36.570
eight. that's 15% of all hands.

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:41.210
Well, we said he'll play 11% of
hands, overall over 73 hands.

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:45.660
So let's start by saying,
any hand in the top 11%.

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.762
He'll play those.

00:59:46.762 --> 00:59:47.970
It's not going to be perfect.

00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:49.607
Our sample's not fantastic.

00:59:49.607 --> 00:59:51.940
We know this, but we're trying
to get an idea for what's

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.000
right to do here in the spot.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.480
So this is the top 11%.

00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.070
You don't have the
bottom two pairs.

00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:59.770
You don't have any
weak aces at all.

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.780
Even ace, nine is
considered a middling ace.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.320
So that's not too bad.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.520
He has no weak suited aces.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.892
That's a 11% range.

01:00:06.892 --> 01:00:08.100
That's a pretty strong range.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:15.180
So PokerTracker also has a built
in calculator that does ICM.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.610
ICM stands for the
Independent Chip Model.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:20.640
This has been out there
for a little while.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:25.260
And what the ICM does is
it takes tournament chips

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:27.352
and converts them to
real world dollars

01:00:27.352 --> 01:00:29.310
because tournament chips
and real world dollars

01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:31.661
don't have a one
to one correlation

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:33.160
because your last
tournament chip is

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.400
worth a lot more than
your thousandth tournament

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.230
chip, if you have 1,000 chip
stack-- because once you're

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:38.450
out, you can win nothing.

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.840
But that extra chip
doesn't mean quite as much.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.610
So this model takes your
equity, your total chip stack,

01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:47.900
and gives you a result as
an equity in the prize pool.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.790
It says, with this chip
stack, if everything

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:54.391
were even-- ceteris paribus--
nothing else to be considered,

01:00:54.391 --> 01:00:56.140
this is what your
equity in the prize pool

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.880
should be according
to the model.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.330
This has been there in the
replayer the entire time.

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:03.810
I don't know if you noticed
it, but if you click it,

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:06.067
it will show you the
results in this spot.

01:01:06.067 --> 01:01:08.650
So we're going to be looking at
the times we face this all in,

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:11.990
and we will see what
the average model says

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:17.280
whether we should push or fold
in this spot with this hand.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.070
So who thinks we should
call his all in raise,

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:22.380
if he was an average player?

01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:30.630
Everyone else I
presume says fold.

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:31.860
The default model says call.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.237
Everyone who raised
your hand, you guys win.

01:01:34.237 --> 01:01:36.070
So you can click the
blue results link here,

01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:37.440
you can see the full ICM tree.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.160
But the important
thing to note right now

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.000
is you can look and see
what your prize pool

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.916
equity is, right here.

01:01:41.916 --> 01:01:44.320
If you push, you can
say you would have,

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.310
against the average model,
a 15.83% equity in the prize

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:49.070
pool.

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:50.930
If you fold, 15.28%.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:54.470
Now keep in mind, this is just
against the average model.

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:56.270
This is not based
on anything we've

01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:58.410
done specifically to
analyze this player.

01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.950
But the good news is,
we can change that.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.700
And we can see what
the model's range was.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.241
So when we click
results, we're going

01:02:04.241 --> 01:02:07.460
to see what the model says the
average player would raise all

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:10.030
in with in this spot.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:19.880
And the default range is--
drum roll, please-- 33.9%.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.920
The default model says
the average player

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.355
will raise all in
with an m of 2.7,

01:02:24.355 --> 01:02:29.020
when folded to in the small
blind with about 34% of hands.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:33.630
We built this model using some
pretty robust data analysis.

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:36.890
But as we've seen, different
players play very differently.

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:40.100
And this player is most
certainly not average

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.802
because we put him on somewhere
much tighter than 33.9%.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.510
And you can see push
equity here and fold

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:46.820
equity or not that different.

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:49.130
We're only talking
0.6% of the prize pool.

01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:50.680
So if we're playing
a $10 tournament,

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.170
we're talking about the
difference between an expected

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.180
result of $0.60.

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:57.550
It's not huge, but each
little edge in poker

01:02:57.550 --> 01:03:00.410
adds up, one piece right
on top of the other.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.410
And making these decisions
in the marginal spots

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:04.690
is really how you can
expand your advantage

01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:06.740
and play better
than your opponents.

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.795
So let's change that.

01:03:07.795 --> 01:03:09.670
So you can click right
here, once you've been

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:11.740
looking at the model results.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.250
You can change his range.

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:16.540
So this, by the way,
is what 33% looks like.

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:19.760
So the average player here
shoving as weak as queen,

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.450
eight suited; king, two
suited; king, six offsuit;

01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:25.060
any pair; any ace.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.690
That's a lot of hands.

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:29.930
These are weak, weak hands.

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:30.660
So we change it.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.430
We'll drag the slider down
from 33.8% down to 11%.

01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:37.250
Suddenly, now we're looking
at a whole lot tighter range.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:41.615
With the updated range,
who thinks it's a call now?

01:03:41.615 --> 01:03:43.740
Good, I'm glad nobody thinks
it's a call because it

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.500
is in fact, a fold.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.970
So by looking at this
player, by doing analysis

01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:52.320
of his previous play, we were
able to turn a close call

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.260
into a close fold.

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.250
And so in this spot,
when he has this range,

01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:01.910
our push equity is 14.85% and
fold equity is 15 and 1/4%.

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:03.850
And you can actually
play with this.

01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:05.910
And you can keep changing
and updating the range.

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:07.700
And you can figure out
what break even is.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.767
So if he knew what
our cards, were,

01:04:09.767 --> 01:04:11.600
if we turned them face
up, we can figure out

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.840
what's the game theory optimal
pushing range for him, right?

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.460
When we turn our king, queen up,
if he could play perfect poker,

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.216
he would have
pushed a 24% range.

01:04:20.216 --> 01:04:22.340
That would be king, nine
suited; any ace; any pair;

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.980
queen, ten suited; king,
10 offsuit, or better.

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.040
If we think he is
pushing less than that,

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.120
it's definitely a fold for us.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.930
If he is pushing more
than that, it's a call.

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:35.440
So we now have established
what a break even

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.320
range is for us facing a
push from a short stack

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.330
at the end of a tournament in
a tournament type that we play.

01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:46.450
So next time that we're
sitting in the big blind,

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:48.850
and we face a shove from
a short stack, who's

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:51.470
in the small blind,
we have a better idea

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:53.719
of what things to look at
and how much to skew things

01:04:53.719 --> 01:04:54.510
based on his range.

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:56.250
If you're starting
to see 50%, 60%,

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.930
and you're sitting with king,
queen, you're in a great spot

01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:02.690
to call, assuming you're in
a otherwise similar situation

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:05.290
with your chips relative
to the rest of the table.

01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:09.720
But in this spot, against
this guy, it's a fold.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.550
So of course, in the
actual tournament,

01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:16.455
hero called because you
always make the wrong play

01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:18.080
the first time you're
in the situation.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.970
So hero called here with
king, queen offsuit.

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:24.700
And we get a lovely,
wonderful flop.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.280
We've got the king, nine, two.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.470
So hurray, we hit our pair.

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:29.840
This is great.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.487
Your heart starts racing.

01:05:31.487 --> 01:05:32.195
There's the turn.

01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:33.580
It's an offsuit seven.

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.230
Fantastical.

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.880
If he has two diamonds, he
doesn't have a flush yet.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.920
None of the straights came in.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.170
Uh-oh.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.170
There's another diamond.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:44.470
So now if he has two diamonds,
he could have a flush.

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:46.687
One of the hands that was
in his range was ace, king.

01:05:46.687 --> 01:05:48.270
If he has ace, king,
he also beats is.

01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:52.580
So if he has queens, kings,
aces, ace king, or any two

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.370
diamonds, he wins.

01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:58.240
And of course, his actual
hand was ace, five offsuit.

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.280
I want to point out
that ace, five offsuit

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.060
was not in our range
analysis for him.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.400
So our range was
actually too tight.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.130
So in the future,
when we're trying

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:15.050
to do this kind of analysis, we
can update our range by saying,

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:17.480
hey, the last time I
did an analysis of a guy

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.190
that I thought was really
tight, when he was super short,

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:21.770
he was looser than I thought.

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:23.280
You can add those
extra few percent

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:29.420
in when you're updating
your ranges later.

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:30.660
No worries about ace, king.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.451
Certainly no flush.

01:06:31.451 --> 01:06:33.920
He did have one diamond though.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.750
So here are our take aways.

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:41.810
You should think about poker as
a series of discrete decisions

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:44.430
that you're going to
make when you're playing.

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:46.810
You can use PokerTracker's
filter system

01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:49.890
to target those very
specific decisions.

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:51.640
As we've seen, you can
filter for anything

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.000
under the sun you would like.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.520
You can save filters for later.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.520
So target those.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.480
Pick the spots that bug you.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.440
Pick the spots that
you're going to remember.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.590
Next time you have six, six,
and you're out of position,

01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:04.759
and it's on the flop, and
there's a king up there,

01:07:04.759 --> 01:07:06.800
and you made a raise
preflop, and you're not sure

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.770
whether you should bet
or you should check,

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:10.686
you can pick that spot
and you can look at it.

01:07:10.686 --> 01:07:13.850
And when you check, call,
then the turn is a queen,

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:16.360
you can decide, do I want to
check or do I want to bet.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.580
You can pick these spots.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:21.126
And then when the river 10
comes, it just sucks to be you.

01:07:21.126 --> 01:07:23.040
You can use the
available information

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.950
to build a mental model
of your opponents.

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:27.280
Look, this is the way
people play poker.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.379
You try to imagine what's going
on in your opponent's head.

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:32.420
You try to go, how is this
player going to think.

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.820
How does he make decisions.

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.965
So that's what I'm
calling this mental model.

01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:38.340
It's all of the
heuristics that's

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:43.480
going on in his head or her head
to make a specific decision.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.514
Analyze your options based
on your mental model.

01:07:45.514 --> 01:07:46.680
Think about what you can do.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:50.130
Think about how his actions
are going to affect your play.

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:51.780
Think about how your
hand affects it.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:54.760
And when your mental model
is proven wrong, like it just

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:58.340
was, we did not think that
guy had ace, five offsuit,

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.630
you can adjust your model.

01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:02.880
And you will get better at
poker if you continue to analyze

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.900
your game one hand at the time.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:10.720
So I hope that that
was instructive

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.740
and that I opened your eyes
a little bit to all the power

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:17.080
that PokerTracker
has to offer for you.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.030
If you have any questions,
I'd be happy to take them.

01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:24.880
