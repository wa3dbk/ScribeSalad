00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:21.840
KEVIN DESMOND: All
right, everyone.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.080
So welcome to 15.S50,
Poker Theory and Analytics.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080
So this is going to be
Monday, Wednesday, Friday

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.900
from 3:30 to 5:00.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.659
I just got a room for a
review session on Tuesday,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.910
Thursday for anyone who needs
to catch up a little bit.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.700
The class is here, 4370.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.450
I'm Kevin Desmond.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.741
I'm going to be the instructor.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.380
Paul Mende is the
faculty advisor.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.500
And this is worth
three H credits.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.300
The game play aspect--
so this is what I did.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.010
And I think this is really cool.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.390
So Poker Stars gave us our own
private league for only MIT

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.400
people in this course.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.730
And my goal here is
to separate people

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.930
who are fairly new from people
who are very competitive,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.460
because I don't want someone not
to pass the course because they

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.020
happen to be not
that great at poker.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.950
So I created this thing
called the Beginners' League.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.680
And these are going
to be Daily Turbos.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.790
Turbos means they're
fast-ish tournaments.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.800
And to get the game play
credit, you can cash,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.960
you can make money
in one of them,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.610
or you can play in 10 of them.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.720
So those who are struggling
can get this game play credit

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.910
by playing 10 tournaments, which
is about a 10-hour commitment.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.510
Let's go into the
game play aspect more.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.680
So Poker Stars created
this private league for us,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.780
which is really cool.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.870
So Poker Stars is generally
considered the most reputable

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.160
online poker site.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.520
That's why we use them.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.725
So they have two
different types of games.

00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:52.600
So they have real money
and play money games.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.540
Now if you're in the US,
you can't do real money.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.565
It used to be something
that was very gray area.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.130
And then there was one
poker site which turned out

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.720
to be legitimately like a
Ponzi scheme, and as a result,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.260
now poker in the US is like
much more black and white,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.220
definitely not OK
for real money.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.050
However, their play money
scene is pretty resilient,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.102
and that's what we're
taking advantage of here.

00:02:22.102 --> 00:02:24.060
The Poker Stars play
money scene is broken down

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.290
into two different things.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.340
They have public games, where
you can just go and play

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.950
for play chips against anyone
in the world, which is cool.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.690
And you can do that,
and I recommend

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.469
you give it a shot just to
get used to the software.

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.010
In addition, you
could do home games,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.410
which is what we're
generally going to be doing.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.650
That's what they call
their private leagues.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.230
So in the private leagues,
in their home games,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.700
they have this showcase.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.090
And you might notice
as soon as you log in

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.210
that the MIT League, Poker
Theory and Analytics,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.570
is already at the top.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.650
That's not just for us.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.950
That's for everyone.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.630
Anyone in the world who
logs into Poker Stars

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.080
and looks at home games
has the MIT League

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.530
at the top, which I
think is really cool.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.910
So to access this, I'll send
a more specific instructions

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.410
later.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.904
I gave you guys just the
passcode of what you need.

00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:15.820
But to actually get
there, what you need to do

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.610
is, you log into Poker Stars.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.120
You go to this button,
which is a little house,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.490
to access home games.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.560
And then you want
to join a game.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.376
And what you do is, you put
the Club ID, which is 557832.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.250
You put the invitation
code, which you're all

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.690
going to have on Stellar.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.860
And then you put your real
name, preferably the one that's

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.600
listed in the course,
because I actually

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.910
have to approve everyone
that joins the league,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.470
and I can't do it just based
on someone's screen name.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.594
And I guess you have to
agree to some sort of terms

00:03:44.594 --> 00:03:45.470
and conditions.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.930
So let's talk
about hand history.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.100
So a lot of analytics
are going to be based off

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.470
of hand histories, which are
just text files that Poker

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.830
Stars gives you to the extent
that you indicate that you want

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.060
to save them down.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.030
So these are kind of
jumbled messes of text.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.110
Each line just shows
one thing that happens.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.110
And you might get
used to reading it,

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.691
or might not,
depending on how much

00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:10.940
you're going to scrutinize it.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.450
But more importantly,
you can use

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.320
these in all the data
analytic programs

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.589
that we're going to use.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.550
In particular, Poker
Tracker runs off of that.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.770
You'll load just thousands
of hands into Poker Tracker,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.400
and it'll do analytics for you.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.540
It knows exactly what's going on
based on that format, which is

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.390
generally considered universal.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.805
And then for the sake of
visualizing these hands--

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:37.180
if you just read
it, that's fine.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.170
But then if you want
to show other people,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.420
I'm recommending we use
something called the Universal

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.360
Hand History Replayer, which
is something that's free.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.950
And what it does, it just reads
the hands, and it plays them.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.940
It animates what happened as
if you were seeing it for real.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.430
So the deal with
hand histories is,

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.080
if you're a real money player,
Poker Stars dedicates databases

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.440
of hand histories so
that, if you want,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.810
you can request all your
hand histories at any time.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.520
For play money players, they
let you capture your own hand

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.200
histories if you want, but they
definitely don't save them.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.369
So the reason I'm
showing you this now,

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:17.160
and I'm going to email
it out to you later,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.520
is if you lose your
hand histories,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.300
so you don't capture
them in time,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.340
you'll never get them back.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.967
So make sure you're actually
capturing hand histories,

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:29.550
because we're going to be using
that for a lot of the analysis

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.212
we do.

00:05:31.212 --> 00:05:32.670
OK, so let's talk
about the league.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.530
And honestly, I
think this league

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.000
is going to be really cool.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.450
Usually the
evolution of a player

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.310
is they're terrible at
poker, and then they

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.250
start becoming good at
playing against bad people.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.817
And then when they actually
start playing for real,

00:05:47.817 --> 00:05:49.400
they get crushed
again because they're

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.160
used to playing against
other bad people.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.610
So this will actually
hopefully get

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.330
you used to playing
against other people who

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.110
are playing correctly, which is
not something you can commonly

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.480
learn just from playing
around with your friends.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.980
In addition through playing
in these online leagues,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.020
you can collect stats
that you could never

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.410
get from playing live.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:22.030
And I think this is why the
live tournament scene is

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.140
dominated by online pros.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:30.230
It's because no live pro
can get as many hands

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.350
or analyze their play in the
way that you can do online.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.980
It's not even comparable.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.500
So this is given-- even if your
whole intention is to only play

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.330
live the entire rest your life,
doing this type of analytics

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.380
would give you a chance to
learn at a much faster rate

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.530
and learn things that
you would never see live.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.020
So every week we're going to
have a major tournament, which

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.450
is basically going to be
the same structure, maybe

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.250
a little bit slower, than
the ones we do daily,

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.470
except they're going
to have real prizes.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.970
So Akuna is giving us, for
their first tournament,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.270
Beats headphones.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.250
And Apple TV, Bose speakers
and a lot of gift cards.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.800
And then for their
second tournament,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.770
they're giving us
all of those things

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.430
plus an iPad Air
and an iPad Mini.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.650
But we're not done yet.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.480
Because this class is
focused on playing live,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.130
we're going to end the
class with a live tournament

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.940
sponsored by Optiver
on the 31st, which

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.240
is the day after the
last day of the class.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.990
So after the league's
over, and after you

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.430
guys are good at poker,
you'll have an opportunity

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.080
to play each other in a live
tournament, where their prize

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.740
pool is all of the Akuna
prizes, plus a PlayStation

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.300
4, plus an iPad, plus a
Kindle, and plus a GoPro.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:03.430
I want this to reflect
the type of things

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.830
an online, multi-table
tournament player would do.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.810
How it normally works is,
during the week, and basically

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.300
every single day, there
is a uniform amount

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.810
of tournaments that will
just run every single day

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.320
at the top of the hour.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.240
And these pros will
just grind those out.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.660
They'll get used
to the structure.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.930
And that's where they'll
kind of grind their teeth.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.120
And then on the
weekends, that's when

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.390
you get a lot of the square
money, a lot of the newer guys

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.240
who only play poker
on the weekend.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.690
And those are more gimmicky,
idiosyncratic tournaments,

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.940
but also the highest value.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.650
So that's why I'm producing the
tournament structure like this,

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.360
where the bulk of
your tournaments

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.980
will be very similar
to each other.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.060
But then the tournaments
that really matter

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.712
will be completely different,
at least relatively different.

00:08:56.712 --> 00:08:57.920
So that's why I'm doing that.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.870
That'll make you
get a feel for what

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.590
these guys have to go through.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.520
So let's talk about turbos.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.340
Turbos let you focus on
pre-flop decisions, which

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.020
are the area where I
think there is the most

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.360
to learn among people
who are new at poker.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.680
Basically, all of
your value that you're

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.320
losing in tournament is
from screwing up pre-flop.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.950
No one gets that right live
because it's really difficult

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.320
to be able to feel comfortable
doing what's generally

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.150
considered right.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.570
And we're going to spend
a lot of time on pre-flop.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.250
But these turbos encourage
you to do that sort of thing,

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.300
because live is a
lot of pre-flop,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.810
and you're going to be doing
that in the turbos online, too.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.840
In addition, no
one wants to spend

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.580
six hours doing a tournament.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.290
So I'm making these
turbos so you can

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.440
be in and out in 45 minutes.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.300
And then you boot up
another tournament,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.620
or you can be done with
poker for that night.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.890
In addition, you have
the opportunity--

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.770
you can play as many
tournaments as you want.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.880
It's common for pros to do
something called multi-tabling

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.900
which is they'll do multiple
tournaments at the same time.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.150
For the beginners, I'd probably
recommend you just do one.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.090
But for the regular
league, have at that.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.290
you want to do like all four
tournaments at the same time,

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.450
go ahead, to the extent
that they overlap

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.410
with each other a little bit.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:20.910
OK.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.576
So that's the end
with the prize league.

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:25.890
So the schedule is, we're
going to go through what

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.390
I'm calling basic
strategy, which

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:35.270
are the basic axioms that we're
going to be using in order

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:40.122
to analyze the decision
making process in poker.

00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:42.080
Then we're going to be
doing pre-flop analysis.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.690
And we're going to be doing
a lot of this, because this

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.930
is really where the
value add is going to be,

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.080
is getting this right.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.750
I think the way
that we can tackle

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.460
this thing is kind of a
way I recommend that you

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.370
learn anything complicated.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.450
So we're going to
break this down

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.140
into three different sections.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.220
Fundamental concept, practice,
which are actually implementing

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.610
those concepts when you have
10 seconds to make a decision,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.240
and then more advanced stuff.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.550
With regard to
concepts, I'm going

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.080
to call this the basic
framework for decision making.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.250
It's being unexploitable.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.870
You want to get to the level
when you sit down at a table,

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.960
every pro in the room
doesn't turn and go,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.830
I want to sit at
that guy's table.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.590
You want to be a
slightly winning player

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:39.240
way before you want to
become a huge winning player.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.200
In order to let you
know the type of thing

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.750
that we're learning, I'm going
to label the slides with this,

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.000
to indicate that this
is like a basic concept.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.200
Learn this thing
before you move on.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.260
The advanced stuff
is, once you learn

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.660
how to do things-- which how
to do things is pretty broad--

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.040
we're going to learn minor
adjustments that we can do

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.690
to get quite a bit
of extra money,

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.700
like how to grind out that
additional half big blind

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.710
an hour out of our opponents.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.990
So any real deviations
from what we normally

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.680
do, in addition to meta game.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.810
Meta game is always
fun, like anything

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.950
not related to the
hand to hand decision

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.940
making process, like
table selection,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:37.100
or bankroll
management, or deciding

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.510
whether or not to play.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.010
That stuff is really
fun, and that's

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.001
to be indicated
by this ace here.

00:12:42.001 --> 00:12:42.500
OK.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.290
So I'm going to label those
slides for anything that's

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.320
considered advanced, and stuff
you should only really do

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.511
when you get the concepts down.

00:12:50.511 --> 00:12:52.052
And then a lot of
this class is going

00:12:52.052 --> 00:12:58.700
to be focused on practice, which
is how to actually implement

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.700
these concepts on a day to
day basis when you're actually

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.020
playing, especially live.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.220
We are not going to have
all the information.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.020
We're not going to
have calculators,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.760
and we're not going to have that
much time to make a decision.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.810
So how to apply these in real
time, making rules of thumb,

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.830
figuring out what
you can just ignore

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.930
and what you have
to definitely do,

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.160
and then some the
psychology stuff related

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.020
to actually performing
live is going

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.940
to be what I'm calling
practice, which

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.640
is going to be indicated by
that poker chip with a P in it.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.710
Let's talk about what I'm
bringing to the table here.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.710
So this course is
primarily going

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.200
to be from my perspective.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:50.120
And the decisions about what
I'm going to teach you here,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.160
and the value calls
I'm making, is

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.100
going to come from what I
consider the appropriate way

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.920
for someone to play poker.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.810
So my background is that I
was an online multi-table

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.320
tournament grinder, not
because I was a great pro,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.270
but because I sat
more than I played.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.810
I was definitely a
person who did not

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.346
play every single tournament.

00:14:15.346 --> 00:14:17.265
I told you the World
Series of Poker

00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:19.540
has like 25 different
tournaments.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.060
10 are Texas Hold'em.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.920
And then they have an Omaha
tournament, and a horse

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.740
tournament, which is
a combination of five

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.930
different games.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.860
And what is common is
that any pro who plays one

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.110
plays them all.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.870
I consider that ridiculous
for someone who's actually

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.040
interested in making any sort of
money or career playing poker.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.990
So I'm definitely someone
who prefers identifying

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.570
value and monetizing it.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.410
So anyway, that's
the perspective

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.500
that I'm going to be
teaching this course from.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.260
I like ROI.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.020
It's a great efficiency metric.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.710
Usually you try to maximize
your ROI up until the point

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.590
where it's below
some sort of hourly

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.810
that you set for
yourself, because one

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.970
of the ways you supplement ROI
is by moving down in stakes.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.140
Usually lower stakes
are easier games.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.110
You should have a
higher win rate.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.700
But that win rate's multiplied
by a much lower number.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.380
So usually you're going to move
around in stakes until you have

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.810
a good ROI, but hopefully above
what you consider your lowest

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.871
amount that you can feel
comfortable earning.

00:15:28.871 --> 00:15:30.870
In addition, I want to
focus on live tournaments

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.970
because who knows what's
going to happen to online?

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.390
Whereas I think live
tournaments are very social,

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.490
they're very public.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.240
Everyone knows who
wins live tournaments.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.980
So I'm going to teach in
a way such that focuses

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.465
on these types of values.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:49.860
OK.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:57.847
So let's move on to some
of the concepts and tools

00:15:57.847 --> 00:15:58.930
that we're going to learn.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:04.050
So we're done learning about
what we're actually going

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.360
to be doing during this class.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.570
So let's learn a
little bit about poker.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.800
So first thing is, we're going
to be using PokerTracker a lot.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.120
So I'm going to
email out exactly

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.840
how to install this thing.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.620
PokerTracker has
donated 115 licenses

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.350
to their product for us.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.290
And then our next
lesson, on Wednesday,

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.400
is going to be Joel
Fried teaching us

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.690
how to use this thing and going
through some of the analytics.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.240
So one other thing
that I like using

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.600
is the Universal Replayer.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.510
And what this thing does is it
just visualizes hand histories.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.440
So you'll feed it a hand
history in a text file.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.470
It animates it.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.510
It probably does other
things, but it's free.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.910
And this thing's been
around for a while.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.984
I've not even sure if
it's supported anymore.

00:16:51.984 --> 00:16:53.400
But it's a thing
that I'm used to.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.470
So this is what it looks like.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.995
So you give it a
hand, and then it

00:16:57.995 --> 00:17:01.340
reproduces what you might
have seen if you actually

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.110
played that hand.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.400
So let's move on to a concept.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.400
So stack size.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.349
So this might seem
fairly simple,

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.240
but we ought to make sure we're
talking about the same thing

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.660
when we go through this.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.520
So your stack size,
it's the value

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.200
of the chips in front of you.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.066
So that's fairly normal.

00:17:21.066 --> 00:17:23.440
But we have this thing called
effective stack size, which

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.981
is what we're usually going to
be talking about when we refer

00:17:25.981 --> 00:17:31.320
to stack, which is the
minimum of your stack

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.330
or the next biggest
stack after you.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.610
And the way to
think about this is

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:41.680
the number of chips you could
possibly lose in this one hand.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.200
That's what your
relevant stack size is.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.640
And the way you make decisions
will depend on your effective

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.530
stack much more
than anything else.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.805
So an example of
this would be, say

00:17:53.805 --> 00:18:01.650
you're in a heads up situation
where you're the hero here

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.700
on the small blind.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.580
Big blind has,
whatever, 300 chips.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.940
And you have some amount
of chips with queens.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.800
So if you have 1,500
chips, and so does

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:32.270
he-- say blinds are like 10/20--
you have, what, like 50 times

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.880
the blinds combined here.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.780
So this is a pretty
different hand than aces.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.740
Why?

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.090
So say that you raise with
queens, and then he raises you.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.375
So you raise to 60, he raises
you to 200, you raise to 600,

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:51.850
and he pushes to 1,500.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:55.030
Your queens are probably not
really that good anymore.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.830
It matters how many
chips you have here.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:04.170
However, if you have 300
chips, you raise with queens,

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.810
and then he pushes over,
you can't fold that.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:11.220
You might as well have aces,
and it makes your hands,

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.770
the way you play hands,
materially different.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.970
That's why chip size
matters in general.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.840
When the chip stack
is low, you're

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.500
playing these two hands
basically identical.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.850
You're saying-- you're
just playing this range.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.660
However, when we're talking
about effective chip stack,

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:35.050
it's the same thing, where
even if you have 1,500

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.667
and he has 300, if you
raise, he's going to push.

00:19:39.667 --> 00:19:42.000
You don't have the opportunity
to do that back and forth

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.720
anymore.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.000
So you might as well
have 300 with regard

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.590
to your decision making here.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.640
That's why we're looking
at the effective stack,

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.010
because it really matters who
has the least number of chips,

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.510
because that determines when
the action is going to be over.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.885
So really, I like this
definition the most,

00:20:01.885 --> 00:20:04.670
the most amount of chips that
you can lose in the hand.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.430
It's a lot more, I think,
simple to think about

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.970
than this min formula.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:11.470
OK.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.097
And then we're almost always
talking about effective stack.

00:20:14.097 --> 00:20:15.430
Let's talk about Dan Harrington.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:23.890
So Dan Harrington is a player
whose style I very much like.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:28.280
His nickname's Action
Dan, which the consensus

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.640
is, he just kind of gave
himself, because he's

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:37.620
considered Mr. Fundamental, like
tight aggressive ABC player.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.480
So this playing style, this
temperament, tight aggressive,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:48.050
is something that is used to
characterize basic playing

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.050
styles.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.200
So let's quickly go
through what those are.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.100
So there are two
different axes here.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.020
There's how often
you bet, where bet

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.970
means you are
raising the stakes,

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.490
so either you bet or you raise.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.920
And then here's
how often you call.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.110
Either you call a lot or
you call not that much.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.360
You can get a good feel for
the type of person someone

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.957
is by what box they fill in.

00:21:14.957 --> 00:21:15.790
So these have names.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.900
So someone who's
tight aggressive,

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.110
you would just refer
to them as Tag, which

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.520
is like what Dan Harrington is.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.000
You bet when you have
good hands and you

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.100
fold when you have bad hands.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.890
Another possibly winning
strategy is loose aggressive,

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.360
Lag, where you certainly bet
when you have good hands,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.000
but you will see a lot
of cards before you'll

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.100
give up on a hand.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.810
You're definitely
willing to call a lot.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:49.870
These, type passive, are
not pronounceable words,

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.650
so the community generally
came up with different words

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:54.600
to describe these.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.710
So a tight passive
person is weak.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.800
They're someone who you
can completely run over,

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.600
because they fold when
they have a bad hand,

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.505
they check when they
have a good hand.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.120
I guess they would
be called rocks.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.750
You never need to worry about
having a big losing night

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.880
against these guys.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.840
So someone who's type
passive is generally

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.170
considered playing
sub-optionally.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:26.100
And then the loose
passive people

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:31.060
are described-- this icon,
which I forget what it's from.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.340
I think it might be from an
old version of PokerTracker,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.140
or maybe it was on Party
Poker or something.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.900
But everyone loved
seeing this icon which

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:46.630
you could label people as,
because a loose passive person

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.280
is what?

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.390
They are a calling machine.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.450
That's what that
stands for, and it

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.820
means that when you
have a hand, they

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.840
will call all of your bets.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.510
You will extract
value out of them.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.580
But when they have
a hand, they're

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.520
OK with letting you
look at your draws

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.290
to make a decision about whether
by the river you have a hand

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.300
or not.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.020
There's virtually no
way that these guys

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.750
are making money in poker.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.280
I think it would be, like
over a realistic sample size,

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.590
there's no type of player who
could fit in this quadrant

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.640
and be good enough on any
other metric to actually

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.330
be making money in poker.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.430
So in general how
we look at this is,

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.230
we would call this
Tag guy solid ABC.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.340
That's what I'm recommending
you guys play as.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.790
Tag players, as a
quadrant, are going

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.200
to be the biggest winners.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.180
Lag players, someone
who's very aggressive

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.130
and plays a lot of
hands, could possibly

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.640
be a pretty good winner.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.880
It depends on the
type of game, and then

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.720
their opponent and their
ability to pick spots.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.310
But there are a lot
of big Lag winners.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.050
There are not a lot
of big weak winners.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:17.000
And there are not
a lot of calling

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.320
machines, loose passive
players, who are not big losers.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.520
So anytime you see-- this is
a definition of someone who's

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.460
a complete fish, a huge
donater to the game.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.210
And your ability to
recognize this type of thing

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.470
will help you find
good games to play,

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.200
when you see someone
doing this kind of thing.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.780
Anyway, back to Action Dan.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:45.480
So Dan Harrington is a
pretty good poker player.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.050
He's been around the block.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.400
He won the main event
back in 1995, when it had,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.060
like, 300 people in it.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:57.100
He has two World Series of Poker
bracelets and one World Poker

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.770
Tour title.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.450
But anyway, so
Harrington popularized

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.100
this thing called
the M-ratio, which

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.760
was invented by someone else.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.080
So the M-ratio was invented by
this guy Paul Magriel, who's

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.900
a backgammon theorist,
apparently one of the best

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.880
backgammon players in the
world, commentator for the WSOB,

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.910
World Series of Backgammon,
and eight WSOB final tables.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.220
Anyway, so he's supposedly
really, really good

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.784
at math, even by MIT standards.

00:25:26.784 --> 00:25:28.700
But he invented this
thing called the M-ratio,

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.560
but then it never caught
on until Harrington

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.570
started doing it.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.360
All right, so
Harrington's M-ratio

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.340
is your effective stack
divided by the sum

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.600
of the blinds and the empties.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.280
So you'll hear
people talk about,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.870
like, oh, I had 10 big blinds,
or 15 big blinds or whatever,

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.670
to talk about their chip stack.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.590
But that has a
fundamental problem.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.120
It has a lot of
different problems.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:02.060
One is, it doesn't
tell the story.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:07.300
So the usual blind levels
are like 1/2 or 2/4,

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.570
where the big blind is
just twice the small blind.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.210
So that's the assumption.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:17.390
But if you're at a blind
level that's like 1/3 or 3/5,

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.650
the number of big
blinds you have is not

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.520
indicative of anything.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.970
It's not indicative of how
many hands you can see,

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.590
or how much you care about
winning a pot pre-flop.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.610
So using the blinds
is bad, in addition

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:36.310
to, once you start having,
like, if you're 50/100 blinds

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:41.650
and you have an ante of 25, you
have basically half the stack

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.960
you had before, in
realistic terms.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.780
Just to get big blinds doesn't,
in fact, earn antes at all.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.180
And that's a major problem
referring to it like that.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.960
So using M seems to
make a lot more sense.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.200
So what it is, is it's basically
the percentage of your stack

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.430
that is the blinds in the ante.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.550
So it's like how
many rounds of poker

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.516
you can survive if you just
fold every single hand.

00:27:08.516 --> 00:27:10.140
Of course, you're
not going to do that.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.490
Although I think that's what
he's actually getting at,

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.270
because he uses M to
refer to when you have

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.750
to make a move, which is not
generally how I recommend

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.780
you do it.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.320
I think it's more important,
because it means how important

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.740
the blinds are to your stack.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.410
The only reason anyone
plays any hand of poker

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.410
is because someone
wants to win the blind.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:36.040
So even if you have
kings, to some extent,

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.720
if you could win the
blinds, 99% of the time

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.110
you would just do that.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.100
You don't really all
the time want someone

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.064
to go up against you.

00:27:45.064 --> 00:27:47.230
So the blinds are really
driving the decision making

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:51.240
process, at least pre-flop.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.280
And the percentage
that those blinds

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.400
are of your stack matter a lot.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.520
If they're 1% of your
stack, if your M is 100,

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.390
the blind basically
don't matter at all.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.680
Whatever happens
after the blinds

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.020
is going to materially
impact your decision.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.690
Where if your M is 2, and the
blinds are half your stack,

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.327
winning those seems
really important.

00:28:11.327 --> 00:28:13.410
You should do whatever you
can to kind of maximize

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.850
your chance of winning that.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:20.710
So that's why M is
a good ratio here.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.940
And then, in addition,
for tournaments,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:28.000
it makes it much easier
to talk about hands

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.220
without having to worry
about all the different parts

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.020
of the tournament life cycle.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.812
If you have 1,500 chips
and it's 50/100 blinds,

00:28:37.812 --> 00:28:39.520
you can basically make
the same decisions

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.400
as if you have 10 times as
many chips at a level that's

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.494
10 times as high blinds.

00:28:46.494 --> 00:28:47.910
You could just
divide in your head

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.451
and basically make
the same decision.

00:28:49.451 --> 00:28:52.820
You don't need to
worry about doing

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.010
anything different as a
result of having more chips.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.400
So Harrington
invented or brought up

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.880
a bunch of other things
that never really caught on.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.380
He invented a thing called
the queue ratio, which

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:09.510
is your stack size divided
by the average stack size

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.750
in the tournament.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.500
So I guess you might use this
to get an idea of how far behind

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.910
you are in the tournament.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.456
Like if your queue
is 5, you don't

00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:18.580
need to be that aggressive.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.090
But if your queue
is .2, you have

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.340
a lot of catching up to do
before you're realistically

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.660
going to be anywhere
near the money.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.910
I don't really make
decisions based on that.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.250
I think the community doesn't.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:33.070
So it never really
caught on for anything.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.200
I've never actually
heard anyone use that.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.700
So he came up with
this thing called

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.210
effective M, which
makes sense, if you

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.350
look at M from his perspective.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:51.010
Effective M, it's your M
divided by-- you multiply by how

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.870
shorthanded your table is.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.230
And it gives you the
equivalent of the number

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.310
of 10-handed tables
you could survive.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.780
It just means that,
say you have 10 Ms,

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.070
you could survive
10 rounds of blinds.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.020
If you have three
people at your table,

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.950
you can't survive for
another like six hours

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.630
because you actually pay
the blind every other hand.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.020
That's what
effective M is doing.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.780
It reduces your
M proportionally.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.420
Since he's looking at this
from the perspective of when

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.780
you need to start making
moves, it kind of makes sense

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.350
that your M would be reduced
if you're shorthanded.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.520
But I look at M from the
perspective of how valuable it

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.950
is in terms of blinds.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.280
So I don't really use that.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.070
I don't know anyone who really
uses effective M either.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.276
But he invented them, and maybe
they'll catch on eventually.

00:30:41.276 --> 00:30:43.150
So I think that's going
to be done for today.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.140
Thanks, everyone, for
a good first lecture.
