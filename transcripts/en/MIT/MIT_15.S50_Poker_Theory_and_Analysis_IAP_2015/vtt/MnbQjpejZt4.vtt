00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.150
PROFESSOR: All
right, well I'd like

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.470
to thank you for
inviting me again

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.750
to talk to the poker class.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.250
It's always great to
come here, and we're

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.970
going to be having a
tournament in a couple weeks,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.890
so good luck for the people
participating in that.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.210
Actually, I'm coming
back in another two weeks

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.610
because I think [INAUDIBLE]
a Harvard MIT math tournament

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.760
for high school kids.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.120
I really love visiting MIT.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.270
I just wish it were at some
other time besides the winter.

00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:04.125
Then it would be perfect.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:05.850
All right, today
I'm going to talk

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.290
about the University of
Alberta's Cepheus computer

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.100
program.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.470
It supposedly solved poker.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.316
We're going to talk about
what they actually did.

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:16.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.360
There seems to be a
lot of buzz about this,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.070
so I thought this
was a good to do.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.130
So I have to tell you that Jared
and I did not work directly

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.940
with the University
of Alberta people,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.100
but we are very familiar
with their methods

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.920
and have actually tried some
of their coding techniques.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.360
So we're pretty familiar
with the same research that's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.430
going on.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.540
To It's sort of an, I
think, objective commentary.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.480
So by the way, as
the lecture goes on,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.450
you can interrupt
with questions.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.140
Just raise your hands
if something is unclear

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.215
because I've been told
I have about 80 minutes.

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:04.440
Probably spend 55 and then
save the rest for questions.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.930
All right, so that
line of talk-- first

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.410
I'm going to talk about what
the Cepheus accomplished,

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.260
what the University of
Alberta people accomplished,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.390
and I'm going to bring that
up by discussing game theory

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.340
optimal energies in poker.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.640
How many of you know
what game [INAUDIBLE] is.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.750
I just want to know [INAUDIBLE]
or what a [INAUDIBLE] is.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.100
Raise your hands.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.200
OK.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.270
So about 1/2, 2/3.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.980
Good.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.194
I'm going to do a quick
introduction to what game

00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:40.110
theory [INAUDIBLE] is.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.700
We're going to talk about a
simple poker game and solutions

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.970
to it.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.740
And then I'm going to go
into their algorithm, which

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.810
is written [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.750
They used the method of
counterfactual [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.370
Actually, the method
they used to push

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.080
through to the
solution of the problem

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.820
is counter CF plus,
which is basically

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.460
the original algorithm with some
shortcuts, which we'll discuss.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.640
After this, though, we're
going to think about extensions

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.160
of computer solutions to other
games, including [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.640
games and multiplayer games.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.490
A couple people have questions
about [INAUDIBLE] no limit

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.820
program.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.970
We'll talk about what they're
work entailed if questions

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.630
lead in that direction.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.120
All right, let's talk about
what Cepheus accomplished.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.280
It's a game theory [INAUDIBLE]
solution to heads up limit

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280
hold 'em.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.140
And so what does that mean?

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.350
You guys all know what
limit hold 'em is, right?

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.150
Good.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.740
Basically, after
[INAUDIBLE] few years,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.960
they've achieved and
exploited less than 1/1000

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.310
of a big blind.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.050
So the first thing is not a
boo perfect optimal solution.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.960
You can still exploit
it for about 1/1000

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.579
of a blind for a hand.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.890
However, there are
probably better games.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.590
This is like 1/20-- this
is 1/2000 of a big bet.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.790
You can actually play heads up
for 50 years at normal speed

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.260
and still have some
probability of losing.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.400
The reason for that is the
standard deviation of heads

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.100
up limit hold 'em is
about five big blinds.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.380
So you can just
imagine how many hands

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.440
you have to play [INAUDIBLE]
the significance.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.850
About, oh, 25 million.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.460
So it's definitely a milestone.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.890
This is the first time a real
poker game has been solved.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.030
In math of poker, we solved
ace, king, queen, [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.580
on paper, but [INAUDIBLE] a
real poker games that's solved.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.390
However, given
their previous work,

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.120
it was just a matter
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.670
I remember two or
three years ago

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.970
they passed the 1/100
of a big bet, which

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.230
is sort of our measurement
of significance.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.280
If you're playing and you're
winning more than 1/100

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.490
of a big bet for a hand,
you can [INAUDIBLE] it's

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.440
a probable game.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.230
Below that comes theoretical.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.080
So it's definitely a milestone.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.150
And basically I knew that,
if they just maybe spent

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.100
more CPU power, they
would get the solution.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.000
For 900 CPU years, we
finally got the solution.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.460
So I don't know.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.410
If I had that much CPU power,
I'd solve a few problems, too.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.550
But it's still the
miles [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.670
It's great.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.350
So what effect does this
have on other games?

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.480
Does this mean poker is
going to go the way of chess

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.620
for computers who are just
much better than we are?

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.560
I don't think we're
there yet, and we'll

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.000
talk about that later.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.230
So let's talk about
Nash equilibrium.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.210
So John F. Nash won
the Nobel Prize in 1994

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.460
"for pioneering
analysis of equilibrium

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.870
in the theory of
non-cooperative games."

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.860
And he extended the work of
John Von Neumann and Oskar

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.470
Morgenstern, [INAUDIBLE]
actually first considered

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.680
these two player zero sum games.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.530
So Nash equilibrium is
just a set of strategies

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.510
such that no player can
actually improve their strategy

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.980
and make more [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.420
[INAUDIBLE] whatever.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.020
In a the two player
zero sum games,

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.955
we refer to Nash equilibria
as also very optimal.

00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:06.800
The reason is because
Nash equilibria are also

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.840
the min/max solution.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.520
It's the best you can
do given that he can

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.850
see what you do and respond.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.754
Simplest case of
Nash equilibria is,

00:07:16.754 --> 00:07:18.420
if you're playing
rock, paper, scissors,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.580
what's the Nash equilibrium?

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.420
1/3 each.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.580
So that's not that exciting in
this case, because both players

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.340
kind of just t0.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.930
You can't make more than 0,
you can't make less than 0.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.960
So it doesn't seem to be
that exciting a solution,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.520
but in poker it's
kind of exciting

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.570
because they're kind of
dominated mistakes people play,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:47.340
or mistakes that actually lose
money to the optimal solution.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.950
So the reason 1/3, 1/3
is the Nash equilibrium

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.530
because nobody can do
anything to improve their lot.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.360
It may not be the
best thing to play.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.670
If a guy is playing 1/2
scissors and 1/2 rock,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.020
what should you play?

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.870
100% rock.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.650
Yeah, sort of like the
Aerosmith strategy.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.850
Right.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.610
So there are much better ways to
play if your opponents deviate

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.910
from Nash equilibrium.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.640
So actually game theory optimal
is not necessarily the best way

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.800
to play, even heads up.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.490
It's a way to play to kind
of guaranteed you never lose.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.919
So that's sort of
the accomplishment.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.919
That's why we like
to find these things.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.539
I know I could just
play this, and I'm not

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.770
taking total advantage of
my opponent's mistakes,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.940
but at least I'm playing
in away where he can't

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.410
take advantage of me at all.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.120
Let's do a simple example.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.100
So this is an
example that I shared

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.060
with the class a
couple years ago.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.210
So there are two
players, Rose and Colin,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.850
and the reason the
players are called

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.185
Rose and Colin are because this
refers to [INAUDIBLE] games.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.090
One player chooses a row, the
other player chooses a column.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.050
That's their payoff.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.740
And for a three player
game, we introduce Larry,

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.530
because there are layers.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.510
So the two players
are Rose and Colin.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.840
So each player antes
$50 for $100 in a pot.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.700
Rose looks at a card
[INAUDIBLE] full deck,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.660
who will win in the pot a
showdown if the card is.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.380
Otherwise she will lose.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.950
So Rose can decide
to bet $100 or check

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.660
after she looks at her card.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.974
So there's $100 in the pot.

00:09:38.974 --> 00:09:39.890
She looks at her card.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.340
She [INAUDIBLE] whether
to be $100 or to check.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.180
If Rose bets, Colin may
decide to call $100 or fold.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.420
If Colin folds, Rose wins.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.220
Well, you guys know
how poker works.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.790
If Colin calls,
there's a showdown,

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.420
and her card is
actually a spade.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.710
She wins the whole pot.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.200
Colin wins the pot.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.992
So what's the optimal
strategies for Rose and Colin?

00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:03.200
Does anybody know the answer?

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.590
Well, let's do one
[INAUDIBLE] part of it.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.840
How often do you think
[INAUDIBLE] should call?

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.310
Colin wants a call
[INAUDIBLE] enough to make

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.000
Rose's bluffs probable.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.220
If Rose gets a spade,
what is she going to do?

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:25.820
Bet.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.140
She has nothing to
lose by betting,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.060
unless she's being
very, very tricky,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.450
but it is correct to bet.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.460
So let's see.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.690
If Rose doesn't pick
up a spade and bluffs,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.540
how often does that
have to succeed for it

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.914
to be profitable?

00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:49.030
There's $100 in the pot.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.100
She looks.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.030
If it's not a spade,
she has to bet $100,

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.890
and how much is she risking?

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.140
How much is she going to win?

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.290
It's actually $100 and
another $100, right?

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.010
Because there's $100 in a pot.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.330
Sure, she anted something
and made the pot,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.680
but she's spending $100.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.080
And if Colin calls, she's
going to lose the $100.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.280
If Colin folds, she's going
to win the $100 in the pot,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.780
or she could have just given up.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.600
So it's 1 to 1.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.710
So Rose should call
half the time--

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.130
I mean Colin should
call half the time.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.230
Rose should bet to
bluff in a 2 to 1

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.680
ratio, because that's the
odds Colin gets to call.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.110
So Rose should
always bet a spade.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.520
If Colin calls 100% of the time,
Rose will just never bluff.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.150
If Colin never calls, Rose
would just be every time.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.640
So there is kind of
no equilibrium there.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.740
If Colin calls
half the time, Rose

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.100
will be indifferent to bluffing.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.770
She'll be negative $50
either way without a spade,

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.570
and then $100 with a spade.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.680
Now, this is strategy
for [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.720
and the correct
strategy for Rose

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:11.070
is this ratio of bluff to
spade, which is 1 to 2.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.110
So Rose should basically
bet half of her hearts.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.530
She can bet the
high hearts, and I

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.500
guess with the eight of hearts
she can decide whether-- is

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.720
it the eight or the seven?

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.870
No, it's the-- yeah,
it's the eight.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.960
[INAUDIBLE] with
the eight of hearts

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.120
she can decide whether to bet
or not like half the time.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.870
So these are Nash equilibrium
and game theory optimal

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:43.420
strategies, and basically the
value of the game is negative--

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.210
is worth $12.50 to Colin.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.990
Any questions about this?

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.950
All right, so these
are the strategies

00:12:54.950 --> 00:13:02.970
that the algorithm
tries to find.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.400
Let's go on to
the algorithm now.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.420
Well, let's talk about what
[INAUDIBLE] optimal is first.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.280
By the way, there will be
about five or so transparencies

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.150
[INAUDIBLE] of math equations.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.990
So just suffer through these.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:26.710
Those of you who understand are
going to enjoy the later part,

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.710
but let's just talk
formally about what

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.460
game theory optimal means.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.980
So there's this
game function, u.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.860
It takes two strategies, an
x strategy and a y strategy,

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.500
and it gives [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.130
If this was rock,
paper, scissors,

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.890
you would have u of
rock versus scissors

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.160
to be 1, so on and so forth.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.000
It's positive for x and
negative-- x is trying

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.130
to-- x gets u, and y loses u.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.190
That's the idea.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.280
So one of things is we can
take convex linear combinations

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.610
of strategies.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.460
That is, if x sigma
xk are strategies

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.900
and we have some coefficients
that are all non-negative

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.960
and that sum to 1, we
can make a new strategy

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.630
as a linear combination
of these strategies.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:32.310
And also u is bi-linear means
that the value of the game

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.180
here is just the
linear combination

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.690
that [INAUDIBLE] sigma x.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.230
And it would be the
same also for sigma y.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.860
This just means, suppose
you have two strategies

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:52.530
and you play 1/3 sigma
x1 and 2/3 sigma x2,

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.225
your payoff is going to be
1/3 of the payoff of sigma x1

00:14:56.225 --> 00:14:57.725
and 1/3 payoff of sigma x2.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:04.080
Hopefully that's pretty clear.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.940
Now we define a
pair of strategies

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.600
to be an epsilonic rim if
the best x can do against y

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.010
is this strategy.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:17.000
The best y can do against x
is this strategy-- is epsilon.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.550
And if epsilon equals 0,
these are in Nash equilibrium.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.880
So after 900 PU
hours, what they found

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.320
were two strategies--
sigma x star,

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:38.860
sigma y star-- that
were within 1/1000

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.790
of a big blind of equilibrium.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:47.950
And that's basically
[INAUDIBLE] accomplished.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.860
So I'm going to actually go
through the nitty gritty of how

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:56.280
they did this in case you would
like to write on poker solver

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.630
Sunday.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.670
So the big idea
that they borrowed

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.810
was this idea of
regret minimization,

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.590
which is actually pretty cool.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.750
Suppose that each time
step t the player has

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.920
a few pure strategies.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.510
We're assuming the player
has a handful of strategies.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.780
In poker, obviously, there's
trillions of strategies,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.240
but-- two to the
trillions of strategies.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.920
But say he has two strategies.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.524
He can play one or two.

00:16:28.524 --> 00:16:30.690
Suppose it's odds, or evens,
or something like that.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.523
Or he has three strategies
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.640
So basically he
chooses some sort

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.180
of mixture of strategies
at the beginning,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.730
and we're only dealing with
one player at this time.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.630
We're assuming the
other guy-- we're

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.300
assuming he's playing
against some adversary that's

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:55.830
all knowing.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.300
That's the original set
up, regret memorization.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.040
We'll talk about
how this applies

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.630
to game theory in general.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:11.510
Now with each time t we're
given values ut of sigma k.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.030
So basically after
he determines this,

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.960
the adversary decides what
the value of use of t is,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.339
and basically his payoff
is just [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.274
a linear combination of
the things he picked.

00:17:25.274 --> 00:17:32.090
But the idea is that the
adversary can be adversarial.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:38.360
he can decide to make the
[INAUDIBLE] strategy score well

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.870
some of the time, and
the [INAUDIBLE] strategy

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.780
score badly some of the time.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:48.190
So basically now the idea
is to calculate a regret.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.070
By the way, this
is not the notation

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.130
that's used in the three or
four papers they wrote on this,

00:17:55.130 --> 00:18:01.780
because I think they did
great work-- it's really

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.450
written as a math paper.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:11.080
It looks like a particle physics
paper, which is-- actually

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.450
for particle physics you
need all the complex notation

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.920
because they're trying to
describe something [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.910
difficult. I think for
computer science papers usually

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.480
don't need this.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.340
So I'll explain this,
and then you guys through

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.380
reread their paper.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.630
I think that [INAUDIBLE]
give you a quicker way

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.880
to understand their paper.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.230
So there's this thing called
regret of the k option

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:42.980
at time t, which is just the
sum of the difference of playing

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.110
k versus playing
whatever you played.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.230
So basically you can
have positive regret

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.740
or negative regrets.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.490
Negative regrets means that what
you played-- what you decided

00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.260
to play up to time t was
better than just playing k

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.950
at each time step.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.180
So we're only
concerned-- we're mostly

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.030
concerned with the
positive regret, which

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.620
means, instead of
playing, you should

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:14.870
have made-- you could have made
more money by playing option k.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.470
So what's the
significance of this?

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.520
So the idea is we want
the average regret, which

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.860
is this element divided by t.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:32.220
So basically you want the
average regret, average amount

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.950
that you're kind missing out
on to be less than epsilon sub

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.080
t, where in epsilon sub t is
the [INAUDIBLE] converging to 0.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:46.690
If you have this, you have
some regret [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.650
So the cool thing about this
is you can do regret matching.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.770
You can let these
weights-- first of all,

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.400
you just look at the
positive, the things

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.960
with positive regret,
and weight the options.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.470
At each [INAUDIBLE],
we basically

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.530
weight the options that have
positive regrets accordingly.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.330
And if you're so lucky that
nothing is positive regret,

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.600
you just randomly
pick a strategy.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.630
Let's do an example,
because I think this

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.510
is kind of unclear what it is.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.580
So let's just say we
have two strategies.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.280
The player can pick
one, or the player

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.560
can pick two at each
time, or the player can

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.880
pick some mixture one and two.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.010
After a player does that, the
adversary comes out and says,

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.310
well, one of them is worth
[INAUDIBLE] and one of them

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.030
is worth 1.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.380
So let's just see
how this works.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.020
So suppose at the
first time step

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.624
we picked sigma 2 because we
don't have any regrets yet.

00:20:50.624 --> 00:20:52.790
We're just randomly picking
a strategy-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.220
sorry, sigma 1.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.790
We'll just randomly
pick sigma 1.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:03.790
So the adversary now gives
us the value of sigma 1 0

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.240
and sigma 2 is 1.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.290
And you go, oh, well that
means that the regret

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.010
of the first option is 0 and
the regret of the second option

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.510
is 1.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:17.930
We're aware this first option is
0 is because we already played

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.980
sigma 1, so you can't
have any regrets,

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.580
either positive or negative,
for playing sigma 1,

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.810
because your option
was playing sigma 1,

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.440
but you have some regret
of not playing sigma 2.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.340
Sigma 2 was kind
of the winner here.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.750
If the two [INAUDIBLE]
reversed, we

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.890
would have r1 equals 0 and
r2 equals the negative 1.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.550
And then we'd become happy
because all our regrets

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.790
would be non-negative.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.840
So at t equals 2,
because we have

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.890
zero regret here
and regret 1 here,

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:58.890
we actually pick the
strategy to be all sigma 2.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:03.350
Now the adversary says, OK,
well the value of sigma 1 is 1,

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:07.014
and the value of sigma 2 is
0 for the second time step.

00:22:07.014 --> 00:22:07.680
So what happens?

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.240
Well, the same thing
happens as before.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.164
Now we have regret of
1 on the [INAUDIBLE],

00:22:15.164 --> 00:22:17.330
and then regret of [INAUDIBLE]
on the second option.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.862
So what do we do next?

00:22:19.862 --> 00:22:20.820
The regret [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:29.620
Well, flip a coin or just
pick a linear even combination

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.880
of the two strategies, half
of one and half the other.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.925
That's what we can do.

00:22:34.925 --> 00:22:36.000
[INAUDIBLE] the same.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.620
So now the adversary
says sigma 1 is 0

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:45.990
and sigma 2 is 1, which
means that the regret of 1

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.740
actually goes to 0.5,
and the regret of 2

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.450
actually goes to 1.5.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.820
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.510
1 goes down a 1/2.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.750
So now with these
regrets our waiting

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.740
is kind of the ratio of the two.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.470
It's 1/4 sigma 1
and 3/4 sigma 2.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.560
So now the adversary
goes, OK, well sigma is 0.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.070
Sigma 2 is 1.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.460
So this regret actually goes
[INAUDIBLE] down by 3/4,

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.360
and this goes up by a 1/4.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.280
And since this is
negative, now we

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.905
pick the strategy to be sigma 2.

00:23:19.905 --> 00:23:21.570
[INAUDIBLE] and so forth.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.600
Now the adversary
[INAUDIBLE] for us and say,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.360
oh, it's really sigma 1.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.080
Then a regret of sigma
1 would go up to 0.75,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.500
and so on and so forth.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:36.090
So it seems that the adversary
can make the job tough on us.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:40.390
Well actually,
there is a theorem

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.800
that says, for our
example, [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.010
The square of the first
regret if it's positive

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.830
plus the square of the second
regret if it's positive

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:54.130
is always going to be
less than or equal to t.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.980
And that's because,
if [INAUDIBLE] these

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.370
are both positive,
it goes, for example,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:08.110
you are really going r1 plus
or minus whatever amount of r2

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.340
you're doing.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.820
And r2 of t now minus
plus whatever amount of r1

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.030
you're doing.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:18.330
The things that [INAUDIBLE]
this you can see the cross terms

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:19.270
cancel each other out.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:24.250
This becomes 2 r1 r2
divided by r1 plus rt.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.560
So you're left with this
squared plus this squared

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.800
plus this squared
plus this squared.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.880
And this squared
plus this squared

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.820
is going to be
less than 1, so we

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.990
have this here, which means
that the quadratic sum only

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.860
[INAUDIBLE] by 1.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.120
We have this bound.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.150
Why is this bound so great?

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.380
Well if the square of the
regrets are less than t,

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.550
that means the average regret
is going to be [INAUDIBLE] 1

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.820
over root t.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.880
In fact, it's kind of left
as a homework problem.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.440
In a general case, our
kt over t is less than n

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.340
minus 1 delta over
root t, where delta

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.870
is the maximum
deviation of the options

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.100
and is just the
number of options.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.251
Yeah?

00:25:09.251 --> 00:25:13.075
AUDIENCE: I'm curious,
is [INAUDIBLE] in terms

00:25:13.075 --> 00:25:17.488
of what is the strategy sigma.

00:25:17.488 --> 00:25:18.784
Number of like a payoff?

00:25:18.784 --> 00:25:19.700
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.670
A strategy sigma, in
terms of poker strategy,

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.910
is sort of a description
of what you would do.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:34.620
Suppose you get ace,
six off suit pre-flop.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.860
A strategy would be a
descriptor of what you would

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.160
do at each point of the hand.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.820
So there's some
significance in effect

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:50.550
that this regret, average
regret, goes to 0.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:57.000
Well, the significance in
terms of game theory optimal is

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.760
suppose a peer's
strategies are--

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.274
suppose you have a bunch of
peer strategies for x and bunch

00:26:03.274 --> 00:26:04.820
of peer strategies for y.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.480
If we regret match, but
instead of doing an adversary,

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.780
we just say t
utility for x is just

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:20.340
the utility for x playing
against the sigma ty,

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:24.500
and the utility for y is
just negative utility--

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.670
the game utility for y
playing against sigma xt.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.060
This is kind of a
mutual regret matching.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.220
You do regret
matching for x and y

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.610
in each step, which
means you just modify

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.890
x-- you compute the
regrets at each step.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.570
Then you modify x
[INAUDIBLE] y strategy

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.550
by this type of regret matching.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:51.090
And basically the
strategies that you

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.050
choose, the average
strategy, which

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:58.330
is the sum of the strategies
you have had all along

00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.660
divided by t.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:05.070
1/t-- all the strategies
you've done in these t steps.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:08.760
And basically what
happens is now,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.700
if you try [INAUDIBLE] to
exploit a [INAUDIBLE] strategy,

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.270
again, this is the best x can
do against y minus the best

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.720
y does against x.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.160
You compute this,
and you add the sum

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.080
of what actually happened
with x of t and y sub t,

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.680
and so on and so forth.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:39.400
You notice that this is the
regret of k-- of x picking

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.185
strategy k all the time.

00:27:41.185 --> 00:27:45.140
It's just y picking
strategy j all the time.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.770
So that's less than
2 epsilon over t

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.220
because regrets over t converge,
so it's within [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.280
game theory optimal.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.720
Basically what this all
means is basically suppose

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.980
you choose your strategy,
some mixture of stuff.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.100
Your opponent tries to
figure out how best he

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.870
can exploit this strategy.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.990
By the way, this is
often called nemesis.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.570
I really like that name.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.160
Opponent figures out his
nemesis strategy against you.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.721
Then, well, you get to see--
so his nemesis strategies--

00:28:22.721 --> 00:28:24.220
unless you're playing
the exact game

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.553
theory optimal strategies--
is always going to be better

00:28:26.553 --> 00:28:28.100
than the game value.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.620
He looks at what you've done
and finds the best response.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.850
And you do the same to him,
and the difference of those two

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.330
games kind of exploitable.

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:44.270
Obviously, this means
basically, if your opponent

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:50.110
sees what you're doing, this is
the best he can do against you.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:55.300
This number is the one
that's less than 1/1000

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.490
of a big blind.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.000
So counterfactual
regret is kind of cool

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.500
because-- it's a good
thing I've drawn this tree.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:09.120
At each of your decision points,
now you can regret match.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.907
So first of all, you
don't need to be fed back

00:29:12.907 --> 00:29:14.240
the correct utility [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:17.482 --> 00:29:21.560
Here in the example we
gave, we had a u0 and u1.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.920
You'll just be fed back some
unbiased stochastic number that

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.470
averages the value of the game.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:33.080
For example, if you're doing
a regret chain on poker,

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.727
it's hard to tell if I'm
up with this strategy that

00:29:37.727 --> 00:29:39.750
has a bunch of terabytes,
and you come up

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.780
with a strategy that's also
a bunch of terrabytes--

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.700
what's the value of playing
against y [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.707
But we can just get a sample.

00:29:47.707 --> 00:29:48.540
We can get a sample.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.170
Well you can just run it once.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.490
Right, that's the idea.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:30:00.960
You get a sample by just
saying, OK, just play one hand,

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.328
and see the result of that hand.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.360
And you could use either
random chance or whatever

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.490
every time you decide to do
whatever branches of your tree

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.690
if you do a mix tree.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:18.860
So the cool thing already is,
without counterfactual regret,

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.790
you can quickly
converge the solution,

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:27.945
because a lot of strategies,
like fictitious play--

00:30:27.945 --> 00:30:29.310
it's the best response.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.090
The best response is hard
to calculate sometimes,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:38.750
but each simulation can just
be one iteration through it.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.140
And this is
counterfactual regret

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.800
because [INAUDIBLE]
is given assuming

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.390
that the player does everything
to play to that node.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:52.280
So the waiting here is nature
just has its probabilities.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.730
If your opponent plays
according to his strategy,

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.570
but when you play
you always kind

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.370
of play towards that node,
so your weight actually

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.910
1 for each of these
options you pick.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.820
The cool thing is that once
you have the structure set up

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.460
where you're just doing
one or a few iterations

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:20.590
throughout the hand, it's
actually pretty easy to set up

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.620
different weighting schemes.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:28.490
For example, if you have two
options and the ace of hearts

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.790
comes on the turn, or the deuce
of clubs comes on the turn,

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.410
and you don't really have to
worry about the ace of hearts

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.420
coming on a turn.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.950
That tree is fine.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.960
That part of the tree has
very little positive regrets.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.040
You can say, OK, we'll
just-- different game where

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.520
the ace of hearts
comes about [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.110
at a time the deuce
of clubs comes,

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.770
but we're going to
weight the results by 10.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:56.010
You still get the same answer.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.150
It's just that you get a much
coarser kind of [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.860
every time the ace of hearts
comes, but already kind of know

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.750
what to do with that.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.870
You can work on
the deuce of clubs.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.900
So there a lot of different
weightings schemes.

00:32:10.206 --> 00:32:12.830
This means that the hands can be
kind of sampled intrinsically.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:20.760
So the final algorithm they
had was factual regret plus.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.100
So instead of having
accumulated negative regrets,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.900
basically a lot of these option
regrets can be really negative.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.040
Folding aces pre-flop
quickly turns

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.855
to really negative regret.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.730
You lose your small
blind, and hopefully

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.120
if you play it limit hold
'em, you could win more

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.590
than the small blind.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:50.550
So you accumulate a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] so set options

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.850
falls off the map.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.440
Their innovation in
counter factual plus

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.020
is to, instead of putting
a big negative number

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.040
to a lot of these things,
they just floor them at 0.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.110
And the reason
they floor at 0 is

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:09.050
because you know this a
simultaneous evolution

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:15.630
of strategies where even
strategies at the beginning

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.550
just might not be
great strategies,

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:21.840
and you want to-- if
regret of something is 0,

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.620
you can route get regret
faster if it's the right thing

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.690
to do to respond to your
opponent's strategy.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.700
All of these
things-- suppose you

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.260
start with a random initial
guess for your opponent's

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.420
strategy.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.540
Then you actually have a
pretty reasonable strategy,

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.210
which is bet and raise
every time with every hand.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:47.270
If your opponent has a random
strategy, he might just fold.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.660
So later in the streets,
it's probably [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.360
just bet and raise every
time with every hand.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.907
He raises you back.

00:33:53.907 --> 00:33:55.240
It's not like he knows anything.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.427
It's a random strategy.

00:33:56.427 --> 00:33:58.010
Just raise him back
and hope he folds.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.790
If he doesn't fold and
call, you bet again an x3,

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.890
because now the pot is bigger.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.060
So he has a 1/3
chance of folding.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.670
You should bet.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:11.719
So that evolves quick.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:16.230
If you start off with a random
tree with no information,

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:21.580
that starts off as
the dominant strategy.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.429
And then you have to walk
that back as your opponent's

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:27.080
strategy evolves also.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.000
By the way, they're
actually keeping

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.630
two trees-- one for the
small blind strategy,

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.159
and one for the
big blind strategy.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:38.350
And this is everything with
respect to the small blind.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:43.090
The small blind isn't-- so let's
just go into the next slide

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.112
probably.

00:34:44.112 --> 00:34:45.070
[INAUDIBLE] have to be.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.139
So let's try to figure out how
big the strategy space in limit

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:56.770
hold 'em has to be.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.180
So let's concentrate
on river nodes

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.470
because that's
most of the nodes.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:08.380
It's a tree so we just have
to calculate the leaves.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:13.050
So first of all,
assuming a four bet cap--

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.860
the reason we assume a four bet
cap-- well, I don't know why,

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:21.870
but it seems that that's--
so this is one approximation,

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:26.280
the four bet cap, but this
is kind of normal in types

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.325
of research papers.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.370
if we have a four bet, there
are nine possible actions that

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:34.710
get you to the next street.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.910
There are some actions that
[INAUDIBLE] like player one

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.230
bets and player two folds, but
if you don't get to the street,

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:47.580
you don't get to the
river, and that's

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.996
a pretty small
percentage of the nodes.

00:35:50.996 --> 00:35:52.620
So why are there nine
possible actions?

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.720
Let's count them.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.950
One of the actions that gets to
the next street is check check.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.630
So that's one.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.529
What are the eight?

00:36:02.529 --> 00:36:03.570
What are the other eight?

00:36:06.824 --> 00:36:07.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.350
PROFESSOR: Right, check raise.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:15.010
Let's try systemic
[INAUDIBLE] count them.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:20.590
So I claim that there are two
ways-- one bet in the pot.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.643
Player one can bet, and
player two can call,

00:36:22.643 --> 00:36:24.476
or player one can check,
player two can bet,

00:36:24.476 --> 00:36:26.420
and player one can call.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.970
In fact, there are two ways
to put k bets in the pot

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.630
and k is greater than 0.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:37.030
If you want to put three bets
in a pot, what are the two ways?

00:36:39.736 --> 00:36:41.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:42.790
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:43.690
Yeah, right.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.860
Bet, raise, re-raise, call, and
check, bet, raise, re-raise,

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.640
call.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:54.140
So if the cap is k bets,
there's always 2k plus 1 ways

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.120
to [INAUDIBLE] three.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.880
So there are nine possible
actions in each betting

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.430
round before the river.

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.790
So there are three betting
rounds-- pre-flop, flop,

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.070
and turn.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:07.990
So let's use some
symmetries because I

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.490
don't think the optimal strategy
has you playing something

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:14.500
differently with ace, six of
diamonds, ace, six of heart.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.990
[INAUDIBLE] very easy to prove.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:19.530
The optimal strategy
doesn't have that.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:24.830
So using symmetries on a flop--
so how many distinct flops are

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.760
there?

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.130
Well, I like to think
about it as where

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:32.890
the suits have symmetries.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.800
I like to think about
it as, well, there

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.490
could be three suits in a
flop, two suits in a flop,

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.070
or one suit.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:44.980
So if there's one suit on a
flop, there's 13 [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.320
combinations.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.470
That's pretty straightforward.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:55.180
If there are two suits on a
flop, what's the combinations?

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.820
There are 13 possibilities
for one of the suits,

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.920
and there are 13 [INAUDIBLE]
for the other suit.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.970
It's based on heart or
something like that.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:05.390
The suits are symmetric.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:09.020
So there are 1014
things [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.890
This is [INAUDIBLE] the things.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:15.090
And if it's three suited,
you just choose three ranks,

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:16.400
but it's not 13 choose 2.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.890
It's 15 choose 2 because why?

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.310
I guess the ranks can be equal.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.210
So it would 13 choose 2 if
the ranks would be unique,

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.975
but you'd have
three aces on him.

00:38:32.975 --> 00:38:35.540
So this is actually 15 choose 2.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:41.410
So there's 455 three suited
flops, [INAUDIBLE] flops.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.230
That's kind of the
big explosion in limit

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.120
hold 'em, pre-flop to flop.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.190
So there is not [INAUDIBLE]
possible actions

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.300
in each betting round.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.670
So let's count the number
of turns and rivers.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.520
There's [INAUDIBLE]
turns and 48 rivers.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.820
So counting that, you have
a billion possible action

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.360
sequences to the river.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.125
The [INAUDIBLE] things in
each street, all the flops,

00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:08.040
then the turns and rivers.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:14.110
But each river, there could be
up to 126 [INAUDIBLE] types.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.020
47 times 46.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.450
Making about 6.5 trillion
hand river types.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.440
Each node should be
visited about 1,000 times.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.220
It's a big
computational problem,

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.100
but it still
tractable, especially

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.070
if you have 900 years of CPU.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.030
And they also used
many shortcuts.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.180
They use all the
symmetries I talk about,

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.530
and they also have
a few shortcuts.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:46.340
And you can see
these trees are big.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.200
Terabytes of memory to
actually store your strategy.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.780
So you can't really
get that on a node yet.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.580
I don't know.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.910
Can you fit that on a node now?

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.460
Does anybody know?

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:03.340
I don't know of a CPU that has
[INAUDIBLE] bytes of RAM yet.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.690
What they did was they broke
the problem up into about 100

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.170
[INAUDIBLE] different
sub-games, and they just

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.960
worked on those sub-games.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.380
In fact, I guess if
you're clever about it,

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:23.590
you can use cache memory when
you get down to the river.

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:27.970
Things are pretty close, and
you know that using cache memory

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.700
is faster than using
[INAUDIBLE] memory.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.980
You can take advantage
of these things.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.460
A lot of these updates
through these regrets

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.180
are just simple addition,
and you can just

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.750
optimize the heck out of this,
and I'm sure they did it.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:49.530
Let's just try to
solve some other games.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:54.140
I have two games
that seem accessible.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.500
Suppose we do Omaha eight.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.460
Well, this is exactly the same
structure as limit hold 'em.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.750
You just change the hole cards.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:13.370
So instead of having 47 choose
2 different river hands,

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.090
you have 47 choose 4.

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:22.010
That's like a multiple 82.5
x to the original tree,

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:24.410
so that's not that bad.

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:29.420
900 CPU hours-- this is
just 75,000 CPU hours.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:34.050
If it were a matter
of national security

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.680
to get the exact
solution to Omaha,

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.150
the military could just
do it in a few months.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:42.110
There's also [INAUDIBLE]
you can do, by the way.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:46.270
Basically, what they did
is-- before they did this,

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:49.030
was that they
solved the sub-game.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:52.830
In that, basically if you
both get hands together

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:55.970
and you say you have to play
these hands the same way,

00:41:55.970 --> 00:42:04.340
that's basically a sub-strategy.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.160
You can consider
subspace of your strategy

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.090
x prime of x and y
prime of y, and you just

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:14.530
solved the x prime y prime
game, meaning you both get hands

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:18.150
together, probably on the river
because that's when bucketing

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.820
kind of becomes more necessary.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.310
And you solve that
game, and you go, well,

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:28.250
how optimal is x prime
in the hold game?

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:34.180
And if you're good at bucketing,
it may be pretty close.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.400
If you're bad at
bucketing, like you

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:41.870
put the aces in the same
bucket as seven, five suited,

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.240
you probably won't
get a great answer.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:51.010
So you need to intelligently
design your buckets.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:55.530
You can't-- well, I guess there
are also evolutionary things

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.100
you can do to try to design
buckets and see what things are

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.780
close to each other.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.882
People who have
familiarity with this

00:43:03.882 --> 00:43:07.290
know that this is
kind of hit or miss.

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:13.440
Another game that you
can maybe solve is razz.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.840
It's definitely as simple
as [INAUDIBLE] a stud.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.140
Why is razz simpler than
all other games of stud?

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.600
There are only 13
different cards.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.100
The deuce of spades is the same
card as the deuce of hearts.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.360
You can't-- well, you
could make flushes,

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.040
but they're irrelevant.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.100
So unfortunately there
are 13 to the 8th power

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.030
possible ways of cards
can come, because there

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.570
are four up cards.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:41.080
That's sort of the problem.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.830
Kind of the
community information

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:47.200
you have is a bigger
set, and your trees just

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.810
get bigger because now
you have one extra street.

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:58.540
And you still have 415 choose 3
combinations of any three ranks

00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.800
as river hand types.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.740
So There are 2.4
quadrillion river hands.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.280
So that's a factor
of 374 [INAUDIBLE],

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.730
but we think some of these
roads are pretty null.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:16.620
How many of you
actually play razz?

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.310
A couple of you.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:18.285
OK, great.

00:44:18.285 --> 00:44:22.740
Good poker class that
people study razz.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.850
If you have a queen up
and a deuce completes it,

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.080
you're not really going
to get into a raising war

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:34.310
and make it [INAUDIBLE]
cap on third street.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:36.460
Some of the [INAUDIBLE]
may be null.

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.280
You can do some
bucketing, perhaps.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.090
Razz is kind of more
natural to bucketing

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:50.690
because you can think about
what hands to bucket together.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:54.250
Maybe the king,
eight, six, deuce

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.380
is very close to the
king, eight, six, ace.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.680
And the two strategies--
and you can start in hands

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.380
by rank order of cards
or something like that.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.400
So this is 374.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.290
This is 82.5.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:17.230
Or you could apply
for a grant and say

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:22.190
we need x hours of CPU time.

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:24.250
I don't know what the
right strategy is,

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:28.560
but these two problems
are tractable.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.960
Let's talk about big bet
games because there's

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:42.530
been some sort of discussion,
even last night, about Snowie.

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:48.480
A few people have tried big bet
games, and they're problems.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.150
First of all, there's a
continuum of bet sizes

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.820
you can make.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.210
The Snowie solution just
assumes three bet sizes.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.470
I can bet half the pot, I can
bet the pot, or I can jam,

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:01.530
I think.

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.980
Maybe there's-- I can
bet two times the pot,

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.680
but the problem with that is
that I think that's a little

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.550
bit too coarse.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:10.860
The question is, if
you solved that game,

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.370
how close is that
solution to the real game?

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.612
And that's kind of an
interesting question,

00:46:18.612 --> 00:46:20.445
but you don't even have
a complete strategy.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.200
What if some guy bets
a quarter of the pot,

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.930
or 1.5 times the pot, something
that' not on your list?

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:35.970
You have to exploit-- and
then it gets kind of weird,

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:39.500
because my response
to a pot size bet

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.145
is to raise the pot again.

00:46:41.145 --> 00:46:44.890
All right, what if he
makes a 1.1 times the pot?

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:51.560
Is it right to raise the pot--
just raise the pot 1.1 times

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.630
or raise the pot 0.9 times so
you get back to the same stack

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:59.675
sizes so you can do the
same thing in the future.

00:46:59.675 --> 00:47:00.925
These are difficult questions.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.360
Even if some bets
[INAUDIBLE] are non-optimal,

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.900
our full strategy needs
responses to to the bets.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.510
So simple
approximations may work.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:19.770
I kind of feel this is kind
of a tough problem, though.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:24.730
And you could just--
just playing a game

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:28.820
where you can just make
rigid pot bet sizes,

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.990
then you might get something
actually interesting.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:35.120
But one of the things
with regret matching,

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.560
if you actually have a lot of
bet sizes, suppose you say,

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.580
OK, I'm just going
to kill this problem,

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:47.020
and I'm going to do 0.01 times
the pot, 0.02 times the pot,

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.230
0.03 times the pot,
and so on and so forth.

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:51.990
The problems is now you have a
lot of options which are really

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:55.500
close in equity together,
so this regret minimization

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.330
is going to take a while.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:02.100
It's going to have to sort
out really close events.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.500
And then it's going to
have to balance your value

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.610
bets with your bluff
and things like that.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:10.590
So even just trying to kill it
by putting a lot of bet types

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:14.870
may not solve the
problem for you.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.490
So two player,
three player games

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:26.010
are actually kind
of interesting.

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:29.130
The dress by the group
and using counterfactual

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:33.190
regret to create competitive
multi-player agents.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:42.320
And this is a paper
done in 2011 or so.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.360
And the program for
actually first and second

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.760
in annual three
player limit event--

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.930
the first problem is that
there's no guarantee of epsilon

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.030
convergence.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:56.140
You're not necessarily within
epsilon of Nash equilibrium.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:01.450
Second problem is
that, do you just

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.160
want to play in
Nash equilibrium?

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.340
There could be multiple Nash
equilibria in multi-way games,

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:12.840
especially in these proportional
payout tournaments, satellites

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.110
where, say, two
people get a seat.

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.450
There are really
nonlinear effects going,

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:20.940
and it could [INAUDIBLE]
which collusive equilibria are

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:21.490
you playing?

00:49:25.331 --> 00:49:28.510
In our book, Jared
and I point out

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.910
a game called the
rock maniac game

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.820
where it's a real
poker game where

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:39.170
players can use a simple
strategy and ensure you losing.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.920
A simple version
non-poker version,

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.750
like a game where you play even
or odds with three players,

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:49.200
but the odd man out wins.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.220
So suppose you and
I are colluding

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.810
against the third chump.

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:56.940
What would we do?

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:57.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.990
PROFESSOR: Right, I would
play one, and you'd play two.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:04.620
And the third guy
could never win.

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:10.360
There are situations which can
come up in poker like that,

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:18.990
but I think if
there's no collusion

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:22.660
and it's not a tournament,
playing Nash equilibria usually

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.190
turns out OK.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:28.850
I think that's sort of the
argument they were making

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:30.680
in creating these strategies.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.570
All right, here
are the references.

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:41.065
This took about [INAUDIBLE] the
time I estimated, so questions?

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:47.660
OK, let's just-- you
hand your hand up first.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.975
AUDIENCE: Well, the
original strategy

00:50:49.975 --> 00:50:52.360
finds that the Nash
equilibria, if you're

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.116
playing against someone who's
trying to beat [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:56.116 --> 00:51:01.845
strategy-- does it work
if one of the strategies

00:51:01.845 --> 00:51:03.825
is probabilistic.

00:51:03.825 --> 00:51:05.674
Let's say two strategy trees--

00:51:05.674 --> 00:51:06.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.803
It does work with--

00:51:07.803 --> 00:51:09.344
AUDIENCE: Choose
[INAUDIBLE], but you

00:51:09.344 --> 00:51:11.506
don't know always
which one I'll choose.

00:51:11.506 --> 00:51:14.610
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
works because you're

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:18.720
going to play-- all
of these strategies

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:23.050
assume that they could
be mixed strategies.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:26.600
If you're not allowed to play
1/3 rock, 1/3 paper, and 1/3

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.280
scissors, then
you're going to have

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.170
to play really bad strategy,
and there's definitely

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:35.780
times in which mixing is
going to be necessary.

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:36.540
So, yeah.

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:38.815
All of these
strategies have mixing.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.160
Yeah?

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.618
AUDIENCE: What
effects do you think

00:51:43.618 --> 00:51:48.502
[INAUDIBLE] going to have
on limit hold 'em games?

00:51:48.502 --> 00:51:49.460
PROFESSOR: I don't now.

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:55.660
I think pretty much before
the solution came out

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:59.440
the big online players kind
of knew that a lot of people

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.040
were playing near optimal, and I
think the game is kind of dead.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.254
What do you think, Mike?

00:52:06.254 --> 00:52:08.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.910
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:13.010
Too bad Matt doesn't come here.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] are
already basically doing this

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.600
anyway.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.660
PROFESSOR: Well, no.

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.940
I mean, even if you have the
strategy, you have to learn it.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.880
The problem is that, if you
go to a casino and you play

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.110
somebody who's a good
limit hold 'em player,

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:36.730
he's-- because these types
of strategies have been out

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:42.650
for a while, they already played
much closer to optimal than

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:44.280
they did before.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:49.500
So I think this would have
absolutely no effect on heads

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.670
up limit hold 'em.

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:54.379
It's already kind
of no one-- yes?

00:52:54.379 --> 00:52:56.670
AUDIENCE: So can you talk
more about different ways you

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:58.086
can do approximations.
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:58.086 --> 00:53:01.830
mentioning earlier bucketing
all of the different hands

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:05.090
[INAUDIBLE] the
ranks or what are

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:06.870
some other things we can do?

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.710
PROFESSOR: It's an
endless [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:12.770
be clever in bucketing.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:14.570
So bucket hand types together.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.370
One kind of clever
thing you can do

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:23.430
is try to cut out
the river entirely

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:28.020
by just estimating your
equity on the river.

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.270
Of course, that's not going
to be your showdown equity

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:35.750
because you may be
forced to face of a bet.

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:42.890
So you try some sort of
implied value of your hand.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:46.700
Let's see.

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.710
What other bucketing things.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:57.340
I mean, in some games there's
a sort of a natural way

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.000
of bucketing hand types.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:06.570
Like In the river on
Omaha, you could just

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:10.520
try to bucket the cards that
actually play and ignore

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.030
the other cards.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:14.880
The thing is that, when you do
things like that, [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.526
losing assisting, we
call it card removal.

00:54:18.526 --> 00:54:21.610
Card removal and
blocking players

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:23.810
from having the nuts
and things like that

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.810
are pretty important--
do turn out

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:30.450
to be a pretty important
part of the game theory

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:33.000
optimal solution when
you're getting down

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.830
to the milli big
blind kind of level.

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:42.300
And if you don't think
about card removal at all,

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:46.600
then you actually
have a strategy that

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.300
can be exploited pretty easily.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.770
Actually, I talked
about this yesterday.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:59.630
The thing is typically
when the pot is p

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.280
and you're facing
a bet, you want

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.590
to make them
indifferent to bluffing.

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:13.670
He's betting 1 to win p, so you
want to call about pr over p

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:15.070
plus 1 at the time.

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:17.340
If you don't call
this much, he's

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.110
going to bluff and take it.

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:22.890
So that's sort of the thing.

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:27.520
We're saying the bet
is 1 and the pot is p.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.980
So if the pot is
10, and he bets 1,

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:33.900
and he takes it more
than 1/11 at the time,

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:38.990
he's going to just--
[INAUDIBLE] bluff everything.

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:42.750
The real problem
becomes that, if you

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:45.740
don't think about
card removal at all,

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:49.540
he can start bluffing
hands in which he knows

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:55.960
it's more likely you have a
mediocre hand or something that

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.970
includes a strong hand.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:01.920
One real example is
in PLO when there

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:07.107
is a flush on the board,
what's a good bluff?

00:56:07.107 --> 00:56:08.690
AUDIENCE: You have
ace of [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:10.642
PROFESSOR: Right, you
have the ace in a suit.

00:56:10.642 --> 00:56:11.850
You don't have anything else.

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.980
That's a great bluff,
because you're blocking him

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.960
from having a great
hand, and you're

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.260
blocking all of his
not hands and a lot

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.900
of his really good hands.

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:28.350
And he's much more
likely to fold,

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:33.490
because if you bet the
pot, a lot of his hands

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:38.050
he's [INAUDIBLE] himself with
[INAUDIBLE] with the nut flush.

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:39.570
Oh, I have a natural call.

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:40.270
Are you all in?

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.936
I have the nuts?

00:56:40.936 --> 00:56:42.850
OK, I call.

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:47.277
So that's why card
removal is important.

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:51.956
Yeah?

00:56:51.956 --> 00:56:53.928
AUDIENCE: So is my
understanding correct

00:56:53.928 --> 00:56:56.886
that optimal [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:59.796 --> 00:57:00.420
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:04.758
AUDIENCE: And has there been any
study of optimal [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.345
PROFESSOR: Sort of
like utility theory.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:20.760
In poker in general,
it's kind of weird.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.750
People think a lot
about that [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:26.070
what tournament
they should enter,

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:28.050
what games they should play.

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:31.810
But there hasn't
been a study really

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:35.160
optimizing your own personal
utility within the games.

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.250
The assumption is kind
of like, well, I'm

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:41.075
going to use all this cool
utilities theory [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:41.075 --> 00:57:42.575
to figure out what
game I'm playing.

00:57:42.575 --> 00:57:44.074
As long as I'm
playing the game, I'm

00:57:44.074 --> 00:57:47.440
just going to try to
win the most money.

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.870
That's sort of
been the attitude,

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:54.440
and I think that's actually
correct for most [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.060
In limit hold 'em,
[INAUDIBLE] you

00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:00.460
need bank rolls of
hundreds of bets.

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.740
You're not going to
try to optimize and try

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:09.269
to win some fraction of a bet
with your utility function

00:58:09.269 --> 00:58:10.310
by lowering the variance.

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.910
That is an interesting
question, because maybe-- I

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:25.460
feel that, if there is some
utility consideration--

00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:28.020
like maybe in a tournament
you feel your chips are

00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:32.150
non-linear-- maybe
you are going to quit

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:35.850
playing your marginal
hands because of utility

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:38.240
considerations.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] like the
fountain table of major events.

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.215
They'll go beyond ICM to
say maybe I won't coin

00:58:44.215 --> 00:58:48.215
flip for a $10 edge
[INAUDIBLE] step up.

00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:54.190
PROFESSOR: I mean,
if you use ICM,

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:59.300
those utilities are already
kind of calculated, but yeah.

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:02.060
For example, final
table of the main event,

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:06.510
I'm not only using ICM,
but I'm thinking, well,

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:13.200
$3 million-- $4 million
compared to $2 million

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.420
is a much smaller step
to me than $2 million

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:20.080
is compared to 0 in my
own personal utility.

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.660
Like $0.5 million compared to
$2 million versus $2 million

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.400
compared to $3.5 million.

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:34.760
So I need to optimize utility.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.620
I mean, yeah.

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:40.376
I think that's kind
of worthy of study.

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:41.268
Yeah?

00:59:41.268 --> 00:59:45.230
AUDIENCE: What is it about
the analytics of poker

00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:47.700
that makes it so popular
with trading firms?

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:49.541
And how does it--

00:59:49.541 --> 00:59:50.290
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:51.996
That's a great question.

00:59:51.996 --> 00:59:54.336
AUDIENCE: How do you
use it professionally,

00:59:54.336 --> 00:59:55.280
all of this stuff?

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:58.140
PROFESSOR: Well, I mean,
I think poker is just

00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:03.840
kind of-- if you think what
one game-- if you could teach

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:08.500
traders one game, what
one game would represent

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.870
what traders have to know?

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:13.070
Well poker-- there
are a lot of actors.

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.580
There's incomplete information.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.900
That's one big thing.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.715
And you do have to do a lot of
thinking of what your counter

01:00:21.715 --> 01:00:23.610
party is doing.

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:25.480
If he wants to
trade against you,

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.100
he puts a bid or
offer-- some of that

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:36.050
is why there's this [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.935
Are you trying to
get out of risk?

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:40.780
[INAUDIBLE] big position
he's trying to get out of,

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:44.750
or do you have to be
worried about these orders

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:45.920
and things like that?

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.280
And also poker gives
you sort of the skills

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:55.539
to trade that-- suppose you
know something is worth $10.

01:00:55.539 --> 01:00:57.830
[INAUDIBLE] you're going to
make around it [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:01.740
Knowing nothing, you might
make-- bid [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.810
offer at 10/10,
which means you're

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:07.150
willing to buy the [INAUDIBLE]
or sell it at 10/10,

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:10.170
but you know something
about the counter party.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.810
You may know the
counter party can

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:20.320
be a better buyer than seller
or that buying is the risky part

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.830
[INAUDIBLE] is the risky part.

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:25.590
That kind of has a quant.

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:28.510
Also, as a quant,
doing poker analytics

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:33.910
is very similar to the
analysis we do in trading.

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:38.350
A lot of this analysis-- how
these strategies work, do

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:43.540
these strategies really return
what we think they return

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.320
are similar to discussions we
have in our trading strategy.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.400
I'm glad I'm able to talk to you
about this, because if you're

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.390
interested in doing
poker strategies,

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:57.090
you'll probably be interested in
doing trading strategies, too.

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.132
Any more questions?

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:02.310
Yes?

01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:07.705
AUDIENCE: What about doing
the deviation from [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:07.705 --> 01:02:12.930
the [INAUDIBLE] detecting
deviation or let's say somebody

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:15.420
goes from playing
optimally [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.320
not playing optimal [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:24.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I mean that's
a very interesting thing,

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:30.270
and that's actually hard
to determine because that

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:32.070
feels a little bit
harder than this

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:33.960
because this is [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.340
It's like I'm trying to figure
out the optimal strategy,

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:40.040
and I just play this,
and whatever money

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.550
comes to me comes to me.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.600
You open your arms.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.500
The money comes to you.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.970
The other thing is, oh,
well he's playing badly,

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:52.380
so I'm going to go there
and take his money.

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.740
But then if I
deviate from optimal,

01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:00.220
I'm also opening up
myself to being exploited.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.480
So that's kind of hard.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.880
That's much more of
a dynamic problem.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.260
When does he go on tilt?

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.330
How long was he on tilt?

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:15.780
What evidence do we
have that he's on tilt.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:21.450
I know that [INAUDIBLE],
the guys in CMU,

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:26.490
were looking into some
sort of zero loss way

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:29.630
to exploit your opponents,
because you just figure out

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.160
when your opponents
are playing badly,

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.800
how much they've given up
in playing sub-optimally,

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.670
and then you go
to a [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:41.830
But you only open
up yourself to, say,

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:43.750
half the money he's
given up, or something

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:46.120
like that, playing badly.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:53.080
And the metric is-- so there's
some sort of gaming algorithm

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:57.002
you can do to do that,
but yeah that's definitely

01:03:57.002 --> 01:03:57.960
another field of study.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.450
There are a lot of interesting
fields that can come out poker

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:02.950
[INAUDIBLE].

01:04:06.171 --> 01:04:06.670
All right.

01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:07.570
I guess that's it.

01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:09.120
[APPLAUSE]
