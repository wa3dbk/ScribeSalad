00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:20.930
PROFESSOR STRANG: Alright.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.290
So this is Lecture 15.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.530
It's the last topic, today and
Friday, like just 15 and 16.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.630
Trusses within Chapter 2.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.480
The last topic we'll do
for discrete systems.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.810
Then it's a lot of fun.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.620
I wanted to say a few words
first about last night's exam.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.720
Several words first.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.920
Overall, I'm sure
it's going to be fine.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.430
Ramis is grading the
first two problems,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.590
he'll pass them to
Peter for the next two.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.140
And I'll get them back.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.180
I'm pretty sure
it'll be next week.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.490
I felt it was a fair
exam, except I should

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.220
have done a better job in
helping you with the matrix A.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.700
Especially in problem one.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.040
I'm glad that hint was
there, the matrix A_0, that

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.150
goes with free-free, to sort
of say what kind of matrix

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.570
to be looking for.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.450
And I thought I'd just repeat,
make the connections that I

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.700
should have made earlier.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.800
So we all see the
point about these.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.350
These A's and the
A transpose A's.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.050
So if I take, for that
A_0, free-free one.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.130
Everybody sees that this is--
And this connects of course

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.650
with our graphs.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.650
Our graph is just this
simple graph with well

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.840
actually is that how
many, is it five nodes?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.810
I guess there are five.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.760
Because as it stands I have one,
two, three, four, five columns,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.180
I've got five u's,
u_0 down to u_4.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.030
And if I take A_0
transpose A_0, that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.640
would be the free-free matrix.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.150
What size would it be?

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.320
And what matrix would it be?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.580
Just if we do that
multiplication,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.170
this is a first
difference matrix.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.670
When I do A_0
transpose A_0 I'll get

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.740
one of our second
difference matrices.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.120
So it'll be one of
our special ones.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.980
Which special one would it be?

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.480
B. It'll be the matrix B
that has both ends free.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.110
And what size will it be?

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.230
I guess it'll be five by five.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.380
That's right; that would be
five by four times A_0, which

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.520
is four by five.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.380
So it'll be the five by five
matrix B. Can I call it B_5?

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.580
OK.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.020
So that was there as a hint.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.480
That isn't the correct
matrix for problem one

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.100
because problem one
was fixed-fixed.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.930
Let's get there in two steps.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.240
Suppose it's fixed-free.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.600
So suppose I make u_0 equal 0.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.340
So I ground the top node,
I support the top node--

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.110
Oh no, shall I do u_0?

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.670
Yeah.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.790
I'll do u_0.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.700
So that would
knock out this one.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.870
If I say fix u_0, say,
at zero or whatever.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.910
Now I've got, the next A, I
won't call it A_0 anymore.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.550
So now four by four, now
if I do A transpose A,

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.510
which of our special
matrices am I going to get?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.170
T. It'll be T. It'll be
the one that has the first,

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.110
the (1, 1) entry
will only be a one.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.490
So that'll be the
fixed-free matrix.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.900
It'll be of what size?

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.010
Four.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.380
Now I've only got four
unknowns. u_1 to u_4.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.650
OK, that still is not
what problem one is.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.910
Problem one was fixed-fixed.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.850
So as I did in the review,
that would knock out

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.840
both of these columns.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.850
So this now is the matrix that I
was looking for in problem one,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.750
and I wish I had emphasized
these steps in advance.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.130
I apologize.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.330
OK, so what fixed-fixed if,
without the C part in it.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.120
Just focusing on the A, what
fixed-fixed matrix would I get?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.330
Which one of our
guys would it be?

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.570
K of size three.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.880
And while we're at it, what
would be the story, how would

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.390
I get one of these
circular ones, which

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.640
is sort of on our special list.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.040
For Fourier it's the
really special guy.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.750
So a circular one I'm going
to connect u_4 back to u_0.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.190
So I'm going to put
these guys back in.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.780
And what else would change, if
u_4 was connected back to u_0,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.960
now I'm aiming for
this circulant.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.450
What matrix A is going
to give me the circulant?

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.980
So again, these guys
are the A transpose A's.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.500
This over here was the A, and
over here is the A transpose A.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.800
And now I want to
fix A, and then

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.550
I want to see that A
transpose A. So suppose

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.310
I give you that graph, then.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.520
Oops, I should have, well.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.770
Just connect the whole guy.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.790
So fifth node coming
back to the first.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.890
So that's my circle of nodes.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.140
That's a simple graph.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:49.240
What's the A_circulant now?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.500
So this would be the A
for the circulant case.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.590
So it's got that back in.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.020
That shouldn't be erased,
that shouldn't be erased.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.930
And what else has it got?

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.610
If I ask you for the incidence
matrix, now I'm in Section 2.4,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.530
like I've given
you a graph, or you

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.480
can think of masses and
springs in a circle.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.660
So I've got five
masses, five springs.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.140
What's my matrix A missing?

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.070
It needs another row.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.690
We just put in another
edge, it needs another row.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:39.350
That edge went from the last
node back to the first node.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:45.510
So we've got a fifth row.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.090
So you see, now it
really is circulant.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.430
I would call this one
also a circulant matrix.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.750
The diagonals are constant.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.850
That's what I and MATLAB
and everybody else

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.620
would call a Toeplitz matrix,
and the command toeplitz

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.740
could create this.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.460
That diagonal is constant.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.620
That diagonal is constant.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.590
The other diagonals
are constant.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.600
But more than that,
what's additional

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.080
here in the circulant,
which is the thing that

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.500
makes Fourier happy?

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.930
The diagonal circles around.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.430
That diagonal has only
got four entries in it,

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.190
but it circles around
sort of periodically

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.030
to its fifth entry.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.210
So that's more than Toeplitz.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.820
It's circulant because
it's coming around again.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.570
This we'll see in the
discrete Fourier transform.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.270
It's really all good stuff.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.240
And now there is my a circulant.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.620
And what would be my A
transpose circulant A_circulant?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:03.770
What would be A transpose A if
I take that five by five matrix?

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:09.790
C. Finally I've created, so
I've already got B, I've got T,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.780
I've got K, all those
three special guys.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.220
And now the A transpose
A for this circulant,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.210
so that's a first difference
matrix for a periodic problem.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.790
And A transpose A will
be a second difference

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.200
matrix for a periodic
problem, C_5, I guess.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.305
It'll be five.

00:09:29.305 --> 00:09:29.805
OK.

00:09:29.805 --> 00:09:34.130
I hope that brings together
what I, if I was on the ball,

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.370
I would have brought it
together before the quiz.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:45.030
Can I just say a few words
about the quiz and grades?

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.650
They come out fine.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.070
Really they do.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.130
I've been doing
this a long time.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:59.050
And just, enjoy October.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.760
I'm sorry to give
you any exam at all,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.230
but it's a chance for you yeah,
I'm working on this stuff.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.590
I'm learning it.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.940
Everybody didn't
learn it first time.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.820
I don't learn it
first time, every time

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.080
I teach the course I
learn something more.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.400
And if you're learning from this
course then I'm totally happy.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.430
And I believe that's the case.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.380
So I am entirely happy.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:32.120
And I hope the quiz,
some points of it

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.030
I wish I'd prepared better.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:39.740
But I feel pretty good about it.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.680
I feel good about
it, let me just say.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.340
So, and I'm happy to have any
comments, email or in person.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.740
But allow me to go
forward with trusses.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.980
However, I'm ready
always for a comment.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.740
Yeah.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.100
OK.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.680
Anyway, enjoy trusses.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.990
Enjoy life.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.150
Yeah.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.740
And this should have been
in the book, this page.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:11.170
So if it wasn't too late
I would paste it in.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.120
Because this connects
A transpose A

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.680
to special matrices, in
the way I had in my mind,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.250
but I didn't put it on
the board until just now.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:29.020
OK, so I'll cover that up
and ready to go with trusses.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.180
OK.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.840
So trusses, we want
to know what's up.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.500
We want to get the setup right.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:45.000
Once we get the setup we'll
know we're looking for.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.100
OK, so a truss is a bunch of
elastic bars with pin joints

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.900
connecting them.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.110
Now, what do I mean
by a pin joint?

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:05.570
I mean that stretching
the bars takes force.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.810
Turning around the pin
joint doesn't take force.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:18.130
So the pin just lets
them turn, so we'll

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.740
have forces in those bars.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.210
So it's like masses and springs.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.300
Exactly like masses and springs.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.140
But yet we have a 2-D problem.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.800
So it's a two
dimensional problem

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.340
with masses and springs.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.550
And we could certainly
have a 3-D truss,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.680
but 2-D makes all
the important points.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.650
And then I can count the bars.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.360
One, two, three, four, five.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.800
And I can count the nodes.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.720
There happen to be five here.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.710
But now comes the moment.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.370
I have to tell you,
what are the unknowns?

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.380
What are the u's.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.090
Because of course,
you know that I'm

00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:05.220
going to go from u's to
e's to w's, to forces, f.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.780
And you know that a matrix
A is going to do that.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.080
A matrix C is going to do that.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.650
A matrix A transpose
is going to do that.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.090
You're all ready, we need
to know what's the setup.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.890
What are these matrices.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.490
OK, and how many-- So
let me explain the setup.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:31.630
Typical node, node one. we
have forces in these bars,

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:38.250
so that node one
could have a force.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.960
We're in the plane.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.200
So we have a horizontal
force and a vertical force.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.060
Together, that would
give, produces a force

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.460
in any direction whatever.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.880
So this is the key point.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:59.340
That there is a horizontal
force. f horizontal one.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.440
The one being the
force on node one.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.700
But there's also
a vertical force.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.940
And let me take
horizontal to the right,

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.510
positive to the right.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.320
Vertical positive upwards.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.550
Just to have a convention.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.180
So how many f's have I got?

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.140
Well, the point is I
now have two per node.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.610
That's the difference.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.960
I have two per node, two forces.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.480
And I have two
displacements per node.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.410
Because that point under,
there will be more forces.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:38.020
Some maybe pulling
this way, whatever.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.030
Maybe let's look at node two.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.710
So node two could have a
couple of forces on it.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.420
f h two, and f v two.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.000
And it moves like
the other nodes.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.140
So now I'm introducing
the unknowns. u

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.680
is the movement. u,
again horizontal,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.240
and again, now we're
talking about node two.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.080
And it moves up.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.870
Or doesn't, or moves down.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.470
But that's an unknown.
u, a displacement,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.130
a vertical displacement
of node two.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.330
Do you see the setup?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.350
Two forces per node.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.210
Two displacements per node.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:27.650
So that's like, the number
of unknown is like doubled.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:33.220
Like, doubled, and that produces
an interesting situation.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.180
I've marked supports here.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.860
So let's just speak
about supports.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.310
So what's happening
at the supports?

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:49.110
At the support
there's no movement.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.940
The whole-- That
point is pinned.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:57.120
So this is telling me
that u horizontal five

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.920
is zero and u vertical,
sorry that was four

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.830
and it'll be the same for
five. u vertical five is zero.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.760
It's like grounding a node
in the electrical case.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.580
We just see this
pattern over and over.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.090
And we want to see OK, what
does it look like for trusses?

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.140
So here's a support
that fixes those.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.090
So those are not unknowns.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.480
And similarly, they're
not unknowns there.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.420
Still saying five
when I mean four.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:34.300
So those are boundary
conditions, n conditions,

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:34.870
whatever.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.330
And similarly here.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.500
So how many unknowns are there?

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:45.120
Now look at this picture, how
many unknown displacements

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.830
are there in this truss?

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.380
Six.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.320
Six, right?

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.180
Two here, two here, two
here and none there.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:17:00.520
So the number of
actual unknowns is six.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:06.340
My idea would be that it's
twice the number of nodes

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:13.980
minus the number of fixed
things, reaction, whatever.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.250
That R would be
four in this case.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.490
I've got two fixed here
and two fixed here,

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.190
so this would be two times five.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.980
Ten possible
displacements but R counts

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.580
the number of fixed
displacements, four,

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.580
and leaves us with six.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.320
OK.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.590
So my matrix A will now
be, it's always m by n.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.880
My matrix A will be five by six.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.060
OK.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.340
Now you're going to ask
what is that matrix.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.940
But let me hold that
off for a little moment.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.910
I want to just see
its shape first.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:02.160
So you could now do this
for a large truss, right?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.500
You count the bars, and
you could count the nodes.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.990
And then you could count the
unknown displacements, u.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:17.190
So there are six u's here.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.460
And there are five e's.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.530
And there are five bar forces.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:29.700
And there are six equilibrium,
balance, force balances.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.920
Six, six for the node count,
for the unknowns count,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.480
five, five for the bars count.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:44.520
OK, now here's a point
about this particular truss.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.440
It's not safe to get on it.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.570
Right?

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.650
And I want to say
why is it not safe.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.860
So this is a feature that comes
into the truss question that

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.040
makes it a little new
and more interesting.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:03.850
A little twist compared
to the previous examples.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.450
That bar, that truss,
I wouldn't stand on it.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.150
Now, why not?

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.980
Well, purely for
linear algebra reasons.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.230
Of course.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.650
The matrix A is five by six.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.840
So now what do we know about
a matrix that's five by six?

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.790
So A is five by six.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.420
Five rows, as always the m;
six columns, because now we

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.850
have six unknowns.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:36.240
And what do I know about
any five by six matrix?

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.400
I want to ask about
the equation Au=0.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.810
So I want to ask about it
in linear algebra language

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.700
and then I want to ask about
it in physical language.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.610
And the beauty is the thing
that makes trusses sort of fun

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:57.070
is, these matrices, A,
get pretty big fast.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.590
Because when I put
a few more nodes on,

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:04.460
the book has a picture
of a sort of treehouse.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.220
Then A is growing.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.030
And I don't, all the time,
write down the matrix A.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.950
I haven't written it down here.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.330
What I've written
down is just its size,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:21.540
because that's enough to tell
us something about this set

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.290
of equations Au=0.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.200
What's the story on Au=0?

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.900
Well of course it
has the solution u=0.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.940
Nothing moving.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.710
If I have no displacement,
if the u's are all zero,

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.840
then I have no stretching.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.290
The e's are stretching.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.890
Elongation, as before.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.250
How far does the bar stretch?

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:44.940
OK.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.760
So if I have zero
u's and zero e's.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:55.700
But, what other possibility
am I going to have here?

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.520
I'm going to have
probably one solution

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.800
to this system that isn't zero.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.910
I'm probably going to have one
set of displacements u, look

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.140
what's happening here.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.750
This is Au is the e.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.900
So I'm going to have at least
one and probably in this case

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:26.530
it will be one, there will
be one, the neat word for it

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.930
is a mechanism.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.850
And what does that mean?

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.000
A mechanism is a
solution to Au=0.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.370
So that, a mechanism is
a movement of the bar.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.410
So it's going to be non-zero.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.080
The bars are going
to move a little.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.060
Sorry, the nodes are
going to move a little.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.180
The nodes will
move a little bit.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.660
In this u, because
it isn't zero.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.420
But the bars won't stretch.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:04.060
So that tells us we've
got instability here.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.880
If there's a solution
to that, that's

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.020
always telling us that A
transpose A is singular.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.020
So let me just put
that A transpose A --

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:18.950
or A transpose C A, C couldn't
save it -- will be singular.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:24.910
It's just like our free-free
thing in being singular,

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.450
but the picture doesn't
look free-free, does it?

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:33.000
It's got supports in here,
just not good enough.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.190
And I believe that if
you look at this truss,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.430
you could describe,
you could tell me,

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:47.620
and you could draw, a movement
of that truss in which

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.040
there is displacement
but no stretching.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.560
Let me ask you how to draw that.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.410
And I believe--
Everybody understood,

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.240
why was there a solution?

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.070
It was because we
have six unknowns

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.320
and we only have five equations.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.720
So this was five equations.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.640
Any time you have five
equations with a zero

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.540
on the right-hand side,
so five homogeneous

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.315
equations, whatever you
want to say when that's zero

00:23:17.315 --> 00:23:20.190
on the right and six unknowns.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.160
Six u's.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.340
Then you're going
to have solution.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.460
You can't help it.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.990
You've got that many
degrees of freedom,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.940
you've only got that
many constraints, there's

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.220
going to be solution.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.540
OK, tell me how to draw that.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.570
Let me put in the truss now.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.940
What's the solution?

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:49.570
So this is the fun part
in a particular example

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.140
at the start.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:24:04.790
How could that move
without stretching bars?

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:08.340
Let me see.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.690
What could happen?

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:16.400
What do you mean now,
who's going to move where?

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.280
What's the movement here?

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.830
And I want to draw
it over there.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:23.480
So you give the answer
by drawing it as well

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.160
as by telling me
the six unknown u's.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:33.300
So what can happen
at this thing?

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:40.200
So you're going to say the
truss could, these bars could,

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.630
turn a little?

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.750
And notice that word a little.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.050
We're talking
small displacement,

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.980
small stretches
all the time here.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.240
I'll show you why
we're always making

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.430
that linearity assumption,
or small assumption.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.290
OK, those move a little.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:05.090
And what happens to that
triangle at the top?

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.630
It sort of just
moves along, right?

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.190
So the picture you
would draw would

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:16.210
be that you started there.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.820
And it moved along
a little, I'll

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.030
make it a larger displacement
than I really have in mind.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.380
These guys of course are here.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:31.180
So they come out and
the rest of the truss,

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.470
the top of the truss,
just kind of goes with it.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.720
Goes with the flow.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.970
That would be the answer
that I would be looking for,

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.720
to draw the mechanism.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.230
That would show it.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.970
And if I wanted to
write down the u that

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.450
goes with it, what would it be?

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.230
Let me again number these
guys; this is one, two,

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.780
and this is three.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:02.880
So what are the displacements
of nodes one, two, and three?

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:07.940
I'll always write u_1
horizontal before vertical.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.620
Can we make an agreement?

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.440
So I want to know about
the horizontal movement

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.780
then the vertical
movement of node one,

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.860
then node two, then node three.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.080
So I'll have six numbers there.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.710
And what could I put in
for those six numbers?

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:27.120
So the horizontal, let me
suppose that that first guy,

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.140
I'll put a one.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.370
Really that's a bigger
number than I should put,

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.980
but it's a convenient number.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.860
So I'll just take it to be
one even though I really

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.500
have in mind-- Let's say
that's one angstrom, or one

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.320
tiny little person.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:51.820
OK, so what about the rest?

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:58.630
What's the vertical-- Oh yeah,
this is a key point here,

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.600
what's the vertical movement?

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.110
This movement to
me is horizontal.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:09.910
I'm going to say that the
vertical moment is zero.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.830
Of node one, just moves over.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.780
And node two does the same.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.440
And node three does the same.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.840
So that's my solution.
[1, 0, 1,  0, 1, 0].

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:25.370
That's a simple movement, a
simple set of displacements,

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:30.820
think most to the right.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.340
I have not written
down the matrix A,

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.610
but probably won't even
do it until next time.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.320
But you will see that
when we do the matrix A

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:46.490
for this particular truss
will have this particular u

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.210
as a mechanism.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:56.130
In linear algebra, u is in
the null space of A. Au=0,

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.410
that's all that means.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:04.260
OK, do you see more
or less what's up?

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:09.610
But now there's one little
thing that may be bothering you.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.070
Which is what?

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:18.650
If I come back to the
zero, zero, zero there,

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:23.520
you could correctly
say wait a minute,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.590
if those bars didn't
stretch, if they just

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.170
rotated as you
told me to do, then

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:35.130
this was mostly across but
a little bit down, right?

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.570
And I'm saying no.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.120
I'm saying zero.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.930
OK, how do I get away with that?

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.520
So I'm saying in
18.085 it's a zero.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.480
And why?

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:55.080
So this is like a little
time-out just to focus in on,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.490
let me focus in on node two.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:02.420
So here's the bottom
node four, so it

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.060
used to be vertical up to two.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.920
This was node two and
this was number four.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.620
And then it rotated
a little, to there.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.690
To this position.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:18.370
So it went, if this
angle was, let's say,

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:26.560
theta, then what is
that actual position?

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.760
So let's say this was, let's
say the bar had length one.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.450
This is the origin, (0, 0).

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.760
This is the point
(0, 1) above it, OK?

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.280
And now, that's before it moved.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.780
Then it moved a little bit.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.470
It moved to an angle theta.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.090
What's the position of that bar?

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:48.890
Of that node?

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.030
What's the new
position of the node,

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.700
and then we'll look
at the difference

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.760
and we'll see the movement
u, the displacement.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:06.820
So how far did it move?

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.390
What's the x-coordinate?

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.400
How far did it go across?

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.470
If I put in that
line you'll know.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.760
So the movement across
was, sin(theta)?

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.220
Good. sin(theta).

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:28.630
And the movement down, well,
yes, so let's find its position

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.550
and then we'll take
the difference.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:41.530
So what's the vertical
new position for that guy?

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:47.470
It moved by, it moved
across by sin(theta).

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:56.810
And down by 1-cos(theta).

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.940
Are you agreed with that?

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:04.680
Because here is cosine
theta, right there.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.150
And here's the little
bit it moved down.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.490
OK.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.410
So these are exactly correct.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:16.550
Yeah this is in the position
of sin(theta), cos(theta),

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.540
and the difference
was the 1-cos(theta).

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.970
OK, so now here
comes the key point.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.590
Approximately, sin(theta)
is approximately,

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:31.680
if theta is small and now here
comes the smallness, sin(theta)

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.480
is approximately
theta. sin(theta)'s

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.840
approximately theta.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.440
And 1-cos(theta) is
approximately what?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:48.180
Now, this is the
important point.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.690
So theta is like the first term.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.450
If I expand, I
mean, the exact term

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:59.380
would be theta minus theta
cubed over six, dot dot dot.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.490
But I'm only keeping that term.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:08.740
And 1-cos(theta), now what's
the formula for cos(theta)?

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.350
This is like worth,
just should--

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:15.070
It's a one, because of
course cos(0) is one,

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.570
and then you subtract what?

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.420
Theta squared over two.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.710
And so on.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.540
And then plus theta fourth
over 24 or whatever.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.640
OK, so the ones
cancel as we expect.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:35.580
And I'm getting theta
squared over two.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:40.100
And this, here was theta
to the first power.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.810
Theta cubed was, we didn't care.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.440
And we don't care
about theta squared.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.870
So that's why it's zero.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:53.050
Because it's a second
order movement.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:57.330
If theta is small, as I'm going
to assume, small displacement,

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:01.690
theta squared would, if
I allowed theta squared

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.910
and cos(theta) in here, I'd
have a non-linear problem.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:07.120
And I don't want that.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.630
And I don't need it.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:14.740
I mean, finite elements,
structures, bridges, whatever.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.300
Your first hope and
expectation and calculation

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.030
is small theta, linear problem.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:27.990
So to a linear person
theta squared is zero.

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:31.490
That's why those guys are zero.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:36.890
OK, so that's an
assumption we'll often see,

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:41.990
so it kind of was.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.750
There are two kinds
of non-linearities

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.650
in structures and elasticity.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:54.980
One would be to allow this
geometric non-linearity.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.670
Thetas, large
displacements, theta large

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:01.200
enough so that you can't
neglect theta squared.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.330
That's a tough one.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.960
If you allow geometric
non-linearity in,

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.320
as finite element
codes have to do.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:14.660
If you-- ABAQUS is a code
that does major finite element

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.420
calculations, nonlinear ones.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.060
I mean they, at the
beginning they were studying

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.410
what happens, what are
the stresses on cables

00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:23.800
under the Atlantic.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.910
I mean, those are
fascinating problems.

00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:29.690
Or I mention car crashes.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.170
I mean, car crashes,
the geometry changes,

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.950
you have big displacements.

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:38.340
But we're talking here about
linear small displacement

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.060
cases.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:44.200
OK, so don't forget that part.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.120
That when the truss
gets more complicated,

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.090
the principle stays the same.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:55.070
That we distinguish between
the thetas that matter

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.220
and the theta
squareds that don't.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:01.220
OK, so now what?

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.960
Now I guess I'm
ready to complete

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.661
this picture a little more.

00:35:06.661 --> 00:35:07.160
OK.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.740
So let me, so we've understood
what's the idea of a mechanism.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:17.220
Oh, how could I
prevent a mechanism?

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:22.450
In other words, if I
stood on this truss,

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:29.410
the slightest bit of wind
would crash it down, right?

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.150
So that's unstable.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.780
That's an unstable truss.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.310
How could I make it stable?

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:43.630
I mean if you were designing
this thing, what would you do?

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.790
Add another edge.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.370
You'd stick in another bar.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.370
Maybe stick in a bar there.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.650
What would happen now?

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.392
Would it now be stable?

00:35:53.392 --> 00:35:54.850
You'd have to answer
that question.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:57.580
You couldn't just put
in bars, whatever.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.120
You want to put bars
that do the job.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.560
OK, now how many bars?

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.940
We've now got six bars.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.500
So m is now up to six.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.720
The matrix A is six by six now,
whatever that matrix may be.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.940
We have six bars,
six displacements.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.280
We can hope that we now
have a six by six, well,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.220
we do have a six by six
matrix, whatever it looks like.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:27.300
And we can hope that
it's not singular.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.180
We can hope it's
invertible, we can hope

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.820
that that mechanism is killed.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.040
And you see it is killed.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.410
The six by six, that
truss is now stable.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:42.350
No mechanism there, right?

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.780
Again I haven't written
down the matrix,

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:49.920
but I'm really calling for
engineering intuition here.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.630
That this truss is now
stable, and of course I

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.120
can make it even more stable
by adding a seventh edge.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.690
A seventh bar.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:03.960
So when it was six I had square
matrices, A transpose and then

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.250
C and then A would
have been square.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:12.630
Now I've got seven bars and, so
now I've put in a seventh guy.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.400
m is now up to seven.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:24.010
My matrix a would
now be seven by six.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.150
Mechanism will be
gone because I've

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:32.270
now got, what, seven equations.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.990
Same six u's.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:39.350
So we begin to get a feel of,
are there solutions or not?

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:44.750
What I'm saying is, I can't
tell just from the count

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.730
that A is not singular.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:51.880
I could have a lot of bars
and still be unstable.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.300
Invent a truss for me.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:58.450
Just because, how could you
invent a truss that had, maybe

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.850
it has seven bars.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:05.000
With those seven bars, those
diagonal guys, that did it.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.870
That made it stable.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.640
Our eye tells us that before
we do any linear algebra.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.330
Tell me a seven by-- A thing.

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.460
Well, yeah.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:23.300
OK, so here would be, shall
we support both of these?

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.860
I'll start out the same, OK.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:32.950
Now, yeah, how could I, let's
see, I've haven't prepared.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:36.230
How could I get a
whole lot of bars.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.340
I might not get seven by
six exactly, but how could

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:44.610
I have plenty of bars
and still unstable?

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.000
Well, suppose I do this.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.640
Oh yeah, that's a good example.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.350
That's not stable, right?

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:54.860
OK.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.610
Every let's practice
with that one.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:01.140
That's just my idea,
and problems in the book

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.410
just ask you to practice
with things like that.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.070
Tell me the count, first.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:10.220
What is m, the number of bars?

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.260
Six.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.480
What is n, the number
of unknowns, little n,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.560
the number of unknowns?

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.200
What's the shape
of my matrix here?

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:25.220
A is, it's got six bars
and how many unknowns?

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.650
Eight.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.700
Eight, right?

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.580
Two here, two, two, two.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.650
None here.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.310
Six by eight.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.010
OK.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:38.900
And how many mechanisms
am I now expecting?

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.200
Probably two.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.850
Probably two, there would be
two independent mechanisms here.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.350
Can you tell me
what they look like?

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:48.790
Draw them.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.600
What would they look like?

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.430
What would be two different
things that could happen,

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:58.870
could go wrong with that truss?

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:00.210
You see it, right?

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:02.400
This could turn.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.100
As in our example with the
top part moving with it.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:13.190
Or, a second one possibility
would be the top part goes.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:15.260
And the bottom part stays.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.620
Or any combination.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.540
So the whole thing
could go like that.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.540
That would be one.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.230
But that wouldn't be
the only one, of course.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.020
So in other words, we have
a two-dimensional space

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.690
of mechanisms and you could
give me two different,

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:35.590
and there are not just two
guys, all their combinations

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.250
are there.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.436
So this would have
two mechanisms.

00:40:40.436 --> 00:40:41.060
Two mechanisms.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.040
And I could put in
bars, of course,

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.940
that would try to save it.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:50.870
Well, how many bars, what's
the minimum number of bars

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.910
I absolutely need to make
this thing stable again?

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:55.990
Two.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.790
Well, now suppose I
put in these two bars.

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:01.480
Right?

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.540
I've got enough bars, I've
got an eight by eight matrix,

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.250
but I haven't saved it.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:07.340
Right?

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.700
Because it still
has that mechanism.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:14.980
So you can't assume that
because the count is right

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.980
you've avoided mechanisms
because in that example you

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:18.990
haven't.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:23.740
OK, so that would be a case
of square eight by eight,

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:29.740
but not good.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.280
So as soon as I say
there's a solution to Au=0,

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.270
I know that A transpose
A will be singular.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.020
And unstable.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:44.420
OK, before I go to the framework
let's just do one more thing.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:51.680
Suppose I take
away the supports.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:57.360
All right, let me put
in some bars, though.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.200
I'll put in some bars.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.640
OK, plenty of bars.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.840
Want another one?

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.960
OK, how many bars have I got?

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.720
Lots, right?

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:14.490
OK, now the matrix A, what
do you think about this?

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.084
Are there solutions?

00:42:16.084 --> 00:42:18.000
You haven't even seen
the matrix A, of course,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.280
but you've seen the truss,
that's what matters.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.190
How many solutions, are
there solutions to Au=0?

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:31.090
Are there ways that this truss
could move without stretching?

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:35.010
Are there ways that this truss
could move without stretching?

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.300
And what are they, and
how many are there?

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.800
And what name should we use?

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.640
OK, what are they?

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.410
How could that move
without stretching?

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:48.570
Well, it's got no
supports at all.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.660
It's just free out
there in space.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.540
So it could move.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.290
How many ways could it move?

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.220
Three.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.980
It could move, everybody
could move this way.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.710
All ones on the horizontal guys.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.990
Everybody could move
this way, all six

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.660
ones on the vertical guys,
it'll be 12 unknowns here.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:12.690
And it could also rotate,
what would be the rotation?

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.490
I'm not talking
about this rotation.

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:16.810
This could not happen.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:17.970
What could happen?

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:21.720
What rotation could happen here?

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.020
For this, there's a
third rigid motion.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:30.300
Translation, translation,
and rotation around,

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.090
well take this
one as an example.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.450
The whole thing could
swing around this.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.830
That would be a motion.

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:40.370
Well now you're
going to say well,

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.750
why didn't I swing
it around that one?

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:44.200
And of course it could.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.630
But what would be the deal?

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:56.240
It would have to be, there
are only three rigid motions,

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.030
right, up and around.

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:01.730
So if you give me another
one, like, around this one,

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.370
then somehow it had to be
a combination of those.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:07.620
I don't even want to think
what combination it is.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.630
But there are three
rigid motions.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:15.610
So I sort of distinguish
mechanisms, this word

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:16.560
mechanism.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.800
So that's where
the truss deforms.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:27.060
In these-- And rigid motions,
so I'll say plus, possibly.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:31.610
Plus rigid motions,
and rigid motions

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:42.020
would be, you know, it
doesn't deform internally,

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.400
the whole thing moves.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.450
And this is of
course what we get

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.140
in the case of not
enough supports.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.750
And this is what we get in
the case of not enough bars.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:54.250
Yeah.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.950
So maybe it's worth
separating those two.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:02.320
In the examples we do, we'll
usually put in enough supports

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.470
to kill the rigid motions.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.630
And then the question would
be are there some mechanisms.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:08.490
OK.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:14.890
Now, I have to start
on what this is.

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:16.960
Well it'll be just
a very quick start.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.710
So what I'll do at the
beginning of Friday,

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:22.250
so Friday's the other
lecture on this topic.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.700
And then the homework will
ask you to do some trusses

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.490
in this section.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:31.260
It's probably Section
2 point something.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:38.220
2.7, maybe.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.640
What's the matrix C?

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.560
Last second question, what's
the matrix C, what size is it?

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.070
What size is the matrix C
for our original problem?

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.360
Or no.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:56.730
What size is C, is C
involving, if I know

00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.150
these numbers, what size is C?

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.520
Five by five. m by m, right?

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:07.990
C is the diagonal matrix,
one entry for each bar,

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:15.790
C is just C. It has a c_1,
c_2, c_3, and this w=Ce,

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:19.040
it's just Hooke's
Law on each bar.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.160
So, simple.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.140
It gets there in the
middle, just the way that C

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.300
in the first exam problem
popped in, and other C's.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.080
That gets there in the middle.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.580
But it's very,
extremely, simple.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:38.970
OK, so the real attention
is on A, as usual.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.990
And that will come
Friday morning.
