00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.250
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Okay, so this is I

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.310
could say delta function day.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.560
Break from linear
algebra mostly.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.250
So we're looking on another
type of right-hand side.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.720
Before in the
differential equation

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.720
and in the difference equation.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.750
So the right-hand sides up
to now, the one we looked at

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.580
was a uniform constant load
second derivative equal one.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.320
Now a point load.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.300
Well in a way, we're now solving
a whole bunch of problems

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.470
because the point load can
be in different places.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.780
So instead of solving
one problem with one

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.790
on the right-hand side, we're
solving with a delta function.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.010
Now a delta function is, you
probably have seen and heard

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.220
the words and seen the symbol,
but maybe not done much

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.090
with a delta function.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.620
It takes a little practice
but it's really worth it.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.490
It's a great model of maybe what
can't quite happen physically,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.470
to have a load acting exactly
at a point and nowhere else.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.040
So the delta function
is, I drew it's picture,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.880
the delta function is zero, this
is delta of x is zero except

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.600
at that one point,
the origin, x=0,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.910
and then all along
back to zero again.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.300
So nothing's happening, no
load except at that one point.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.510
And let me just, so
there's no hesitation

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.840
in when I change from x to x-a,
what does that do to a graph?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.440
If I have a function of x and
I instead shift the function

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.600
to f(x-a), I shift x to
x-a, well in this case,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.700
and in all cases, it will
just shift the graph.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.150
So if I drew a picture
of delta, of x-a,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.360
the load now would
happen when this is zero,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.660
because it's delta at
zero is the impulse,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.490
and now this is zero at x=a.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.440
In other words, the load
moved to the point a.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.080
So there is the shifting
load, but the load

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.030
could fall anywhere
between zero and one.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.940
So delta of x, the load
actually falls at zero.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.750
Well we don't quite want
that load at the boundary.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.900
So let's think of the point
a, the load point as somewhere

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.410
between zero and one.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.610
Can I just take a little
time to recall the main fact

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.580
about delta functions?

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.960
When I say recall, it could
very well be new to you.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.990
So that's what the
delta function--

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.110
that's my best graph
of the delta function.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.120
But of course I'm, in
using the word function,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.470
I'm kind of breaking the rules
because no function-- I mean

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.200
the function is, functions
can be zero there,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.060
can be zero there,
but they're not

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.810
supposed to be infinite at
a single point in between,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.300
but this one is.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.170
Let me go back to delta of
x to match these figures.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.450
Of course, they would also
just shift along by a.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.490
Maybe no harm in that.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.160
Sorry, I'll stay there and
now I want to integrate.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.260
And that's when a delta
function comes into its own.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.330
Its value of infinity is
a little bit uncertain.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.670
What does that mean?

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.270
But when we integrate
it, what's the key fact

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.790
about delta function?

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.330
That the integral of
a delta function from,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.470
let's say, let's
integrate the whole thing,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.310
we can safely start
way at the far left

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.340
and go away to the far
right because it's zero

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.300
all the time there except
at one point, and you know.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.030
So what's the area
under that spike?

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.939
It is one.

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:55.480
That's right.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.380
So that's the fact, the
sort of central fact

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.190
about a delta function.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.030
That the area is one.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.710
Oh well, let me, while
I'm really writing down

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:14.010
the central fact, let me write
it more specifically, more

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.830
generally.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.040
Suppose I integrate, and this
is delta functions now really

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.640
showing up, if I integrate a
delta function against some,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.200
times some nice function.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.630
Now have you ever
thought about that?

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.990
What would be the answer if I
integrate the delta function

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.540
against some nice function?

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.980
So I'm still getting zero from
this term all the way along

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.510
until I hit the spike and
then after it goes back

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.680
to zero again.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.030
So, whatever, it's gotta
be at the spike, at x=0,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.790
because I put the spike
here at zero, the impulse.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.980
So what do you think's
the answer for that one?

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.790
Yeah, It's the function.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.000
So, yes, tell me again
and I'll write it down. g,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.240
it's a value of this function g.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.260
We don't care what it is to the
left and to the right at zero

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.390
because it's really at zero
that this thing turns on

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.690
and its value at
that point is just--

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:31.260
gives us the amplitude of
the impulse, which is g(0).

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.400
And of course if g is the
constant function one,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.310
I'm back to that formula.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.850
But this is maybe the
thing to watch for.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.100
Actually there's a lot built
into that little thing.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.580
We'll come back to that.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.580
So that's delta
functions integrated

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.590
and now here are some pictures.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.640
These are the good pictures.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.540
So here's one integral
of the delta function.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.220
It's a step function.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.760
And the step of course
will occur at the point

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.290
a if the integral of the
delta function at a point a

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.220
will be the step function.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.060
Where the action happens.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.620
The jump happens, I could
call it a jump function.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.880
At that point a.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.840
Because, just for
the reason we said.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.480
That if we integrate,
the integral is zero.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.940
And then as soon as our
integral passes this point,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.410
so this is integral of the,
this is-- I integrated.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.600
I integrate to get
to this picture.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.930
I start with that delta function
and I integrate and it suddenly

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.190
jumps to one as soon
as the integral goes

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.030
past the spike, the impulse.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.390
So a step function.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.710
Very handy function,
step function.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.610
Sometimes called a
Heaviside function

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.910
named after the guy who--
the electrical engineer

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:13.190
I think who first sort of work
out the rules for using these.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:18.380
Let's integrate one more time
because we have second order

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.810
equations, second derivatives,
so we better integrate twice

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.160
to see what sort
of answer we get.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.200
Now integrate the step function.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.100
So again, the integral is
zero all the way to the left,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.870
so I'm still getting zero,
but now beyond this point

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.810
I'm integrating one.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.810
And the integral of one is x.

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.410
So now that I would
call a ramp function.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.760
That's a nice short word
for this valuable function.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:56.060
A ramp function is the function
that's zero and then x.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.600
So tell me about
that ramp function.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.660
Just think about it.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:08.070
What happens to its
derivative at the point a?

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.700
As I run along and I
hit this key point,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:18.230
what happens to the
derivative of the ramp?

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.870
What does the derivative do?

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.820
Focus on that ramp now.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.300
What does the derivative
do at that point?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.620
It jumps.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.800
The derivative jumps.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.250
The slope is the derivative,
the slope jumps from zero

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.590
and here the slope is one.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.620
And of course that's
what that's telling us.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.280
Here's the picture
of the derivative.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.660
What does the second
derivative do?

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.600
Well, since I
integrated twice I guess

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.100
going back two
steps I'll find out

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.200
what the second derivative is.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.960
So the first derivative
takes a jump.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.990
The second derivative is
the derivative of that jump,

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.660
so it's got the impulse.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.720
So the second derivative,
it's a straight line here,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.780
second derivative
a straight line.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.380
This is straight line
here, second derivative

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.130
of a straight line
is a straight line.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.610
But at that point the
first derivative jumps,

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.010
the second derivative
has that delta function.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.530
In other words,
that's that stuff.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:30.360
If I keep integrating -- and
I don't need higher integrals

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.250
in today's lecture -- another
integral would be what?

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.600
If I integrate this
function, then it's

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.880
running along the zero.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.380
What's the integral of this?

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.680
Doesn't quite turn that steeply.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.070
What's that curve there?

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.925
If I've integrated the ramp.

00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:50.800
Here is the integral.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.340
First, the next step up, the
integral of the ramp would be?

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.630
It'll be x squared, yeah,
it'll be a parabola.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.480
x squared over two,
the integral of that.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.470
And now what do I get
when I integrate this one?

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.950
I get something very important.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:13.200
Not important today, but
important in a few weeks.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.920
And very useful in computing.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.100
These have turned out to
be just the right thing.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.140
So again, I'm integrating that.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.700
Everybody can tell
me, what is that?

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.460
What's that curve now?

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.410
It's the next
integral of course.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:35.250
The area under that will
be x cubed over six.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.060
So now that is a function.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.180
Yeah, it's worth maybe
just for practice.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.110
What's the deal
with that function?

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.870
That's pretty smooth function.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:50.370
Because it certainly passes--
right, it meets at that point.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.560
The first derivative
meets at that point.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.940
The second derivative
meets at that point.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.480
The third derivative does what?

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.150
Of this line.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.020
The third derivative, take
three steps back down the line

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.481
and you see that the
third derivative jumps.

00:12:08.481 --> 00:12:08.980
Right?

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.120
The third derivative of that
is the third derivative,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.570
would be, shall I-- for C,
for cubic spline or something,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.280
the third derivative
will be zero there.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.700
And the third derivative
of that is exactly

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.860
like back to that, back to
that, back to one is one.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.750
So the third derivative. so
the cubic spline's so smooth

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.640
your eye doesn't see that.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.390
They're very useful for
drawing many, many purposes.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.550
CAD programs would use
such things constantly

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:50.460
because they're convenient,
they have nice pieces

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.070
that you can fit together
and they fit together

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.180
very smoothly.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.930
But they really are
two separate functions.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.270
So that's up to cubic spline.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.770
But our focus is--

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.550
These would solve, what
equations would those solve?

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.290
Well, that takes how many
derivatives to get to a delta?

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:17.820
So what would be the equation?

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:22.630
What would be the
right-hand side?

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.520
Let me take the
fourth derivative.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.530
I'll just ask the
question that way.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.270
What would be the
fourth derivative

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.820
of that cubic spline?

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.800
A delta, right?

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.740
Four steps back.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:40.620
So what is, physically,
what are we seeing here?

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.100
Do you recognize what
kind-- If I ask now

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.230
people in mechanics,
When will we

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.700
meet a fourth order equation?

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.560
Fourth derivative equals a load.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.110
Anybody know the
physical situation

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.410
where fourth derivative?

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.590
Beams, yeah.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.790
It's the equation for a beam.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.710
A beam has-- The
bending of a beam.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.530
So it's a beam.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.260
This eraser isn't too
very much like a beam,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:20.380
but anyway I put the chalk
on it, well nothing happened.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.680
Sit on it, whatever.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:28.430
It'll bend and that bending will
be given by a beam equation.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.050
So later we'll meet
the beam equation.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:40.150
So most equations of physics,
mechanics, biology, everything

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:45.780
are second order, Newton's
Laws often the reason.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.730
But we get up to
fourth order sometimes.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.260
And very seldom get higher.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.380
Hopefully.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:58.500
Beams or plates, that
table would be a plate

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:05.530
and it would have a
fourth order equation.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.850
Let's start solving
this problem.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.620
What's the solution,
what's the general solution

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.200
to that equation?

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.830
Minus the second derivative,
so notice the minus

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.840
that I like, and the load
has now moved to the point a.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.920
So the solution u(x), let's
write down all solutions.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.390
Tell me one solution, first.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.280
One particular solution.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.410
What is one function
for which minus

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.480
the second derivative
would be the delta?

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.030
That's what we've
got over there.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.110
So just bring that
blackboard over here.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.120
Change its sign
because that minus,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.750
and what are you
going to tell me?

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.250
Minus a ramp.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.170
Minus a ramp.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:57.830
And the ramp, of course,
will ramp up at the point

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:04.820
a so that it's the second
derivative of that,

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.650
the second derivative
of R will be delta.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:12.270
The minus is correct and
the point is correct.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:17.590
Now does that solve our problem?

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.610
No.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.240
The ramp is going upwards.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.570
It's not zero.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.650
What am I forgetting?

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.180
What do I not yet have?

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.520
There's more to this solution.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.360
Just as there was
for a uniform load.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.850
What was the more?

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:47.400
Constant and-- and I want
two homogeneous solutions,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.270
null solutions, two solutions
with second derivative equal

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.030
zero.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:57.340
One of them is C and
the other one is Dx.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.440
That's the whole solution.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.450
So what I want to-- I
mean we need that C+Dx.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.030
We've got two
boundary conditions

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.340
to satisfy, just as before.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.820
So I need two constants,
that'll do it perfectly

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.430
and I'll get an exact answer.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.170
And so this is a ramp.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.350
Oh yeah.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:23.760
Before I go further, how
would I think about this?

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.160
This is a ramp that
turns which way?

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.270
Down.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.840
Right?

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.330
With that minus sign, that ramp
turns down at the point x=a.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.630
Right?

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:43.840
It's derivative goes
from zero to minus one.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.790
The slope of this guy drops by
one because of the minus sign.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:18:00.340
Sorry the slope of the ramp
function, of minus the ramp.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.630
It goes at zero, drops by one.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.070
And what this is going
to do is take that ramp

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.700
and adjust it to go
through the fixed ends.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.000
Oh, let's just do it.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.780
Let's just do it.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.530
What are C and D?

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.480
What are C and D?

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.660
My point a-- let
me draw a graph,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.110
that's always the best thing.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:26.150
Always draw a graph
of these solutions.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.730
So let me put in the point a.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.830
So I'm drawing now a picture of
the solution from zero to one.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:40.470
I'll graph it.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.260
What do I have here?

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:47.160
Shall we just plug in
the boundary conditions

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.260
and find C and D?

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.060
That's the direct way.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.880
What is C?

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.030
C I'm going to plug in.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.760
Hopefully I might find it
from just the first boundary

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.090
condition.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.690
If I'm starting from zero,
well this guy certainly

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.770
starts at zero, right?

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:09.010
The ramp hasn't done
anything until it gets to a.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.820
And this guy is certainly zero.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.880
So what is C?

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.760
Gone, right.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.200
Now what is D?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.810
Well alright, what's D?

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:23.310
Let's see.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:30.020
Let me draw the-- So there's
a Dx, and D won't be zero.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.480
I want that thing to
be zero at point one.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:39.390
So I want to determine
D. Let me determine D.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:45.180
So what is minus
the ramp at x=1?

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.637
I'm plugging in x=1.

00:19:46.637 --> 00:19:47.220
Is that right?

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.360
I'm going straight forward here.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.660
Plugging in x=1 into
this boundary condition,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.780
ready for this guy.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.070
What's the ramp?

00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:02.980
So it's minus and
the ramp is, well

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.310
if the ramp is shifted over
then that's shifted over.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:12.220
So at x=1, what's the ramp?

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.400
How high has that ramp gone?

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.340
1-a.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:17.840
Right?

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.030
The ramp is x-a.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.860
At the point x=1 it will be 1-a.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.890
So I think I get one,
-(1-a) out of that.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:35.500
Minus the ramp
plus D times what?

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.880
One, I'm plugging in x=1.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.610
And that's supposed to equal?

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.310
Zero, good.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:49.370
So I'm doing this sort of the
systematic way of writing down

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.230
the general solution.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:55.060
Discovering that D,
what do I discover D is?

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.680
Put it on the other side.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.520
D is 1-a.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:08.420
And of course, don't forget
that it's multiplying the x.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:13.010
Let me just draw the picture.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.580
Here's how I think about it.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.690
The solution is, away from x=a,
what does the solution look

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.730
like?

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:28.000
To the left of x=a what's
my graph going to be?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.630
It's going to be?

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.690
A straight line, right?

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:38.400
To the left of here
there is no load.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.370
The equation is second
derivative equals zero.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.730
The solution to that
is a straight line.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.130
In other words, until I get to
a, this thing hasn't started.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.360
It's only this straight line.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.830
The solution does
something like that.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.650
It's a straight line.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.180
And I guess, actually,
that's what it is.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.710
Because the C isn't here and
that's all we've got left.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.830
So that's that straight line.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:10.820
What is it for the second half?

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.660
Tell me what the solution
looks like in the second half.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.260
In between a and one.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.600
It's going downhill.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.030
Why?

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.770
Because it gotta
get back to zero.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:28.690
And how's it going downhill?

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.030
It has to be linear.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.280
In this region,
has to be linear.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.200
Why?

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.800
How do I know it's linear here?

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.040
Because one way is to say
the equation in that region

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.380
is second derivative equal zero.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.250
Second derivative equal
zero, straight line.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.830
This is my solution.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.820
It's (1-a)x here and it's
whatever it is to get back

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.320
to zero.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.100
What will it take
to get back to zero?

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.540
Let's see.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.090
Well we could plug in, we've
got one expression here.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.350
Or I could just look at that.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.870
I could say, okay what's the
equation for the straight line

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.510
that's at this point, what
is the, yeah, it's (1-a)x.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.360
I want it to be linear.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.520
I want it to get to zero.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.390
Let's see.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.460
If I want that, it would
be great to have 1-x times

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.460
something.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.910
I have to figure out what.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:44.160
Because with the 1-x at
x=1, that'll drop off.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.460
That's linear.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.960
What number, what's
the key here?

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:58.230
That slope, I want to
match them up there.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.750
And that's the point x=a.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.640
This is supposed to
match that at x=a.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.380
Do you have an idea
for what I should take?

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:15.740
What do I put right there? a.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:22.120
Look at the symmetry in those
two sides. (1-a)x going up.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.700
(1-x)a going down.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.990
At x=a it hits
that point, right.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.750
So we've solved it.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.130
We could think about
this different ways.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:39.210
I could have got
that 1-x, let's see,

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.290
I could have got it
from the formula.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:47.040
In a way I like to get it from
the picture, I see it, sort of,

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.000
I see the point.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.410
What happened at that point?

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.160
What are the jump conditions?

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.390
This is another
way to ask, to see

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.410
how the delta function works.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.740
What are they jump conditions?

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.530
I want to know, when I
ask about jump conditions,

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.570
I want to know what are
the conditions on u(x),

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.030
the displacement?

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:12.850
What are the conditions
on the slope, u'(x)?

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:19.790
That'll be the strain when
we're speaking about elasticity.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.020
Just for u(x),
what's the statement

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.480
about u(x) from the
left and from the right

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:32.760
at that critical point,
the point of the load.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:38.020
From the left and from
the right u(x) is?

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.000
The same. u(x) matches
up. u(x) from the left

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.500
is that height. u(x)
from the right is that.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.860
I want to write down
those jump conditions.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.050
Because that's another
way to see this. u(x),

00:25:53.050 --> 00:26:02.200
u(a) from the left
should equal u--

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.500
do you want me to
say u is continuous?

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:12.650
I'll just say it in
words. u(x) is continuous,

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.200
that just means it
doesn't jump, at x=a.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:22.770
So that's, you could say
that's a non-jump condition.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.390
The function itself
doesn't jump.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.020
Why not?

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.190
Because we're talking about
some elastic bar on which

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.160
we put a point load.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.600
The thing isn't going to break.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.510
The displacement is
going to be continuous.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:42.150
But what's the condition
on u'(x), the derivative,

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:43.560
the slope?

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.390
So that's the function
and now tell me

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.400
what's the deal on the slope?

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.350
What's the comparison
between the-- I

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.420
have a slope of whatever
it is going along here

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.980
and I have a slope
of-- a new slope.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:03.130
So u'(x), the
slope jumps, right?

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.710
And how much does it jump?

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.120
Minus one.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.860
It drops by one.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.420
The slope, because of my minus.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:17.849
So this tells me that--
Yeah, let me write that down.

00:27:17.849 --> 00:27:18.640
u'(x) drops by one.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:32.550
This is another way to say
what the equation is asking.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:36.540
The equation is looking for
two pieces of straight lines

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.260
that meet at a but their
slope drops by one.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.800
By the way, what
were the slopes?

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.880
It's good to graph
the slopes, too.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:52.610
Let me graph the slopes.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:58.590
The slope u', the
derivative du/dx.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.790
What's the slope here?

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.280
Slope is 1-a at
this point, right?

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.350
The derivative is
1-a along here.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:09.790
So slope is 1-a.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:14.680
And now at x=a the slope
changes to this one.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.730
And what's the slope
of that second part?

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:18.770
Minus a.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:19.660
Look.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.190
It did it right.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.430
Minus a is the slope along here.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.330
Do you see 1-a?

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.520
It dropped by one.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:36.610
The one disappeared to
leave a slope of minus a.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:41.970
I guess if I just imagine a bar.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.110
I'm fixing it at both ends.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:50.870
There's a bar.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.450
I'm just thinking
for people who like

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:57.510
to see a physical picture
of what's happening,

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:03.490
that's what this is, we'll do
it properly very, very soon.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.500
I've got a bar.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.700
It's a very light bar.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:12.320
Its weight is not
a problem here.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.460
But it's got a
load at the point.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.340
So I'll measure x
going downwards.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:22.900
And at the point x=a I'm
hanging a heavy load.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.640
A load.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.940
How do I draw a load?

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:40.110
Maybe I'll make a big
weight or something.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:49.180
What's going to happen to
this dumb bar when I do that?

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.472
Just tell me physically.

00:29:50.472 --> 00:29:51.430
What's going to happen?

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.810
What's going to
happen above the load?

00:29:54.810 --> 00:30:00.300
It's going to stretch,
right, tension.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.740
The load is going to
pull the bar down,

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.350
it's going to stretch this part.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.340
And because nothing
special is happening,

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.780
it's going to
stretch it linearly.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.180
And then what's going to
happen below the load?

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.810
Compression.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.390
So the slope will go negative.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.730
And nothing special happened
so the slope will be negative

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.240
but it'll be constant.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.600
The slope will drop
from this to this.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:34.650
The displacement, that point
will go down a little bit.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.687
That little bit it goes down
is actually the height of this,

00:30:38.687 --> 00:30:40.020
because that's the displacement.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.940
It'll go down a little bit.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.990
It'll stretch above,
it'll compress below,

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:52.700
and we see that in that
picture of the displacement.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.070
The displacement's all down.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.000
Right?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.320
Displacement-- You know, nature
is still going to-- All the bar

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.340
is going to move down.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.310
That's why this function
doesn't, this function,

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.340
the displacement
function is positive.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.880
It goes all down.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.500
But the slope function
is positive here,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.780
so tension is positive
slope, stretch.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.740
And compression is negative.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:31.360
Well all that to
solve this equation.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:38.450
Maybe while we're on a roll,
let's solve the free-fixed guy.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.440
So this is our-- might
as well be systematic.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.160
This is the fixed-fixed problem.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.770
Let me below it solve
the free-fixed problem.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:50.490
So it'll be minus u'',
that's the second derivative,

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.840
equals delta at x-a.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.680
Same setup.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.730
But now the top end is,
so it's free at the top.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.290
What does that mean?

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:12.110
Slope is zero at the top but
it's still fixed at the bottom.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:21.490
So this will be now free-fixed.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.040
Let me go straight
to the picture.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.700
Let me go straight to
the picture of u(x).

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.770
So there is x=0, there's
x=1, here's the load at a.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:37.050
What's up?

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.940
And while you're
thinking about that,

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.300
let me draw a picture
to match this picture.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:52.640
A bar fixed at the bottom
but not at the top.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:59.120
And it's got its load
here hanging down.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:08.240
But let's do it math first, and
then check with the picture.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.890
What have we got,
two or three ways now

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.490
to try to get the answer?

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.590
The systematic way
would be to write down

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:22.710
this solution and plug in
the two boundary conditions.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.780
That'd be a straightforward way.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.350
Yeah, we could
even start by that.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:33.170
So u(x) is the
particular solution,

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:46.350
the ramp plus any Cx+D. And just
plug in x=0 that'll be easy.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:51.550
If I plug in x=0 in
the free condition,

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.240
what does that tell me?

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:58.820
At x=0, this corner, this ramp
hasn't started so the slope is

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.040
zero.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.730
The slope of the
constant is zero.

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.280
What do I learn from this
boundary condition? u'(0)=0.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.300
That C is zero.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.740
Before I learned that
D was zero, but now

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:18.540
from that condition I'm
going to learn C is zero.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.160
Do the picture for me.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:24.090
Do the picture for me.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:27.770
What's the graph of--
this is a graph of u(x).

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:36.000
Remember now it
starts from zero slope

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.330
because it's free at the top.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:44.880
What does the graph look
like in the first part?

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.370
It's a straight line, has to be
a straight line because there's

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.050
no force.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:54.260
And what kind of a line?

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.920
It's going to be horizontal
because it starts off

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.290
horizontal.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:05.080
The slope has to be zero at zero
and nothing changes until a.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.960
So it comes along there.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.220
Right?

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:14.110
Now I've started out
with the right, left,

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:18.950
the correct boundary condition
at zero, which was no slope.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:22.330
And now what's it going
to do the other half?

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.200
From a to one.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:31.090
It's going to be again, it'll
be a straight line, right?

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.380
Because there's no force there.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.680
And what happens at--
all the action of course

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.900
is at this point a,
and what action is it?

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.000
Tell me what sort of a line.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.940
How do I finish the picture?

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.370
What do I do?

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:53.770
I start here, right?

00:35:53.770 --> 00:36:01.070
Because the bar's not falling
apart. u is continuous.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.780
I don't get a gap suddenly.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.390
And now what do I do from there?

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:11.130
Only thing I can possibly do,
because I have to end up here

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:16.942
and it has to be a
straight line, that's it.

00:36:16.942 --> 00:36:18.900
That's what the picture
will have to look like.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:30.110
What does that correspond to
in the picture for the bar?

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.300
Well what happens with this bar?

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.740
Above the weight, what
happens to this top part

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.630
of the bar in that picture?

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.020
And what happens to the
lower part of the bar?

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:51.300
So this was at the point x=a,
this is x=0, this is x=1.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:57.890
What happens above the
bar, above the weight?

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.780
It just-- A rigid
motion, just goes down.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.620
Because what happens
below the weight?

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.510
The same compression or
compression still happening.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.950
This is still squeezed.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.140
Shall I try to draw it?

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.830
So this is after the weight.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:21.300
This got squeezed but this
part did not get squeezed.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.970
And that's what
we're seeing here.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.120
A fixed displacement.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.970
So this means,
that picture means

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:36.600
that all the pieces
of the bar here

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.370
got moved down by the same
amount, whatever this,

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.860
we don't know that number yet.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:49.240
And then below it
they got compressed.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:56.430
Well we're almost there but we
don't yet have that solution.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:02.130
Come back to this picture.
u(x) is continuous, got it.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.690
And what's the real
condition that's

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:09.980
going to determine where
we are, what those heights

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.390
are, the numbers in there.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:16.060
It's gotta look like
that, but we get more than

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.970
that, we gotta know what are
the actual, what is that height.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:20.950
What is this?

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:22.050
What's the slope?

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:27.250
Here the slope is zero.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:34.230
Here the slope is what?

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.170
What's the slope
in the second part?

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:37.080
That's the key.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.610
And you know what it
has to be because what

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.740
happens to the slope?

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.910
If I have the second
derivative as a delta function

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:56.420
with that minus sign,
the slope drops by one.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:02.690
And the slope here is zero, so
the slope here is minus one.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:07.620
And now it has to get through
there, so what is the function?

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.990
What's the function that
has a slope of minus one

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:22.030
and comes down to zero?

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.480
It's gotta have a minus
x in it and what's

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:30.800
the constant to make
it come out right?

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.510
What do I write
now here for u(x)?

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.010
1-x.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:41.230
That has a slope of minus one,
the derivative is minus one,

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.140
at x=1 it comes to
zero, that's it.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.680
And what do I write,
what's u(x) up here?

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:54.550
And therefore, right there?

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:59.070
What's the displacement
there, of all this bit that

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:03.200
moves down, how much
does it move down?

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.360
1-a.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.680
Why 1-a?

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.780
That's the right answer.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.279
1-a.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.430
Why's that?

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:15.600
Because it had to
match up at x=a.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.230
At x=a, this and that match up.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:23.590
At x=a, that slope, that
function and that function

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.370
match up.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:31.570
So the slope picture is
zero and-- Oh, I'm sorry,

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:36.500
can't draw it because I'm
at the bottom of the board.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.120
The slope picture, maybe
I can draw it here,

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.740
the slope picture
is zero along here

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.300
and then it drops by one to 1-a.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.600
So that's a picture of u'.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.470
Zero and minus one.

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:59.930
This is the thing to look at.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.150
That's hard work, when
you're seeing delta functions

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.790
the first time.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:06.590
But of course the functions
did not get complicated.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:11.220
We kept a clean example.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:18.240
And which we matched up with a
figure and we've got the answer

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.440
and we've got a couple
of ways to do it.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:25.510
One is this standard,
systematic, plug-in boundary

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.650
condition way.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:31.700
The other way is this.
u(x) does something here,

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.460
then the slope has
to drop by one.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:40.120
And that's the key to everything
with a boundary condition.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.410
So in a way, we have a piece
to the left and a piece

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:44.660
to the right.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.140
Two constants here,
two constants here,

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.750
and somewhere there are
four conditions that

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:52.940
settle those four constants.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.450
You know, we could have
a straight line here,

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.990
a straight line here,
that's two and two.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:00.280
But what are the
four conditions that

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.690
settle those four constants?

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.460
Well we have a boundary
condition here, that's one.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.890
Boundary condition here is two.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:11.970
We need two more
conditions to settle

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:19.410
the two pairs of constants,
and there they are.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:27.540
Two conditions at the
jump, at the discontinuity.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:36.270
Now I've got to do
the discrete case.

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:39.170
Are you up for
the discrete case?

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:47.320
The case where we're doing--
We have a difference equation,

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:52.480
so we're doing Ku equal
a column of the identity.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:43:03.460
Column of I. Let me
take a specific column.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.420
Say [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:12.550
Let's suppose we have five--
I'm going to draw a picture now.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:15.680
We have five, because
I made it five by five.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:21.260
One, two, three, four, five,
here is zero and here is six.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.720
So h is 1/(5+1), 1/6,
that's the delta x.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:36.650
And my equation says-- So
what does my equation say?

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:46.130
Remember what K is. u is then
u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, and u_5,

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.080
the unknowns.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:44:04.130
K is our old friend with twos
and minus ones and minus ones.

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.140
I'm going to find the solution.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:15.280
And this'll be the solution
that has a load at this point.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.240
This is like my point a, right?

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.400
Here in the continuous
case, a could run anywhere

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.050
between zero and one.

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:27.420
In the discrete case, I've
got five possible load points

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.120
and I've picked the second one.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.830
Five columns of the
identity matrix, five

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:36.050
places to put that
one, I put it there.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:42.660
Now can I draw the picture here?

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.000
Which should we do first?

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.950
Should we do free-fixed?

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:52.280
Because that came out even
easier than fixed-fixed.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.920
Notice the solution
here had two parts.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.660
This is the way I would
write that answer.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.550
Because you could
draw a picture,

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:06.560
but if you want to write the
formula, what would I do?

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.410
I would break it
into two pieces.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:16.210
1-a up to the point
a because that's

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.120
what it was running along here.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:23.480
And then down here it
was 1-x, x &amp;gt;=a.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.830
That's important to mention.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:38.820
You have to have some guidance
on how to write the answer.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.210
And when the answer
has two parts,

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.490
this is a good way to
write it, in two parts.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:46.770
It's a little too--
you're compressing

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:50.580
it too much to write, to
use that ramp function.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:56.310
Better to split it apart
into before a and after a.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.660
What's going to
happen over here?

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:04.860
Oh yeah, can we take a
shot at this problem?

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:11.880
And let me mention again,
in the review that'll

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:17.130
be in here this afternoon and
every Wednesday afternoon I'll

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:18.880
just be ready for questions.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.040
Please bring questions.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.360
They can be questions
on the homework.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.200
Even better if they're
questions on other problems,

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.060
questions on the lecture.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:42.000
Questions are essential to
make that help session helpful.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.470
What do you think's
cooking here?

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:54.060
At a typical-- Somewhere
in the middle here,

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.770
I'm going to draw the u's.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:00.560
Shall I just draw them?

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.640
And now what's my condition?

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.710
I gotta put the
boundary conditions on.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.800
Oh, I have put the
boundary conditions on it.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.350
By putting that two
there, I'm up to here.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:15.280
Okay, let's do that one.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.780
When I chose K and
put a two in there

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.620
I was picking the fixed-fixed
boundary condition.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:29.010
So can I just say it's
going to be beautiful.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.530
The solution over there is
going to look like this.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:37.720
The solution over here is
going to be up, up, up.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.960
It's going to be a straight
line but only points in a line

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.660
and it'll be straight line down.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.280
That value, that
value, that value.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.760
Those will be u_1,
u_2, u_3, u_4, and u_5.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:05.690
And once more, this is
going to drop by one again.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.620
Actually I didn't have
to redraw the picture.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:11.140
It falls right on.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:22.540
In case x is 2/6 so that
it fits that picture,

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:28.250
I'm claiming we have another
extremely lucky case.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:34.380
If we can use the
word lucky for math.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.560
I'm claiming that the
way the-- You remember

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.180
for the uniform load
with a one, when

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:44.840
we had second derivative
equal one, the solution

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:49.160
was a perfect parabola
and the discrete solution,

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.570
the difference equation
was right on the parabola

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:54.700
for this fixed-fixed case.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.540
It's going to happen again.

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.580
It won't always happen.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:04.330
Those are the only two important
right-hand sides I know.

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.440
They're the two most important
right-hand sides and those

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.900
are the two lucky ones.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.570
If we have a constant that
lies right on a parabola,

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:21.660
if we have a delta function,
it lies right on a ramp.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.300
And there it is.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.630
So that's what the
solution looks like.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:31.720
Now, I have to figure out what
these numbers are, I guess.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.870
Yes, what are those numbers?

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.060
Oh, well.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:40.900
Actually, if it falls right
on, I know the numbers.

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:46.890
So a is 2/6.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:49.540
So let me keep 2/6.

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.550
So a is 2/6.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.140
That's that value.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:58.870
So let me say what I think u is.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:00.590
So this was a picture of u.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:04.990
That's u_1, 2, 3,
4, and 5 and now

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.780
I think it lies right on that.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:19.160
So it's going to be (1-2/6)x
going up and (1-x)2/6 going

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.380
down.

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:28.780
My point is that I'll be able
to figure out what that-- this

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:33.420
is u, this is the u.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:38.140
You're going to say, why?

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.530
Let me pause before
putting in numbers

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:46.300
and say why is it, how do
I know that the solution is

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:53.150
right on the function,
the continuous solution.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:59.150
Well, can I draw
a set of pictures

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:03.420
just like those
guys for discrete?

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:07.700
Yeah, let me just draw
those for discrete here.

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:12.890
That shows you the magic.

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:24.630
So there is a-- I'm going
to draw a vector now.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:27.220
I'm going to have to lift the
chalk, it won't be a function

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.290
and it'll be the delta vector.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:32.600
So it'll be the
delta vector, delta

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.730
with-- So there is point one,
zero, one, two, up to six.

00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:41.250
It'll be the delta vector.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:45.630
Well if I just draw
the delta vector,

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:49.000
the delta vector
has a one there.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.360
So this is the delta vector.

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.810
Do I need?

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:57.610
Well you can see that
the delta vector is now

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:01.140
going to be the
vector of all zeroes

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:06.110
and it's got a one at the key--
at the impulse and then zero.

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:07.940
So it's a discrete impulse.

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.610
That would be a better word.

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:10.870
Discrete impulse.

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:13.520
Impulse at zero.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.700
So let's stay with
an impulse at zero.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:20.960
Alright.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.710
What's my next picture?

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:28.780
Again let me put in zero.

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.390
One, two, three, onwards.

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:35.450
Minus one, so on.

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:36.570
What do I want to do now?

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.460
What do I draw second?

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.890
I always look over here.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:44.080
What did I draw
second over here?

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.450
The step.

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:51.620
Now why did I draw
a step function?

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.510
How did I get from here to here?

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:56.260
I integrate.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.890
I took the integral.

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:02.530
So how will I get from
here to this picture?

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:07.300
I don't integrate, I add, sum.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:12.110
So coming along from the left,
all these all along here,

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:14.560
this sum is all zero
because it was always zero.

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:19.070
So it's zero, zero, zero, zero.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:21.660
And then, whoops, wait a minute.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.480
It says it a one there?

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.630
Yeah, I think it must be.

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:30.100
So here it wasn't a zero, wrong.

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:31.880
Here it's a one.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.070
And what is it next?

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:34.620
What's next to it?

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.720
One, because I'm adding
more and more zeroes

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.880
but I have that one now, okay.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.060
A discrete step.

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:46.380
It's a discrete step,
zeroes and then ones.

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.230
Now comes the second.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:52.860
So what am I going to call that?

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.670
A step, right?

00:53:54.670 --> 00:54:01.620
It'll be a step
function, step vector.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:07.410
If the sums of the delta
vector gave me the step vector,

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:11.530
how do I go the other way?

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:13.990
What do I do to the
step vector to get back

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:18.730
to the delta vector?

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:20.180
Differences, right?

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.500
Sums in one direction,
differences in the other.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:31.010
So the differences of the step
vector are the delta vector.

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:33.780
The step is the
sum of the deltas

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.600
and the delta is the
differences of the step.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.870
Now for the crucial next guy.

00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:42.450
What's it going to be?

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.850
I add.

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.090
Wait a minute.

00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:49.680
What's up?

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:55.680
I'm looking for that picture.

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.550
Do I get it?

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:02.450
Yeah, I hope so.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:03.780
Oh, look, we ran out of time.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.940
I don't have to do
this, but I will.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:12.720
So as I add I get zeroes
and then it's one,

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.200
and then I add on one more one.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.880
Look.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.420
You see what's happening.

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.090
I run along at
zero but I'm going

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:26.330
to look at the book to see
whether that jump should

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:28.190
come here or here.

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:32.070
So I've got a little bit
of this to finish next time

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:35.970
and I'm open for any
questions this afternoon.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:38.810
Okay, thanks and sorry
to keep you late.
