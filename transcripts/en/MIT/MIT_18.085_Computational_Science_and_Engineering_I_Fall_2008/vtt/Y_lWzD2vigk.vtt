00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.930
PROFESSOR STRANG: Well, hope
you had a good Thanksgiving.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.190
So this is partly
review today, even.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.880
Wednesday even more review.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.880
Wednesday evening,
or Wednesday at 4

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.900
I'll be here for any questions.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.220
And then the exam is
Thursday at 7:30 in Walker.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.380
Top floor of Walker this
time, not the same 54-100.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.760
OK, and then, no
lectures after that.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.300
Holiday, whatever.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.360
Yes.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.270
Right, you get a
chance to do something.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.520
Catch up with all
those other courses

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.510
that are being neglected
in favor of 18.085.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.960
Right.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.240
OK, so here's a bit
of review right away.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.770
We really had four cases.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.370
We started with Fourier series,
that was periodic functions.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.930
And then discrete Fourier
series, also periodic in a way.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.600
Because w^N was one.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.340
So that we have N
numbers and then

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.510
we could repeat
them if we wanted.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.500
So those are the
two that repeat.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.020
This is the f(x),
this is all x, so that

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.310
would be the Fourier integral
that we did just last week.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.130
Fourier integral transform.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.220
And this was the--
Well, these are all,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.840
this is the discrete
all the way.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.810
So that's-- oh, you can
see these pair off, right?

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.260
The periodic function,
the 2pi periodic function

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.930
has Fourier
coefficients for all k,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.630
so that's the pair
that we started with.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.010
Section 4.1.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.850
This sort of pairs, I don't
know whether to say with itself.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.990
I mean, we start with N numbers
and we end with N numbers.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.670
We have N numbers
in physical space.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.810
And we have N numbers
in frequency space.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.650
Right, so we call those,
so those went to c_0 up

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.630
to c_(N-1).

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.360
And this, all x, pair--
for the function,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.820
paired off with itself.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.600
Or with this went to F--
well maybe I used small f.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.650
I guess I did in last week.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.520
So that, and I called its
Fourier transform f hat of k,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.820
all k.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.970
So that's the pairing kind of
inside n-dimensional space,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.670
with the Fourier matrix.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.220
This is the pairing
of the formula for f,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.310
and its similar
formula for f hat,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.390
and these are the guys that
connect with each other.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.580
OK, so that's what we know.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.330
What we haven't done is
anything in two dimensions.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.300
So I would like to
include that today.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.750
I think my real
message about 2-D,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.310
and I'm not going to
include it on the exam,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.870
but you might wonder, OK, can
I have a function of x and y?

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.040
And will the whole setup work?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.510
And the answer is yes.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.670
So really, my message is not
to be afraid in any way of 2-D.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.590
It's just the same formulas
with x,y or two indices, k,l.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.090
Yeah.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.190
You'll see that.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.630
OK, now for the new part.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.380
What's a convolution equation?

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.710
That's my word for
an equation where

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.230
instead of doing a
convolution and finding

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.360
the right-hand
side, instead we're

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.760
given the right-hand side.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.560
And the unknown is
in the convolution.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.200
So let me write examples
of convolution equation.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.010
Every one of these would
allow a convolution.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.600
So the convolution
equation would

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.650
be something the integral
of F(t) u, for the unknown,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.550
at x-t, is-- Oh no, sorry.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.400
F will be the right-hand side.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.430
F of, well, can I--
Yeah, better if I put it

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.090
on the right-hand side.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.840
Wouldn't want to call
it the right-hand side.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.500
So this would be some, shall
I call it often K for kernel

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.190
is sometimes the word.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.350
So what I'm saying is
equations come this way.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.130
This is really K
convolved with u.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.260
Equals F. You see, the only
novelty is the unknown is here.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.574
So that's why the word
deconvolution is up there.

00:05:28.574 --> 00:05:29.990
Because that's
what we have to do.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.120
We have to undo the convolution,
this unknown function

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.390
is convolved with a known, K is
known, some known kernel that

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.810
tells us the point
spread of the telescope

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.060
or whatever we're doing.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.490
And gives us the output
that we're looking at.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.120
And then we have
to find the input.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.760
OK, can I write down the similar
equations for the other three

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.360
here?

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.770
And then we'll just
think how would we find

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.340
u, how would we solve them?

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.260
So the equation here
might be that some kernel

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.500
circle convolved with
the unknown u is some y.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.940
These are now vectors.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.220
This is known.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.380
This is known.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.710
And those, the N components
of u, are unknown.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.710
OK, so that would be
the same problem here.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.680
What would be here?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.660
Same thing.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.520
Now the integral will go
from-- The only difference is

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.420
the integral will go from
minus infinity to infinity,

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.990
K(t)u(x-t) dt equal f(x).

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.970
And finally regular convolution.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.210
What am I going to call it?

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.720
K would be a sequence,
maybe I should call it a,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:04.141
known, convolved with u,
unknown, is some c, known.

00:07:04.141 --> 00:07:04.640
Yeah.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.570
So those would be
four equations.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.210
You might say, wait
a minute, where

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.220
is Professor Strang come
up with these problems

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.450
at the last week of the course.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.720
But, these are exactly
the type of problems

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.520
that we know and love.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.370
These come from
constant-coefficient,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:31.170
time-invariant, shift-invariant
linear problems.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.620
LTI, linear time-invariant.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:40.370
And my lecture Wednesday,
just before Thanksgiving, took

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.300
a differential equation
for u and found,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.670
and put it in this form.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.640
I'll come back to that.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.750
So suddenly we're
seeing, I mean,

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.800
we're actually seeing
some new things

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.640
but also it includes
all the old ones.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.170
These are all of the best
problems in the world.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.920
These linear
constant-coefficient problems.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.900
Time invariant, of
any of these types.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.700
This one was an
integral from minus pi

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.400
to pi, where this
one went all the way.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.540
So this is not brand new stuff.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.810
But it sort of looks new.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:26.890
And now the question is, so my
immediate question is, before

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.150
doing any example, how would
you solve such an equation.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.820
And I saw on old exams,
some of this sort

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.690
for example, let me
focus on this one.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.280
Let me, instead of
K there, I'm not

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.080
used to using K for a
vector, I'm used to,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.860
well maybe I'll use c.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.220
For the vector there.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:59.060
So this is n
equations, n unknowns.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.610
Oops, capital N
is our usual here.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.160
For the number.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.740
N u, N unknown u's.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.670
It's a matrix equation
with a circulant matrix.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:17.510
So all these equations are
sort of the special best kind.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.540
Because they're convolutions.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.140
And now tell me the main point.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.820
How do we solve
equations like this?

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.680
How do we do a deconvolution,
so the unknown is convolved

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.330
with c here, it's convolved
with K, it's convolved with a,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.780
how do we deconvolve
it to get u by itself?

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.840
So what's the central idea here?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.950
Central idea: go
into frequency space.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.160
Use the convolution rule.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:57.730
In frequency space,
where these transform,

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.190
we're looking at multiplication.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.160
And multiplication, we can undo.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.680
We can de-multiply.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.930
De-multiply is just a big
word for divide, right?

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.580
So that's the point.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.030
Get into that space.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.870
That's what we've been
doing all the time.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:21.490
I better get one example,
the example from the problem

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.620
Wednesday, just up here.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.810
Just so you see it.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.280
This won't look like a
convolution equation,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.570
but do you remember that it
was -u'' plus a squared u equal

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.410
some f(x)?

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.500
So that's a constant, it's
certainly constant-coefficient,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.270
linear, time-invariant.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.100
Right, OK.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.600
And how did we solve that?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.960
We took Fourier transforms.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.770
So this was the
second derivative,

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:52.930
the Fourier transform.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.870
What is the rule for the
Fourier transform of derivative?

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:01.130
Every derivative brings
down an ik in the transform.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.030
So we get ik twice.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.200
So it's k squared. i squared
cancels the minus one.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.380
So that's the transform of -u''.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:17.010
This is the transform of
ordinary a squared u, just

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:17.840
a squared.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.880
And this is f hat.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.420
So we've got into
frequency space.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.880
Where we are just
seeing a multiplication,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:34.620
k squared plus a squared, u
hat, of-- this is u hat of k,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.000
equals f hat of k, right?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.190
Oh well, sorry we were-- Yeah,
that's right. f hat of k,

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.230
right.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.090
So we're in frequency
space, where we just

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.220
see a multiplication.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:58.010
So again, this is now we
just demultiply, just divide.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:03.000
And then we have the answer,
but we have its transform.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.550
And then we have
to transform back.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:10.560
So we have to do the Fourier
transform to get to the,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.460
I'll say the inverse
Fourier transform.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.655
To get back to u(x), the answer.

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:21.160
That's the model.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.110
That's the model.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.410
And that's maybe the
one that we've seen,

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:32.710
now we're able to think
about all these four topics.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.660
Right.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.090
OK, so what was the key idea?

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.520
Get into frequency
space and then it's

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.160
just a, the equation is
just a multiplication,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.980
so the solution is
just a division.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:52.050
So can I do that now with
these four examples, just see.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.480
So this is like bring
the pieces together.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.140
OK, and deconvolution is
a very key thing to do.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.370
OK, so I'll take
all four of those

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.000
and bring them into
frequency space.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.100
So this will be
maybe, you'll let

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:14.080
me use K hat of, oh, K hat
of k that's not too good.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:27.390
Well, stuck with it.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.680
What am I doing here?

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.040
In this 2pi periodic one?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.250
That's the one I started
with, but now I've got,

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.030
I'm using hats and so on.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.180
I didn't do that in Section 4.1.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.980
What the heck am I going to,
what notation am I going to do?

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.740
And I really didn't do
convolution that much,

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.760
for functions.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.300
So let me jump to here.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.030
I'll come back.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.750
It follows exactly
the same pattern.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.350
So let me jump to this one.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.920
OK, so I have a
convolution equation now.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.700
This is one where you
could do this one.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:16.185
This could appear on the quiz
because I can do all of it.

00:14:16.185 --> 00:14:18.690
So what is this convolution?

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:19.870
OK.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.920
I've got N equations,
N unknowns.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.800
Let me write them
in matrix form,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.880
just so you see it that way
too. c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.970
I'll make N equal four.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:39.790
And then these are, this
convolution has c_0, c_2, c_1.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.510
c_3, c_2, c_1, c_0.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:49.960
This'll be c_3, c_3,
c_3, I'm writing down

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.830
all the right numbers
in the right places.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.020
So that when I do
that multiplication

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:04.740
with the unknown,
[u 0, u 1,  u 2, u 3],

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:10.530
I get the right-hand, the
known right-hand side.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.350
Maybe b would be
a little better.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.740
Because we're more used
to b as as a known.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:22.490
It's just an Ax=b problem,
or an Au=b problem.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.550
It looks like a
convolution but now

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.520
it's just a matrix
multiplication.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.340
So this is just
[b 0, b 1, b 2,  b 3].

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.800
OK.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.920
That's our equation.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.950
Special type of matrix.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.470
Circulant matrix.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.730
So this is just
literally the same

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:46.630
as c circularly convolved
with u equals b.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.640
I just wrote it out
in matrix language.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:59.640
So you could call MATLAB with
that matrix, and so one way

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.960
to answer it would be get
the inverse of the matrix.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.190
But if it was
large, a better way

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:16.190
would be switch over
to frequency space.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:16.970
Think, now.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:23.680
What happens when I switch these
vectors to frequency space?

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.540
It becomes a multiplication.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.570
So this becomes
a multiplication.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:36.990
Now so c, I want the Fourier,
from the c's, what am I

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:45.580
going to-- So these are
all in the space where

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.820
it's a convolution.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.480
What am I going to call it
where it's in the space where

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.270
it's a multiplication?

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.050
I just need three new names.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:59.190
Maybe I'll use c
hat, u hat, and b hat

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.950
just because there's no
doubt in anybody's mind

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.460
that when you see
that hat, you've

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.690
gone into frequency space.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.800
Now, what's the equation
in frequency space?

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.760
And then I'll do an example.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.360
It's a multiplication,
but I don't usually

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:27.160
see a vector and nothing there.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.270
What's the multiplication
in frequency space?

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:37.310
It's component by component.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:48.100
c_0*u_0 equals b_0. c hat
1 u hat 1 equals b hat 1.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.760
c hat 2 u hat 2 equals b hat 2.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:00.650
And finally, c hat 3 u
hat 3 equals b hat 3.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.040
And there might be, I don't
swear that there isn't, a 1/4

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.210
somewhere.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.780
Right?

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:12.830
But the point is, we're
in frequency space now.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.190
We just have a
component by component,

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:21.550
each component of c hat
times each component of u hat

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.910
gives us a component
of b hat; now we're

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.560
ready for a deconvolution;
just divide.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.860
So now u hat,
obviously I don't have

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:34.940
to write all these,
b hat 0 over c hat 0.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.720
Right?

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.850
I just do a division.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:44.520
So on down to u hat 3 is b hat,
is the third component of b,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.840
divided by the third
component of c.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.860
OK, now don't forget here.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.800
That in going from
here to here, I

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.730
had to figure out what
the c hats were, right?

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:03.330
I had to do the Fourier matrix,
or the inverse Fourier matrix

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.620
to go from c to c
hat, from b to b hat,

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.870
so everything got
Fourier transformed.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:17.500
But the object was to
make the equation easy.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.720
And of course, now we've
got four trivial equations

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.160
that we just solved that way.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.460
Alright, let me see if I
can just pull this down

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:32.730
with some questions.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.000
Here's a good question.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.300
When is a circulant
matrix invertible?

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.900
When will this method work?

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.520
The circulant matrix could
fail to be invertible.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.090
How would I know that?

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:54.730
If it's singular, and how
would I, if I proceed this way,

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.600
here I've got an answer.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.290
But if it's singular
I'm not really

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:00.540
expecting to get an answer.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.260
Let me lift the board a little.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:14.100
So where would I get, oops,
have to stop this method.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.460
In solving those four equations.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.140
Where would I learn
that it's is singular?

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.820
What could go wrong in this?

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.330
Yes.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.380
PROFESSOR STRANG: That's right.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:32.600
Always in math, the question
is are you dividing by zero.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.210
So the question of whether
the matrix is singular,

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.420
is the same as the question
of whether c_0 hat,

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:46.860
c_01, c_02, and c_03-- sorry,
c_0 hat, c_1 hat, c_2 hat,

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.740
and c_3 hat, can't be zero.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:55.780
That's, in fact, even better
those four numbers, those four

00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:00.190
c hats, are actually the
eigenvalues of the matrix.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:06.090
We've switched, what the Fourier
transform did, was switch over

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.780
to the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.050
And there, that's the whole
message of those guys is,

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.010
you follow each one separately.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.880
Just the way we're doing here.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.150
So this is the component of
the b in the four eigenvector

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.200
directions.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.020
Those are the four eigenvalues,
and I have to divide by them.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.620
You see, the idea is, like,
we've diagonalized the matrix.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.570
We've had that
matrix, which is full.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:41.810
And we take-- By taking the
Fourier transforms, that's

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:46.440
the same thing as as
putting in the eigenvectors,

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:51.660
switching the matrix to
this diagonal matrix, right?

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:56.590
Our problem has become,
like, the diagonalized form

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:01.670
is c_0 hat down to c_3 hat,
sitting on the diagonal.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.420
All zeroes elsewhere.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.920
That's when we switched, when
we did Fourier transform we

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.780
were switching to eigenvectors.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.830
OK, so that's the message.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:18.780
That the test for singularity is
the Fourier, the transform of c

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.560
hits zero.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.930
Then we're in trouble.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.350
Let me do an example you know.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.580
Let me do an example you know.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:33.250
OK here's, so finally now
we get a numerical example.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:38.900
The example we really
know is this one, right?

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.620
As I start writing that,
you may say in your mind,

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.280
oh no not again.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.840
But give it to me, one more
week with these matrices.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:54.710
But it'll be the C matrix, so
it's going to be the circulant.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.900
Recognize this?

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.320
And it's got those minus
ones in the corners, too.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.750
OK, let's go back to day one.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:09.390
Is that matrix invertible?

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.310
Yes or no.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.340
Please, no.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.230
Everybody knows that
matrix is not invertible.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:21.400
And do you remember
what's in the null space?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.440
Yes, what's the vector in the
null space of that matrix?

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.350
All ones.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.620
Now, when I take,
just think now.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:35.250
When I take Fourier
transform, that all ones is

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.640
going to transform to what?

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.300
It's going to
transform to the delta.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:45.370
It'll transform to the one
that is like [1, 0, 0, 0].

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.400
Or maybe it's [4, 0, 0, 0].

00:23:47.400 --> 00:24:01.370
But it's that, well, OK, now I'm
ready to take, so here's my c.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.810
So what's my method now?

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:07.190
I'm going to do this method,
and I'm going to run into,

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.520
this thing is going to be zero.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.470
Because that's the
eigenvalue that

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:16.320
goes with the [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
column, the constant, the zero

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.140
frequency in frequency space.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.590
You'll see it happen.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:24.511
So let's take the Fourier
transform of that.

00:24:24.511 --> 00:24:26.260
And then we would have
to take the Fourier

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.450
transform of the
right-hand side b, whatever

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:29.380
that happened to be.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.480
But it's always the left side.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.680
The singular or not matrix.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.760
I believe we'll
be singular here.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:42.470
So, OK, just remind me how do
I take transforms of this guy?

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.600
Gosh, we have to
be able to do that.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.430
That's Section 4 point,
well, 4.3 isn't, yeah.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:53.170
The DFT of that vector.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:56.960
What do I get?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.570
Yes.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.240
How do I take the
DFT of a vector?

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.420
I multiply by the
Fourier matrix, right?

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.800
Yes.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.770
So I have to multiply that
thing by the Fourier matrix.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:17.090
So to get c hat, this was
big C for the matrix, little

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.790
c for the vector that goes
into it, into column zero.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.290
And c hat for its transform.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.640
OK, so now here comes the
Fourier matrix that we know, 1,

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:39.770
i, i^2, i^3; 1, i^2, i^4,
i^6; 1, i^3, i^6, and i^9.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:46.340
So I want to transform that
c to get, to find out c hat.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:52.300
OK, and what do I get up there?

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.840
What's the first component,
the zeroth component

00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:02.820
I should say, when I take this
guy, this four, this vector

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.070
with four components
and I get back

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.910
four components, the
frequency components, what's

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.640
the first one?

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.570
Ones times this,
what am I getting?

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:14.220
Zero.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.230
That's what I expected.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:20.100
That tells me the matrix is
not going to be invertible.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:28.140
Because in a different language,
I'm finding the eigenvalues

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.100
and that's one of them.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.610
And if an eigenvalue
is zero, that

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:36.270
means the eigenvector is
getting knocked out completely.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:40.590
And there's no way a c
inverse could recover

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.370
when that eigenvector is gone.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:43.860
OK, let's do the other ones.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:49.510
Two minus i, nothing.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.880
What's the other one here?

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.560
Two, this is minus i, and
that's plus i, I think.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.040
So I think it's just two.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.910
Alright, this is 2 i squared,
can I write in some of these

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:07.190
just so I have a little,
i squared is minus one,

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.170
and i^4 is one, and
that's minus one.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:15.660
So that's two plus one,
plus one, I think is four.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.100
And then i^3 is the
same as minus i.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.800
And i^9 is the same as plus i.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:34.900
So I think I'm getting two
plus i, nothing, minus i: two.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.770
So what's my claim?

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:39.280
My claim is that these
are the four eigenvalues,

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.080
that the Fourier-- Fourier
diagonalizes these problems.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.800
That's what it comes to.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.700
Fourier diagonalizes all
constant-coefficient,

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.850
shift-invariant,
linear problems.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.820
And tells us here
are eigenvalues.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.530
So [0, 2, 4, 2].

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.180
Would you like
to, how do I check

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.710
the eigenvalues of a matrix?

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.940
Let's just remember.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.870
If I give you four numbers and
I say those are the eigenvalues,

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.730
and you look at that
matrix, what quick check

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.020
does everybody do?

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.650
Compute the?

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:15.425
The trace.

00:28:15.425 --> 00:28:17.880
Add up the diagonal
of the matrix,

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.560
add up the proposed eigenvalues,
they had better be the same.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.330
And they are.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.725
I get eight both ways.

00:28:23.725 --> 00:28:26.100
That doesn't mean, of course,
that these four numbers are

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.430
right, but I think they are.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.200
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.810
So those added up to
eight, those numbers

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.240
added up to eight.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.520
And yep.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.270
And these are real.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.970
They came out
real, and how did I

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:44.530
know that would happen
from the matrix?

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:51.030
What matrices am I certain
to get real eigenvalues for?

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:51.900
Symmetric.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.690
Right.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.300
Now, what about, I
heard the word positive.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.070
Of course, that's the other
question I have to ask.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:03.760
Is this matrix
positive definite?

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.590
OK, everybody, this
is the language

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:06.770
we've learned in 18.085.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.980
Is that matrix positive
definite, yes or no?

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.150
No.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.020
What is it?

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.260
It's positive semi-definite.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.460
What does that tell
me about eigenvalues?

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.100
There, one is zero, that's why
it's not positive definite.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.270
But the others are positive.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.010
So that sure enough,
in other words,

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:32.260
what we've done here, for that
matrix that came on day one

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:38.040
and now we're seeing
it on day N-1 here.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.590
We're we're seeing sort of in
a new way, because at that time

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:47.230
we didn't know these four
were the eigenvectors

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.000
of that matrix.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.300
But they are.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:56.080
And we're coming to
the same conclusion

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.010
we came to on day one.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:03.270
That the matrix is
positive semi-definite

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.470
and that we know
its eigenvalues.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.850
And we can,
actually, let me even

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.350
take it one more step, just
because this example is

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.200
so perfect.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.300
Some right-hand sides we
could solve for, right?

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:21.070
If I have a matrix
that's singular.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.380
Way, way back, even, I think
it was like a worked example

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:32.330
in Section 1.1, I could ask the
question when is Cx=b solvable.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.950
Because there are some
right-hand sides that'll work.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.280
Because if I just take
an x and multiply by C,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.280
I'll get a right-hand
side that works.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:48.770
But for which vectors,
right-hand sides b,

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:52.000
will my method work?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.470
The ones that have...?

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.180
Yeah, the ones that have which?

00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:01.830
What do I need with these
c's, c_0, c_1, c_2, and c_3,

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:06.630
for my solution to be possible.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.710
I need b_0 hat.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.540
Equals zero.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.380
I need b_0 hat equals zero.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.180
And then what does that say?

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.500
That means that the
b, the vector b,

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.790
has no constant term
in the Fourier series.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:27.950
It means that the vector b is
orthogonal to the [1, 1, 1, 1],

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.290
eigenvector.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:34.050
So this is like a subtle point
but just driving home the point

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:39.120
that what Fourier does is
diagonalize everything.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.990
It diagonalizes all the
important problems of,

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:47.330
all the simplest problems,
of differential equations.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:52.730
You know, I mean this is like
18.03 looked at from Fourier's

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:53.840
point of view.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.060
OK, what more could I
do with that equation?

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.680
I think you really are seeing
all the good stuff here.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.570
You're seeing the matrix.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.050
We're recognizing
it as a circulant.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:08.860
We're realizing that we could
take its Fourier transform.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.700
We get the eigenvalues.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.270
We're diagonalizing the
matrix, the convolution

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.530
becomes a multiplication,
and the solution becomes,

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:22.040
inversion becomes division.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.990
I hope you see that.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.820
That's really a model
problem for this course.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.160
OK. yeah.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:33.710
Questions.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:41.417
Good.

00:32:41.417 --> 00:32:44.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR
STRANG: Would I give you a six

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.930
by six Fourier matrix on a test?

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:46.730
Probably not.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.080
No.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.630
I just about could.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:55.220
I mean, it's, six by six, those
are pretty decent numbers.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.730
Right.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:59.850
Those six roots of
unity, but not quite.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.580
Right, yeah.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.080
Yeah.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.590
Yeah.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.720
So four by four is, five by five
would not be nice, certainly.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.570
Who knows the cosine
of 72 degrees?

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:10.300
Crazy.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.620
But, 60 degrees we could do.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.260
So the Fourier matrix would
be full of square roots

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.720
of three over two, and one
over two, and i's, and so on.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.960
But it wouldn't be as nice,
so really four by four

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.910
is sort of the model.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.310
Yeah, yeah.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.890
So four by four is that model.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.230
Other questions?

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.180
Because this is
really a key example.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.240
Yeah.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.860
When I calculated the
eigenvalues, yeah.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.420
Ah.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.330
Because this matrix, I know
everything about that matrix

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.800
when I know its first vector.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.232
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:49.232 --> 00:33:50.940
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Yeah, it's because it's

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.120
a circulant matrix.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:57.010
It's because that matrix
is expressing convolution

00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:03.170
with this vector.
[2, -1, 0,  -1].

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.400
That circulant
matrix essentially

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.820
is built from four
numbers, right.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:09.320
Yeah.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.640
Yeah, and they go in
the zeroth column.

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.700
Right, yeah.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.580
Yeah.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:20.580
Right, so there is an
example where we could like

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.780
do everything.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:27.660
Now, and let me just remember
that with this example,

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.440
we could do everything.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:37.410
So this is an example of, you
could say this type of problem.

00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:42.310
But with a very special kernel
there, so it turned out to be,

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.470
it looks like an
integral equation here

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:49.010
but if that kernel involves
delta functions and so on then

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.530
it can be just a
differential equation.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.420
And then that's
what we got there.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:59.590
So we took all-- The same
steps we did here, we did here.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:06.110
We took the Fourier transform,
and I emphasize there,

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.850
just to remember Wednesday,
this was a delta function.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.660
When I took the Fourier
transform I got a one,

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.020
so this was a one over this.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:22.190
And I did the inverse transform
and I got back to the function

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.260
that I drew.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:29.170
Which was e^(-ax) over 2a.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.240
And even.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:38.650
So, yeah. this was
the answer u(x).

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.950
So I was able to do that,
I mean this step was easy,

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.110
that step is easy.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.960
That step is easy,
the division is easy.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:55.270
And then I just recognize this
as the transform of this one,

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.680
this example that we had done.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.570
Once I divided by 2a.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:01.420
So you should be
able to do this.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.230
So those are two that you
should really be able to do.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.510
I'm not going to,
obviously I'm not going to,

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:13.600
ask you a 2-D problem on the
exam or even on a homework.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.970
But now if you'll
allow me, I'd like

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:22.360
to spend a few minutes to
get into 2-D. Because really,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.540
you've got the
main thoughts here.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.340
That Fourier is
the same as finding

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.910
eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:35.520
That's the main thought
for these LTI problems.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:40.420
OK, now suppose I have, let's
just get the formalities

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.560
straight here.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:45.170
Suppose I have a
function of x and y.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.440
2pi periodic in x, and in y.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:54.530
So if I bump x by 2pi, or
if I bump y by 2pi -- oh,

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:59.190
I'm using capital F
for the periodic guys.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:04.410
So let me stay with
capital F -- x, y+2pi.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:08.470
OK, so I have a function.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.440
This is given.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.610
This is, it's in 2-D now.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.300
And I want to write
its Fourier series.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.850
So I'm just asking
the question what

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.770
does the Fourier series look
like for a function of two

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.210
variables.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.930
The point is, it's going
to be a nice answer.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:34.100
And so everything, what you
know how to do in 1-D you can do

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:41.090
in 2-D. So let me write the
complex form, the e^(ik) stuff.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.410
So what would I write,
how would I write this?

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:48.390
I would write that as
a sum, but it'll have,

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.630
I'll make it a double sum,
I'll write two sigmas just

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:57.100
to emphasize that we're summing
from k equal minus infinity

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:02.285
to infinity, and from l equal
minus infinity to infinity.

00:38:02.285 --> 00:38:07.390
We have coefficients c_kl.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:11.270
They depend on two indices,
this is the pattern to know.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:19.130
Multiplying our e^(ikx),
and our e^(ily).

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:23.760
Right, good.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.990
So, alright.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.070
Let me ask you.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.540
How would I find c_23?

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.040
Just to know that-- We could
find all these coefficients,

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.720
find formulas for them.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.210
We could do examples.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.380
How would I find c_23?

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:49.240
So this is my F. I know
F. I want to find c_23.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.000
What's the magic trick?

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.800
And I'm 2pi periodic, so all
integrals, all the integrals--

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.480
And I'm giving you
a hint, of course.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.520
I'm going to integrate.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.840
And the integrals will
all go from minus pi to pi

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.290
in x and in y.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:09.650
They'll integrate over
the period square.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.590
Here's the period
square from, there's

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:18.615
the center. x direction, y
direction, goes out to pi

00:39:18.615 --> 00:39:21.270
and goes up to pi.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:26.360
So all integrals
will be over dxdy.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.350
But what do I integrate?

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:33.070
To find c_23.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.770
Well, these guys are orthogonal.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:38.460
That's what's making
everything work,

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.830
they're orthogonal
and very special.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.940
So that by use
orthogonality, what do I do?

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.320
I multiply by?

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.140
Just tell me what
to multiply by.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:57.890
By this and integrate.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:04.260
OK, what is it that I multiply
by if I'm shooting for c_23,

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:15.580
for example? e^(i2x),
is it e^(i2x)?

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.150
Minus, right.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:27.800
I multiply by e^(-i2x),
e^(-i3y), and integrate.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.420
Yeah.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.980
So when I multiply by
that and integrate,

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.830
everything will go
except the c_23 term.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.430
Which will be
multiplied by what?

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:43.290
So I'll just have c_23
times probably 2pi squared.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.130
I guess 2pi will come
in from both integrals,

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:51.230
so the formula will be
c_kl-- c_kl will be,

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.790
do you want me to
write this formula?

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.740
I'll write it here and
then forget it right away.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:00.570
c_kl will be one
over 2pi squared,

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:07.020
the integral of my
function times my e^(-ikx),

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:10.350
times my e^(-ily) dxdy.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.510
So that just makes the point.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:22.750
That there's nothing new here,
it's just up a dimension.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.700
But the formulas
all look the same,

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:31.620
and if F was a-- Well, if F is
a delta function, if F is now

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.690
a 2-D delta function.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.500
We haven't done delta
functions in 2-D, why don't we?

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:45.340
Suppose F is the delta
function in 2-D. Then

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:49.110
what are the coefficients?

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.860
What do you think
you this means,

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.230
this delta function in 2-D?

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:57.250
So if I put in the delta
here, and I integrate.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:01.350
And what do I get then?

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:06.280
So if this guy is a delta, a
two-dimensional delta function,

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:10.990
the rule is that
when I integrate over

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:15.230
a region that includes
the spike, so it's a spike

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:19.610
sitting up above a plane now,
instead of sitting above a line

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:21.250
it's sitting above a plane.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:25.700
Then I get the value, so
this is the delta function

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.030
at the origin.

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:29.690
So I get the value of
this at the origin.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.100
So what answer do I get?

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.110
I get one out of the
integral and then

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:35.360
I just have this constant.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.970
So it's constant again.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.460
And it's just one.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:45.950
So the Fourier coefficients
of the delta function

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:46.600
are constant.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.700
All frequencies
there are the same.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.020
What about a line
of delta functions?

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.460
And what does that mean?

00:42:54.460 --> 00:43:01.730
What about, yeah let me
try to draw delta(x).

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:06.770
Suppose I have a
function of x and y --

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:12.290
it's just worth imagining
a line of delta functions.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:21.490
So I'm in the xy-- Let me
look again at this thing.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:25.480
I have delta functions
all along this line.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.530
Now.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.520
Here is a crazy example,
just to say well there

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.140
is something new in 2-D. So
previously my delta function

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.210
was just at that point.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.130
And the old integrals
just picked out

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:40.210
the value at that point.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:43.490
But now think of
a delta function's

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:46.400
a sort of line of spikes.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.820
Going up here, and then
of course it's periodic.

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.970
Everything's periodic
so that line continues

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:55.280
and this line appears here,
and this line appears here.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:02.010
But I only have to focus
on one period square.

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:04.750
What's my answer now?

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:10.930
If this function suddenly
changes from a one-point delta

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.210
function to a line
of delta functions?

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:17.390
Now tell me what the
coefficients are.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.240
What are the
Fourier coefficients

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.920
in 2-D for a line
of delta functions?

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:28.760
A straight line of delta
functions going up the y axis?

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.260
It'll be-- Let's see.

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.850
What do I do?

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:39.060
I'm go to integrate--
Oh yeah, what is it?

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.600
Good question.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.450
OK.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:47.260
So what is the--
When do I get zero

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.570
and when do I not
get zero out of this?

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:54.600
Yeah, tell me first when do I
get zero out of this integral?

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.250
And when do I not?

00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:00.170
What am I doing here?

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.690
Help me.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:06.350
I said 2-D was easy and I've
got in over my head here.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:10.070
So look.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:12.700
I can do the x integral, right?

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.950
We all know how to
do the x integral.

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.440
Yes, is that right?

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.142
If I integrate with respect
to x, what do I get?

00:45:22.142 --> 00:45:24.100
Let's see, I'll keep that
one over 2pi squared.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.680
Now I'm trying to
do this integral.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:34.710
Do I get a one?

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.840
If I get a one from
the x integral.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.410
So then I'm down
to one integral,

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:47.160
just the y integral is
left. e^(-ily) dy, right?

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:52.720
I did the x part, which said,
OK, take the value at x=0,

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.990
which was one.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:57.850
So the x integral was one, good.

00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:59.900
And now I've got
down to this part.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:03.950
Now what is that integral?

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:10.230
It's two-- wait a minute.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:16.570
Depends on l, doesn't it?

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:21.940
When l-- Yeah, so it's going
to depend on whether l is zero

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.080
or not.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.080
Is that right?

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.480
Yeah, that's sort
of interesting.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.670
If l is zero, then I'm
getting -- then this is a 2pi.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:38.820
So the answer, so
I'm getting c_k0,

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.530
when l is zero I'm
getting a 2pi out of that.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.820
If l is zero, I'm
integrating one,

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.940
I get a 2pi, cancels
one of those.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.020
I get a one over 2pi.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:59.280
And otherwise the other c_kl's,
when l is not zero, are what?

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.270
Just zero, I think.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:03.120
The integral of this thing,
this is a periodic guy,

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.290
if I integrate it from
minus pi to pi it's zero.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:11.670
What am I-- I'm making a
big deal out of something

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.070
that shouldn't be a big deal.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:20.020
The delta(x) function,
this is just,

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.470
its Fourier series is
just the one we know.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:25.830
Sum of e^(ikx)'s.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.210
Do you see what's happened here?

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:36.850
It was supposed to
be a double sum.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:41.060
But the ones, when l
wasn't zero, aren't there.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.270
The only ones-- Yeah.

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:48.020
So I'm back to the, for a line
of spikes, a line of deltas,

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.410
I'm back to-- So
it only depended

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:54.020
on x, so the Fourier series is
just the one I already know.

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.660
All ones.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.470
When there's no--
When l is zero,

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:05.060
all ones or 1/(2pi)'s, all
constants when l is zero,

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:11.340
but there's no y-- There's no
oscillation in the y direction.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:17.810
OK, I don't know why I
got into that example,

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:21.560
because the conclusion was
just it's the Fourier series

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.330
that we already know and
it doesn't depend on l,

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.940
because the function
didn't depend on y.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.840
OK, then we could
imagine delta functions

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.630
in other positions,
or a general function.

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:44.220
OK, so that's 2-D. Would I
want to tackle a 2-D-- Ha,

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:48.370
we've got two minutes. that's
one dimension a minute.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.500
Right, OK.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:57.400
What happens, what's a
2-D discrete convolution?

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.480
What's a 2-D
discrete convolution?

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.180
Now, you might say OK, why
is Professor Strang inventing

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.380
these problems?

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.240
Because a 2-D
discrete convolution

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.170
is the core idea of
image processing.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:14.440
If I have an image, what
does image processing do?

00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:18.360
Image processing
takes my image, it

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.860
separates it into
pixels, right, that's

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.980
all the image is,
bunch of pixels.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:28.720
Then many 2-D image
processing algorithms,

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.100
will take-- JPEG,
old JPEG for example,

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:36.720
would take an eight by
eight, eight by eight 2-D,

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.130
in other words--
Eight by eight, 2-D

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.600
is the main point,
set of pixels.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.740
And transform it.

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.020
Do a 2-D transform.

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.610
So what is a 2-D transform?

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:56.730
What would be the 2-D transform
that would correspond to this?

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.420
First of all how
big's the matrix?

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.470
Just so we get an idea.

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:04.250
I probably won't get to
the end of this example.

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:10.290
But just, so in 1-D, my
matrix was four by four.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:15.740
Now I've got, so that was
for four points on a line.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:22.085
Now I've got a square of points.

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:25.560
So how big is my matrix?

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.830
16, right?

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:32.590
16 by 16, because it's
operating on 16 pixels.

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:37.370
It's operating on 16
pixels, where in 1-D it only

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:38.790
had four to act on.

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:42.960
So I'm going to end up with
a 16 by 16 matrix here.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:48.150
And I think-- Let me
see, what do I need?

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:49.630
Oh, wait a minute.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.330
Uh-oh.

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:54.620
Yeah, I think the
time's up here.

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:59.080
Yeah, because my C, has my
C got to have 16 components?

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.140
Yes.

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.010
My u has to have 16,
my right-hand side

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.060
has got these 16 components.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:05.600
Yeah.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.900
So I'm up to 16 but a
very special circulant

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.610
of a circulant.

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.750
It'll be a circulant
of a circulant somehow.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:17.150
OK, enough for 2-D.
I'll see you Wednesday

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:18.430
and we're back to reality.

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:19.581
OK.
