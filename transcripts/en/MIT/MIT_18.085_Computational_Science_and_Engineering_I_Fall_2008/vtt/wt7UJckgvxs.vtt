00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.840
PROFESSOR STRANG: Shall we just
start on this review session?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.200
So, any questions on
anything from Chapter one,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.050
anything from those first seven
lectures is very, very welcome.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.410
So this morning finished
the serious part

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.880
of what we'll do in the
chapter with positive definite

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.040
matrices.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.460
And we'll see a lot
of those fortunately.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.050
They're the best.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.110
So questions about, I
hope you look in the book,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.770
at other problems
in the problem sets

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.880
as well as the ones I suggest.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.090
And then I can, anyway.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.600
Ready for any questions.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.930
Okay.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.140
Which problem is it?

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.740
In section?

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.920
Section 1.6, problem 27,
what have I done there?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310
Oh, okay, that's good.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.790
So it's about positive
definite matrices.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.890
May I just put on the board
what the central question is?

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.270
Just put these matrices up.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.910
We're given that H and
K are positive definite.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.010
And then the question is, what
about these block matrices.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.290
Do I call them M and N?

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.630
One is the block matrix
that looks like that.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.600
And another one is the block
matrix that looks like this.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.330
So those are both symmetric.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.739
We're allowed to ask,
are they positive

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:08.530
definite or negative
definite, because they

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.060
passed the first requirement.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.810
They're symmetric.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.410
We can discuss them.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.620
Because of course H and
K each were symmetric.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.530
The transpose of this would
bring K transpose down here,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.220
but that's K, so all good.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:32.520
So the question now.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:43.030
Of these guys to those
guys I guess, yes.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.210
Good question.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.260
So this guy has, let's
take eigenvalues first.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.700
So this guy has
some eigenvalues,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.000
say lambda_1 to lambda_n.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.650
And this guy, we'll
suppose they're

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.230
the same size, so
they don't have to be.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.490
Maybe I shouldn't, but I will.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.410
This has some other
eigenvalues, maybe

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.080
e_1 to e_n for eigenvalue.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.780
And then the question is, okay,
what about the eigenvalues

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.930
of that combination?

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.810
And what about this?

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.040
So it's a good question,
I think for all of us

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.840
to practice what just
came up in the lecture.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.150
The idea of block matrices.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.970
So looking here at eigenvalues
I could also look at pivots.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.530
Pivots would be interesting
to look at, too.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.910
Maybe I'll start with pivots.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.700
Can I?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.510
Did you think?

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.970
What would be the pivots of M?

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.950
If I start elimination on M
what will I see for pivots?

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.670
Well, I start up in the usual
left-hand corner and work down.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.190
So what am I going to see first?

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.130
I'm going to see the pivots
of H. It won't even know,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.860
by the time I had halfway there,
it won't even have seen K.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.680
And then, that'll be fine.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.100
And then this will be,
what's going to happen?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.160
This is all zeroes.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.360
So never get touched, right?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.080
So when I get down to the second
half I see all zeroes here.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.250
K is still going to be
sitting right there.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.320
Nothing happened.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.390
Because when I did these
eliminations nothing changed

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.970
with K. So the
rest of the pivots

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.210
will be the pivots of K. Good.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.900
Now, we might hope for the
same thing with eigenvalues

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.720
and probably that's
going to happen.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.430
This is like a diagonal matrix.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.610
And actually, what
words would I use?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.000
Block diagonal.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.560
I'd call that matrix
block diagonal.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.040
And those are very
nice matrices.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.030
That tells us that
the big matrix,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.690
for all practical
purposes, is breaking up

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.390
into these smaller blocks.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.270
Actually MATLAB will
search for a way

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.930
to reorder the rows and columns
to get that in case it's

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.870
possible.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.730
So here it's in front of us.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.100
Let's see if we can figure out.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:31.330
That lambda_1, I believe,
is also an eigenvalue of M.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.530
So it was an eigenvalue
of H. So that this,

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.560
the fact that it has that
eigenvalue lambda_1 means what?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:48.160
That H times this times some
vector y is lambda_1*y, right?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.210
If that's an eigenvalue
it's got an eigenvector

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.270
and let's call it y.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.720
Now this is a good question.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.630
I believe this block matrix
also has eigenvalue lambda_1,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.670
and what's its eigenvector?

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.830
What could I
multiply M by to get

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.040
lambda_1 times the same thing?

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.050
Can you see what?

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.620
Of course I'm thinking
that y is going to help

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.460
but it's grown now.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.830
So what would be the
eigenvector here?

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.950
When I multiply by M
it'll just come out right

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:33.840
with the same eigenvalue?
y_1, or y rather, and then?

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.540
And then zero, good. [y; 0].

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.210
Because if I multiply, can
I put in what M really is?

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.990
The H and K. H there, K there.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.300
When I do that multiplication
I get lambda_1*y.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.850
When I do this
multiplication, see I've just,

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.290
that's a zero block,
zero, so I got a zero.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.620
Perfect.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:05.510
So the eigenvectors of H just
sit with a zero in the K part

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.730
and produce an
eigenvector of the block

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.260
matrix with the same lambda_1.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.060
So you can see then, we
get the whole picture.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.870
The eigenvalues are
just sitting there

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.240
and the eigenvectors are there.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.170
Now maybe you got all
that and wanted-- well

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.450
I haven't said anything
about N, Sorry.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.750
Everybody thinks more about
N. So what's the thing with N?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.000
What would you say about N?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.400
If you look at that matrix,
suppose I don't even tell you

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.270
it's positive definite
at first, would you

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.080
say that looks like a
invertible or singular matrix?

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.550
Everybody's going
to say singular.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:55.040
And why would you
say that's singular?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:05.160
Well, the determinant of a block
matrix, this morning I said

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.420
do whatever you like
with block matrices.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:13.890
But I have to admit that if I
had a bunch of general blocks,

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.270
if I had to take the determinant
of that, and of course

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.830
everybody's remembering
Professor Strang doesn't like

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.250
determinants, if I had
to take the determinant,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.940
I'd have to do the whole thing.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.900
The separate determinants would
not tell me the story, usually.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.990
So determinants
are a bit tricky.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.700
But up here the determinant
will come out zero.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:45.460
I guess what I would hope your
internal test for a singular

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.050
matrix is, are the
columns independent?

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.280
And then the matrix
is invertible.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.710
Or are they dependent?

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:59.070
Do you have some
columns that are

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.860
in the same direction as
other columns, same direction

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.910
as combinations
of other columns?

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:08.640
If you look at the columns
of that, say column one,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.150
so column one is the first
column of K repeated.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.290
What do you think about the
columns of that matrix, that

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.540
block matrix N?

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:24.200
Do you see that same
column showing up again?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.550
Yeah.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.760
That very same column, which
is the first column of K,

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.970
again twice, is going to show up
right there, first column of K

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.880
again.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:39.140
So this matrix has
two identical columns.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.370
No way it could be invertible.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.650
And in fact, you can
tell me what vector,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.810
I'm always saying are
the columns independent?

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.870
Here, no, they're dependent.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:56.600
And then you can tell me an x.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.640
So this is my block
matrix N. I want

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:06.830
to know an x so that
the result is zero.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:13.880
That's really my
same indication.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.830
We found two identical columns.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.640
What would be the x?

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.970
Well, you have to tell me
more than one, minus one

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:30.790
because I've got a big x there.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.360
Yeah I've gotta
make it big enough,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.620
but essentially it's the
one, minus one, thanks.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.930
And enough zeroes in there
and enough zeroes in there.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:45.210
So the fact that that
vector gets taken to zero

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.700
is the same thing as saying that
one of this column minus one

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.810
of this column gives zero.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.900
In other words, the
columns are the same.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.770
And of course, by
doing this we're

00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:01.010
seeing the one and minus one
could have gone into position

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.950
two there, position three.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.140
So we've got a whole
bunch of vectors.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:13.860
This matrix N, this [K, K; K, K]
has got a whole lot of vectors

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.610
that it takes to zero.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.850
What I would say it
has a large null space.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.510
A large space of vectors
that it takes to zero.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.290
So that's a really
useful exercise.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.440
I'm delighted you asked it.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:34.050
Now I'm ready for more.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:34.850
Could do.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.060
Exactly, row reduction.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.740
I should look to see what
would happen in elimination.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.470
Well, elimination would
go swimmingly along

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.200
for the first part because
it's only looking here.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:56.390
But then what would I have after
the first half of elimination?

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:04.012
Well I'd have I suppose whatever
that K changed to, elimination.

00:12:04.012 --> 00:12:04.970
What should we call it?

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:09.360
U or something?

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.950
When I did these row
steps that matrix

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.360
turned into this upper
triangular matrix.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.110
And maybe you can tell me
what will have happened

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.900
at the same time to the rest?

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.990
What will I see sitting here if
I just do ordinary elimination

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.470
and I'm just looking
there and using the pivots

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.720
and so on, I'll see?

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.470
It'll be U because whenever
I do on the left side

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.410
I'm doing to the whole row.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.100
And now, the main point
is, what will I see?

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.970
Now elimination, keep
going, keep going.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.920
Do elimination to
clear out this column,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.020
this whole bunch, right?

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.110
Elimination.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.700
And now what am I going
to see in that corner?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.980
All zeroes, right.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:05.910
So that's telling me
that the matrix has just

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:11.070
got half of the eigenvalues
positive, half of the pivots

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.000
are positive.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.700
The second half all zeroes.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.490
So I guess, here I've
found an eigenvector

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.330
with what eigenvalue?

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.720
That's looking like
an eigenvector to me

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.720
if we're thinking eigenvectors.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.050
And what's the eigenvalue
that goes with it?

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.730
Zero.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.150
Because Nx is 0x.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.680
You can either think of it as
Nx=0 if you're thinking about

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.200
systems of equations.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:46.860
Or Nx=0x if you're thinking that
that guy is an eigenvector with

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.550
eigenvalue zero.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.230
So I'm pretty happy.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.370
I mean many of you
will have spotted this.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.640
Probably perhaps all.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.250
But I'm happy that's
an example that

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.870
just shows how you
have to think big

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.690
with block matrices I guess.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.030
Good.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.470
Okay on that?

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:27.231
What else, thanks.

00:14:27.231 --> 00:14:27.730
That's true.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.530
And that's really all I've done
so far is those four examples.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.910
I think that language of
fixed-fixed and fixed-free

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:40.180
really comes, I mean I used
it early about those four

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.680
matrices, but it's
really going to show up

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.670
at the next lecture,
Friday, when

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:53.170
I have a line of springs and the
matrices that come out of that.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:15:00.050
So Friday we'll finally
be on those first four.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:05.500
A fifth matrix will appear
in this course finally.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.770
Of course, it's going to be
related to the first ones,

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:14.630
naturally, but we'll move
to, we'll see something new

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.860
and then we'll see the
fixed-free idea again

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.780
for those.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.965
So if that can
wait until Friday,

00:15:20.965 --> 00:15:24.160
you'll see some different ones.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.320
Good.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.680
Questions, thoughts.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.110
You can ask about anything.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.720
Maybe I can ask.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.660
Any thoughts about the
pace of the course?

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:49.640
This is sort of a heavy dose
of linear algebra, right?

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.320
Of course, the answer
maybe depends on how much

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.160
you had seen before.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.920
So those who haven't seen very
much linear algebra at all

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.950
really got quite a
bit quickly here.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.940
Because many courses
on linear algebra

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:12.620
never reach this key idea
of positive definiteness

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.980
that ties it all together.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.620
So you've seen
quite a bit, really.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.040
Of course, we've concentrated
on symmetric matrices

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.790
and there's a whole
garden or forest or zoo

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:32.870
of matrices of different types.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.720
So what matrices have we seen?

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.760
Symmetric matrices and
then their eigenvectors

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.130
were orthogonal and we
could say orthonormal.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.990
So that gave us, I
don't know if you

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:53.650
remember this part, which
when we wrote it down I said,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.860
big deal.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.370
That's very important.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.750
That's this principal
axis theorem.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.810
These Q's, what kind
of a matrix is Q?

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.730
It's the eigenvector matrix.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:12.370
And for symmetric matrix, so
this is the eigenvector matrix.

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.820
And what do we know about it?

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:22.540
In the special case
of symmetric K?

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.260
What do we know especially
about the eigenvectors then?

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.440
They're orthogonal.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.890
We can make them orthonormal.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:34.710
So this will be an
orthogonal matrix.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:39.040
And that was a matrix
with Q transpose

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.400
was the same as Q inverse.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.410
Normally we would see
the inverse there,

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.350
but for these we can
put the transpose.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:52.140
Here's one type of matrix,
symmetric, very important.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.120
Here's another type of
matrix, orthogonal matrices.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.550
And of course, many,
many other varieties.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.610
Well here we have
a very nice matrix,

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.870
so that matrix is diagonal.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.380
Right, that's just
the eigenvalues,

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.710
so that's a diagonal matrix.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:12.350
And what do we know, if K is
positive definite, let's just,

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.690
this was for any symmetric one.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:19.020
So what's special if K
is positive definite?

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.860
Somehow the positive
definiteness

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.820
should show up here.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.520
And where does it show?

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.150
Positive eigenvalues, exactly.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.790
The Q could be any,
any Q would be fine.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.710
But we would see
positive eigenvalues.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.760
Oh, here's a little
point about eigenvalues.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.080
Suppose I have my matrix K.
And it's got some eigenvalues.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:57.220
Now let me add four
times the identity to it.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.320
What are the eigenvalues now?

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.230
What are the eigenvectors now?

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:08.710
What's changed and how
and what hasn't changed?

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.710
Because that's a pretty
easy, the identity matrix

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.910
is always the easy one for
us to know what's happening.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:20.270
So what is happening
to the eigenvalues now?

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.380
If K had these
eigenvalues lambda,

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.010
what are the
eigenvalues of K+4I?

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.849
You add?

00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:32.640
You add four, yeah.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.620
The eigenvalues of this are
the eigenvalues of K plus four.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.830
That is just like
shifting the matrix,

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.630
you could think of
it is adding four

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.340
along the diagonal
will add four.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:54.300
And the eigenvectors would
be exactly the same ones.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.570
I would have Kx would
agree with lambda*x.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.440
And 4Ix would agree with 4x.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.250
So that proves it.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:11.680
Good to see what you can do,
the limited number of things

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.640
that you're allowed
to do without changing

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.300
the eigenvectors, and therefore
you can spot the eigenvalues

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.280
right away.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.330
The limited things
you can invert,

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.820
you can shift like this, you
could square it, cube it,

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:34.530
take powers, things like that.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.200
I'm going to look to you now for
giving me a lead on something

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.960
that is interesting or not.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.120
Yes, thanks.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.900
Go ahead.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:21:02.700
Oh, I see okay, yes.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.540
I see.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.370
Alright.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.350
So that's page 64 of the book.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:18.220
Well, so that's a problem
that physicists love.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.360
I don't know how much I
can say about it here,

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.010
to tell the truth.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.300
Just to mention.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.730
Do they use a minus sign?

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.230
Probably they do.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:40.120
So their equation is minus the
second derivative of u plus (x

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:46.460
squared)*u, and they are
interested in the eigenvalues,

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:54.080
equal lambda*u.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.880
The case that we've done in
class was without this (x

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.680
squared)*u term, right?

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.600
The absolutely most important
case is the second derivative

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.990
of u equal lambda*u.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.300
The eigenvalues
were, or what were

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.740
the eigenvectors in that case?

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:21.070
What were the eigenvectors of
the second derivative before

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:27.760
there was any (x squared)*u,
any potential showing up?

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.760
They were just sines
and cosines, right?

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.690
Sines and cosines
have the property

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.600
that if you take two
derivatives you get them back

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.330
with some factor lambda.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.680
Now let me just
look at that problem

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.550
without saying much about it.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.920
First of all, the first
thing I want to know

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.250
is have I got a
linear problem here?

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.740
Have I got a linear equation?

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.730
Because that's where I
talk about eigenvalues.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:05.120
So in the matrix case,
I'd say I have a matrix.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.550
K times an eigenvector.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:14.210
That matrix represents
something linear.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:18.280
It's just, all the rules
of addition work here.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.310
Here it is linear.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:27.110
It is linear.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:33.570
What I'm trying
to say is, I just

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.330
call that a variable coefficient
and that's what we're

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.480
going to see in Chapter two.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:44.090
The material or something could
lead to some dependence on x.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:49.810
But u is still
there, just linearly.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:55.520
In other words, this is a
perfectly okay linear operator

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.100
and am I imagining that
it's positive definite?

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:00.900
Let's see.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:08.090
This part with the minus sign
was positive definite, right?

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.100
Well, at least semi-definite.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.660
So let me just remember
the most important case.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.720
If I look at this equation,
d second u/dx squared equals

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.970
lambda*u.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:28.550
So that's the eigenvalue,
eigenfunction problem

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.990
for our good friend.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:35.570
What do I say about
the eigenvalues now?

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:40.010
What can you tell me about
the eigenvalues of that?

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.160
Mostly positive.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.680
Because they were
sort of omega squares.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.510
But I mean zero could
be an eigenvalue, right?

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:55.620
What would the eigenfunction
be for lambda equal zero?

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.330
If I wanted to get
zero here, if I

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:02.990
wanted a zero on the right
side, what functions u

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.780
could give me zero?

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.840
Constant function.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.250
Yeah, the constant
function is certainly there

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.030
as a possibility.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:19.490
But anyway, I would say this
is positive semi-definite

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.820
at least.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.150
And this part?

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.290
How do I think about
that as a big matrix?

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.670
I think of it sort of like
a big matrix with x squared

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:36.060
running down the diagonal.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.800
With a matrix, you could say
walking down the diagonal

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.670
because it's n steps.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.300
For differential
equations, maybe running

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.420
is the right word.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:53.250
Because it doesn't jump,
it's just bzzz all the way

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:56.250
from zero squared to whatever.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:05.430
Anyway, that would correspond
to a diagonal matrix, but not

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.490
constant diagonal.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.070
Diagonal, but not
constant diagonal.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:13.150
Because this x squared
number is changing.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.590
It's like a spring,
it's like a bunch

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:22.730
of springs in which
the first spring maybe

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.940
has a spring constant of one.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.840
And then we have a tighter
spring and then a very tight

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.400
spring and so on, more and
more, higher and higher

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.720
constants there.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:39.720
Well, I'm just speaking
very roughly here.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.490
Because variable coefficient,
variable material properties,

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.800
springs of different
elasticities,

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.810
we're ready to move to that.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:57.720
Our problems up to now, the
springs were all the same.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.270
The bar, if it was
a bar, was uniform.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:05.380
And now this would
be a step forward.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.840
But now, of course,
this specific problem

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.060
just happens to have a
solution that physicists love.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.590
It has a meaning to
physicists, not to me.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.080
And the eigenfunctions
have a meaning

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.450
and they're famous functions.

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.100
It's just glorious.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.510
So you could say that's the
special problem, the way we

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:35.540
had four special
matrices in 18.085,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:44.310
that would be a similar special
problem in quantum mechanics.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:48.390
Let's turn to something
entirely different.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:51.590
Questions about any topic.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.900
Or I can ask some and
you can take this, maybe

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.350
that's one way to review.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.020
Go ahead.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.010
Thanks.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:03.570
Number 20 of 1.6.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.360
1.6 is a section, oh, no.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.930
That's positive definite
notes so I'm okay with that.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.590
I see that I did ask you
a question on the homework

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:22.320
from 1.7 which I may not
get to cover in lecture,

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.900
but give it a shot anyway.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.620
So what's 20?

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.620
Oh, okay, that's good.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.570
Without multiplying
out the matrix.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.120
So it's this
Q*lambda*Q transpose.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.680
So I'm telling you
in that question what

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.040
Q, lambda, and Q transpose are.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:53.970
The Q is this [cosine, minus
 sine; sine, cosine].

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.940
The lambda is two and five,
I think, in that question.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.240
And the Q transpose of course
is [cosine, sine; minus sine,

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.310
cosine].

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:12.100
And if I've told you that
those are the numbers then you

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:18.060
could multiply those together
to get K. But you can tell me,

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.140
this is like K exposed.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:27.070
The matrix is like, we're
told more than we would know.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:28.990
If I multiply it all
together, I wouldn't

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.620
see that the eigenvectors
are these guys,

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.990
that the eigenvalues
are these guys.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:41.960
So what, without
looking to see, what

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.370
are the eigenvalues
of this matrix K if we

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.810
multiplied it all together?

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.930
What would the
eigenvalues actually be?

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.640
Two and five, right, because
we built it up that way.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.520
What would the determinant be?

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.930
Now what do we know
about determinants?

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.600
It would be ten is
the right answer.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.810
What's the right
way to see that?

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:10.113
Well, the determinant is always
the product of the eigenvalues,

00:30:10.113 --> 00:30:11.720
isn't it?

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.100
These guys have
determinant ten anyway.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.620
And if I hadn't normalized,
so this had some bigger

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.130
determinant, this would have
some smaller determinant.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.080
Their inverses,
their determinants

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.210
will give me the one
and there's the ten.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:33.360
What else could I ask about
or did I ask about for that?

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.250
The eigenvectors, okay.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.720
The eigenvectors of the
matrix, what are they?

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.210
They're these columns that
are sitting here for us,

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.290
they're those two
columns, right.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:49.470
And would you like to just
check that if the-- I believe

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.450
that column is an eigenvector.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:56.260
And which do you think, two
or five, is its eigenvalue?

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.080
That goes with
this first column.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.510
Everybody's going to say
two and that's right.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:08.120
And do you want me to just take
that matrix times this proposed

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.340
eigenvector and just see
if it's going to work?

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:17.390
Suppose I just do
all and just see,

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.340
sure enough this will
be an eigenvector.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.100
So what do I have at this point?

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.010
Can you do this
times this first?

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:31.840
What do I get? c squared
plus s squared is one.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.050
And -cs plus cs is zero.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.720
So at that point I have [1, 0].

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.140
Now comes this matrix.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:46.630
So what do I have after that
matrix speaks up? [2, 0].

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:51.310
And now I take two times
this and what do I get?

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:55.260
Or that matrix times the [2, 0].

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.142
How do you multiply a matrix
times that [2, 0] vector.

00:31:59.142 --> 00:32:00.600
Here's the good
way to think of it.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.240
It's two times the first column.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.430
And zero times the second.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.160
So the net result
of the whole deal

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.810
was two times that first column.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.640
Which is exactly saying
that this is an eigenvector.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.350
When I did all that
it came back again.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:24.770
Scaled by two.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.100
So that's a good example.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.260
And then, is the matrix
positive definite?

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:33.860
That connects to
today's lecture.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.850
What test would you use
to show that the matrix is

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.110
positive definite?

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.700
The eigenvalues, yeah.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.360
The eigenvalues
are sitting there.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.410
Two and five, both positive.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:47.760
If I changed one of those
signs, then it would no longer

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.780
be positive definite.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.200
It would still be symmetric,
I'd still have the eigenvectors,

00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:00.850
but the eigenvalue would
have jumped to minus five.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.470
I think this sort of helps out.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.570
I guess I hope that as
I'm doing these things,

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:10.230
you're ahead of me or
with me in the calculation

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.730
and you just have to
do a bunch of these

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.270
to get confidence that
you've got the right thing.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:22.890
Okay, yes?

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.350
1.6, 24.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.680
Is that also a homework problem?

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.200
Alright, but you guys are
reading the rest of the book,

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.720
right?

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.380
Not only the homework questions.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.320
Ah.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.050
Oh, dear.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:41.100
24, that's a very good question.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.370
About this, yeah.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:54.650
Right.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:55.850
It's a good question.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.810
And if today's lecture had
been, well it ran a little late.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:05.760
But if we ran another 20 minutes
late, I could have done this.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.440
I'll just say what's
in that problem.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:16.080
And then we'll see it again.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.340
So what's in that question?

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.540
Let me write down what it is.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:28.830
So I have a positive
definite matrix K, right?

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:33.580
And then I've got its energy.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:39.980
I'm using u rather
than x, so let's use u.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:46.110
So my u transpose Ku, or
like x transpose Kx today.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:52.580
That is this bowl-shaped
figure, right?

00:34:52.580 --> 00:35:01.140
If I graph this on
the u_1, u_2 maybe up

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.780
to u_n, all in the base.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.040
And now I have the picture.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.550
So I'm in n+1 dimensions.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.410
The other dimension is this one.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:15.950
Then that's the one where I
might get this bowl-shaped guy.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.930
And I've called that energy.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:22.570
In many, many physical problems
there is a factor of 1/2.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:27.810
And it's going to be nice
to have that factor of 1/2.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:35.610
So that won't change
anything, just half as big.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:41.630
So what is the minimum
value of that energy?

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:46.400
And what is the minimum value of
this, if I said minimize that,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.040
you could do it right away.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.570
It'd be a zero.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:57.470
Now I'm going to
introduce a linear term.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.030
This was a quadratic term
and it had u squareds in it.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:04.980
So the linear term is
going to be u transpose f

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.652
is the shorthand for it.

00:36:06.652 --> 00:36:08.985
And of course, we all know
that that stands for u_1*f_1,

00:36:08.985 --> 00:36:16.540
u_2 all minus,
u_2*f_2 and so on.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.760
However many dimensions I'm in.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.660
You can imagine I'm
in two dimensions.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.850
So it's -u_1*f_1 - u_2*f_2.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:34.300
So what I'm saying is
that minimizing just this

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.720
was like, too easy, right?

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.650
The answer was zero.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.810
Nobody's interested
in that for very long.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.730
But now it is much
more interesting

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:48.380
when I get a linear
term in there.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.680
So what happens now?

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.190
Well, the effect
of that linear term

00:36:54.190 --> 00:37:02.540
is to shift that bowl sorta
over and down a little.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:09.590
So that instead of sitting where
I drew it, let me erase it.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:14.870
If I now graph this function,
this is my function of u,

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:19.240
this is still the
most important part,

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:24.240
but now I have a
first order term.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.130
And the result is, it
still goes through here.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:27.630
Right?

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.800
Why does it still go
through that same point?

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:37.020
Because if I take u_1 and
u_2 to be zero, I get zero.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.260
So I still get zero there.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.500
But the bowl has shifted.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.040
It's more like something here.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.690
And it still has a minimum
because this is still

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.730
the all-important term.

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.900
But it's just moved
over and down.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.360
So it has the minimum value.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:00.550
It actually goes below
zero, but if I look at it

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:04.130
if I'm sitting at the
minimum and looking

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.730
I'm seeing a bowl
going up, right.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:14.160
So I hope that picture shows--
And now, of course, that's

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.480
the geometry.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.280
In other words, the
same geometry just

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.360
moved the thing over and down.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.160
But the algebra is,
where is the minimum?

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.000
What is the value
of that minimum?

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:35.180
And this problem, 24, is
one way to do the minimum.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.750
One way to do it.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:42.060
But actually, if you
didn't like linear-- well

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:44.560
I won't say didn't like
linear algebra, that's

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.560
against my religion.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.910
So if you like calculus and
you said, wait a minute,

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:54.170
if you give me something
you want me to minimize,

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.750
what will I do?

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.290
I'll set derivatives to zero.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:03.920
And can I just
jump to the answer?

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:12.370
Oh, what derivatives do I set to
zero now, for the minimum here?

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.500
It's the first derivatives.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:21.770
And they're first
derivatives with respect to?

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.330
I look at df/d what?

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.250
You see I've already
given it away.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.060
These are going to be
partial derivatives.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.950
Why's that?

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.390
Because I've got two directions.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:36.200
So I have a df/du_1=0
and a df/du_2=0.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.240
In other words, when I
sit here at the bottom

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.420
I'm seeing this
whole bowl above me.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.920
If I go along the u_2
direction it should go up

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.450
and if I come along the
u_1 direction, goes up.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:40:00.700
But it's flat at the
bottom both ways.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.320
So what's my point here?

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.560
If you like calculus,
you'll get to two equations.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.540
And I just want to say
what those equations are,

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:19.230
because they're all important.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:22.630
Suppose we only had
u_1 and nothing else.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:26.530
Then this would just be a
parabola and the derivative

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.160
of this would be
at 1/2 K*u squared.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.790
Suppose n is one.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:34.530
I'm only in one.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:39.410
So what's the derivative
of 1/2 K*u squared?

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:40.200
The derivative.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.250
So I'm looking for, if this
was 1/2 K*u squared and I took

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.480
the derivative with
respect to u, it would be?

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.610
It'd be Ku.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:52.130
And it works here
in the matrix case.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:56.766
And what would be the derivative
of u, transpose of u times

00:40:56.766 --> 00:41:03.930
f, if u was just a number and
if u was just one thing and f

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:08.070
was a single number, the
derivative would be? f, yeah.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:12.140
It'd be f.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:18.560
That's the system.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.400
I've jumped to the answer.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:27.130
That this set of two or n
equations in matrix language

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:33.100
would just be, and I'll even
write it better as Ku=f.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.960
That tells me where
the minimum is.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.720
The minimizing guy is,
so this is in the base

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.680
and then the thing
is dropping down.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:49.350
I still have to figure out
what's the bottom value.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:54.290
But I've now identified
where the minimum occurs.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:57.260
So you get two questions
about a minimum.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.040
Where is it?

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.300
What value of u
gives the minimum?

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:09.240
And at that point, at that
lowest point, how low is it?

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.820
The one thing you've
gotta remember

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.910
is that when you
minimize that quadratic,

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.570
you get that system
of equations.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:22.430
And then, of course, the answer,
you have to solve that system.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.450
But this goes back
to what I said

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:29.260
at the first minute of today.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:34.030
That we have two ways
of looking at a problem.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:38.080
Usually we go directly
to the equations.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:44.080
Sometimes the problem
comes naturally to us

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.520
as a minimum problem.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.360
Like we have to
minimize the cost,

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.030
we want to build a new
school or something.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.300
So we've got some
cost function that we

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.240
minimize that will lead, through
calculus or linear algebra,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.980
to this.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:14.680
So I've done everything
but answer the question 24.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.770
We only checked
the one by one case

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:21.780
to see that that's
the right equations,

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.590
derivative equal zero.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:27.710
And now you could use
calculus as I said.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:36.220
But if I answer that question,
well let me just do a little.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:41.120
The idea of that question
24, so that was what?

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.770
1.6, 24, or something.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:46.740
Is that right?

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.770
Yeah.

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:55.130
Is that I could rewrite
this to make it clear.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:44:00.280
I think it's u
minus K inverse f,

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:07.560
transpose K times u
minus K inverse f.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:17.230
And then a minus 1/2 f
transpose K inverse f.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.060
Actually, my best friend in
China told me this trick.

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:25.600
And I didn't give him
credit for it in the book.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.500
But I should have done.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.560
I just think that if you
multiply all this out,

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.460
you'll get this.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.980
It's what I would
call an identity.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:40.190
That just simply means that
it's just true for every u.

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.230
It's true for everything.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:45.700
Can I try to multiply
some of that out?

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:53.930
Just so you kind of see it.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:57.060
Yeah, that's what I
mean, multiply it out.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.330
You've got it.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.870
This thing would
give me four terms.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:05.140
It'd be this transpose
times that times that.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.560
Which is my guy here.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.270
And then I'll have something.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:10.610
It's just like numbers.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.350
Then this thing times
that times this.

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.700
And this thing times
that times that.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.410
And this thing times
that times that.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:19.760
Let me do that last one.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:26.990
What happens when I do
the 1/2 and this transpose

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.880
times the K times this.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.910
So I'm using the
distributive, whatever, laws.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:35.960
Let's just do that
particular term

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.370
and see what we're getting.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:42.380
So I have 1/2 of the minus
K inverse f transpose.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.740
So how do I write that?

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.920
Shoot.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.560
Well, it's something
times something transpose.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.460
So what do I have to do?

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.890
Opposite order.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:58.151
So I have a minus, an F
transpose and the K inverse

00:45:58.151 --> 00:45:58.650
transpose.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:02.730
You're seeing all this stuff.

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:06.440
And then comes the K and
then comes the minus,

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.470
oh again the minus.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:08.900
So that'd be a plus, right?

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:13.190
Times K inverse times f.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:15.470
So that's one of the terms.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.550
That's one of the
terms that shows up.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:22.960
And what good is that one?

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.120
So that's one.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.340
You could say that's
the longest term.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.470
That's the one with
the messiest term.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:31.900
But you can fix it.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.670
What would you do with that?

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:37.350
K times K inverse is?

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.030
Identity.

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:40.390
So we can forget that.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:42.210
And now we're there.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.520
That's 1/2, f transpose,
f on this side.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.200
Oh, what's K inverse transpose?

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.420
It's the same as K inverse
because K is symmetric,

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.850
so its inverse is symmetric.

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.880
So that transpose doesn't
change the matrix.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:08.600
In other words, this term will
show up and this term is oh!

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.110
Nope, sorry.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.030
I was going to goof here.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.050
I was going to say this
is the same as this,

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:16.830
but it's not, right?

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:18.880
Why not?

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.610
Because it's positive.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:24.470
And this guy is negative.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:27.980
Has my good friend
Professor Lin messed up?

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:32.680
Nope.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.890
What's going to happen now?

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:39.900
The two that I didn't
do, you see, the 1/2 u

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.070
transpose K u is here.

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:46.540
Then comes this
one, which I didn't

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.450
do, and then another
one that I didn't do,

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.760
and then this one that I did.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.960
They'll all be the same.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.600
So they'll all contribute with
their plus sign or minus sign

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:02.170
and the net result will
be a perfect match, yeah.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:08.310
So I won't wear out your
patience by doing that.

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:11.590
But I do want to make the point.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:16.880
What was Professor Lin's point
in suggesting to write it

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:21.010
in this more complicated way?

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:27.710
His point was we could see
this is just a constant.

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.860
Doesn't depend on u.

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:34.630
And now I can see what value
of u would make this as small

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.410
as possible.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.260
Remember, I'm still
trying to minimize.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:43.190
This part, I can't make it
bigger or smaller, it's fixed.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.950
It's u that I can play with.

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:51.700
So what u should I choose
to make this part smaller?

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.180
Bear with me.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:58.580
What u will make this big
mess as small as I can get it

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.850
and how small can I get it?

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:07.350
If I take u to be K inverse
f, then this is zero,

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.900
this is zero, I get zero.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:15.060
And that's my claim, that u
equal K inverse f is the best

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.930
possible, is the minimizer.

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.460
And how do I know
that I can't make this

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.210
more negative than the zero?

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:29.790
I can get it down
to zero by making

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:31.900
that to be the zero vector.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:41.090
But how do I know I
can't make it below zero?

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:44.090
The K is positive definite
and I'm sitting here

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:48.370
with some x
transpose and some x.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.980
The x has this sort of
messy form but it's an x

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.690
and here's its transpose.

00:49:53.690 --> 00:50:00.070
So this is an x transpose Kx
and can't be brought below zero

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:02.230
when K is positive definite.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:05.370
Good.

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:08.890
So we've said a good bit
about positive definite here,

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:19.970
but happy to think--
Yeah, thanks.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:27.020
In fact, finally a fifth.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.060
Exactly.

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.470
Thanks, perfect question.

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:33.070
And let me answer it clearly.

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:36.560
Each of those five
tests completely

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.760
decides positive definite.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.590
So the five tests
are all equivalent.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:46.760
If a matrix passes one
test, it passes all five.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.140
So that's great, right?

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:52.700
So we just do
whichever test we want.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.820
Or whichever way we want
to understand the matrix.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:02.720
I was going to add, I didn't
say a lot about this one.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:09.790
Can I just add a note
about a MATLAB command?

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:18.410
The command chol(K).

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:23.150
That's the first letters
in the name Cholesky.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:28.450
So chol is the first four
letters of this name.

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:34.650
And that's a MATLAB command.

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.670
If I've defined a matrix
that's positive definite

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:42.470
and I use that command,
out will pop an A,

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.540
one particular A that works.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:50.580
Out will pop an A
that makes this work.

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:55.060
It'll be a square A and
it'll be upper triangular.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:52:03.150
So out will pop, so this command
is very, very close to the LU

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:06.230
but it's just sort of
the appropriate version,

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:12.510
symmetrized version
of elimination

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:16.560
when you have a positive
definite symmetric matrix.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.690
If your matrix is not
positive definite,

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:22.240
MATLAB will tell you so.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.700
So it produces one
particular A. There

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.970
are many A's that
would work, but there's

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.310
one particular upper
triangular one.

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:40.010
It's just related to the
usual U, but yes, thanks.

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:43.070
No, I only even get
into that ballpark

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:45.110
if the matrix is symmetric.

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.510
I don't touch it otherwise.

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:51.510
So my matrix is
symmetric before I begin.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.670
So I know good things about it.

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:57.440
And here I'm asking for more.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.460
Here I'm asking are the
pivots all positive?

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.810
Are the eigenvalues
all positive?

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:06.060
So that's more.

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:10.460
But I could think of
some interpretation that

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:12.890
would, for
non-symmetric matrices,

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:17.590
but it has problems, so
I'd rather just leave it.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:22.470
Stay with symmetric.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:27.210
Well that's two hours of
lots of linear algebra.

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:31.220
I'm hoping you're going to
like the MATLAB problem.

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:41.640
Would you like to
see what it'll be?

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.850
I'll just tell you what
the equation will be.

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:49.920
So it'll be a
differential equation.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.830
Oh, dear, what is it?

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:57.030
So it's a differential
equation with a -u''

00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:00.260
that we know and love.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:03.110
And what else has it got?

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:05.600
Oh yes, right.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:09.300
So here's the problem.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:13.890
Here's the equation.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:21.050
So it has the -u'', the second
derivative and it has a first

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:24.600
derivative equal whatever.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.570
In fact, the example will
choose a delta function there.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:32.390
So what am I talking about here?

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:37.200
This would be a diffusion
and this would be,

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.910
anybody met these things before?

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:41.380
That would be a convection.

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:46.890
So that's a first derivative,
that's an anti-symmetric.

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:50.800
The MATLAB problem is now going
to create the difference matrix

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.370
for that.

00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:55.070
So the symmetric part
will be our old friend K.

00:54:55.070 --> 00:55:02.340
But now we've got the
convection term is appearing.

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.900
And it's going to
be anti-symmetric.

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:09.450
And if v is big, it gets
more and more important.

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:10.520
So what happens?

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.360
What happens with
equations like this?

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.980
Really this is like the
first time in the course

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:22.390
that we've allowed this first
derivative term to pop up.

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:29.970
But nevertheless we can see
a lot of what's happening.

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:32.570
And how to deal with
those equations?

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:37.130
I mean, if you ask a chemical
engineer or anybody, they're

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:41.920
always dealing with a flow, like
the Charles River is flowing

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.820
along, that's coming
from the velocity there,

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.670
but at the same time
stuff is diffusing in it.

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:53.070
It's just a constant problem
in true, true applications.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:56.450
And this is the
best model, I think.

00:55:56.450 --> 00:56:03.780
So you'll see that and
I'm pleased about that.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:06.120
As you'd see.

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.460
Any last question?

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:09.580
I'm always happy.

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.830
Well I'll see you Friday then.

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:12.610
Thanks for coming.
