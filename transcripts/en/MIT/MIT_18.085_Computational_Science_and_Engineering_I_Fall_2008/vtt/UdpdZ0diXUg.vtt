00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.470
OK, so.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.050
Pretty full day again.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.730
I had last time introduced
the Fourier matrix,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.330
the discrete Fourier transform.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.400
Well, more strictly, the
discrete Fourier transform

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.530
is usually this one.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.250
It takes the function values
and produces the coefficients.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.830
And then I started with the
coefficients, added back,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.080
added up the series to
get the function values.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.620
So F or F inverse.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.430
So we didn't do examples yet.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.380
And one natural example is the
discrete delta function that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.050
has a one in the zero position.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.540
That's easy to do.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.170
And then we should
do also a shift,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.080
to see what's the effect, if
you shift the function, what

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.020
happens to the transform.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.780
That's an important rule,
important for Fourier series

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.890
and Fourier integrals, too.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.240
Because often you do that, and
it's going to be a simple rule.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.490
If you shift the function, the
transform does something nice.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.520
OK, and then I want to
describe a little about the FFT

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.940
and then start on the next
section, convolutions.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.250
So that's fun and
that's a big deal.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.340
OK, about reviews, I'll
be here as usual today.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.690
I think maybe the 26th, just
hours before Thanksgiving,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.230
we can give ourselves a holiday.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.120
So not next Wednesday but
then certainly the Wednesday

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.500
of the following week would
be a sort of major quiz

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.040
review in the review session.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.790
And in class.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.950
OK, ready to go?

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.390
On this example
gives us a chance

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.480
just to remember what the matrix
looks like, because we're just

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.960
going to, if I multiply this
inverse matrix by that vector

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.865
it's just going to pick
off the first column

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:31.900
and it'll be totally
easy so let's just do it.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.820
So if y is this one, I
want to know about f.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.380
What are the
Fourier coefficients

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.020
of the delta function?

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.700
Discrete delta function?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.560
OK, before I even do it,
we got a pretty good idea

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.230
what to expect.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.130
Because we remember what
happened to the ordinary delta

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.040
function, in continuous time.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.770
Or rather, I guess it was
the periodic delta function.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.210
Do you remember
the coefficients,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.460
what were the coefficients for
the periodic delta function?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.370
You remember those?

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.220
We took the integral
from minus pi

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.340
to pi of our function,
which was delta(x).

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.240
And then we had to
remember to divide by 2pi,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.090
and you remember the
coefficients are e^(-ikx).

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.130
This is c_k in the periodic
case, the 2pi periodic case.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.120
The function is
the delta function,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.200
and you remember that if we
want coefficient k we multiply

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.730
by e^(-ikx).

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.140
That's the thing that will
pick out the e^(+ikx) term.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.100
And of course everybody knows
what we get here, this delta,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.500
this spike at x=0, means we
take the value of that function

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.780
at zero, which is one,
so we just get 1/(2pi).

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.490
For all the Fourier coefficients
of the delta function.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.660
The point being that
they're all the same.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.140
That all frequencies are
in the delta function

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.350
to the same amount.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.220
I mean that's kind of nice.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.040
We created the delta
function for other reasons,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.190
but then here in Fourier space
it's just clean as could be.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.470
And we'll expect
something here, too.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.960
You remember what F inverse is?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.530
F inverse is 1/N, instead
of 1/2pi, and then

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.190
the entries of F inverse come
from F bar, the conjugate.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.630
So it's just one, one,
one, minus-- Well,

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.360
I've made it four by four here.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.970
This is minus omega--
No, it isn't minus omega.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:58.620
It's it's omega bar, which
is minus i, in this case.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.390
Omega bar, so it's minus
i, that's omega bar.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.950
And the next one would be
omega bar squared, and cubed,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.530
and so on.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.140
All the way up to
the ninth power.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.710
But we're multiplying
by one, zero, zero,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.580
so none of that matters.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.400
What's the answer?

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.640
I'm doing this discrete
Fourier transform,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.620
so I'm multiplying by the matrix
with the complex conjugate

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.720
guys.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.720
But I'm multiplying
by that simple thing

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.840
so it's just going to pick
out the zeroth column.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.440
In other words, constant.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.270
All the discrete
Fourier coefficients

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.200
of the discrete
delta are the same.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.350
Just again.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.470
And what are they?

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.800
So it picks out this
column, but of course it

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.450
divides by N, so the answer
was 1/N [1, 1, 1, 1].

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.160
It's just constant with the 1/N,
where in the continuous case we

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.450
had 1/(2pi).

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.880
No problem.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.090
OK.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.160
And, of course, everybody
knows, suppose that I now

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.410
start with these
coefficients and add back

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.800
to get the function.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.110
What would I get?

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.900
Because, just to be sure
that we believe that F and F

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.890
inverse really are what
they are supposed to be.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.870
If I start with
these coefficients,

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:39.490
add back to put those in here
and reconstruct, so 1/N [ 1, 1,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.510
1], what will I get?

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.960
Well, what am I supposed to get?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.920
The delta, right?

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.900
I'm supposed to get back to y.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.900
If I started with
that, did F inverse

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.280
to get the coefficients,
that was the discrete Fourier

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.970
transform, now I add back to
get, add the Fourier series up

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.760
again to come back
here, well I'll

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.820
certainly get [1, 0, 0, 0],
and you see why?

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.540
If I multiply F, that zeroth
row of F is [1, 1, 1, 1],

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.970
times [1, 1, 1, 1] will give
me N. The N will cancel.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.240
I get the one.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.260
And all the other
guys add to zeroes.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.870
So, sure enough, it works.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.680
We're really just seeing an
example, an important example

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.730
of the DFT.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.940
And the homework, then, would
have some other examples.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.970
But I've forgotten whether
the homework has this example.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.370
But let's think about it now.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:54.050
Suppose that's my
function value instead.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:59.210
OK, so now I'm starting
with the delta.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.520
Again it's a delta,
but it's moved over.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.820
And I could ask, I
really should ask

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.020
first, in the continuous
case, suppose I,

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.250
I can do it with just
a little erasing here.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.630
Let me do the continuous
case for the delta

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.000
that we met first
in this course.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.150
I'll shift it to a.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.650
If I shift the delta
function to a point a,

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.070
well, I said we'd met the delta
function first in this course.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.130
At a, good.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.680
But when we did it
wasn't 2pi periodic.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:41.020
So we still have, in fact, the
Fourier integrals next week.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.750
Will have a similar formula.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.810
The integral will go from
minus infinity to infinity

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.130
and then we'll have the
real delta, not periodic.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.320
Here, we have, and people
call it a train of deltas.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.880
A train of spikes.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.180
Sort of you have one every 2pi.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.180
Anyway, that's what we've got.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.840
Now, you can see the answer.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.450
This is like perfect practice in
doing an integral with a delta.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:15.220
What's the integral equal?

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.830
Well, the spike is at x=a.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:25.560
So it picks out this function
at x=a, which is e^(-ika).

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.540
So not constant any more.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.370
They depend on k.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.210
The 1/(2pi) is still there.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:43.270
So it's-- But still, the
delta function shifted over.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.060
I mean, it didn't change energy.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.820
It didn't change, it just
changed phase, so to speak.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:10:00.780
And we see that-- I would
call this like a modulation.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.250
So it's staying of
absolute value one, still.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.790
But it's not the number one,
it's going around the circle.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.480
Going around the unit circle.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.700
So it's a phase factor, right.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.970
And that's what I'm going
to expect to see here

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.700
in the discrete case too.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.690
If I do this multiplication
by one there,

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.610
it picks out this column, right?

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.840
That one will pick
out this column,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.600
so you see it's-- Maybe
I come up here now.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:39.500
Shall I just-- When I
pick out that column,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.870
the answer then, I guess
I've got the column circle,

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.580
there it is.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.740
Minus i, minus i
squared, minus i cubed.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.430
You see it's like k equals
zero, one, two, three.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.330
Just the way here,
we had k, well we

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:01.570
had all integers k in
that function case.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.560
Here we've got four
integers, k equals zero, one,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.250
two, and three, but again it's
the minus i, it's the e to the,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.250
it's the w bar.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.880
In other words, the answer
was one, w bar, w bar squared,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.920
w bar cubed.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.220
Just the powers of
w with this factor

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.280
1/N. Here we had a modulation.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.590
It's the same picture.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.060
Absolute value's one.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.520
And and what about energy?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:42.070
Having mentioned energy,
so that's another key rule.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:47.730
The key rules for the Fourier
series, just let's think back.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.720
What were the key rules?

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.020
First, the rule to
find the coefficients.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.040
Good.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.010
Then the rule for
the derivatives.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.970
This is so important.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.070
These are rules.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.510
Let's say, for Fourier series.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.560
For Fourier series.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.850
Let's just make
this a quick review.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.380
What were the important rules?

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.590
The important rules were, if
I had the Fourier series of f.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.680
Start with the
Fourier series of f.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.490
Then the question was, what's
the Fourier series of df/dx.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.580
And now I'm saying the
next important rule

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:38.170
is the Fourier
series of f shifted.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:45.530
And then the last important
rule is the energy.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.340
OK, and let's just,
maybe this is a bad idea

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:55.510
to, since we're kind of
doing all of Fourier in,

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.700
it's coming in three parts.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:05.840
Functions, discrete,
integrals, but they all match.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.560
So this is what happens
to the function.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.260
What happens to the coefficient?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.130
So this starts with
coefficient c_k,

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.410
for f, what are the
coefficients for the derivative,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.580
just remind me?

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:32.480
If f(x), so I'm starting with
f(x) equals sum of c_k*e^(ikx).

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.660
Start with that.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.740
And now take the derivative.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.000
When I take the
derivative, down comes ik.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.370
So you remember that rule.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.050
Those are the Fourier
coefficients of the derivative.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.150
Now what's the Fourier
coefficients of the shift?

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.790
If I've just shifted,
translated the function,

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:56.880
if my original x was this,
now let me look at f(x-a).

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.090
You'll see it.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:03.690
It'll jump out at us,
it'll be a sum of the same

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.240
c_k's e^(ik(x-a)).

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.650
So what are the Fourier
coefficients of that?

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.260
Well there is the e^(ikx).

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.870
Whatever's multiplying it
has got to be the Fourier

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:23.280
coefficient, and we see it
is c_k times e^(ik(-a)).

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.230
e^(-ika) times c_k.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.470
Right?

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.540
And, of course, that's just
what we discovered here.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.910
That's just what we found there,
that when we shifted the delta,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.050
we've multiplied
by this modulation,

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:46.590
this phase factor came into
the Fourier coefficients.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.030
And now finally,
the energy stuff.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.210
You remember the energy
was, what's the energy?

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.840
The integral from
minus pi to pi, of f(x)

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:02.990
squared dx is the same as
the sum from minus infinity

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.540
to infinity of the
coefficient squared.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.410
And somebody correctly
sent me an email

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.140
to say energy and length
squared are you really,

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.320
is there much difference?

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.240
No.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.140
No.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.840
You could say
length squared here,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.910
I'm just using the word energy.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.030
Now, I left a space
because I know that there's

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.700
a stupid 2pi somewhere.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.690
Where does it come?

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.600
You remember how to get this?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.920
You put that whole
series in there,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.520
multiply by its complex
conjugate to get squared.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.180
And integrate.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.770
Right?

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.830
That was the idea.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.710
Isn't that how we figured
out, we got to this?

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.230
We started with
this, length squared.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.280
We plugged in the
Fourier series.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.770
This is f times f bar, so
that's this times its conjugate.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.860
And we integrated, and all
the cross terms vanished.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:08.220
And only the ones where e^(ikx)
multiplied e^(-ikx) came.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.440
And those had c_k squared.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.270
And when we integrated that
one, we probably got a 2pi.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.710
So that's the energy
inequality, right.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:21.960
For functions.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.520
And now what I was
going to say is,

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:31.090
you shouldn't miss the fact
that in the discrete case,

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.810
there'll be a similar
energy inequality.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:40.150
So we had y was the
Fourier matrix times c.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:44.830
Now, if I take the
length squared of both,

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.040
y, so I'm going to-- Right?

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.990
That's the same as that.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.960
Now I'm going to do
the same as this.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.790
I'm going to find
the length squared,

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.180
which will be y transpose y.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.390
No, it won't be y transpose y.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:09.690
What is length squared?
y bar transpose y.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.480
I have to do that right.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.380
That will be, substituting,
that's c bar F

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:22.470
bar transpose times y is Fc.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.670
Just plugged it in,
and now what do I use?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.560
The key fact, the fact that
the columns are orthogonal.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.980
That's what made all these
integrals simple, right?

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.630
When I put that into there,
a whole lot of integrals

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.040
had to be zero.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.110
When I put this in, a
whole lot of dot products

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.980
have to be zero.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.470
Rows of F bar times
columns of F, all zero,

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.920
except when I'm
hitting the same row.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.160
And when I'm hitting that
same row I get an N. So I get,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.440
this is N c bar transpose c.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.760
And that's c squared.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.010
That's the energy inequality,
it's just orthogonality

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.330
once again.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:15.950
Everything in these weeks is
coming out of orthogonality.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.860
Orthogonality is the fact that
this is N times the identity.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.690
Right?

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:30.470
Well, OK that's a
quick recall of a bunch

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.790
of stuff for functions.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.690
And just seeing maybe
for the first time

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.750
the discrete analogs.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:43.000
I guess I don't have a brilliant
idea for the discrete analog

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.100
of the derivative.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.940
Well, guess there's
a natural idea,

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.760
it would be a finite
difference, but somehow that

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.730
isn't a rule that
gets like, high marks.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:01.080
But we saw the discrete
analog of the shift

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.640
and now we see the
energy inequality

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.630
is just that the length
of the function squared

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:13.900
is equal to N times the length
of the coefficients squared.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.760
OK with that?

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.800
Lots of formulas here.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.080
Let's see.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.310
Do some examples.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.930
I mean, these were
simple examples.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.790
And I think the homework
gives you some more.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:36.220
You should be able to take
the Fourier transform and go

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.960
backwards.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.960
And when we do convolution
in a few minutes,

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.100
we're certainly going to
be taking the Fourier,

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.680
we're going to be
going both ways.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.070
And use all these facts.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.390
OK, I'll pause a moment.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.290
That's topic one.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.560
Topic two, fast
Fourier transform.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.550
Wow.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:07.240
What's the good way to--
I mean, any decent machine

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.810
comes with the FFT hardwired in.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.320
So you might say,
OK I'll just use it.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.830
And that seems totally
reasonable to me.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:24.790
But you might like to see
just on one board, what's

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.400
the key idea?

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.560
What's the little bit of
algebra that makes it work?

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.170
So I'll just have one
board here for the FFT

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.140
and a little bit of algebra.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:45.290
Simple, simple but
once it hit the world,

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.660
well, computer scientists
just love the recursion

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.520
that comes in there.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:58.180
So they look for that in every
possible other algorithm now.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.700
OK, let me see that point.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.470
So here's the main point.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:12.790
That if I want to take the--
multiply by F of size 1,024,

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:19.140
the fast Fourier transform
connects that full matrix

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.110
to a half-full matrix.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.090
It connects that to
the half-full matrix

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:30.520
that takes the half-size
transforms separately.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.670
So it's half-full
because of these zeroes.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.950
That's the point.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:44.350
That the 1,024 matrix is
connected to the 512 matrix.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.310
And what's underlying that?

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:58.510
The 1,024 matrix is full of e
to the 2pi*i, the w, over 1,024,

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.010
right?

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.820
That's the w for this guy.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:07.210
And then the w for this
guy, for both of these,

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.690
is e^(2pi*i/512).

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.620
So if there's a connection
between that matrix

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.180
and this matrix,
there'd better be

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.330
a connection between that
number and that number.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.250
Because this is the number
that fills this one,

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.670
and this is the number
that fills these.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.120
So what's the connection?

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.530
It's just perfect, right?

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:38.960
If I take this number, which is
one part of the whole circle,

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.310
1/1,024, a fraction
of the whole circle,

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.120
what do I do to get this guy?

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.430
To get one 512th of the
way around the circle?

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.110
I square it.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:01.650
The square of this w is this w.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:07.970
Let me call this w_N,
and this one w_M.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:12.930
Maybe I'll use caps, yeah I'm
using cap N, this is my w.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.570
This is the one I want.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.660
The w_N, the N by
N one, N is 1,024,

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.250
and the point is, everybody
saw that, when I squared it

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.790
I doubled the angle?

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:31.130
When I doubled that angle the
two over that gave me 1/512.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.650
Fantastic.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:39.590
Of course, that doesn't
make this equal to that,

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:44.330
but it suggests that there
is a close connection.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:48.580
So let me finish here the
key idea of the Fourier

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:53.580
transform in block matrix form.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.110
What's the key idea?

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:59.430
So instead of doing the big
transform, the full size,

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.360
I'm going to do two half-sizes.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:08.520
But what am I going
to apply those to?

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.610
Here's the trick.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:16.530
These two separate guys apply to
the odd-numbered coefficients.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.410
The odd-numbered component.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.710
And the even.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:24.420
So I have to first do
a little permutation,

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.950
and even comes first, always.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.080
Even means zero, two,
four, up to a 1,022.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:38.350
So this is zero, two;
zero up to 1,022.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.840
And then come all the odd guys.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.350
One up to 1,023.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.360
So this is a permutation,
a simple permutation.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.060
Just take your 1,024 numbers,
pick out the even ones,

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.270
put them on top.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.340
Right?

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.940
In other words, put
them on top where

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.420
512 is going to act on it.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.510
Put the odd ones at the
bottom, the last 512,

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.020
that guy will act on that.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:10.010
So there's 512 numbers there,
with the even coefficients,

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.750
this acts.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.990
OK, now we've got two
half-size transforms.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:21.720
Because we're applying this
to the y, to a to a typical y.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.630
OK.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.900
But I've just
written F without a y

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.230
so I don't really need a y here.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.130
This is a matrix identity.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.960
It's a matrix identity that's
got a bunch of zeroes there.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.410
Of course, that matrix
is full of zeroes.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:41.640
I mean, this is instant
speed to do that permutation.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.040
Grab the evens, put them
in front of the odds.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.770
OK, so now I've
got two half-sizes,

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.010
but then I have to
put them back together

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.290
to get the full-size matrix.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.660
And that is also a matrix.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.640
Turns out to be
a diagonal there,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:05.770
and a minus the
diagonal goes there.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:09.250
So actually, that
looks great too, right?

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.030
Full of zeroes, the identity.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.240
No multiplications whatever.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.000
Well, these are the
only multiplications,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.490
sometimes they're called twiddle
factors, give it a fancy name.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:25.330
Official sounding
name, twiddle factors.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:29.690
OK, so that diagonal
matrix D, what's that?

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:36.010
That diagonal matrix D happens
to be just the powers of w,

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:41.770
sit along D. 1,
w, up to w to the,

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.900
this is w_N, we're
talking, the big w,

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:50.210
and it's only half-size
so it goes up to M-1.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:55.000
Half, M is half of N.
Everybody's got that, right?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.290
M is half of N here.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:01.130
I'll get that
written on the board.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:06.490
M is 512, N is 1,024,
here we have the powers

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:10.810
of this guy up to 511.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:17.670
The total size being 512 because
that's a 512 by 512 matrix.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.290
I guess I can
remember somewhere,

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.780
being at a conference,
this was probably soon

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:29.780
after the FFT became
sort of famous.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.750
And then somebody who was
just presenting the idea

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:38.860
and as soon as it was presented
that way, I was happy.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:39.760
I guess.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.020
I thought OK, there
you see the idea.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.770
Permutation, reorder
the even-odd.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:50.220
Two half-size transforms,
put them back together.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.780
And what's happened here?

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:58.760
The work of this
matrix, multiplying

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.520
by this matrix, which
would be 1,024 squared

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.560
is now practically cut in half.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.290
Because this is nothing.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:10.310
And we have just this
diagonal multiplication to do,

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.900
and of course this is the same
as that, just with minus signs.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.890
So the total multiplications
we have to do,

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.750
the total number of twiddle
factors, is just 512,

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.340
and then we're golden.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.690
So we've got half the work
plus 512, 512 operations.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.540
That's pretty good.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.060
And of course it gets better.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.980
How?

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.552
Once you have the idea
of getting down to 512,

00:28:38.552 --> 00:28:39.760
what are you going to do now?

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:46.070
This is the computer
scientist's favorite idea.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.540
Do it again.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.900
That's what it comes to.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.200
Whatever worked for 1,024 to
get to 512 is going to work.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.720
So now I'll split this
up into, well, each 512,

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.350
so now I have to do, yeah.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:07.860
Let me write F_512 will
be, it's now smaller.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:15.370
An I, an I, and a D and a
minus D for the 512 size,

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:22.480
of F_256, 256 and
then the permutation,

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.480
the odd-even
permutation P. So we're

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.960
doing this idea in
there, and in there.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:38.700
So it's just recursive.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.200
Recursive.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.920
And now, if we go
all the way, so you

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.400
see why I keep
taking powers of two.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.390
It's natural to
have powers of two.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:49.410
Two or three.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.190
Three is also good.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.560
I mean, all this
gets so optimized

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.880
that powers of two or
three are pretty good.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.320
And you just use the same idea.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:06.720
There'd be a similar idea here
for, if I was doing instead

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:12.110
of odd-even, even-odd I was
doing maybe three groups.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:19.600
But stick with two, that's fine.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.130
Then you might ask,
if you were a worrier

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:30.650
I guess you might ask what
if it's not a power of two.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.800
I think you just add in zeroes.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:41.010
Just pad it out to be
the next power of two.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.760
Nothing difficult there.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.920
I think that's right.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.750
Hope that's right.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:55.690
And once this idea came out, of
course, people started looking.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:00.110
What if the number
here was prime?

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:05.790
And found another
neat bit of algebra

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.020
that worked OK
for prime numbers.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.680
Using a little bit
of number theory.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.290
But the ultimate
winner was this one.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:23.680
So maybe I'll just
refer you to those pages

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:29.700
in the book, where you'll
spot this matrix equality.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.230
And then next to
it is the algebra

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:37.200
that you have to do to check it.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.910
I can just say, because I want
you to look to the right spot

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:47.190
there, maybe I'll take out
the great-- This is sometimes

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:53.200
called after Parseval,
or some other person.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.850
Yeah, the algebra--

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:02.820
Let me start the algebra
that made this thing work.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:07.800
We want the sum, when
we multiply Fourier,

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:14.760
F times something, we want
the sum of w^(jk), right?

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:23.040
That's the coefficient, that's
the entry of F. Times c_k.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.930
Summed from k=0 to N-1.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:30.990
To 1,023.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:40.220
That's the y_j that
we're trying to compute.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.520
We're computing 1,024 y's
from 1,024 c's by adding up

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.130
the Fourier series when we
multiply by F. This is F,

00:32:49.130 --> 00:33:00.770
this is the equation y=Fc
written with subscripts.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.630
So this is what the
matrices are doing,

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:07.150
and now where do I
find that 512 thing?

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.050
How do I get M into the
picture, remembering

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:16.910
that the w_N squared
was w_M, right?

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.060
That's what we saw.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.140
This is the big number,
this is half of it,

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.750
so this is a little bit of
the part around the circle.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.590
When I go twice as far
I get to the other one.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:34.510
So that's the thing
that we've got to use.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.430
Everything is going
to depend on that.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.230
So this was w_N, of course.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.750
This is the N by N transform.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:47.010
So now comes what,
what's the key idea?

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.960
The key idea is split
into even and odd.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.640
And then use this.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.160
So split into the even
ones and the odd ones.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:01.060
So I write this as two separate
sums, a sum for the even ones.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:10.520
w_N, now, so now the even
c_k, so I'm going to multiply

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.330
by c_(2k).

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.820
These are the ones
with even, and the sum

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:23.070
is only going to go
from zero to M-1, right?

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.080
This is only half of the terms.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:31.090
And then look on the other
half, plus the same sum

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.340
of-- But I didn't finish here.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.280
Let me finish.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.870
So I'm just picking
out, I'm taking,

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.320
instead of k I'm doing 2k.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.430
So I have j times 2k here.

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:49.460
And now these will be
the odd ones. c_(2k+1),

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:54.990
and omega_N to the j(2k+1).

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.330
It's a lot to ask you.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:11.530
To focus on this bit of algebra.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.230
I hope you're going
to go away feeling,

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.170
well it's pretty darn simple.

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.970
I mean there'll be
a lot of indices,

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.650
and if I push it all the way
through there'll be a few more.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.250
But the point is, it's
pretty darn simple.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.730
For example, this term.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.700
What have I got there?

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.450
Look at that term,
that's beautiful.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:36.620
That's w_N squared.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.650
What is w_N squared?

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:42.630
It's w_M.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.060
So instead of w_N
squared, I'm going

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.680
to replace that
w_N squared by w_M.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.160
And the sum goes
from zero to M-1,

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.050
and what does that represent?

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:58.980
That represents the
F_512 multiplication,

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.840
the half-size transform.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.280
It goes halfway, it
operates on the even ones,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:09.740
and it uses the M.
It's just perfectly,

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.980
so this is nothing but
the Fourier matrix,

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:21.950
the M by M Fourier matrix,
acting on the even c's.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:23.110
That's what that is.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.630
And that's why we
get these identities.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.310
That's why we get
these identities,

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:33.650
because they're acting on
the even-- The top half is

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:37.470
the even guy.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.110
OK, this is almost as good.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.410
This is the odd c's.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:47.900
Here I have, now
do I have w_M here?

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.530
I've got to have w_M.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.210
Well, you can see.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:58.300
It's not quite coming out right,
and that's the twiddle factor.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:05.200
I have to take out a w_N to the
power j to make things good.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.470
And when I take out
that w_N to the power j,

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:14.820
that's what goes in the
D, in the diagonal matrix.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.010
Yeah.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.610
I won't go more than that.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:24.380
You couldn't, there's no
reason to do everything here

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.620
on the board when the
main point is there.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.250
And then the point was
recursion and then, oh,

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:33.180
let me complete the recursion.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.520
So I recurse down to
256, then 128, then 64.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.390
And what do I get in the end?

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.990
What do I get altogether,
once I've got all the way down

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.440
to size two?

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:54.830
I have a whole lot
of these factors

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.400
down in the middle,
the part that

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:03.060
used to be hard is now down
to F_2 or F_1 or something.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.340
So let's say F_1, one by
one, just the identity.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.050
So I go all the way.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:14.000
Ten steps from 1024,
512, 256, every time

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.090
I get twiddle factors.

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.200
Every time I get P's.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:25.150
A lot of P's, but the F_512,
what used to be the hard part,

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:29.170
has gone to the easy part.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:31.250
And then what do I have?

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.910
I've got just a
permutation there.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:38.920
And this is the actual work.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:43.490
This is the only work
left, is the matrices

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:49.180
like this, for different sizes.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.886
And I have to do those.

00:38:50.886 --> 00:38:52.510
I have to do all
those twiddle factors.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:58.300
So how many matrices
are there, there?

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.310
It's the log, right?

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.480
Every time I divided by two.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.480
So if I started at
1,024, I do ten times,

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.580
I have ten of those matrices
and have me down to N=1.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:18.350
So I've got ten of these, and
each one takes 1,024 or maybe

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:19.390
only half of that.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.790
Actually, only half because
this is a copy of that.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:26.660
I think the final count,
and can I just put it here,

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:32.350
this is the great number,
is each of these took

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.400
N multiplications.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.510
But there were only log
to the base two-- Oh, no.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.990
Each of them took half
of N multiplications,

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:44.680
because the D and
the minus D are just,

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.240
I don't have to repeat.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.320
So half N for each factor
and the number of factors

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.360
is log to the base two
of N. Ten, for 1,024.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:00.120
So that's the magic of the FFT.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.980
OK.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.920
It's almost all on one
board, one and a half boards.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:21.000
To tell you the key point,
odds and evens, recursion,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.270
twiddle factors, getting down
to the point where you only

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:30.100
have twiddle factors left and
then those multiplications

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:37.640
are only N log N. Good?

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.230
Yes.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:40.180
Right, OK.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:47.840
Now, that's discrete transform.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.870
The theory behind it and
the fantastic algorithm

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:59.000
that executes it.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.600
Are you ready for a convolution?

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.570
Can we start on a topic
that's really quite nice,

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:10.130
and then Friday will be
the focus on convolution.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.210
Friday will certainly
be all convolution day.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:21.920
But maybe it's not a bad idea
to see now, what's the question?

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.310
Let me ask that question.

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.990
OK, convolution.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:35.200
So we're into the next section
of the book, Section 4.4,

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:42.050
it must be.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.510
And let me do it first
for a Fourier series.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:50.690
I have convolution of series,
convolution of discrete.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:57.490
Convolution of integrals,
but we haven't got there yet.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:02.370
So I'll do this
one, this series.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.090
So let me start with
a couple of series.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.430
f(x) is the sum of
c_k*e^(ikx), say.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:18.430
g(x) is the sum of some
other coefficients.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.600
And I'm going to ask
you a simple question.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:27.550
What are the Fourier
coefficients of f times g?

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:39.990
If I multiply those
functions, equals something.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:44.490
And let me call those
coefficients, h maybe.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:54.580
h_k*e^(ikx), and my question is
what are the coefficients h_k

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:59.590
of f times g?

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:10.550
That's the question that
convolution answers.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:14.870
Actually, both this series
and the discrete series

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.290
are highly interesting.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:20.770
Highly interesting.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:25.740
So here I wrote it
for this series.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:34.540
If I write it for the discrete
ones, you'll see, so let

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.310
me do it over here
for the discrete one.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:39.850
Because I can write it
out for the discrete ones.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:47.530
My y's are c_0 plus
c_1 e t-- No, w.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:58.870
I have this nice notation, w.
plus c_(N-1)*w^(N-1), right?

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:03.440
That's the-- Ooh.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.630
What's that?

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.000
I haven't got that right.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.540
Yes, what do I want now?

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.660
I need, yep.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.800
Sorry, I'm looking,
really I'm looking at y_j,

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.960
the j-th component of y.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:32.510
So I need a w^j, w^(j(N-1).)
Yeah, OK, let me-- OK.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:33.010
Alright.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:36.420
And so that's my f.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:44.830
I'll come back to that,
let me stay with this.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.530
I'll stay with this to
make the main point,

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:51.230
and then Friday we'll
see it in a neat way

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.960
for the discrete one.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.300
So I'm coming back
to this. f has

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.940
its Fourier series. g
has its Fourier series.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.870
I multiply.

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:10.080
What happens when I
multiply this times this?

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.430
I'm not going to integrate.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.890
I mean, when I do
this multiplication,

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.890
I'm going to get
a mass of terms.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:21.230
A real lot of terms.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.650
And I'm not going to
integrate them away.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:25.850
So they're all there.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:27.160
So what am I asking?

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.320
I'm asking to pick out
all the terms that have

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.050
the same exponential with them.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.730
Like, what's h_0?

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.980
Yes, tell me what h_0 is?

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.200
If you can pick out
h_0 here, you'll

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:50.630
get the idea of convolution.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:53.460
What's the constant
term if I multiply

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.710
this mess times this
mess, and I look

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:04.420
for the constant
term, h_0, where

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.080
do I get the constant terms
when I multiply that by that?

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.490
Just think about that.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.180
Where do I get a
constant, without any k,

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.960
without an e^(ikx)?

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.650
If I multiply that by that.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.970
Well tell me one place I get
something. c_0 times? d_0.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:25.650
Good.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:28.030
Is that the end of the story?

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:29.130
No.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.159
If you thought that
multiplying the functions,

00:46:32.159 --> 00:46:33.950
I just multiplied the
Fourier coefficients,

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:36.820
the first point is no.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.420
There's more stuff.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.940
Where else do I get a
constant out of this?

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:44.850
Just look at it, do
that multiplication

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:48.100
and ask yourself
where's the constant.

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.090
Another one, yep.

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:54.890
You were going to say
it is? c_1 times d_(-1).

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:55.580
Right.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:59.750
Right. c_1 times d_(-1).

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:05.890
And tell me all of them,
now. c_2 times d_(-2).

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:09.112
And what about c_(-1)?

00:47:09.112 --> 00:47:09.820
There's a c_(-1).

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:16.150
It multiplies d_1.

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:19.500
And onwards.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:26.330
So the coefficient
comes from, now how

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:29.650
could you describe that?

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:35.580
I guess I'll describe it as,
I'll need a sum to multiply.

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:42.490
This will be the sum
of c_k times d what?

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.600
Minus k, right?

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.370
That's what you told me,
the piece at the start,

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:52.170
and that's the pattern
that keeps going.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:58.810
OK, that's h_0, the sum
of c_k times d_(-k).

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:05.580
Now, we have just time
to do the next one.

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:07.310
We've got time but
not space, where

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:09.640
the heck am I going to put it?

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:14.550
I want to do h_k, I guess.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:18.170
Or I better use a
different letter h_l,

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:22.890
let me use the letter h_l,
and God there's no space.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:31.120
Alright, so can I-- Yes. h_l.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.300
OK.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.810
So this was h_0, let me keep
things sort of looking right

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:37.470
for the moment.

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:39.640
OK, now you're going to fix h_l.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.770
So what does c_0 multiply,
if I'm looking for h_l,

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.920
I'm looking for the
coefficient of e^(ilx).

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.080
So ask yourself how do I get
e^(ilx) when that multiplies

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.110
that?

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.820
When that multiplies that, and
I'm looking for an e^(ilx),

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:02.430
I get one when c_0
all multiplies what?

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:05.690
This is it. d_l, right.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:07.130
And what about for c_1?

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:14.190
Think of here, I
have a c_1*e^(i1x).

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:18.120
What does it multiply down
here to get the exponential

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.340
to be l? ilx?

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.860
It doesn't multiply d_(-1).

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:31.530
It multiplies, c_1
multiplies? d_(l-1).

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:38.470
Good, good. l-1, right. l-1,
and what are you noticing here?

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.560
c minus, I'll have
to fill that in.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:45.620
But you're seeing
the pattern here?

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.380
And what was the pattern here?

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:51.870
Those numbers added
to this number.

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:54.490
And now these numbers add to l.

00:49:54.490 --> 00:50:00.040
Those numbers add to
l, whatever it is,

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.020
the two indices
have to add to l,

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.140
so that when I multiply
the exponential they'll add

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.000
to e^(ilx).

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.480
They'll multiply to e^(ilx).

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.360
So what goes there?

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.750
It's probably l+1, right?

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:22.300
So that l+1 combined with
minus one gives me the l.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.560
If you tell me what goes
there, I'm a happy person.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.750
Let's make it h_l.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:33.300
We're ready for the final
formula for convolutions.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:39.020
Big star.

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:44.200
To find h_l, the
coefficient of e^(ilx),

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.390
when you multiply that
by that, you look at c_k,

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:58.110
and which d is going to show
up in the e^(ilx) term? l-k,

00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:59.700
is that what you said?

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.870
I hope, yeah. l-k.

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:04.590
Right, that's it.

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:05.250
That's it.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:10.030
So we've got a lot
of computation here.

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:17.300
But we've got the idea of
what, we've got a formula.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.740
And most of all we
have the magic rule.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:25.480
In convolutions,
convolutions are,

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:29.930
things multiply but indices add.

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:32.300
Things multiply,
numbers multiply,

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.160
while their indices add.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.990
That's the key
idea of convolution

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:40.410
that we'll see clearly
and completely on Friday.

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:41.660
OK.
