00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.930
PROFESSOR STRANG: Ready?

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.910
So let me recap the
important lecture

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.650
from last time that gave
the framework that we'll

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.480
see in Chapter two
and Chapter three,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.640
really a major
part of the course.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.990
And our example was a line
of masses and springs.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.190
So that's like, the first
example to start with.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.700
And you remember,
there were three steps.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.240
If we want to know how
much the masses displace

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.350
we have to get to the springs.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.010
Difference in displacements gave
the stretching of the springs.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.660
Then comes the material law,
Hooke's Law in this case,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.160
with a matrix C that led to CAu.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.470
And then finally,
those spring forces

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.440
are balanced by the
external forces.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.560
That brought in A transpose.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.540
So that's the
picture to look for.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:27.430
And I just mention it again
because it's so central.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.660
So we'll be doing
other examples of that.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.330
But I wanted to stay with
springs and masses for today.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.560
To do another type of problem.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.360
A problem in which time enters.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.610
A problem in which we're not
looking for the steady state.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.470
But it's Newton's Law
is going to come in.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.220
This is actually Newton's Law.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.790
You recognize mass.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.090
You recognize acceleration.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.380
And the force on
the spring is -Ku.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.420
So when -Ku, when the force
came over to that side,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.120
that's the equation
we're looking at.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.810
So it's like time-out
for a discussion

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.290
of the very important
subject of time derivatives.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.080
How do I solve initial
value problems now?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.370
So I have some
starting time, I'm

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.780
given u(0), the starting
position of the springs,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.600
and I'm given the
velocity at zero.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.120
So I'm given two facts at zero.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.000
That's very different from
the steady state problem

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.420
where you're given stuff
around the boundary.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.290
Here we're given
stuff at the start.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.540
Initial values instead
of boundary values.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.000
So what does this mean?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.130
It means that maybe I pull
the springs down and I let go.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.080
And what do they do?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.900
They oscillate.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.830
And you will have
studied this equation.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.600
I hope you've seen
that equation.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.030
Because I think of it as
the fundamental equation

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.890
of mechanics.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.740
In fact, I've even
used those words.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.990
The fundamental equation
of mechanical engineering.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.290
Well, it's Newton's
Law for a system.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.830
So the matrix M
now has two masses.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.800
In this case, it would
be a two by two system.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.660
The matrix M would
have two masses.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.850
Suppose mass one may be like,
nine and mass two is one.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.380
So copying what our problem
is we'd have a nine and a one

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.550
multiplying u_1'' and u_2''.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.160
Can I use prime
for a derivative?

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.430
Rather than dots,
because I'm never

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.820
too sure if the dot
is there or not.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.690
So prime I can see.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.040
And then plus our Ku.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.860
And actually you know what K
will look like for this system.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.020
It's fixed-fixed.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.700
Well, let me write down
what K would look like.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.270
Just because we saw
it at the very end.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.140
What it looks like if there
are spring constants, c_1, c_2,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.950
and c_3.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.390
Can I just remind you
what that will look like?

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.310
So this will multiply
u and give zero.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.930
So the mass matrix is
diagonal in the problem.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.750
That's, diagonal matrices, we
certainly expect to be easy.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.770
Almost as easy as
the identity matrix

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.320
where we would have
two equal masses.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.620
Here it's just that
little bit more general

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.190
with two different masses.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.840
And in here, the kind of thing
that we created just at the end

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.560
of the last lecture was
something like c_1+c_2

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.830
on the diagonal and a -c_2
and a -c_2 and a c_2+c_3.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.420
So c_2 for the middle
spring is the one

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.900
that's really there with its
full little element matrix,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.570
c_2, -c2; -c_2, c_2.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.160
The c_1 part is only
coming in at the top

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.730
because it's connected
to a fixed support.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.240
And c_3 is only coming
in at the bottom.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.370
Anyway, that's the matrix
K. This is the matrix M.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.020
And how do we solve the problem?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.350
You've seen before, and now
ADINA Professor Bathe's code

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.590
or any other code would offer,
like, two different ways.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:02.470
One way is because we have
constant coefficients here

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.370
we can expect a pretty clean
formula for the answer.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.830
And because we're growing,
we're oscillating in time,

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.320
things are happening in
time, we expect eigenvectors,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.160
eigenvalues to come in.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.270
Into that formula.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.980
I think it's worth just
repeating that formula.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.700
How do you approach it?

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.860
And then the second,
the really serious issue

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.890
is how do you solve
equation like this

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:40.400
or even more general,
time-dependent problems.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.410
I mean this is what finite
element codes are created for.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.720
How do you study
the crash of a car?

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.170
So this isn't quite the
equation for a car crash.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.360
What would be different
in a car crash?

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.370
There's a short section
later in Chapter two

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.340
called the reality of
computational engineering.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.660
And the reality is, cars crash,
people drop their cell phones.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.030
And those are very difficult
problems to compute with.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.840
And of course, absolutely
impossible to use eigenvectors

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.040
because, well they're
not linear at all.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.190
Right?

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.440
If you crash two cars,
if you want to study,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.850
everything's happening
in like, a hundredth

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.330
of a second or something.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.610
But what's happening
there is highly non-linear

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.330
so it's very much
more complicated.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.030
And you take thousands
of time steps

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.050
maybe within the crash time.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:52.090
And you're going to use finite
differences or finite elements.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.150
So this is a chance
to say something

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:02.120
about this special equation
for finite difference method.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.870
It's really 18.086 that takes
up these questions seriously.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.780
If I choose a finite
difference method.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.290
See, the thing is with
finite differences

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.610
you've got many, many choices.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.710
There's only one way
to go in step one.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.950
Eigenvectors, this thing has
got eigenvectors, you find them,

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.180
you're in.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.420
But for the much more
general, typical problems

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.450
that you'll be solving
the rest of your lives,

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.380
finite differences
or finite elements,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.170
you've got lots of choices.

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:41.270
And the issues that come up
are the accuracy of the choice.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.590
Centered differences
often gives you

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.560
that extra order of accuracy.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.820
Stability is something
we have not seen yet.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.500
So what does stability mean?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.900
Stability means that as I follow
my difference equation forward

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:02.250
in time it stays near
the true equation.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.150
You'll see by example.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.820
So some methods are
more stable than others,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.970
some are completely
unstable and unusable.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.470
And then, of course,
the other condition,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:19.230
another desired requirement,
is speed of calculation.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.250
So these balance each other.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.200
It's a beautiful subject.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.850
And let me just open the
door to that subject today.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.900
May I start with the
eigenvector solution.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.110
How would I solve this
equation by eigenvectors?

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:42.780
Well again, I'm going to
look for special solutions.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.460
So let me write that
equation down again.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.020
Mu''+Ku=0.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.140
I'm taking zero external force.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.090
So the springs and masses
are just oscillating.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.770
Their total energy won't
change, it's a closed system.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.260
The kinetic plus the potential
energy will stay constant

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.580
and we can show why.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.380
There's a lot in this section,
by the way, section 2.2.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.650
More than I would be able
to do in the lecture.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.210
But let me capture
the key ideas.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.840
So one key idea is
the natural idea when

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.910
we have constant coefficients.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.970
Look for special solutions.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:32.270
So let me say look for special
solutions of the form--

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.880
well, let's keep in mind always
the simplest model of all.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.170
Let me put it over here because
I'll focus on it particularly,

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.370
especially.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:49.380
The simplest case would be u'',
with a mass normalized to one,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.600
plus u equal 0.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.090
Just a single equation.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.910
So that's just a single spring.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.800
Single mass.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.570
So the mass is just
oscillating up and down.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:07.940
And we all know that it's
going to oscillate up and down,

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.710
sines and cosines are
going to come into here.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.810
In fact, we know
that the solution

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:18.950
to that would be, this
could have cosine, this

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.350
would have some
cos(t)'s and some-- u

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:29.330
could be a combination
of cos(t) and sin(t).

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.250
Right?

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.240
And the A and B would
be used to match the two

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.670
initial conditions.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.050
So that's what we've
got in the scalar case.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:44.390
This is one spring. n is one.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.490
We don't have a matrix
here, just a number.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:53.330
But that's our guide
to the matrix case.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.830
So now what am I
going to look for?

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.940
I'm going to look for u(t).

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:04.530
I'll look for special
solutions of the form cos--

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.700
They'll go at
different frequencies.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.920
So the frequency
has to be found.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.550
So that's the time dependence.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:17.640
And then some, if I'm
lucky all the springs

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.740
will be going together.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.850
So this x-- Am I going
to use x for eigenvector?

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.040
I think so, yes.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.180
Let's use x for eigenvector.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:37.690
So this is a vector, this
is a constant vector.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:49.490
And this gives the oscillation.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:55.910
Let me just already
start with that.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.550
I've got two
unknowns here, right?

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.760
Two things that
I'm free to choose.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.400
I'm free to choose
the frequency omega

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.320
and I'm free to
choose this vector x.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.240
And I've like,
separated out time.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.850
The way we've been doing
it with an e^(lambda*t).

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.740
We used an e^(lambda*t).

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.880
So that was sort of right
for a first order equation.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.940
Cosine is right for a second
order equation like this.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.770
When is that a solution
to my equation?

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.360
May I just plug it in?

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.160
So I'm going to just plug it in?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.910
Substitute is a better
word than plug in, right?

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:42.170
So shall I just plug it in?

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.810
So I get M times that
second derivative.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.820
So the second
derivative of the cosine

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:54.390
is the cosine with a
minus, M omega squared.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.580
Is that right?

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.750
Yes?

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.830
Times what?

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.710
So that's what came from
the time derivative.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.540
Times cos times
this, cos(omega*t)x.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.550
Two time derivatives brought
down a minus omega squared.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:16.440
And the other part is just
K times u, cos(omega*t)x.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.270
And that should be zero.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.130
And this is supposed to
be a good solution that

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:33.780
works for all time.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.470
This is what I want to be zero.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.330
Do you see what's left?

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:45.310
Kx from here.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:53.240
And putting that on the other
side, M omega squared x.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.140
Can I write the omega squared
that way? omega squared Mx.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:05.015
Then if that is satisfied
then the differential equation

00:15:05.015 --> 00:15:05.850
is satisfied.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:06.960
I've got a solution.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.970
So I'm looking for K and
I'm looking for x and omega.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:16.940
And by the way, I could
also have sin(omega*t) here.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.660
As well as cosine just
the way over there.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.140
Sines and cosines both possible.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:22.870
So sin(omega*t)x.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.620
It would be exactly the
same except that it'd be

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.520
a sin(omega*t) that
I'd be dividing out.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.750
And again, I'd
come back to this.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.640
This is key problem.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:44.760
And do you see that somehow
here we have an eigenvector x

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.850
and an eigenvalue omega squared?

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:54.110
An eigenvalue omega
squared, right.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.460
But there is one little twist.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.590
It's not quite our standard
eigenvalue problem.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:03.860
What's the extra guy
that's present in that box

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.500
that we don't usually see?

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.960
M. M is the new person
there, new thing.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.220
The mass matrix.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.660
Which, if all masses
where one, the mass matrix

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.740
would be the identity.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.730
We would be back.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.870
We would just have
our standard problem.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.810
I just have to say a
word about the case

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.780
when the mass matrix is there.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.370
It's still an
eigenvalue problem.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:37.000
If you like, I can bring
M inverse over here.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.180
I could write it as M inverse
K x equal omega squared x.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:49.490
So I'm looking for the
eigenvalues of M inverse K.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.640
That's really what I'm doing.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.230
The eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of M inverse K.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:17:03.610
But I'm always trying to be
like, aesthetically right.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:09.210
And what's-- M inverse K has
just a little something wrong

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:09.710
with it.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.720
Which is?

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.620
It's not symmetric.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.320
If I take my matrix K, which
is beautifully symmetric,

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.530
and my M, which is
beautifully symmetric,

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.740
but when I do M inverse K,
do you see what'll happen?

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.290
The inverse of that
matrix will have a 1/9.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.650
When I do M inverse*K, that
row will get divided by nine.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.380
And the second row won't
change because I've got a one.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.180
So it just like,
spoiled things a little.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.250
You can deal with it.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:46.030
But actually, in some way
it's better to keep it right.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.120
And MATLAB is totally
okay with that.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.930
So MATLAB would use the command
eig -- and other systems too --

00:17:54.930 --> 00:18:03.140
of K, M. Just tell
MATLAB the two matrices.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.300
Then it solves that problem.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.450
It will print out the,
well if you just typed eig,

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.790
it would print out
the eigenvalues.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.810
If you ask it for the
eigenvector matrix,

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.380
it'll print those too.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:24.590
So that has the grand name
generalized eigenvalue problem.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.380
Generalized because
it's got an M in there.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.970
I don't know if you've met
these problems where there could

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.710
be an M. It's just a
natural, and it's not really

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:39.000
a big deal, particularly when M
is a positive diagonal matrix.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.850
It's not a big deal at all.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.860
It's the same codes essentially
finding the eigenvalues

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.230
and eigenvectors.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.050
So suppose we have them.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:19:01.200
We expect n positive
eigenvalues,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.980
and those'll be
the omega squareds.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.670
And each one comes
with its eigenvector.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:14.110
And complete set,
everything is good.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:17.460
We're talking about symmetric
positive definite matrices.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.300
Notice that K is
positive definite.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.800
That was what our whole
last weeks have been about.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.770
And M is obviously
positive definite.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:34.660
So it's a complete--
it's a perfect set-up

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.570
for the eigenvalue problem.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.160
I just want to think
through the final step.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.560
After we find the eigenvalues,
lambda, the omega squareds,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.370
then we know the omegas and
we find the eigenvectors, x,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:56.610
how do you write the answer?

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.000
So what have I done so far?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.030
I've looked for some
special solutions.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.170
And I will find them.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.140
So I've found these omegas.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.460
They can go with sines or
cosines, I found the x's.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:17.210
Now what's the general solution?

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.650
If I have these solutions
to my great equation

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.710
there, what's the
general solution? u(t).

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:30.160
So this would be
the big picture.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.270
What can I do in
linear equations?

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.130
Linear combinations.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.270
That's what linear algebra is
all about, linear combinations.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.750
So I could take a linear
combination of these cosines,

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:49.160
so cos(omega_1*t)x_1.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.740
So that would be
a solution coming

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.560
from the first eigenvector and
eigenvalue, or the square root,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.120
times any constant.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.740
And then, of course,
I could have a b_1.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.300
I'll use b's for the sines.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.610
(omega_1*t), x_1.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.670
So that's just like that.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:15.240
But it's used the sines, which
would also solve the equation.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.770
And then all the
way down to x_n's.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.240
Right?

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.750
So I've got 2n.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:30.810
2n simple solutions. n cosines
times eigenvectors and n sines

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.880
times those same eigenvectors.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.360
Why do I want 2n?

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.360
I've got 2n constants then to
choose, the a's and the b's.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.160
And how do I choose them?

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:53.070
What's the next step?

00:21:53.070 --> 00:22:03.460
Using eigenvectors, maybe I just
mention again the three steps.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:09.420
The three step method.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:19.710
Step one: find a's and b's.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.216
Oh, now you have to
answer my question.

00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:25.090
Where are the a's and
b's going to come from?

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.560
What's going to determine
these 2n constants,

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.100
the a's and the b's?

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.780
The initial
conditions, of course.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.320
We've got two initial
conditions, this is a vector.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.860
We're talking about
a system here.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.910
I've got position
of both masses.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.880
I've got the initial
velocity of both masses.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:52.840
And the a's, they come
from, because the a's go

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.800
with the cosines and so they're
going to be the ones associated

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.330
with u(0), will give this.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:09.780
Will give a combination-- Will
give the a's. u(0) will be

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:15.690
a_1*x_1 + a_n*x_n.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.670
This is at t=0.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.040
So I'm using the
initial conditions.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.170
u(0) is a combination
of those eigenvectors.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:32.510
So this is from the
initial conditions.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:36.860
And the b's of course are going
to come from u'(0), the initial

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.330
velocity, because
they go with sines.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:47.020
So sines start at zero but
they have an initial velocity.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.920
So that's step one.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.550
That finds the constants.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:57.450
It splits the problem
into these normal modes.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.560
It finds how much
of each eigenvector

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.260
is in there at the start.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.450
Step two?

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.820
So it's really worth
seeing these three steps

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.090
because they just repeat and
repeat for all applications

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.230
of eigenvalues.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.670
Step two is what?

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:20.300
Step two is follow each of
these guys forward in time.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.810
Follow them to any time.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:23.870
What does that mean?

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:28.500
That means just put in
the cosines and the sines.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:44.260
So the a's go to a*cos(omega*t).

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.300
So I'm just saying what
happens to those coefficients.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:48.950
Each one.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:57.910
Let's see. a_i, say, goes to
a_i is multiplied by the cosine.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:03.850
And the b's, b_i's go
to b_i*sin(omega_i*t).

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:13.840
So now we followed the
coefficients forward in time.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.830
And step three?

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.380
The final step is?

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.670
So here, we're
following each one.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.260
So the pattern is
always the same one.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:31.370
Take your starting
conditions, split them up

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.990
into eigenvectors.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.050
Follow each eigenvector.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.520
And then step three is?

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.790
Reassemble.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.010
Put them back together.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:49.974
Step three is the solution.
u at that later time t is

00:25:49.974 --> 00:25:50.890
a_1*cos(omega_1*t)x_1.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.150
And b_1*sin(omega_1*t)x_1.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:06.210
Those are the two guys
that are reflecting

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.040
the fundamental mode.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:14.700
And then we have a_2's and b_2's
multiplied by cosines and sines

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.650
and times x_2 and so on.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.160
Put the pieces together.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.920
So it's split the
initial conditions,

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:31.340
follow each
eigenvector, reassemble.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.830
It's the heart of
Fourier methods,

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.720
it's the heart of
using eigenvectors.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:49.610
And there's a little code in
the book that does exactly that.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.920
So let's just pause a moment.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.900
This was the
eigenvector solution.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:04.840
And now I want to talk
about computational science.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.750
For which this
problem is a model,

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:12.870
but the problem has probably got
more complications and things

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:19.870
change in time, whatever.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.740
This was an exact solution.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:28.670
That's more than we hope
for in real computations.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:32.860
We hope for accuracy, but we
don't hope for 100% accuracy

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:38.570
unless we have this
exact model problem.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.680
So we use finite differences.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.550
Ready for finite differences?

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:50.610
So this is method one, which
allows you to understand

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.030
the model problem.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:56.120
And now comes method two,
which allows you to compute

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.220
much more, many more problems.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.850
And if I do it just for
this, let me come back

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.610
to just this model.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:14.390
One spring and one mass.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:22.540
Shall we start the mass at rest?

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.960
Let me make that the answer.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.400
I want that to be the answer.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:34.960
So I'm going to start with u(0)
to be zero-- to be one, right?

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.990
I'm going to start with u(0)
to be one and u'(0) to be zero.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.870
Because the cosine starts
at one and its derivative

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:47.030
starts at zero.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.090
Apologies that this is
such a simple model.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:54.390
I'm just pulling this
this mass down and let go.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:58.310
I just pull it down an
amount one, I let go,

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:05.980
it oscillates forever.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:14.130
How do I draw the
motion of a single mass?

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.170
A picture is
important and we have

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.480
to think what's in the picture.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:26.150
So I think the picture should
be, maybe u in this direction

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.480
and maybe u' in this direction.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.600
So it's the u, u' plane.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.200
The position-velocity plane.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.380
Sometimes called
the phase plane.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.570
I'll just write that
word down, phase plane.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.090
And what will be
our picture here?

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:50.200
It starts there, right? u(0) is
one, no velocity, starts there.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.770
Oh, and then it
just follows cos(t).

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.210
And of course, I
know what u' is.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.540
If u is cos(t), u' is -sin(t).

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.790
Let me put that somewhere where
my picture won't run over it,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.620
up here maybe. u' is -sin(t).

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.710
Help me out.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:23.510
If as time increases,
I follow this point,

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.110
the x-coordinate is cos(t).

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.620
The y-coordinate is -sin(t).

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.530
It's a circle.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.050
It's a circle.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.830
So I just buzz along it,
because of that minus sign,

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.980
the circle goes this way around.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.370
It's a unit circle.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.970
Goes on forever.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.760
And actually cos squared
plus sine squared

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.420
is one, of course, that's why
it's a circle of radius one.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:58.450
And that represents the
total energy actually.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.390
I'm trying to draw a circle.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:07.490
Actually how would you get
your computer to draw a circle?

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.640
I'm thinking not
just one circle.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.810
I want to refresh it.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.080
I mean, I want to
follow this in time.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:23.440
So I want to draw, I want to
follow a point around a circle.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.380
Well I suppose what
you would do would be

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.740
to ask it to plot those points.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.490
That's not allowed.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:37.600
I want you to follow the
solution to the equation.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.190
I want to take that equation
whose exact solution is

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:45.950
a circle and I want to use
finite differences in time.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:48.460
So I'm going to
take finite steps.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.420
Of course that's what
the computer has to do.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.280
The computer will
take finite steps.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.310
So I'd be very happy if
those finite steps keep me

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.270
on the circle.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.730
And I'd be even happier if
it came around exactly right

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:12.910
at 2pi but it's not going to.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.450
I want finite differences.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.950
I want to replace that
differential equation

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.330
by finite differences.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.110
And when we do this
equation, we're

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.440
practically doing that
one at the same time.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:33.130
So this model will be fine.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.070
So I'm going to introduce finite
differences for this equation.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.940
And everybody,
we've been talking

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.010
about how to replace
second derivatives

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.860
by second differences.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:49.600
So that looks good.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.580
Let me write down,
maybe I can write down

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:57.420
three or four possible
finite differences.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:07.300
For u'' I think I'll write
down u_(n+1) - 2u_n + u_(n-1).

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.940
That's the second
difference that

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.290
replaces the second
derivative, divided by what?

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:20.120
What do you think goes
in the denominator now?

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.170
Square of what?

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.390
Yeah, now what's the right name?

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.480
It's going to be
something squared.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.780
What do I put down there?

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.540
The step size.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.460
I don't want to call
it delta x, right?

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.280
What should I call that?

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.970
Delta t would be
natural, delta t.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:44.350
Or h, I could again use h
just to have a shorthand.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.150
That's my second difference.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.110
It's centered, it's
the natural choice.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.230
And not the only
choice, by the way.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:55.280
Oh.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.600
If I'm an astronomer or
like, Professor Wisdom here.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:05.720
So he followed
Pluto around, right?

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.890
And discovered that Pluto
wasn't a planet, right?

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:11.030
He discovered that
the motion of Pluto

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.970
was not like, regular
like the Earth.

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:18.090
I think the Earth is regular.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.300
But Pluto has chaotic motion.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.280
So it does crazy stuff.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.010
Right.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:30.970
Well we're looking for very
periodic, circular motion here.

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:35.040
So what I was going to
say, Professor Wisdom, he

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.930
would sneer at this
second differences, right?

00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:43.020
I mean, as we'll see that's
got decent accuracy, but not

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.130
accuracy that would
allow you to follow

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:50.020
Pluto for 100 million years.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.170
But it'll do for us.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.520
We're not going 100
million years here.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.960
So now comes -u.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.550
Now, question.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.330
I'm taking this,
the u term and I'm

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.090
putting it on the other side.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.090
So mass is one.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.800
Acceleration is this.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.450
The force is -u.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:23.410
Now comes the big question.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.750
For -u, do I use
the newest value?

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.680
Do I use the middle value?

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.740
Or do I use the oldest value?

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.320
Or some combination?

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.100
If I want high
accuracy, oh, then I

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.600
go way up in these
differences and I

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:45.010
find tricky combinations
that get me above first

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.530
and second order accuracy.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.370
But let's not go there.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:53.670
So I've got to make
one of those choices.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:58.020
And that choice is going
to decide, so I mean,

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.460
this is a choice
you have to make

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.740
when you have such a problem.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.990
Where are you going
to evaluate this?

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.550
I guess one choice
jumps out as natural.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:16.750
What would you think of doing?

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:20.060
Well how many would do that one?

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.000
So those are people, that's
the conservative choice,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.550
the stable.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.510
And then, how many
would do this?

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.010
Yeah, you would do that, right.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.450
I would call that
the leapfrog choice.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:38.950
Somehow, this
second difference is

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.460
leaping over this middle point.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.750
So that would be
the leapfrog method.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:52.620
And then if I use a very
low-- to use the first value

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:58.420
would be-- So my point is those
are three different choices.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:04.810
And each one has these
questions of accuracy.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:08.690
The middle one will be more
accurate because it's centered.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.390
Each one has a
question of stability.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.440
Ah, you don't see stability yet.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.680
So that's the point of the
rest of the lecture is to see.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.210
What is this stability question?

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:30.060
The issue of speed, speed
would be, this is the slow one.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:35.010
Because it involves, I have
to bring u_(n+1) over there.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:39.140
And if I've got a system
of equations and then I,

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.750
it would take me some time.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:48.040
This would be called
an implicit method.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.770
The new u_(n+1) is only given
implicitly because it's showing

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.010
up on the right-hand side.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:56.000
I've got to move it
over to the left.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.670
If it's non-linear I've
got a system to solve.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:05.350
It's safer, but more expensive.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:11.250
But this would be
the natural choice.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:19.680
I want to get eigenvalues
into this picture.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.150
So I'm going to do the
step we often do when

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.330
we see a second order equation.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:30.290
That is, reduce it to two
first order equations.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:33.360
Can I do that and
see the same thing?

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.730
So what would be my two
first order equations.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.720
My unknowns will be u and u'.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:46.530
So it'll be first order,
the derivative of u and u'.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.690
Shall I call it v for velocity?

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.670
Let me write down, I don't
need to write this fancy.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:39:05.100
The two equations will
be, u'=v. And v' is what?

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:10.290
So u'=v sort of told me what
v was. v is the velocity,

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:12.680
the time derivative of du/dt.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.370
And now the derivative
of the velocity, now that

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.840
should reflect my true equation.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.910
So this is all
coming from u''+u=0.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:29.680
So v' is what? v' is u''.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.730
Do I want -u there?

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:39.230
Yeah, that's my equation.
v', which is u'', is -u.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.740
Good.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.800
That's my system.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.270
So I have a matrix here.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:51.670
I have a two by two system with
a matrix [0, 1; -1, 0] I guess.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:57.310
So while thinking about
difference methods-- So this,

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.880
I was thinking about a
second order equation.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.580
I went right to it.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.500
Here I'm thinking about
a first order system.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.690
A lot of problems come
in first order systems.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.460
Gas dynamics comes
as a big first order

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:16.920
system for those components
of mass, momentum, energy,

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:23.150
typically five non-linear
equations in gas dynamics.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.970
I mean, that's a very,
very serious problem,

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:28.050
how to solve those.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:32.410
Here we've got a much
simpler model problem,

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.660
linear, constant coefficients.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:40.850
But what do we do?

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:43.410
Can I propose three
possibilities here?

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:48.210
And actually they are identical
to these three possibilities.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.760
If I just switch over
to a first order system.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:41:01.180
So possibility one_
Possibility one is that u_(n+1)

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:05.470
and v_(n+1)-- So the
u_(n+1) would be,

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.820
how do I model that equation?

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:15.480
u_(n+1) is u_n + delta t*v_n.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.840
That would be a natural-- Right?

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.410
Let me just pause
there, because that's

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:27.820
meant to be the natural
forward difference.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:33.770
So I replaced u' by
u_(n+1)-u_n over delta t.

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:38.480
And I replaced v by
the value I know.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:45.010
And do you know whose name
is associated with that?

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:49.420
I'm almost going
to say his name.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.490
It's just, I replace a
differential equation

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.530
by a difference
equation where each step

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.470
I just could figure
out what the slope is

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:02.130
and I go along a straight line.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.020
Delta t further along.

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.350
Do you know his name?

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.970
Euler, Euler, right.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.980
It's Euler's method.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.530
The very first method
you would think of.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:17.400
Right?

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.870
So I'm doing the
same for v. This

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:27.880
is my position I've reached.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.894
So Euler's method
is replace this

00:42:29.894 --> 00:42:31.060
by over delta t equals -u_n.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:38.010
v_(n+1)-v_n over
delta t equals -u_n.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.940
So this is Euler's idea.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.880
Predict the new value
by a forward difference

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:50.370
starting from where the slope
of the line is this old one.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:55.870
That's the first difference
method you would think of.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:59.350
So now if I multiply up by delta
t I have a minus delta t*u_n.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:14.020
Good time to pay attention.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:18.870
This is forward Euler.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:27.340
Forward Euler.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:31.520
The time step, you
follow the derivative,

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.800
what the derivative is
at the start of the step.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.650
You follow it for a little step.

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:39.290
Ah, let me draw what
the thing would do.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:42.670
Shall I draw what
forward Euler will do?

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:43.900
So we're here.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.560
And what's our first step?

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.490
Our first step.

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:51.410
So we're starting at v
is zero at the start.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.950
So u won't change in one step.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:58.380
But u is one, so v will go down.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:04.900
I think the first step
will take us there.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.220
That point was (1, 0).

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:13.330
And I think the second
step, u came from the zero,

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.450
so it'll still be a one.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:19.780
And v came from a
zero, but minus delta.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:27.840
I think it'll just be 1-delta t.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:33.320
It's left the circle, of course.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:42.780
And what do you think happens
when I do 1,000 steps?

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.920
This is two lines in MATLAB.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.900
Just write those equations
for the next u coming

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:57.000
from the previous u starting
at (1, 0) and see what happens.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.790
And what do you think?

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:03.060
It's going to sort of go around.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.810
I mean, it's a reasonable--
Euler wasn't dumb.

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:10.750
Anything true here is the
fact that Euler was not dumb.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:13.620
He had a bunch of ideas.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.880
This wasn't his greatest.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:21.280
But it's the starting
point of any,

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.560
if you have to code some
complicated problem,

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.620
start with Euler, forward Euler.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.730
What'll happen?

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.010
It'll spiral out.

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:30.720
Exactly.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.800
It'll spiral out.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.070
And if I was an
eigenvalue person,

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:44.300
I guess which I probably am,
I would look at the, there's

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:48.320
some matrix here that's finding
the new u, v from the old u,

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.670
v. Maybe we can
even find out, write

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:57.110
above what that matrix is.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:00.120
The new u, v come
from the old u, v,

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.890
well there is the
identity matrix.

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:04.850
Here is a delta t.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:07.730
And here is our minus delta t.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:11.780
That would be my matrix.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.930
That's the forward Euler matrix.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:19.830
The growth matrix for
forward Euler is that.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:24.200
Now what do you think about
its eigenvalues before?

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:29.960
Spiral out was the right answer.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.810
If delta t is small it'll
stay close to the circle,

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:38.790
but it'll spiral out from it.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:45.590
So if we were following a
planet, it would just be off.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.310
So I can't immediately,
well you could almost

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:51.010
see the eigenvalues
of this matrix.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:54.210
What's the determinant
of that matrix?

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.910
What's the determinant of G?

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:58.510
I'm just asking you
to think through.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.310
You see a matrix like this.

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:03.630
You wonder about its eigenvalues
so you take the determinant.

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:06.480
And what do you get?

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.330
One, something bigger
than one or less than one?

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:11.420
Bigger.

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.940
So that tells me what?

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.600
Since the determinant is the
product of lambda_1*lambda_2,

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.560
whatever those guys are, at
least one of those eigenvalues

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.540
is bigger than one.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.120
This has an
eigenvalue, actually,

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:31.160
the actual eigenvalues of
this happen to be one from

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:36.050
the identity matrix and
then this guy is what was

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:41.700
our example of an imaginary
eigenvalue, i*delta t.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.330
Bigger than one
in absolute value.

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:49.090
It goes out.

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:57.020
So that's forward Euler
corresponding to that choice.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.910
Can I change to a second,
to Euler's other choice?

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.970
And you can guess
what its name is.

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:09.460
Instead of forward
Euler it's going to be?

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:14.200
Backward Euler.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.670
Euler said, if you don't like
it, I've got another one.

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:19.750
And what will happen then?

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:25.490
Backward Euler is going to
use, instead of the old value,

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:29.950
it will use the new values here.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:33.470
So these differences,
you see that this is now

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:39.400
a backward difference?

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.370
So I'm at time n+1.

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:42.910
I'm at the new time.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.620
And this goes back from that.

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:49.230
So this is at the new time and
this is a difference backward.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:52.020
And what happens now?

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:55.360
Well, we could follow
backward Euler.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.190
We could follow its first step.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:59.710
What would its first step be?

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:00.210
u_n+u_1.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:07.690
This is-- No, I can't follow
that first step so easily.

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:09.890
Help me out by just
making a guess.

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:14.260
What do you think
backward Euler does?

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.590
It spirals in.

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:22.890
Right, the cover of the book
has forward Euler, I think,

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.950
is on the cover of the textbook.

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:26.460
Spiraling out in the front.

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:31.020
But maybe the back cover
also has Euler spiraling in.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.990
So here is backward Euler.

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:36.000
And after I take
a bunch of steps

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.780
it comes back somewhere
there, but it's spiraled in.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:41.510
No good.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:47.120
Have we got one minute
for the good method?

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:52.550
You're guessing
that it's this one?

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:53.780
How does that work?

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:58.760
Actually, it's pretty neat.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.590
So my question is, where
do I evaluate these guys?

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:07.950
So this is like
forward and backward.

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:14.050
The u equation, so I
know u_n and v_n, right?

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:14.800
Everybody with me?

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.670
I've got to time in,
I know u_n and v_n,

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:22.160
the position and velocity,
approximately at point n.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.810
And I want to go n+1.

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:28.860
What I know is v_n.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.360
So that's great.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.190
But what's going to change here?

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:39.370
Now I know u_(n+1) from
the first equation.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.520
What shall I do, where
shall I evaluate u

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.160
in the second equation?

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.790
At n+1.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:47.980
Why not?

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:51.360
I know it already
from the first step,

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.180
from the forward step
with this equation.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.060
I've taken u forward.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:03.830
So I'll use that forward
value of u in the v equation.

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:08.080
So it's forward and
backward at the same time.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:16.700
And the net result if I go
back from my system of two

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.570
first order equations back
to one second order equation,

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:24.240
I'll find the centered guy.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:34.170
And what do you think happens
with that centered difference?

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:39.250
I think MATLAB would
have to show it.

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:42.370
And look in Section
2.2 for the picture

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:44.960
that shows the leapfrog method.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.270
So what do you think?

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:57.690
I'm having to depend
on my memory now.

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:01.190
It stays almost on the circle.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:05.840
I think it maybe, it stays
very close to the circle.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:11.650
And comes back almost at the
right time, but not exactly.

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:13.690
Because we have an error here.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:15.950
No, we haven't got
the real equation.

00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:19.620
We've got a difference equation.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:23.590
So maybe that's
the point to say.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:25.480
When you start with a
differential equation

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:29.890
you've got various choices.

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.430
Backward is actually safer.

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:37.600
Probably for a car crash.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.000
No, actually I think
for a car crash

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.380
they would use
forward differences

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.930
because they have
to take so many.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:47.090
Let me check on that.

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:54.430
But for our problem, this
one, leapfrog is the winner.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:56.690
Actually, if anybody
does computation

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:58.750
in computational
chemistry, I mean

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:03.070
that's a subject that uses
giant supercomputers to follow

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:07.230
molecular dynamics, to follow
what molecules are doing

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:09.770
at high speed, very high speed.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:13.410
So this, there's a giant
number multiplying that u.

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:19.160
And they use leapfrog method.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.040
I'll say a little
more Friday if I can

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:26.110
about this general subject,
because it's so important.
