00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.430
PROFESSOR STRANG: Starting
today on section 1.3,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.290
actually we'll
finish that today.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.050
And that's about the big problem
in, or the most common problem

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.270
in scientific computing,
solving a linear system.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.290
Au=b.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.750
How would you do that?

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.240
So we will certainly do
it for some examples.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.550
Like our free-fixed or
our fixed-fixed matrices.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.870
But I thought I'd just
put some comments.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.100
Often I make comments that go
beyond what specific things

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.730
we will do in detail.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.750
Certainly the
workhorse of-- if I'm

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.500
in MATLAB notation, the
workhorse would be backslash.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.230
That command is the
quick, natural way

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.790
to get the answer u.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.050
And I want to say
more about backslash.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.020
I won't be able to say
all the things it does.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.300
There's a lot built
into that command.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.140
And the MATLAB
helpdesk would give

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.470
the details of all
the different things

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.680
that backslash actually does.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.600
It looks first, can it divide
the problem into blocks,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.460
into smaller problems.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.510
It looks to see
if A is symmetric.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.640
If it's symmetric,
because of course,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.740
that would cut the work
in half because you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.270
know half the matrix
from the other half

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.140
in the symmetric case.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.730
It goes hopefully
along and eventually

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.850
gives you the answer.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.930
Okay, so I'm going to
say more about that.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.790
Because that's by elimination.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.590
The method there is elimination.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.940
I just thought I would mention
that if I had a large sparse

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.530
matrix, so I was in sparse
math MATLAB and used backslash,

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.510
it would try to
reorder the rows.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.960
Or it will try to reorder
the rows in an optimal way.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.570
Now, what would
be an optimal way?

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.560
Just so you have
an idea of what.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.910
So elimination takes
this matrix, right?

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.310
It's got all its rows.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.620
And we'll do examples.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.020
So the idea of elimination
is that it produces a zero.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.070
So let's suppose it accepts
the first row as the pivot row.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.590
And this (1, 1) entry
would be the pivot.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.020
And then how does
it use the pivot?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.980
It subtracts multiples of that
pivot row from the other rows

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.610
in order to get zeroes
in the first column.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.270
So then it has a
new matrix that's

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.460
like it's one size smaller.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.610
And then it just
continues all the way

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.180
until it gets to a
triangular matrix

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.190
with all the pivots sitting
there on the diagonal.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.240
So that's the idea
of elimination.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.220
And we'll do small examples.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.230
So why would you want
to reorder the rows?

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.560
Two reason, two good reasons
for reordering the rows.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.400
One reason which
MATLAB will always do,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.830
unless it has some
good reason not to,

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:03.960
is if that pivot is too small
compared to numbers below it

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.730
it will pick the largest and
reorder to put the largest

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.170
pivot up there.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.880
So you like large pivots.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.340
Why do you like large pivots?

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.910
Because for numerical
stability that

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.180
gives you small multipliers.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.750
If this is the biggest number
then all the multiples that you

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.890
need, the multiple
of that row that you

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:35.150
want to subtract from the other
rows will be less than one.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.750
The multiplier is, so
just let's remember,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:51.610
the multiplier is the entry to
eliminate divided by the pivot.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.020
So if that entry
to be eliminated

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.730
is smaller then the pivot, then
the multiplier's less than one

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.920
and things stay stable.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.170
So that's a picture
of elimination,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.760
a sort of first picture.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.230
And if it's sparse that means
there's a lot of zeroes.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.440
And where would we like
those zeroes to be?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.890
Where would we
like to find zeroes

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.850
to save time and use
to avoid all the steps,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.180
to avoid going
through every step.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.430
If this was already a
zero then it's there

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.360
and we don't need
to get it there.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.700
The job is already done.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.160
We can go forward.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.160
And if we have a
zero here then it's

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.120
already zero in the next
one and we don't have to do,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.820
that would be the
second pivot row,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.350
we don't have to
subtract it from this row

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.610
because a zero is already there.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.490
So we like zeroes.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.740
And sparse matrices
have a lot of them.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.870
But we only like them if
they're in the right place.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.240
And what's the right place?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.140
It's, roughly speaking,
it's the beginning of a row.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.550
So we're very happy
with, we would

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.400
like to get an ordering that
looks somehow like this.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.080
We would like to get a
bunch of zeroes in there.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.500
Well that's, I
really overdid it.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.670
Maybe we can't get that many.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.630
But my point is,
you see the point

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.990
that those are at the
beginning of the rows.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:34.270
So let's say we can't quite
get to that, but maybe

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.750
something more like that.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.480
Zero.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.450
So we get some rows starting
with zeroes and then we get

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:47.121
rows that don't.

00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:49.620
Which of course, I mean, they
were there in the first place.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.260
What we've done is move
them to the bottom.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.340
And the reason for
moving them to the bottom

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.820
is that they don't
destroy rows below them.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.000
Yeah.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.390
I didn't show how
that would happen.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.040
Suppose I had a number there.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.830
Suppose that wasn't a zero.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.540
And all these were.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.450
Then when I do that elimination
I subtract a multiple

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.130
of that row from this row.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.250
Do you see that those
zeroes will fill in?

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.730
So fill in is the bad thing
that you're trying to avoid.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.110
So in this quick
discussion of reordering

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.650
you're trying to order the rows
so that they start with zeroes

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.460
for as long as you can because
those zeroes will never

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.440
fill in.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.820
Zeroes inside a band, yes,
just to make the point again,

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.230
suppose I have a long row.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.420
Then if I have some zeroes
here, here, here, useless.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.100
Because when I go to do
elimination on these rows, when

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.710
I subtract a multiple of
that row from that row,

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.910
that zero will fill in,
it didn't help, it's gone.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.390
And this and this.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:10.440
So zeroes sort of
near the diagonal

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.070
are often going to fill in.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.150
It's zeroes at the far
left that are good.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:20.100
So that's a discussion
of a topic that

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.050
actually comes into 18.086.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.960
And so does the third words
that I thought I would just

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.820
write on the board.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.570
So this would be topic
specializing in how do you

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.420
solve large systems.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.580
And reordering with
elimination is one way.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.760
And a second approach is, I
just put these words up here

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.480
so that you've seen them.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.320
Conjugate gradient
method, that's

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.340
a giant success in solving
symmetric problems.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.750
Large symmetric problems.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:59.640
Something called multigrid
is a terrific, incomplete LU.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:06.440
People have worked hard on ideas
for solving problems so large

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.560
that this becomes too expensive.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.070
But backslash is
the natural choice.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.650
If you can do it, it's
like it's so simple.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.030
So let me focus on backslash.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.640
So backslash is the
key to talk about.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.590
Let me see, let's just think
what does backslash do?

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.150
Suppose I had two equations,
two different right-hand sides,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:40.500
b and c with the same matrix
A. Would I solve them,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.600
would I do u=A\b and
then separately A\c?

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.890
No.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.800
If I had two equations
with the same matrix,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.310
there's a big saving in, suppose
I have two equations, two,

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.840
well, can I put it?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.080
I'll make a matrix.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.710
I mean this is what
MATLAB would always do.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:11.070
Put those two right-hand
sides into a matrix.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.700
Then backslash is
happy with that.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.890
That backslash command
would solve both equations.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.210
It would give you the
answer then, would be,

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.290
it would be two parts to it.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.310
What would be the
first column of u then?

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.110
So, do you see what I have now?

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.510
I have a square matrix
A times an unknown u.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.260
And I've got two
right-hand sides.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.400
The point is this often happens.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:45.260
If you're doing, say,
a design problem.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.980
You might try different designs.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.300
So those different designs give
you different right-hand sides.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.410
And then you have
a problem to solve.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.710
What's the response
to those designs?

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.900
What are the displacements,
what happens?

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.270
So you want to solve
with two right-hand sides

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:10.310
and the point is you don't want
to go through the elimination

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.810
process on A twice.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.350
That's crazy.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.080
You see how that
elimination process on A

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.430
has this, what I described
here, didn't look at b.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.140
I didn't even get to the
right-hand side part.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.330
I was dealing with the expensive
part, which is the matrix A.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.790
So we don't want to
pay that price twice.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:37.740
And therefore backslash
is all set up.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.010
So what's the first
column of u then?

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.820
It's A\b.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.750
And now what's
another way to write,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:48.560
a more mathematical
way to write A?

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.020
What's the answer to Au=b.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.120
It's u equals A
inverse b, right?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.020
That's the answer
in the first column

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.770
and A inverse c would be the
answer in the second column.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.320
So it would produce
those answers.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.130
Backslash will
produce the answer

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.660
to the first equation and the
answer the second equation.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.240
Will it do that by
finding A inverse?

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.150
No.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.000
A inverse, for
multiple reasons, we

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.380
don't often compute,
if it's 3 by 3, 4 by 4,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.960
then it's not a bad idea to
see what A inverse looks like.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.430
We'll do that
actually, because it's

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.510
very enlightening if
the matrix is small,

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.310
you can see what's going on.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:42.310
But for a large problem
we don't want A inverse.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.920
We want the answer.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.680
And backslash goes
to the answer.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:53.000
It doesn't get there
by computing A inverse.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.650
And our examples will show how.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:05.600
So I'm giving A inverse a
little bad comments right now.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.360
So I maybe should
finish that sentence

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.030
and then you'll
see me turn around

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.750
and compute the darn thing.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:16.950
But why do we not use A inverse?

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.250
Two reasons.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.630
One is it's more expensive.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.920
If I have to compute A
inverse and multiply by b,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.170
that's taking too long.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:32.780
Second reason is A inverse could
easily be a full, dense matrix.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.210
All non-zero.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.640
Where A itself was
like, tridiagonal.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.570
So if A is tridiagonal,
all the numbers we need

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:46.510
are there in three diagonals,
we don't want A inverse,

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.270
you'll see, A inverse is full.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.290
So two reasons for
not using A inverse.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:56.990
Takes too long in the first
place even in the good case

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.630
and often our matrix
A has got lots

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:07.750
of zeroes that are not there in
A inverse so we've wasted time.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.660
Nevertheless let
me say something

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:16.140
about A inverse
on the next board.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:20.260
I don't know if you ever thought
about the inverse matrix.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.540
Let me ask you this question.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:33.390
Suppose I use the command
A\I. What's that doing?

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.700
That's putting the identity
on the right-hand side

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.500
instead of a single
vector b or instead

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.950
of two vectors b and
c I'm now putting n.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.340
That's okay.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.290
Backslash will work with that.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.590
That's a shorthand for solving.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.150
This solves all these equations.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.190
A, it'll get my different
answers, u_1, u_2.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:04.750
It'll get n different answers
from the n right-hand sides,

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:09.520
the columns of I. Let
me take to be three.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.440
0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:19.720
But I'll take n to be three.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.230
That's the identity.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.850
So this solves that equation.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:29.070
A\I will output
u, will output u.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.350
And here's the question.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.750
What have I got?

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:38.450
If you have a matrix A,
square matrix and of course

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:44.830
you have to create I as
eye(3), that I would be,

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.860
this would be eye(3).

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.070
Cleve Moler's lousy pun.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.120
So what would I get?

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.810
What would I get?

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.310
The inverse, yes.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.840
I'd get the inverse.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.540
I'd get the inverse matrix.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.890
A backslash-- why's that?

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.900
Because what matrix
solves, what's

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.970
the solution u to A
times something equal I?

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:20.290
The solution to--
This equation is Au=I.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.370
The solution to that equation
is the inverse matrix.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.250
u will be A inverse.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.530
So that is a pretty,
I mean, that's pretty,

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.750
if I wanted A inverse
that's a good way to do it.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.410
Other ways to do it
would be inv(A) in MATLAB

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:44.980
and other ways, but this is
about as good as you get.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:51.410
Do you see that you get the
inverse matrix that way?

00:16:51.410 --> 00:17:03.340
And it's worth giving
some words to that fact.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.890
How would I describe this?

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:10.410
This is a set of three
different problems.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:18.170
I would describe [1, 0, 0], that
right-hand side, as an impulse.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.230
That's an impulse.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:26.580
A delta vector with an impulse
in the first component.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.250
I'd call that an impulse
in the second component.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.610
I'd call that an impulse
in the third component.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:37.110
So my inputs are three
impulses and my outputs

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.990
are u_1, u_2, u_3.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.380
What words might I use?

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.400
I could call those
impulse response.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.820
If I were in Course
6, I certainly would.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.570
These would be impulses,
these would be the responses

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.410
to that impulse from our system.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.760
So those are impulse responses
but in linear algebra

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.710
the words I would
use, u_1, u_2, u_3

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.830
are the columns of
A inverse, right?

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.160
That's what we just
said. u_1, u_2, u_3.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.090
So the columns of--
Let me write that down.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:24.020
The columns of A inverse
are the responses,

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:33.430
the u's, the solutions to
the impulses, to n impulses.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:41.520
And these are the
columns of I. Do you see?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.280
Nothing I've said so
far is deep or anything.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.570
But it's just, this
comes up so much

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.320
that it's nice to have different
ways to think about this.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.430
And actually, yeah, if
I had to solve by hand,

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:05.680
if I had to find the inverse
by hand I would use elimination

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.080
on this system of equations.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.770
I would take A and put
the identity next to it.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.210
I would do elimination a lot.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.610
Actually I'll put that in one.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:24.610
If I had to find the inverse I
would take this block matrix.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.060
Is that the first block
matrix we've seen?

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:34.690
Block matrices are really,
you should just get familiar,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.890
when you're getting
familiar with matrices,

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.590
they often come in blocks.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.320
So here's a three
by three block,

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.590
here's a three by three
block, the whole matrix

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.530
is three by six.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.720
I can go through the
elimination steps on it.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.640
If I really go
haywire on elimination

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.280
and keep going and going and
going all the way until A gets

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.330
to the identity,
so I do elimination

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.890
and I get it triangular
then I even clean out up

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.680
above the pivots and then I
change all the pivots to one,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.490
I can get all the
way to the identity

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.450
if the matrix is invertible.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.950
And what do you think will
show up in the right half?

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.690
A inverse, yeah.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.380
So A inverse will show up there.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.920
So in 18.06 I would
explain, go through examples

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:35.070
of this computation just
to see A inverse appear.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.010
There's no reason for us
to go through long examples

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.780
like that.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.630
Maybe one three by three
would be worth doing,

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:49.900
but in the big picture we're
going to use backslash.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.280
Questions or discussion.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.520
So this is the sort of overall
picture about the inverse.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.660
Well this is about the inverse.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.120
This was about elimination.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.570
I've gotta take a little
time on elimination.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.530
No it's just too important.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.960
It's sort of straightforward
and mechanical

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.420
but it's like, too
important to blow away.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:23.420
So let me remove that and
put something better there.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.970
So now I'm talking
about elimination.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.460
I'm talking about one equation.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.840
I'm back to Au=b.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.710
Au=b.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:41.650
And notice I'm using the
letter A rather than K or one

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.050
of our special letters
because right now I don't know

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.640
that that's a special matrix.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.880
In a minute the
example I do will

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.600
be one of our special
matrices of course,

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.690
and then I'll use its letter.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.400
Just a word, though.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.920
I thought I would take-- you're
getting a lot of big picture

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.780
here for a minute and then
we'll get into the details.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.740
I thought I would
just, like, this

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.880
is an occasion to look ahead.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.870
To say a word about the big
picture of linear algebra.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:22.040
It's got four major
problems, linear algebra.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.270
And there are four commands
to solve those problems.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.570
And those commands,
why not know?

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.590
So those commands are: lu.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:36.970
I'm speaking about MATLAB
notation but Octave, Scilab,

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:42.950
Python, R, all other
would have those.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.060
Would do these same things.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:53.070
So lu is the command
that produces this,

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.110
but I didn't say
what that is yet.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.080
Ooh.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.960
So that's my job, right.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.090
What does this mean?

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.770
What's up there?

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.480
So, okay, to nobody's
surprise MATLAB thought, okay,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.110
lu was a good letter for that.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:15.680
And what did MATLAB think of as
a good letter for the command

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.900
that does this? qr.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:29.870
So if I did lu(A) or qr(A)
I would get-- I mean,

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.170
this is sometimes associated
with the names of Gram-Schmidt.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.990
It makes vectors orthogonal.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.660
Not to worry about this stuff.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.980
You can like, close your
eyes for a moment here.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.110
lu is the first command and
that's what today's about.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:51.740
qr is the key command for
least squares problems.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.780
Maybe the biggest application
of rectangular matrices,

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.810
I'm sure that's the big.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.330
Eigenvalues, do you
know about eigenvalues?

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:04.860
Well we'll just name
the command eig(A).

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.980
And the singular
value decomposition,

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:18.050
which you may never have heard
of, but you will, is svd(A).

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.560
Can I leave that?

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.530
It's in the videotape now.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:32.440
And my point is that when
we've spoken about those four,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.500
we really have got
numerical linear algebra

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:42.120
and a lot of pure linear
algebra explained.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.760
These are the four big ones.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.700
And I guess what I'm
saying is, the four

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:53.800
big problems of linear algebra
turn out to, a good way

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:59.220
to describe the answer is as
a factorization of the matrix.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.200
This is a factor.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.160
So now let me say
what this one is.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.490
I start with a matrix and
what elimination is really

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.030
doing, if you look to
see what is it doing,

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.930
it's producing a
lower triangular

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.330
times an upper triangular.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.300
Let's go directly to that.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.910
Let me go directly to that.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.390
Let me take an example.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:22.790
So here's my matrix.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:34.310
Well, I don't have to call it
A because you recognize it.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.000
So what's our name
for that matrix?

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.140
T. T because the top
boundary condition is free.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.200
Oh, that reminds me.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.710
Some good comments after class
Friday brought out something

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.900
that I sloughed over.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:58.210
That the free-fixed matrix,
the free-fixed problem

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.340
is usually one unknown
larger than the fixed-fixed.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.370
Because remember the fixed-fixed
problem had both ends fixed.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.410
They were not unknowns.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:12.340
The only unknowns were one,
two, three to n in the middle.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:16.880
But people noticed when I was
talking about the free boundary

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.640
condition that u_0 came into
it and u_0 is not known.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.120
So really, the free
boundary condition like,

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.040
has an extra unknown, an extra
row and column in the matrix

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.600
and that's correct.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.620
We'll see later in
Fourier transforms

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.190
cosine matrices are one size
bigger than sine matrices.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.170
The cosine matrices
are free-free

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.880
and the sine matrices
are fixed-fixed.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:54.670
And now here we're
at free-fixed.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:59.060
I want to do elimination
on that matrix.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.680
And while I'm at it,
we'll find the inverse.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.280
But let's do elimination.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.310
Just on that matrix.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:15.660
Just to see what this
L and U stuff is.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.480
What do we do?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.980
The first pivot is?

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.740
One, it's fine.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.090
Not going to worry about that.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.150
We'll use it now.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.790
So how do I use it?

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.545
I use a pivot, now
listen because here

00:27:32.545 --> 00:27:36.350
is a convention here, I'm
going to use the word subtract.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:41.030
You would say add that
row to that row, right?

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.030
Because you want
to get a zero here.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.490
Forgive me for making
it sound harder.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.700
I'm going to say subtract
because I like subtraction.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.650
Subtract minus one of
that row, my multiplier

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.480
is minus one here.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.210
I'm going to say subtract minus
one of that row from that.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.200
Same thing.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.620
You'll say okay.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.640
No problem.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.110
Let's just do it.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:14.600
So there's the pivot row and
now when I-- shall I just add?

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:23.830
When I add that to that, or
as my superego is saying,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.460
subtract minus one
of that from that.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.370
What do I get?

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:33.140
I get the zero, the
one and the minus one.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.500
And then what do I get?

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.270
What's the multiplier?

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:42.590
So let's just put these l,
these multipliers, the l_(2, 1).

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.450
That's the multiplier.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.330
2, 1 refers to row
two, column one.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.870
And this step got the zero
in row two, column one.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.330
And what was the
multiplier that did it?

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:58.060
It's the number that I
multiplied row one by

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.820
and subtracted from row
two, so it was minus one.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.410
What's l_(3,1)?

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:10.250
What's the multiplier that
produces a zero in the three,

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.800
row three, column one position?

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.770
It's zero.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.320
I take zero of this
row away from this row

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.460
because it's zero already.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.540
So I'm not going to change, that
row won't change and l_(3,1)

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.380
was zero.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:35.080
Now I know the next pivot.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.890
I'm ready to use it.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.040
I want to get a zero
below it because I'm

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.580
aiming at this
upper triangular U.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.060
And what's the multiplier now?

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.810
And what's its number?

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.670
What's the multiplier number?

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:55.000
3, 2 because I'm trying to
fix row three, column two.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.560
And what do I multiply
this by and subtract

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.540
from this to make it zero?

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:05.470
It's negative one again.
negative one, right.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.390
It's negative one.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.670
Sorry.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.320
Right.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.320
And now what happens
when I do that?

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.370
Can I just do it in place here?

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:19.310
Forgive me if I just
add that to that.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:25.240
And I'll get zero and one.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.929
And now what do I know at this
point, what have I learned?

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:32.470
The most important
thing I've learned

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.930
is the matrix is invertible.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.580
Because the pivots
one, one, and one,

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.710
well they're all
here on the diagonal.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.730
This is my matrix U. That's
my upper triangular matrix.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.660
And-- yeah, of course?

00:30:48.660 --> 00:31:03.150
I'm subtracting
from this, so I've

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:06.860
got the two is there,
yeah, yeah, that's right.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:11.540
So the two is sitting there
and I'm subtracting minus one

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:16.800
of that row from it and that
would mean taking, yeah, yeah.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.200
Right.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.827
That would mean I'm
subtracting one from the two

00:31:20.827 --> 00:31:21.660
and getting the one.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.710
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.410
So the row, the
typical entry is,

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:28.870
the typical result is:
the row you have minus

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.380
l times the pivot row.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.650
The row you have minus the
multiplier times the pivot row.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:39.690
That's the operation that
elimination lives on.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.410
Elimination does
that all the time.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.800
It's one of the basic
linear algebra subroutines.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.610
B L A S.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:54.710
Now, this is my U. So that's
the goal of elimination,

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.000
get it upper triangular.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.770
And the reason is, you can solve
upper triangular systems really

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.480
fast.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:08.940
These multipliers l, l_(2,1),
and so on, they and go

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.420
into the L matrix.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.010
And now, let me just say
it here that in a way,

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:20.820
that example is too beautiful.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.080
Seldom am I sorry to see an
example come out beautifully,

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.320
but why do I say this
is too beautiful?

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.300
It's not typical.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.270
If I had other numbers here, I
would get to other numbers here

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:37.930
and what would be the
difference, typically?

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:44.640
The pivots wouldn't be all ones.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.140
That's what's too beautiful
here, but let's go with it.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.810
I mean, it was worth it because
everything came out simple.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:56.450
But the pivots for
another problem, ooh,

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:03.000
let me just do a
second problem here.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.920
I'll do the fixed-fixed guy.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.620
Okay, so let's just do
elimination on that.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.730
That's the first pivot.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:12.520
Subtract.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:17.471
Now what's the multiplier now?

00:33:17.471 --> 00:33:18.720
You're not as quick as MATLAB.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.080
MATLAB is ahead of you.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:26.120
So the multiplier is -1/2.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.700
So the multiplier
is, l_(2,1) is -1/2.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.470
l_(3,1) will again be
zero and let's use it,

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.860
so it knocks that guys out.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.850
And what did that
number come out to be?

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:40.550
Do you remember?

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.240
That was 3/2.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.270
I think we looked at that once.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.990
And that would be all the same.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:52.310
And then the next multiplier,
l_(3,2) will be negative 2/3

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:56.280
because when I multiply that
by 2/3 it gives me the negative

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:02.200
one and then I subtract and
it kills this and I get 4/3.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.400
I just did that quickly.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:11.730
And my main point was the
pivots are on the diagonal.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.910
They're not all ones now.

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:15.490
So this is a more typical one.

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:24.220
This is, again our U.
And our L matrix will be,

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.220
oh, oh, that's the point.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.200
That these l's,
these multipliers

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.900
fit right into a lower
triangular matrix.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.200
All these multipliers,
and we'll put ones

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.840
on the diagonal of that guy
and these lower triangular ones

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.490
will fit in just right
perfectly in there.

00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:51.590
Over here the L would be,
let me construct the L.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.750
Ones on the diagonal
representing

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.708
the pivot rows that stayed
put and minus one, zero,

00:34:59.708 --> 00:35:10.020
and minus one as the multipliers
that-- So this was L,

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:16.150
the multipliers that we used.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.350
One more.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:22.870
We're doing lots of good
stuff here and it's not deep,

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:29.450
but it's-- Suppose the
matrix had been singular.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:34.210
We have to realize, okay, this
elimination method is great.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.940
But it can break down and
it's going to break down,

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.630
it has to break down somehow
if the matrix is singular.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:46.110
Now what's our example of
a singular matrix here?

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:50.420
The matrix, this is free-fixed
and that by fixing one

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.190
support it wasn't singular,
but if I want to make it

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.610
singular, what'll I take?

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.210
Free-free.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.390
Free-free matrix.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:04.170
So can I, if I had thought
to bring colored chalk,

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:08.400
I'll just erase for a
moment for the bad case.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.020
The bad case would be free-free.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:16.430
And how would it show up
as bad in elimination.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:21.810
How does a singular
matrix reveal itself

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.390
as elimination goes forward?

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:29.776
Because you can't
tell at the beginning.

00:36:29.776 --> 00:36:30.900
What would have gone wrong?

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:35.280
We would have had a zero there.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.540
We had a two that
dropped to one.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.310
But if we start with a
one, it'll drop to zero.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.580
That would have
been a zero there.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:49.460
The matrix would not
have had three pivots.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.070
This upper triangular
matrix is singular, no good.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.780
And that tells us back there
that the original matrix

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.530
is singular, no good.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:04.230
So if I can't get to
three pivots somehow,

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:09.990
the matrix'll be singular and
that's an example that is.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.870
And MATLAB would immediately
tell us, of course.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:17.510
So let's go back to the good
case for the main point.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:19.100
The good case for
the main point.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:26.050
So the good case
was three pivots.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.110
In fact it was extra
good because they all

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.030
turned out to be ones.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:36.410
Now, oh, now we're ready for LU.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.120
Here's the magic.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.580
And I'm not giving a proof.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:48.300
The magic is that the result
U, if I multiply the multiplier

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:53.640
matrix L times
the result U, I'll

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:59.500
bring back A. I'll bring
back A. So let me just see.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:05.100
If I multiply L by U, so
this is now L times U,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.500
maybe you can see that
I get A. So what is U?

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:15.890
I just have to copy it.
[1, 1,  1; -1, -1, 0].

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:22.900
I could fill in the zeroes
but I know they're there.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.210
That's L times U.
And sure enough,

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.620
if I do the multiplication,
this-- How would

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.940
you to that multiplication?

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.970
I would say this is one of
the first row when I see that.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.790
1, 0, 0 multiplying these.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.220
I'd say get one
of the first row.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:41.630
That's correct in A. Here I
would say this is minus one

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.670
of the first row, plus
one of the second row,

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:48.330
and sure enough it's
the right part of A.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:50.820
And this is minus one
of the second row,

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.460
plus one of the third row,
and sure enough it's the right

00:38:53.460 --> 00:39:00.620
third row of A. I get A. And
that's when elimination goes

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.870
through with no zero
pivots, no problems,

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:10.620
just a bunch of multipliers,
then that wonderful description

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:15.170
of it, A=LU is correct.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.140
I don't know how
many that's new to.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.270
I should maybe
have thought ahead.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:22.640
How many have seen
like, L times U before?

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.420
Just to give me an idea?

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.020
Quite a few.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.970
Okay.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:31.850
So it's terrific.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.330
Oh, here I would
get L times U. Now

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:38.380
this is like a little more
interesting because the pivots

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:43.800
were not ones.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:49.780
So that's my matrix U. And
here's my matrix L, right?

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.710
Okay, big point.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:56.650
Because we're so interested in
symmetric matrices and this one

00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:00.770
in particular, or that one,
symmetric matrices are good.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:05.490
Now, I'm unhappy
about one aspect.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:10.470
So now there's just
one part of this.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:14.510
This was great, we got three
non-zero pivots, we got to U,

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:18.170
we got the multiplier
matrix all fine

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.740
and we would be ready
for the right-hand side

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.231
and we would be ready
for two right-hand sides,

00:40:24.231 --> 00:40:26.480
we would even be ready for
all three right-hand sides,

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.580
whatever.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.660
But I have one criticism.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:39.950
The matrix A which was
our K, this was really K,

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:40.780
was symmetric.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.040
That was the very first
thing you did, told me

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.490
on the very first day.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.670
And now it's equal to L
times U, but what's happened?

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.250
The symmetry is lost.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:56.100
Somehow the L has
ones on the diagonal,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.130
the U as we have it has
pivots on the diagonal,

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:01.860
now the pivots are not all ones.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.630
So you see the symmetry
of the problem got lost,

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.970
and that shouldn't happen.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.920
And there ought to
be a way to get back.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.530
Okay.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.390
And now I want to describe the
way to get back to symmetry.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.130
So LU doesn't keep the symmetry.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.200
L has ones, U has pivots.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.370
Different.

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:29.470
But a very simple idea will
bring back the symmetry.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:37.430
That is peel off the pivots
into a diagonal matrix.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:40.100
In other words,
there's a matrix,

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.500
I'll call it D, D for diagonal.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.940
I'll divide those
numbers out of each row.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.240
And can I just do that?

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.110
So I'm just going
to write this U

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.520
as a product of this
diagonal D where I'm going

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.460
to be dividing the two out.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.040
So when I divide the
two out from that row

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.690
I'm left with 1, -1/2, 0.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:10.470
And when I divide
3/2, the pivot then,

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:13.410
it makes that pivot
into a one and what

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.930
does it produce for that guy?

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:22.480
When I divide 3/2, when I divide
that -1 by 3/2, what do I get?

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:28.330
I get negative, division will
be 2/3, I'll get a negative 2/3.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:32.960
And now, on the last row I'm
dividing that row by 4/3.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.210
When I divide that row by
4/3, what row do I get here?

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.680
[0, 0, 1].

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.940
Because I've made the pivots
one, well they're not pivots.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.730
What I've done is
separate out the pivots.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:51.310
So I've made the diagonal ones
just by separating it out.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:58.790
And what's happened?

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:01.980
My goal was to get
back some symmetry that

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.880
was there at the start.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:10.430
Now so I have a pivot matrix
D, and what's that matrix?

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.930
You could say,
well, it's the rest.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.640
But that's not what
I'm looking for.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.920
What is it?

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.350
Can everybody have a look at it?

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.220
I can't raise it.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:26.950
If you look at what we
got there, what is it?

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:29.945
What's the right
name to give it?

00:43:29.945 --> 00:43:30.820
L transpose, exactly!

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.290
That's the right name.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.400
L transpose.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.200
So what am I concluding then?

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.170
I'm concluding that, let's
see, where shall I put this?

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.350
And it'll come back to it.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:49.050
Well, here we had just to
show it wasn't an accident,

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.610
here we had L L
transpose and what

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:56.970
was the pivot matrix in this
too beautiful problem case?

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.630
It was the identity.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.530
So we didn't notice it.

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.600
So can I squeeze
in the identity?

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.580
That's the pivot matrix there.

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.810
But and again, we had
L times L transpose.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.440
The beauty was there,
the symmetry was there.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.920
And now what's the usual thing?

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:21.180
So really I'm completing
this to one more thought.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.700
In that case when
A is symmetric.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.940
I'm completing, I have the
L. I'm factoring out the D.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.730
And what's left is L transpose.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:43.540
I hope you like LDL^T.
Seeing a matrix on one side

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:47.230
and the transpose
on the other side,

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:50.960
the matrix L at the left and L
transpose at the right is just

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.730
right.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:45:08.330
So the point of
symmetric case we have,

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:12.030
and I'll use the
letter K rather than A

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.950
because now we're getting the
matrix that's more special.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:18.060
It's that K or
it's this T or it's

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.750
any other symmetric matrix.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:25.850
The elimination leads
to, uses multipliers L

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:29.810
and if I factor out
the pivot matrix

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:33.250
then the other part
is L transpose.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:36.910
We've seen that just by example.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.560
By two examples.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.420
Now I want to just look at that.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:50.420
Because this that describes not
only the result of elimination

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:56.840
which is the key operation,
but it also keeps the symmetry.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:03.500
In fact every matrix of
that sort is symmetric.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:07.930
No, yeah, that's important.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:13.140
This is sure to be symmetric.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:21.980
We will often see matrices
multiplied by their transpose.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.210
So what I'm saying is
that if you gave me

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:30.160
any matrix L, any diagonal
matrix D, and then

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.570
the transpose of L, if
I multiplied those out,

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.980
I would get a symmetric matrix.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.150
And going the other way, if I
started with a symmetric matrix

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.810
and I did elimination
and got an L,

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:44.530
then the D factoring out
would leave me L transpose.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:48.660
So what you've
seen by example is

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.540
what will happen all the time.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:57.050
Now why is that
matrix symmetric?

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:02.410
Here we get a chance to show
the power of matrix notation,

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:03.580
really.

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.950
I just think that if I have
any matrix L, in this case

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.210
it happened to be lower
triangular, but if I have

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:14.580
any matrix L and I have a
nice, symmetric diagonal guy

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.610
in the middle and I
have the transpose

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.600
of this matrix on
the other side I

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:25.220
think the result is a symmetric
matrix when I multiply.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:33.090
So it's these symmetric
factorizations

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:36.170
that we're getting to and
are important problems

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:39.120
because our important
problems are symmetric.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:42.830
Ok, why is that sure
to be symmetric?

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:45.940
Suppose I asked
you as a exercise,

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:51.730
prove that L times a diagonal
times L transpose is always

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:55.230
a symmetric matrix.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:57.370
How could you do that?

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.480
How could you do that?

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.300
You could certainly create
an example that did it

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.530
and check it out,
multiply, it would work.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:11.920
But we want to see that this
is going to be true always.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.580
So how would you do that?

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.860
I guess, let me get started.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.860
I would take its transpose.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.330
If I want to show
something's symmetric,

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.880
I transpose it and see if I
get the same matrix again.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.050
So let me take the
transpose of this.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.040
So I'm answering, Why is
it sure to be symmetric?

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.550
So let me take K transpose.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:40.080
So this is the
transpose of, I have

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.900
K equals something times
something times something,

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.510
A times B times
C, you could say.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:53.600
If I transpose a
matrix, how can I

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:59.810
create transposes
out of A, B and C.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:02.340
Do you remember what happens?

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.280
They reverse the order.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.710
It's like inverses.

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:14.360
Transposes and inverses
both have that key rule.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.810
When you have a product
and you invert it,

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.300
they come in the opposite order.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.180
When you transpose it, they
come in the opposite order.

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:26.060
So let me try put these
separate transposes

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:31.380
in the opposite order.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.410
So I've used the most
important fact there.

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:43.740
Which is just a fact about
transposing a product.

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.910
Okay, what have I got now?

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:50.700
What's L transpose transposed?

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.500
It's L, great.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.290
What's L transpose L transposed?

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:57.680
Nothing but L. Transpose
twice and I'm back to L.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.030
What about D transpose?

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:04.350
Same as D. Because D was
symmetric, in fact diagonal.

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:08.730
So what have I learned?

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.590
The proof is done.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:13.080
I've got K back again.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.830
This was the original K. So I've
learned that K transpose is K.

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:21.210
So you're going to
see time after time,

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:24.510
let me just put
these things there,

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:28.960
you're going to see an A
transpose times an A. That's

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:33.730
the most important, most highly
important multiplication.

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:36.110
Take a matrix,
maybe rectangular,

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.100
multiply by A transpose.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:43.220
So this matrix is
certainly square

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:47.130
because A could be m by n.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:51.010
And then A transpose
would be n by m

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:55.460
and the result would be n by n.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.150
So it's certainly square.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.500
But now what's the new
property we now know?

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.280
It's symmetric.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.300
It's symmetric because
if I transpose it,

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.880
the transpose of A
will go on this side,

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.990
the double transpose
will go on this side,

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:16.960
but the double transpose
is A again, so symmetric.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.090
So I'm plugging away here
on symmetric matrices

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:30.970
because they're just-- yeah,
what does symmetry mean in,

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:42.000
yeah, can I just come back
to this idea of responses?

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:50.090
And by the way, if
this was symmetric,

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.930
would its inverse be symmetric?

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:54.690
The answer is yes.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:59.370
If a matrix is symmetric,
its inverse is symmetric.

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:04.960
These symmetric matrices
are a fantastic family.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.700
So I could add that to this.

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:17.460
K inverse will also symmetric
without having yet said why.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.810
But maybe in words, I'll
just say a few words here

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:27.260
at the end.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:31.230
So what's a typical entry?

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:37.590
Say the (2, 1) entry, just to
carry on with this language one

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.310
more moment.

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:43.000
This is A inverse here.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.510
Now the (2, 1)
entry in the inverse

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:53.280
is an impulse is in the first,
the first mass, whatever

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.650
gets an impulse.

00:52:56.650 --> 00:53:01.100
And that is the response
of the second mass.

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:06.440
The response in position two
to the impulse in position one.

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.660
Now my matrix is
symmetric, thinking

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.580
about symmetric matrices here.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.680
So what about here?

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.730
Here, if I take the
impulse in position two

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:20.920
and look at the response
in position one,

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.670
so do you see the difference?

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:24.800
In general, those
could be different.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:30.000
This is the response at position
two to an impulse at one.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.870
This is the response at
one to an impulse at two.

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:37.330
You see that I'm
multiplying those columns

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:38.690
and getting these columns.

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:42.200
And what's the point
about symmetry?

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.590
Those are the same.

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:48.420
Symmetry is expressing
this physical meaning

00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:53.180
that the response at
i, to an impulse at j

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:58.390
is the same as the response
at j to an impulse at i.

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:03.970
And that's sort of, that's
such an important property,

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.530
you want to notice it.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:09.910
And it goes into symmetry.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:14.910
So many, many problems will be
symmetric and then some won't.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:17.870
We'll have to admit this
won't cover everything,

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:22.150
but it covers such an
important and beautiful part.

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:29.290
So that's today's lecture
on LU elimination,

00:54:29.290 --> 00:54:34.160
solving linear
systems, and then let's

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:40.100
move forward to understanding
the actual inverses.
