00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.940
PROFESSOR STRANG: So this is
review session number five,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.530
I guess it is.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.310
And it comes before
an exam next Tuesday,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.110
and actually there'll be a
further review session number

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.250
six on Monday, right
before the exam.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.360
So maybe today we would,
there's a homework problem set

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.490
on Chapter 2, mostly
the oscillating masses

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.680
and springs and today's
lecture that you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.870
see traces of, networks.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.730
And masses and springs
also the static case.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.840
So I'm open as
always to questions.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.200
Yes please, thank you?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.670
AUDIENCE: 2.2 number six.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.080
PROFESSOR STRANG:
2.2, number six.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.731
OK.

00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:25.230
Yeah.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.270
So this is, and of course you
understand that, so I'm happy,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.420
that's a good
question to discuss.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.720
And maybe number
seven people well

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.000
have something to say about.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.100
Good.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.310
So that just fine, so let
me start right in on those.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.470
So, number six is
the fact, I mean

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.870
everybody understands that
when energy is conserved,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.590
that's an important thing.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.950
And so the question is first
when is energy conserved

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.400
in the differential equations?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.980
In the equation we're
trying to solve?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.540
And if it is, then
we want to know,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.900
we would like to choose
difference methods that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.710
also conserve energy.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.060
They may not be exactly
right, they may not be exactly

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.760
at a right point on this circle,
if we're in that model problem,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.710
but still on the circle.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.850
So, and the point is that
the trapezoidal method does

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.350
stay on the circle, and
of course the differential

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.110
equation stays on the circle.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.660
Can I, so, and I put quite
a bit into this problem six.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:52.440
So this is 2.2.6, and and let
me try say something about that,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.610
OK.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.430
So, first of all, there's the
continuous problem. du/dt=Au.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.810
When does that conserve energy?

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.780
And then there's the
discrete problem,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.880
which we know that Euler's
doesn't conserve energy,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.660
because we've seen it, the
computer shows you right away.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.200
It spirals up from
the circle, it

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.140
spirals in, or forward
and backward, or whatever.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.960
But trapezoidal method, is
that the one that turns out

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.010
to be well?

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.390
OK, so it refers to equation
24 as the trapezoidal method,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.000
and let me try to
follow that notation.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:45.480
Yep. the trapezoidal
method is this one.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.220
Did we get music there for
the trapezoidal method?

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.820
OK. u_(n+1) equal
(I+A*delta t/2)u_n.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.230
OK.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.530
Right.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.470
OK.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.560
So that, and actually
problem seven,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.110
that you maybe want
to discuss too,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.060
is the question of how
accurate this is compared

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.600
to the differential equation.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.370
Everybody should see that
this really came from,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.100
the original way to look at
this was (u_(n+1)-u_n)/delta t,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.440
that approximated
the derivative,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.000
equals A and then I'm
taking half at u--

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.060
at the new time and
half at the old time.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.520
So it's got that centering.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.040
That we suspect will give
us a little extra accuracy.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.370
OK.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.770
So two questions then.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.980
One was the stability,
so problem six

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:06.930
was the energy conserved,
and problem 2.2.7,

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.050
if I anticipate it, is
the order of accuracy.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.290
So these are both
topics that are

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.960
extremely important in
choosing a difference method.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.290
We would like to know first
when is energy conserved there?

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.570
What differential equations
have conserved energy?

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.160
Physically we kind of
can see them coming.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.730
If a physical universe
is not being-- Somehow,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.970
lots of physical problems, we
see those masses and springs

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.550
oscillating, and we
say OK, nothing's

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.270
coming in from outside,
how could-- Energy

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.950
there would be the sum of the
kinetic energy of the masses,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.890
and the potential
energy in the springs.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.040
So energy passes
between kinetic,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.160
when the mass is zooming
past equilibrium,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.260
and potential energy, when the
mass is stretching the spring.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.030
So we've got two cases.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.540
And we would hope, and
this trapezoidal method

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.280
comes through, that
energy is conserved.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.390
So can I just begin
with this one?

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.010
Maybe I always ought to say,
because you guys are also

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:37.150
thinking about the quiz.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.010
So, for example, this
question about how

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.870
to find the order of accuracy,
I'll speak about that.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.460
but let me just say
that's not something

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.270
that we've done in enough
detail that I would

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.220
expect you to be
quick on the quiz

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.700
and just be able to do it out.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.260
I'll try to choose
questions on the exam

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.180
that you really have
had more practice with.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.700
But this is certainly important,
so it was that definitely right

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.060
to put on the homework.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.630
And this is important.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:20.930
OK, so let me tackle this one.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.490
First the differential equation.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:29.820
So by energy here I'm meaning
just the length of u squared.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.700
So now I'm looking at
energy conserved, OK.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.310
So I'm hoping energy
conserved would

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:44.220
mean that the derivative
of u squared was zero.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.280
That's what conserving
energy would mean.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.040
And my question is
which differential

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.490
equations-- What's the
condition on A, in other words?

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.400
How would I recognize
from this matrix A

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.390
that I have this
interesting property?

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.960
OK.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.170
So, let me just show
you what I would do.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:15.340
Another way to write u
squared is u transposed u.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.950
These are vectors, of course.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.270
So what's the derivative
of u transpose u?

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.960
My equation is telling me what
the derivative of u is here,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.890
I've got the thing squared.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.720
OK.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.440
I have a product here, right?

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.760
I've u's times u's.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.280
So I'm going to
use the standard--

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.200
They happen to be vectors, so
if I want to use like freshman

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.810
calculus, I'd have to
get down to the scalar

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.680
to get down to the
numbers, but I absolutely

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.070
could do that and just
follow them along, component

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.920
by component.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.630
Or I could try to do it
a whole column at a time.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.920
And let me try that.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.730
It's going to be the
product rule, right?

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:12.130
In some form I'll have this guy
times the derivative of this

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.100
plus the derivative,
I'll keep them

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.370
in order, the derivative of
this thing, times this guy.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.110
Right?

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.500
That's the product rule.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.300
OK, now what do I know here?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.410
I know that the
du/dt is Au, right?

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:34.820
So this is u transposed Au.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:41.440
And I know du, is that
dt meant to be dt?

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.240
So du/dt is Au, again.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:54.110
Look, this isn't difficult.
It's (Au) transpose u.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:59.050
And the question is,
when is this zero, OK?

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.090
So those were the two terms
from the product rule,

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.500
and notice they're
not exactly the same.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:11.640
This is u transpose Au,
and what's this guy?

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.710
u transpose A transpose u.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.940
So if I put them
together, I have

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:24.660
u transpose times the A and
the A transpose times u.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.910
And I'm hoping that this will
be zero, for all the solutions

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.500
that I've come up with.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:37.470
So the condition is
simply that A plus A--

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:42.290
we want that to be the zero
matrix, A plus A transpose.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.860
In other words, if A
transpose is minus A,

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.030
that's the good one.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.920
If A transpose is
minus A, this is

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.580
zero, that's zero,
that's zero, that's

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.460
zero, energy's conserved.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.340
So the energy is conserved
when A transpose is minus

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:08.070
A. It's for the anti-symmetric
A's that energy is conserved.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.340
And of course this
all makes sense.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:17.140
What are the special solutions
to that differential equation?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.800
The special solutions to this
equation are e to the, just,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.120
this is connecting now with
things that really are basic.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.270
The special solutions,
the pure eigensolutions,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.840
the ones that follow
their own paths,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.310
are the e^(lambda*t)x's, right?

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:46.300
Where x is an eigenvector of
A, and lambda's an eigenvalue.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.190
Those are the guys, and we
expect to have n of them,

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.340
and we expect a
combination of those

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.920
to give us the general solution
and to match the boundary

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.500
conditions.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.055
So these are the,
these n of these guys

00:11:59.055 --> 00:12:01.180
with n different eigenvectors
and their eigenvalues

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:08.370
are the heart of
problems like this.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:13.430
And of course that's the
additional homework problem

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:19.530
that wasn't in the book but I
added as an additional problem

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.120
was exactly that, to
get you to practice

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.280
with these eigenvectors
and eigenvalues.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.590
OK, now, what's the
deal, I want to connect

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.860
this energy conserving with
this picture of solutions.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.080
When would this keep
the same energy?

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:46.110
When would this have constant
energy, constant length?

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.130
The length would be constant,
since x is certainly,

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.770
that's an eigenvector,
whatever it is.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.670
This is what's changing.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.260
And now I want to know, when
does the length not change?

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.630
Well, the test would be
that this number should

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.570
have absolute value one, right?

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:12.030
If this keeps absolute
value one, then

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.710
in the eigenvalue picture I
have energy staying the same.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.420
OK?

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:22.130
Now, when will this
have magnitude one?

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:26.700
Time is running along, this
is e to the lambda t, so which

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.680
lambdas?

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.850
Zero, certainly, but
now there's more,

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.660
you gotta know the others.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.210
What other lambdas
will have, what

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.990
other lambdas give me this
thing stays on the unit

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.360
circle, absolute value one?

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.800
Key question you must
know. lambda could be?

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.550
Imaginary. lambda
could be imaginary;

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.767
right, lambda
could be imaginary.

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:54.350
e^(i*omega*t).

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.110
That's just like basic
fact about complex numbers,

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:07.000
that if lambda's imaginary we
would have cosine of something

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.980
t plus i times the
sine of something t,

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.350
cos squared plus sine
squared being one,

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.920
we'd be on the unit circle.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.020
So from this picture we
would want the lambdas

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.920
to be pure imaginary.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.640
And now a little
next step, what we'd

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:32.320
like for eigenvectors, because
the real solution will not

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.180
be just one of these
guys but a combination.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.620
So when we have a combination
each one is doing its thing,

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.540
each one better have
lambda imaginary

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:50.770
but more than that, we
would want the x's to be

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:51.650
perpendicular.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:57.890
Because if the x's interact,
then this guy, one of these,

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.610
you will say there's
only one there,

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.330
but I'm thinking
of n of them there.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.930
A combination of
say, two of them.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.970
Suppose I have an
e^(lambda_1 t)*x_1,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:13.520
and an e^(lambda_2*t)*x_2,
when does that conserve energy?

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:20.650
Well, each one will, but
the combination will be fine

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.570
if the x's are perpendicular.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.920
Because if I have
perpendicular vectors,

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.080
then the length of the whole
combination by Pythagoras

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.960
is just one squared
and the other squared

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.430
and each of those
pieces is constant.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.910
Let me say what
I'm trying to say.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.270
That the eigenvalue,
eigenfunction picture

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:45.290
also tells us that we would
like imaginary eigenvalues

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.070
and perpendicular eigenvectors.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:53.010
And that is exactly what you get
from A transpose equal minus A.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.630
So A transpose equal
minus A is exactly,

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.130
those matrices,
anti-symmetric matrices,

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:06.050
have perpendicular eigenvectors,
just like symmetric,

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.290
but the eigenvalues
are pure imaginary.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.910
Instead of all being real,
they're all pure imaginary.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:15.820
In other words, that
answer and the discussion

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.840
here came to the
same conclusion,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.290
that A should be anti-symmetric.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.560
OK.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.460
Now let me look at--
Is that OK, so that's

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.340
a discussion which
is worth knowing

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.960
about differential equations.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.610
When is energy conserved.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.250
Now I want to do,
or the problem asks

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.950
me to do, what about
this difference equation?

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.290
When is energy conserved there?

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:50.690
And I believe it
will be, this is

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.830
the requirement for the
differential equation

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.340
to be OK, to conserve energy
and so I'm going to expect,

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.780
I'm going to need
that in this one.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.340
And is that enough?

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.070
If I have this A transpose
equal minus A, anti-symmetric,

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:10.460
it was good for this, does
it also do the job here?

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.240
Is this trapezoidal
method just cool

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.140
so that it will
conserve energy, too.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.920
And the answer, I think,
is yes, and the problem

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.850
was to prove it, or to see why.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:28.230
So what do I now want?

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.910
If you don't mind
my erasing, I'm

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:35.190
now going to look
at the discrete guy.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:40.390
So now I'm looking at when
is u_(n+1) squared equal u_n

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.450
squared?

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.620
That's what I mean by conserving
energy in the discrete case.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.290
At every step, same energy.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.780
So now I want to look at the
energy in u_(n+1) compared

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:59.590
to the energy in u_n, and I
want to see that this holds.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:08.240
Probably, there's some
smart way to do that.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.200
Now we're down to just
the math questions.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.650
Math is always looking for
some, you just sort of do

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.530
the right thing, you stand
back and poof it works.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.110
OK, so what's the right thing?

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.860
Hopefully I have
helped you and me

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.480
by saying what would be
a good idea to do here.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.160
Can I just look?

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:41.660
OK, it say, oh, does
it say what to do?

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.190
Yeah.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.640
It says multiply by u_(n+1)+u_n.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.010
Take the dot product,
that's interesting.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.920
Take the dot product,
so why did that work?

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.480
Take the dot product of
both sides with u_(n+1)-u_n.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.060
Did anybody succeed
with this idea?

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.700
But that's the idea.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.550
And hopefully we'll
get it to work.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:16.890
That if I multiply both sides
by u_(n+1), oh, no, plus u_n.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.260
Maybe better if I
look at it this way.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.690
I'm sort of OK to
do it that way.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.440
Suppose I multiply both sides.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.240
So now I'm following on
this idea, That equation

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.660
I've rewritten here and without
practice I don't know which one

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.780
is the good one to start with.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.240
But I'm pretty OK with
starting with this one.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.300
So what's my idea?

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.010
That's my equation, now I'm
going to multiply both sides

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.900
by (u_(n+1)+u_n) transpose.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.400
Now I don't have room
to do it, unfortunately.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.110
I want to stick in here
u_(n+...) with a plus sign

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.170
in there, and of course I have
to do the same thing here.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:04.440
OK.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.000
Are you OK, do you
see what I'm doing?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.400
I want to show that
this equation, which

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.510
is the same as this equation,
has this property which

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.320
is a copy of this property.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.550
Here would be
another way to do it.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.420
We could do it,
the way we're going

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.240
to do it now sort of compares
with the way we started

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.780
with the derivative
of the norm squared.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.810
I could also ask
the same question

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.960
by following eigenvectors.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.560
I could also ask
the same question

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.900
by following eigenvectors.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:51.110
I'm guessing that here the
eigenvalues-- u_(n+1) is,

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.570
you see I could do it both ways.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.870
Maybe having just
done eigenvectors

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.680
let me do this one
by eigenvectors.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:04.010
So an eigenvector of
A, when it's x itself,

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.320
is, what happens
to an eigenvector.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.280
Suppose u_0 is an eigenvector
x of A, What's u_1?

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.570
Yeah, you really should
see this question.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:26.580
So u_0 is the eigenvector
x, then what is u_1?

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.730
Let me just write it here.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.530
Ax equaling lambda*x.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.720
So these are the
eigenvalues of A,

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:40.680
and we've learned that they're
pure imaginary in this case

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.920
when we're ready
to go, and now I'd

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:48.240
like to know that we
get the good thing here.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:55.380
OK, so if u_n is an
eigenvector, what is u_(n+1)?

00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.520
OK, so can I just
do that? u_(n+1) is,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:10.990
so what do I have on that right
hand side? x and what is Ax?

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.590
It's lambda, right?

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.130
It's lambda*x.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:22.860
So all this is one plus
lambda delta t on two x

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.560
but now I've also
got to bring this guy

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.720
over here, its inverse.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.810
And see what that does.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.410
Now it's the inverse,
so it's going

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.330
to have the same eigenvector
and the eigenvalue's

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.290
going to go in the
denominator and it'll

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:50.090
be one minus lambda
delta t over two.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.280
OK, so that's u_(n+1).

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.840
Do you see what's
happening here?

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:02.020
The eigenvector x, if we
start with that eigenvector x,

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.190
we come out with
a multiple of x.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.800
And this is the multiple.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.810
So each finite difference
step multiplies by a number

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.440
just the way each, in
the continuous case

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.940
we were multiplying
by e to the lambda t

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.760
and in the discrete
step by step case

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.270
we're multiplying
by that number.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:28.670
Actually, this is why
problem seven is important,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:33.980
because if we want to know how
accurate the comparison is I

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:39.800
want to compare e to the
lambda t with that number.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:47.150
So problem six is asking a
question about that ratio.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.790
And problem seven is
asking another question

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.770
about that very same ratio.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.430
Now what's the question
for problem six?

00:23:54.430 --> 00:24:01.630
When will this vector have
the same length as-- This

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:08.180
x was u_n.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:14.330
So I started with the u_n,
I multiplied by this number

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:19.750
to get u_(n+1), when do
they have the same length?

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:27.210
When that number has
absolute value one.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:31.680
So if I'm watching
eigenvectors, this guy

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.550
had absolute value one
because lambda was imaginary.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.570
Now, what about
this guy? lambda's

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:40.110
still that same
lambda, imaginary.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.130
What can you tell
me about one plus,

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:48.850
so lambda is some i*omega, delta
t over two and down here I have

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:54.200
one minus i*omega, that's
the lambda, delta t over two.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:25:00.460
I believe that that does
have absolute value one.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.620
Anybody tell me why?

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.980
So this is checking
that energy is

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.580
conserved for each eigenvector.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.090
The energy-- Because the
eigenvector is multiplied

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.290
by that number and
that's some number,

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.810
it's some complex
number, but I believe

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.080
it has absolute value one and
I believe you can tell me why.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.740
Yep.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.450
Because they're
complex conjugates.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.480
This numerator and the
denominator are complex

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:38.260
conjugates, in the complex
plane here's the one,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:43.380
and I go up by
i*omega*delta t over two,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.780
or on this one I go down by--
Bu those lengths are the same.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.110
That numerator, the
length of the numerator

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.740
is that guy, the length of
the denominator is this guy,

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.450
and their ratio is one.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.970
So I think that this
gives us the point

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.310
about complex numbers.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:09.010
That a complex number
and its conjugate

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:14.270
automatically have
ratio of magnitude one.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.550
You see the difference
between Euler's method.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:24.450
So Euler's method, so
forward Euler-- Forward Euler

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:31.560
would not have had this
stuff on the left side.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.790
It would all have been
on the right-hand side.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:38.790
Forward Euler would have
been about i plus A*delta t.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.670
Delta t A. And what
are its eigenvalues?

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:48.410
One plus i omega delta t, right?

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:54.600
With no, we're not
dividing by anybody.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.030
This part is up top too, so
it's one plus i*omega*delta t.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.990
Now, does that have
absolute value one?

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.480
Well, you know from the way
I'm asking the question, what

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.280
can you tell me about
the absolute value

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.310
of the forward
Euler growth factor?

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.400
Greater than one.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.310
Because this is the one, and
this is the i*omega*delta t,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.550
maybe went up twice as far.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.980
And there was
nobody to divide by.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.290
It's bigger than
one, so it blows up.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:29.850
And the backward Euler had
only the one over one minus

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:37.050
i*omega*delta t, so the backward
was like this, one over it.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.980
And less than one.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.960
But this balance has
absolute value equal one.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.230
So, OK, that's the sort of
heart of what's going on.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:54.270
Can I, before I tackle the
question using the hint there,

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.180
which would take me
on another blackboard,

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.180
can I discuss question seven?

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.570
Were you going to ask
me about number seven?

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.000
PROFESSOR STRANG: You were?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.820
OK.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.670
Alright.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.840
We get the answer.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.280
So, question seven is
about the accuracy.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:18.350
So here's the correct number,
this is my e^(i*omega*t),

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:24.000
that's the correct number that
I should be multiplying by.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.080
And the actual number that I'm
multiplying by is that much.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.680
Or, in the forward Euler
case, it's that one.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:40.000
And so I'm comparing
the one step accuracy.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.580
So let me compare
one step accuracy.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:49.100
So this is the topic now,
of order of accuracy.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.140
This is question seven.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:29:01.520
And it amounts to comparing
the-- So what is one delta t

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.820
step in the continuous case?

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.600
So how much does
the eigenvector x,

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.330
what does it get multiplied
by if I take a delta t

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.530
step in the
differential equation?

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.660
So this is the
exact delta t step,

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.740
what the finite difference
won't get exactly right.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:26.740
So the exact step delta t.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:36.660
The differential equation, and
of course I'm always looking

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:46.690
at Ax=lambda*x, the differential
equation multiplies x by what?

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:52.910
What's the exact growth
factor, you could say,

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:57.620
if my equation is du/dt=Au,
that's the differential

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:03.810
equation, and I'm supposing
that I'm on an eigenvector x,

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:09.630
so that the solution
is e^(i*omega*t),

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.440
or e^(i*lambda*x).

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:19.010
Now, what happened
over a delta t step?

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:23.340
This is the answer like
running along for all time,

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.380
all I'm asking you to
do is if the step is

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.220
delta t, what's that number?

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.310
I mean that number is telling us
how much it grew in that delta

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:37.380
t step, and of course
it's e^(i*omega*delta t).

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.770
That's the exact growth
factor, that's G_exact.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.760
In one time step,
the eigenvector

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.310
gets multiplied by that, because
that's the amount of time that

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.330
elapsed.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.610
And what's the
approximate growth,

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:03.900
the growth factor
from trapezoidal

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.110
is just what we wrote down here.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:14.510
One plus lambda*delta t, maybe
I'll stay with lambda rather

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.110
than i*omega.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:25.010
e^(lambda*delta t), and this
was one plus delta t over two

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:33.320
lambda, divided by one minus
delta t over two lambda.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:42.560
So question seven just says
compare that with that.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:48.380
Thinking of delta t as a small
time step, if delta t is zero,

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.200
then of course e
to the zero is one,

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.270
if delta t is zero
I get one here,

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:59.180
they're correct if delta t
is zero, that's no big deal.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:09.240
How do I understand what
happens for small delta t?

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.690
I'm comparing this exponential
for a small delta t

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.980
with this guy for
a small delta t.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.230
How do you make comparisons
for a small delta t?

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.730
Well, that's what Taylor
series is all about.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.150
Let's do the Taylor series.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.870
What's the series
for the exponential?

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:32.790
If delta t is small, I have
e to some little number,

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:40.220
tell me, start me out
on the exponential.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:49.010
One, thanks, one plus,
lambda*delta t plus,

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.700
this is the exponential series,
there are only two series

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.100
in this world that
are worth knowing.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.840
Really, that's literally true.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.600
In calculus you study all
these infinite series,

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.400
there are two that
are important,

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.150
that are worth remembering
long after calculus.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:09.600
And e to the x, e to the
whatever, is one of them.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.070
OK, what's the next term?

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:17.980
Over two, lambda delta
t squared over two,

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.880
and then there's a cube guy
if you don't mind telling me

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.180
what's the denominator
in that one?

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.750
It's three factorial six.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:27.250
Good.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.040
And onward.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.570
OK.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.570
So that's one of the series
that everybody should know.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:37.540
OK, how we going to
deal with this guy?

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.930
We want to expand that,
so what's my goal?

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:45.200
I want you to expand that
in powers of lambda*delta t

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.960
and compare with this.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.980
And see where, they aren't
going to be equal, right?

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.800
At some point they're
going to be different.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.160
But at least they
should start out equal.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:03.550
So so here's the heart
of problem seven.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:08.400
How do I expand this
in powers of delta t?

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.030
Do you mind if I
just, this is just

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:17.650
a number let me put it times
one over, so this is times one

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:23.410
minus delta t over two
lambda, inverse right?

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:25.930
I just bring that
up as a number.

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:32.770
So it's this guy times
one over this guy.

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.330
What do I do?

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:46.480
This is, here's the moment
when the math tools get used.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.040
And I'm well aware
that it's like years

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.480
since you did calculus
or series or whatever,

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.170
and those tools get rusty.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:02.510
And the point is that
they're really genuine tools

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.060
that we can now use.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.250
So what do you think?

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.500
This is the problem one,
this is the one coming from

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.770
the denominator;
this is 1/(1-x).

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.560
So I have a 1/(1-x) deal.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.750
And what's the series for that?

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.870
I said there were two
series worth remembering,

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.650
and sure enough the
exponential was one of them

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.060
and now we're ready
for the other one.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.990
What's the series for that guy?

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:39.530
1+x, good start.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:45.370
Plus x squared.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:49.820
Right, x squared plus
x cubed and so on.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.530
Real simple.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.610
It's all the same stuff
with no factorials.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:57.360
Those are the two
series to know.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.320
The exponential series
and the geometric series.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.710
Right, that's the
geometric series.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:07.020
OK, so that's what I've
got out of this stuff.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.030
Can I write it below?

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:12.490
I have one plus delta
t over two lambda.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.270
Let me just call that
x for the moment.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.920
Delta t over two lambda is my x.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:24.190
One plus x, and this is 1/(1-x),
which you just told me is one

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:29.730
plus x plus x squared
plus x cubed and so on.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.370
And now I've got to do
that multiplication.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:40.020
OK, x is, remember this is
x, I'm just saving space.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.580
Can you multiply those guys?

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.650
So that's one plus x
times a lot of stuff here.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:49.150
What do I have all together?

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:53.210
Well, the one,
what's the next term?

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:54.270
Two x's?

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.430
Everybody spots
the two x's there?

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:03.040
And then the next term, you
have to get these terms right

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.380
because we plan to
compare with this guy

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.710
and see how many we get.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.650
How many x squareds
are in there?

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.100
Is it two?

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.110
Looks like two.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.810
Two x squareds.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:16.370
And two x cubes, and so on.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.710
Yeah, that looks right, OK.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:22.670
Now I'm ready, what
am I ready for?

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:28.230
I'm ready to say what x is, x
is this delta t over two lambda.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:29.850
So what have I got here, one?

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.190
What is this guy now?

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:37.540
Two x's is delta t lambda.

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.180
Is this good?

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.280
Yes, right?

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.420
We're pleased.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.880
Because the two x
is the, two of these

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.250
is delta t lambda and that's
what we wanted to match.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:50.090
Absolutely.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:52.520
Delta t lambda, lambda delta t.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.400
Now let's keep going.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.860
By the way if this first
term hadn't matched

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.770
we would be extremely surprised.

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:04.730
Because that first
matching is only

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:08.760
saying that my difference
equation is quite consistent,

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:14.610
it's a reasonable creation out
of the differential equation.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.230
And we knew that.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.490
The question is how much
further are we going to get?

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.900
Euler will not get any further.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.550
With Euler the next
ones will fail.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:28.240
But I think with trapezoidal
the next ones are going to work.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.750
Does it work?

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:35.170
It's like we're holding
our breath, right?

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.380
Two now, I'm going
to put in x squared

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.490
and see about this
term. x is what?

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:45.640
x is this guy, delta
t over two lambda.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.230
Delta t lambda
over two, squared.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:52.490
And now you get the fun.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:56.930
Because you're going to
compare this term with what?

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.530
With this term.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.190
And are they the same?

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.010
Yes.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.100
Yes.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.790
So that's the way,
you see, that you

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:12.380
got the extra accuracy which
Euler did not give you,

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.820
but that's why the
trapezoidal rule is

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.970
a is a second order
accurate method.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:29.270
OK, you may say that I went
overboard to say all that.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.690
You may say I didn't
ask that question.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:36.120
But it's the right question to
ask about order of accuracy,

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.740
and it's what problem seven
was intending to bring.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:50.140
Maybe I called it h in problem
seven rather than x here.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.260
Well.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.660
Oh gosh, I realize
I I'm supposed

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.510
to come back to this one.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.880
But some people might
have other problems

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.330
that they're interested in.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:06.340
But let me, because
time is pushing along,

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.260
and the solution to
this one we'll post,

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.220
let me at least offer
the possibility to ask me

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.830
about something completely,
not six or seven here,

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.860
but something
entirely different,

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.920
like what's the first question
on the quiz or anything.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:32.510
And that, let me say I'll
hope to know by Tuesday.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:37.260
I love to teach, but making
up exams is serious work.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.430
Anyway.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:46.100
Let me open a board and open to
another question of any sort.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.540
Any place, Chapter 1,
Chapter 2, whatever.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.870
Is there anything?

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:56.610
So I know that you're in
the middle of this homework.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:03.220
So I can say a little
more here about

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.720
that number six if you want,
but I wanted to allow, yep.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:14.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.240
PROFESSOR STRANG: The
A, from today's lecture

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.280
this was the incidence
matrix, and this

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.630
was the A transpose A
that's probably still

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:28.201
on the board somewhere.

00:41:28.201 --> 00:41:28.700
Yep.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.030
Yep.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:36.980
So this is the A, which
you should take in and be

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.610
able to create if I
gave you the graph,

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.730
and this is the A
transpose A, so it's

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.020
through today's lecture, yeah.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:47.200
Next lecture I'll be talking
about the A transpose

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.430
by itself, which involves
Kirchhoff's current law,

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:52.090
it's beautiful.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.210
A transpose w equals zero.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:42:00.550
But I think this part was
straightforward enough

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:06.410
to be able to add this
to our list of problems

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.720
which fit the framework.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.790
So that's what that was about.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.260
It doesn't mean that this will
be on but it could be, right.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.380
OK, what else?

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:20.844
You guys are patient, I
come on-- Yeah, thanks.

00:42:20.844 --> 00:42:21.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.676
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yep.

00:42:22.676 --> 00:42:25.370
AUDIENCE: This is only valid
when x is less than one?

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:29.740
PROFESSOR STRANG: It's only
valid when x is less than one,

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:34.880
so that's now the math point
that this expansion for e^x

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.070
valid for all x's.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.200
Because you're dividing by
these bigger and bigger numbers.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.150
But this one is only
valid up to x=1.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:47.450
At x=1 we're getting
one plus one plus one,

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.520
and we're getting one
over one minus one,

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.030
sort of infinity
matches infinity,

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:58.780
but then if x goes up to two,
yeah what happens if x is two?

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:02.090
It's sort of not good,
but you know mathematics,

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.010
it's never completely
crazy, right?

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.960
If x is two, what does this say?

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.450
What have I got on
the left hand side?

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.640
Negative one.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.560
And what have I got on
the right hand side?

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:21.010
One plus two plus
four plus eight.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:24.270
I should not allow
this to be videotaped,

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:30.410
but that's actually not
so completely crazy.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:37.700
In some nutty way that
could still make some sense.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.110
That's certainly will not be
on the-- So you're right that x

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:45.520
should be less than one, and
of course it will be here

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.550
because I'm looking
at little delta t's.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:53.380
Little, so my delta t-- My x
was this thing and my delta t,

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.970
the time step was small
and somehow that tells me,

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.350
actually this is
a good indication.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:03.090
It gives me the units.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.510
That stability and
things going right

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.710
will depend on lambda delta t.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:14.540
Will depend on lambda delta t,
that's the key parameter there.

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.640
That's like the
dimensionless parameter

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.520
that we're, or lambda delta
t over two, or whatever.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.310
But lambda delta t is the key.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:26.860
And a highly important key.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.040
It tells us that as
lambda gets bigger,

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.820
as the matrix has
bigger eigenvalues,

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.670
delta t has got to get smaller.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.740
And I mentioned stiff equations.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:43.000
Stiff equations are equations
where the eigenvalues lambda

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.450
are out of scale.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.380
You know, you might have two
eigenvalues, one of size one

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.940
and the other of size
ten to the fourth,

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.330
because you've got two
physical processes going on

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.480
at the same time.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.350
And those equations are
tough, because that ten

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:04.060
to the fourth guy is
forcing your delta t

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.320
to be really small.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.740
Whereas the action
might, the true,

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.940
real solution might be
controlled by the lambda=1 guy.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.620
So to follow this
slow evolution,

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.100
you're having to take very small
steps because on top of that

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.060
slow evolution
with the lambda=1,

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.590
there's some very fast evolution
maybe with lambda equal minus

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.140
10,000.

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:32.630
Yeah, there's a
lot happening here.

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:36.450
And always you have
to think OK, is there

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.970
some way around that box.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:44.510
Because forward Euler
would not get you through.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.611
OK, thanks for that question,
you got another one?

00:45:46.611 --> 00:45:47.110
OK.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.135
AUDIENCE: So then if you
weren't using small enough time

00:45:50.135 --> 00:45:51.420
steps, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.390
PROFESSOR STRANG: If you weren't
using small enough time steps,

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:56.790
OK.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.120
For trapezoidal, let's say?

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.384
AUDIENCE: I mean, that
expansion wouldn't hold

00:46:01.384 --> 00:46:02.550
if you were using a lambda--

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.508
PROFESSOR STRANG: Well,
the expansion is really

00:46:04.508 --> 00:46:05.920
intended for a small delta t.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.420
Yeah.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:10.730
It's not intended, I never
added up the whole series.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:14.770
I just compared a couple of
terms to see how am I doing,

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:19.260
and I got the extra term
to match from trapezoidal

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.760
that I didn't get from Euler.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.600
So what's to say?

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.060
If you took delta
t too big, what

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:31.050
would happen in the
trapezoidal method?

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.440
Well, you would
stay on this circle

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:39.410
because the absolute value
of this thing is truly one.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:43.120
Even if lambda is enormous
and delta t is way too big,

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:49.320
we still had complex conjugates
and their ratio was one.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.420
So we would not
leave the circle,

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.900
at least in perfect
arithmetic, as everybody says.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.820
If we didn't make
any round-off error,

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.570
we would not leave the circle.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:02.020
But boy would we skip all
over the place on that circle.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.080
So if we took
delta t too big, we

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.730
would be completely inaccurate.

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:10.270
We wouldn't be unstable,
for trapezoidal,

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:11.910
because it would
stay on the circle,

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:16.090
but the phase would be
completely wrong, yeah.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.120
So it would be a complex
number of absolute value one,

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:28.310
but it would not be close
to the exact growth factor.

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:30.880
Well, so many things to say.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.720
I realize that the course
moves along pretty quickly

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:40.070
but this topic of numerical
methods for differential

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:44.460
equations, that's a
core part of 18.086.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:51.550
So I'm like anticipating here
in just a couple of days what

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:55.730
really takes longer is the
stability and the accuracy

00:47:55.730 --> 00:48:05.330
and the best choices for
time-dependent problems.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.640
OK, always good questions.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.010
Anything else that's on
your mind of any sort?

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.730
Yes, thanks.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:11.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:17.940
PROFESSOR STRANG: 114?

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.910
AUDIENCE: There is a figure 2.7.

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:21.785
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

00:48:21.785 --> 00:48:22.285
OK.

00:48:22.285 --> 00:48:24.540
114 figure 2.7.

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.460
Oh yes, OK.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.560
Oh yes.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.260
AUDIENCE: I figure it's about
how these shapes [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.220
see.

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:37.320
That has a bunch of
figures, so that in order

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.880
to say for everybody who's
not looking at the book,

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.280
those figures are about the
problem we've discussed here

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:48.480
with a model problem,
where we're on a circle.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:52.480
So do I have space
to draw a circle?

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.690
Well, let me just
make space here.

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:00.610
OK, so page 114 has
that model problem

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:03.430
that we've drawn before.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:07.600
There's the exact solution,
here's the phase plane;

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.640
there's u and there's
u', and the u was cos(t),

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.830
so the u' was minus sin(t), and
we travel around the circle.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:19.140
On the exact solution.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:22.440
Energy constant, u squared
stays one-- u squared

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.460
plus u prime squared stay one.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:30.361
Now which figure was it
you wanted me to look at?

00:49:30.361 --> 00:49:30.860
So.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.476
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:32.476 --> 00:49:33.850
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Of any of them?

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:38.230
PROFESSOR STRANG:
OK, that's fine.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:39.260
Let's see.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.720
Is trapezoidal on that one?

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.220
Yeah.

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.460
Trapezoidal was the first one.

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:47.650
OK, so figure 2.6 shows
the trapezoidal method

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:50.290
moving around the circle.

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:51.100
So what happens?

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:55.160
Yeah, thanks, that's a
very suitable question.

00:49:55.160 --> 00:50:02.340
OK. and I took, in that figure
I took, how long does it

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:05.650
take for the exact solution
to get exactly back

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:07.590
where it started?

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:09.720
At t equal what do I come back?

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.070
AUDIENCE: 2pi.

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.550
PROFESSOR STRANG:
t equal to 2pi,

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:15.960
I'm right back where I was.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.460
Right?

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.870
Cosine has period 2pi.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:24.550
OK, now a single
step of size 2pi

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:28.250
would be really
ridiculous, right?

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.050
I mean, I want to now delta t.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:37.930
So in that figure I took delta
t to be 2pi divided by 32.

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:42.750
So I'm taking delta
t to be the 2pi, that

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:48.390
would bring me all the way
around, but I'm dividing by 32.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:49.390
So, what does that mean?

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:54.420
What what does the exact
solution do at those steps?

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.120
32 steps?

00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:01.360
It goes on the circle,
32 equal steps, 30, 360,

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:06.290
2pi divided by 32 radians
every time, comes back exactly

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:08.350
there, the exact solution.

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:12.210
And right where I started.

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:16.280
So it's like following a planet.

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.250
Now I do it by
finite differences.

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:22.410
So now I'm going to follow
the trapezoidal rule,

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:26.280
just what we've been talking
about, with that time step,

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.060
and with the equation--
Everybody remembers

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:34.040
the equation was [u, u'] equals,
do you remember what the matrix

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.950
was in that equation?

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.950
This is the derivative of
it and this is [u, u'].

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:45.780
Sorry to squeeze this in,
but what I'm, u' is u'.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:50.000
u'' is minus u.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.500
Now we know why that
matrix was good, right?

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.250
Why is that?

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:59.130
That's my matrix
A, why is it good?

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:02.440
Because it's exactly, it fits.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:06.750
A transpose is minus
A. It's anti-symmetric.

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:08.670
Keeps me right on the circle.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.740
OK now, trapezoidal
method keeps me

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.620
right on the circle, 32 steps.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:20.170
And so the picture just shows
where it goes after 32 steps.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:25.930
And 32, 32 does it
come back there?

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:28.070
Well, not exactly, right?

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:31.420
We don't expect to find
a different solution

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:37.180
to be exactly in sync
with cos(t), the real one.

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.460
But it's really close.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:43.070
I think in that figure
I can see that that's

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:46.750
sort of a double
point there, at 2pi.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:50.370
I put a little arrow
indicating small phase error.

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:55.350
It misses by a little bit.

00:52:55.350 --> 00:53:01.210
And actually, roughly
what does it miss by?

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:05.560
This was the point of the
order of accuracy stuff.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:09.630
Roughly what size is
that little error?

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.400
That's what we did over here.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:18.290
The term that we got
wrong was a delta t cubed.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:21.000
At each step.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.050
Can I just tell you the answer?

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:27.390
The error here is of
size delta t squared.

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.720
Because over here we
match those series

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.250
and we found the error
was delta t cubed.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.540
That's in a single step.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.740
But now we've got one
over delta t steps,

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.580
you see what I'm saying?

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:45.970
That if the error was
delta t cubed per step,

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:51.090
and I have one over delta
t steps, to get somewhere,

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:55.861
or 2pi over delta t or whatever,
then that gives me delta t

00:53:55.861 --> 00:53:56.360
squared.

00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:02.240
So that little error there is my
error of size delta t squared.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.500
And that square tells me
I've got a good method.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.510
At least, decent.

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.310
Second order accurate.

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:16.330
And the trapezoidal rule
is sort of the natural one.

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:20.390
Well, OK, so that's a
full hour mostly devoted

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:22.800
to two or three things.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:26.720
Actually the eigenvectors
came into it.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.980
And the energy
conservation came into it,

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:34.050
the stability matching
series came into it.

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.930
And the picture.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:43.530
OK, I'll see you Friday
for more about these guys,

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:48.660
and then Monday evening
please ask me everything

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.190
you want to, on Monday evening.

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:51.940
OK.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.400
Thank you.
