00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.870
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.710
This is a big day.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.480
Part One of the
course is completed,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.040
and I have your quizzes
for you, and that

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.390
was a very successful
result, I'm very pleased.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.860
I hope you are, too.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.990
Quiz average of 85, that's on
the first part of the course.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.380
And then the second part --
so this is Chapter 3 now --

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.370
Starts in one dimension with
an equation of a type that

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.120
we've already seen a little bit.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.240
So there's some
more things to say

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.060
about the equation
and the framework,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.350
but then we get to make a start
on the finite element approach

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.720
to solving it.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.290
We could of course-- In 1-D
finite differences are probably

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.450
the way to go, actually.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.850
In one dimension the special
success of finite elements

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.130
doesn't really show up that much
because finite elements have

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.400
been, I mean one great
reason for their success

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.420
is that they handle
different geometries.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420
They're flexible; you
could have regions

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.980
in the plane, three-dimensional
bodies of different shapes.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.740
Finite differences
doesn't really

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.070
know what to do on a
curved boundary in in 2-

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.540
or 3-D. Finite elements
copes much better.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.120
So, we'll make a start
today, more Friday

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.620
on one-dimensional
finite elements

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.300
and then, a couple
of weeks later

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.450
will be the real
thing, 2-D and 3-D.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.160
OK, so, ready to
go on Chapter 3?

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.560
So, that's our equation
and everybody sees

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.000
right away what's the
framework, that that's

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.390
A transpose; in some way
this is A transpose C A,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.510
but what's new of course is that
we're dealing with functions,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.230
not vectors.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.170
So we're dealing with, you could
say, operators, not matrices.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.950
And nevertheless, the big
picture is still as it was.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.720
So let me take u(x) to be
the displacements again.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.440
So I'm thinking more of
mechanics than electronics

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.370
here.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.640
Displacements, and
then we have du--

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.910
the e(x) will be
du/dx, that'll be

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:00.700
the stretching, the elongation
and, of course at that step

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.940
you already see the
big new item, the fact

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.330
that the A, the one that
gets us from u to du/dx,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.260
instead of being a difference
matrix which it has been,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.880
our matrix A is
now a derivative.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.730
A is d/dx.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.560
So maybe I'll just
take out that arrow.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.950
So A is d/dx.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.330
OK, but if we dealt OK
with difference matrices,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.570
we're going to deal
OK with derivatives.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.720
Then, of course, this is the
C part, that produces w(x).

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.590
And it's a multiplication
by this possibly varying,

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.370
possibly jumping
stiffness constant c(x).

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.790
So w(x) is c(x) e(x), that's our
old w=Ce, this is Hooke's Law.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.880
I'll put Hooke's
Law, but that's,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.590
or whose-ever law it is.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.840
It's like a diagonal
matrix; I hope

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.900
you see that it's like
a diagonal matrix.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.590
This function u is kind
of like of a vector

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.040
but a continuum vector
instead of just a fixed,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.040
finite number of values.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.590
Then at each value we
used to multiply by c_i,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.740
now our values are continuous
with x, so we multiply by c(x).

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.730
And then you're going to
expect that, going up here,

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.650
there's going to be an A
transpose w f, and of course

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.740
that A transpose
we have to identify

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.690
and that's the first point
of the lecture, really.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.750
To identify what is A transpose.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.590
What do I mean by A transpose?

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.080
And I've got to say
right away that I'm

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.760
a little, the notation, writing
a transpose of a derivative is

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.950
like, that's not legal.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.570
Because we think of the
transpose of a matrix,

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.470
you sort of flip it
over the main diagonal,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.120
but obviously it's got to be
something more to it than that.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.630
And so that's a
central math part

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.170
of this lecture is what's really
going on when you transpose?

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.150
Because then we can
copy what's going on

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.030
and it's quite
important to get it.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.970
Because the transpose,
well, other notations

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.290
and other words for it
would be-- A notation

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.970
might be a star.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.370
Star would be way more
common than transpose,

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.200
I'll just stay with
transpose because I

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.410
want to keep pressing the
parallel with A transpose C A.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.180
And the name for it
would be the adjoint.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.870
And adjoint methods, and adjoint
operator, those appear a lot.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.510
And you'll see them
appear in finite elements.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:24.340
So this is a good
thing to catch on to.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.060
Why?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.030
Why should the transpose or
the adjoint of the derivative

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.000
be minus the derivative?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.610
And by the way, just
while we're fixing this,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:43.870
this is a key fact then,
which is certainly--

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.640
We have a very strong hint from
centered difference, right?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.810
If I think of derivatives,
if I associate them

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.100
with differences, the
centered difference matrix,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:01.800
so the A matrix may be centered,
would be-- Just to remind us,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.600
a centered difference has
ones and minus one, one,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.280
zeroes on the diagonal, right?

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.430
Minus one, one.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:16.210
Takes that difference
at every row.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.280
Except possibly boundary rows.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.220
And of course as soon as you
look at that matrix you see,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.590
yeah, it's anti-symmetric.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.100
That's an anti-symmetric matrix.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:32.160
So A transpose is minus A
for centered differences

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.580
and therefore we're
not so surprised

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.330
to see a minus sign
up here when we

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.910
go to the continuous
case, the derivative.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.320
But, we still have
to say what it means.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.660
So that's what I'll do next, OK?

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.790
So this is a good thing to know.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.930
And I was just going
to comment, what

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.530
would be the transpose
of the second derivative?

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.490
I won't even write this down.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:04.380
If the derivative transpose
sort of flips its sign to minus,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.540
what would you guess
for this transpose

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.550
of second derivative, our
more familiar d second

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.190
by dx squared?

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.820
Well we'll have two minus signs.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.550
So it'll come out plus.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.040
So second derivatives,
even order derivatives

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.030
are sort of like symmetric guys.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.410
Odd order derivatives, first
and third and fifth derivatives,

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.850
well, God forbid we ever
meet a fifth derivative,

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:36.910
but first derivative
anyway, is anti-symmetric.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.840
Except for boundary conditions.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.560
So I really have to
emphasize that the boundary

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.030
conditions come in.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.580
And you'll see them come in.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.200
They have to come in.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.150
OK, so what meaning can I
assign to the transpose,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:58.790
or what was the real thing
happening when we flipped

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.930
the matrix across its diagonal?

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:14.050
I claim that we really define
the transpose by this rule,

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.810
by-- We know what
inner products are.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.320
I'll do vectors first, we
know about inner products,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.650
dot products, we know what the
dot product of two vectors is.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.390
So, this is the
transpose of A. How

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.650
am I going to define
the transpose of A?

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:36.170
Well, I look at the dot
product of Au with w.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.250
I'll use a dot here for once,
I may erase it and replace it.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:46.860
If at the dot product of Au
with w, then that equals,

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.700
for all u and w,
all vectors u and w,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:56.720
that equals the dot product
of u with something.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.790
Because u is coming-- If I write
out what the dot product is,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.810
I see u_1 multiplies something,
u_2 multiplies something.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:13.420
And what goes in
that little space?

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.210
This is just an identity.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.760
I mean, it's like,
you'll say no big deal.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.330
But I'm saying there is at
least a small deal here.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:22.930
OK.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:28.710
So if I write it
this way, you'll

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.850
tell me right away this should
be the same as u transpose

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.900
times something.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.400
And again, so I'm asking for the
same something on both lines.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.930
What is that something?

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.100
A transpose w.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.130
Whatever A transpose
is, it's the matrix

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.220
that makes this right.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.960
That's really my message.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.550
That A transpose
is-- The reason we

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.810
flipped the matrix
across the diagonal

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.110
is that it makes that
equation correct.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.510
And I'm writing the
same thing here.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.940
OK.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.590
So again, if we knew
what dot products were,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.930
what inner product
of vectors were,

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.940
then A transpose
is the matrix that

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.780
makes this identity correct.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.310
And of course if
you write it all out

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.580
in terms of i, j,
every component,

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.640
you find it is correct.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.190
So that defines the
transpose of a matrix.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.590
And of course it coincides with
flipping across the diagonal.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.610
Now, how about the
transpose of a derivative.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.520
OK, so I'm going to
follow the same rule.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.080
Here A is now going
to be the derivative,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.230
and A transpose is
going to be whatever

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.470
it takes to make this true.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.930
But what do I mean?

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.620
Now I have functions, so
I have to think again,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.870
what do I mean by the inner
product, the dot product?

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.950
So for this to make
sense I need to say,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.410
and it's a very
important thing anyway,

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.830
and it's the right
natural choice,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:14.520
I need to say the dot
product, or the inner product

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.170
is a better word, of functions.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.270
Of two functions.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.760
Say e(x) and w(x).

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.260
If I have two functions, what do
I mean by their inner product?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.570
Well, really I just
think back what

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.100
did we mean in the
finite dimensional case,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.520
I multiplied each e by a w,
each component of e by w,

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.780
and I added, so what
am I going to do here?

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:49.410
Maybe my notation
should be parentheses

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:54.410
with a comma would be better
than a dot, for functions.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.800
So I have a function.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.400
I'm in function space now.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.100
We moved out of R^n today,
into function space.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.390
Our vectors have
become functions.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.420
And now what's the dot
product of two vectors?

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.710
Well, what am I going to do?

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.660
I'm going to do
what I have to do.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.970
I'm going to multiply each
e by its corresponding w,

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:26.240
and now they depend on
this continuous variable x,

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.840
so that's e(x) times w(x).

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.010
And what do I do now?

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.580
Integrate.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.420
Here I added e_i
times w_i, of course.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.200
Over here I have functions.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.610
I integrate dx.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.500
Over whatever the region
of the problem is.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.050
And then our example's in
1-D, it'll zero to one.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.370
If these are functions
of two variables

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.990
I'd be integrating over some 2-D
region, but we're in 1-D today.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:15.110
OK, so you see that I'm prepared
to say-- This now makes sense.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:20.320
I now want to say, I'm going
to let A be the derivative,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.190
and I'm going to figure out
what A transpose has to be.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:29.930
So if A is the derivative,
so now is this key step.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.780
Why is the transpose that?

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:40.950
OK, so I look at the
derivative, du/dx, with w,

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:52.670
so that's this integral, from
zero to one of du/dx*w(x)dx,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.860
so that's my left side.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.070
Now I want to get u by itself.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.020
I want to get the
dot product, so I

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:07.410
want to get another integral
here that has u(x) by itself.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.130
Times something,
and that something

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.900
is what I'm looking for.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.230
That something will
be A transpose w.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.600
Right?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.340
Do you see what I'm doing?

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.240
This is is the dot
product, this is Auw,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.680
so I've written out what
Au inner product with w is.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.680
And now I want to get u out by
itself and what it multiplies

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.020
here will be the A
transpose w, and my rule

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:42.510
will be extended to the function
case and I'll be ready to go.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:48.670
Now do you recognize, this
is a basic calculus step,

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.420
what rule of calculus
am I going to use?

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.660
We're back to 18.01.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.240
I have the integral of
a derivative times w,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.580
and what do I want to do?

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.150
I want to get the
derivative off of u.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.890
What happens?

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.710
What's it called?

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.140
Integration by parts.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.060
Very important thing.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.060
Very important.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.420
You miss its
importance in calculus.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.480
It gets sometimes introduced
as a rule, or a trick

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.490
to find some goofy integral,
but it's really the real thing.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.630
So what is integration by parts?

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.770
What's the rule?

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.280
You take the
derivative off of u,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.600
you put it onto the other
one just what we hope for,

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.920
and then you also
have to remember

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.290
that there is a minus sign.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.510
Integration by parts
has a minus sign.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.750
And usually you'd
see it out there

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.090
but here I've left
more room for it there.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:54.290
So I have identified
now A transpose w.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:59.990
A transpose w has-- If this
is Au, inner product with w,

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.950
then this is u inner
product with A transpose w,

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.490
it had to be what was.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.910
And so that one integration by
parts brought out a minus sign.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.890
If I was looking at
second derivatives

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.560
there would probably be
somewhere two integration

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.430
by parts; I'd have minus
twice, I'd be back to plus.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.510
And you're going to ask
about boundary conditions.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.910
And you're right to ask
about boundary conditions.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.680
I even circled that, because
that is so important.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:33.200
So what we've done so far
is to get the interior

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.670
of the interval right.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.140
Between zero and one,
if A is the derivative,

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.020
then A transpose is
minus the derivative.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.750
That's all we've done.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.290
We have not got the
boundary conditions yet.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.490
And we can't go on without that.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.470
OK, so I'm ready
now to say something

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.110
about boundary conditions.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.660
And it will bring up this
square versus rectangular also.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.940
We're getting the rules
straight before we

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.820
tackle finite elements.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:15.090
OK, let me take an example of
a matrix and its transpose.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.800
Just so you see how boundary
conditions-- Suppose

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.130
I have a free-fixed problem.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.840
Suppose I have a
free-fixed line of springs.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.470
What's the matrix A for that?

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.830
Well-- Question?

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:33.330
Yes.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.740
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:44.770
That's-- Yes, when I learned it,
it was also that stupid trick.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:50.036
So you would like me to put
plus, can I put plus, whatever.

00:18:50.036 --> 00:18:51.410
What do you want
me to call that?

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:52.640
An integrated term?

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.490
It would be, yeah.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.910
I even remember what it is.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:03.170
As you do better than me. u
times w at the, is that good?

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.860
Yeah, I think.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.530
So it's really this part
that I'm now coming to.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.090
It's the boundary part
that I'm now coming to.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.630
And let me say, so I'm glad
you asked that question

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.500
because I made it
seem unimportant,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.360
where that's not true at all.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.400
The boundary condition is
part of the definition of A,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.000
and part of the
definition of A transpose.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.830
Just the way, I'm about
to say free-fixed,

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:38.350
I had to tell you that for
you to know what A was.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.570
Until I tell you the
boundary condition,

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.410
you don't know what
the boundary rows are.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.900
You only know the
inside of the matrix.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.880
Or one possible inside.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.790
So I'm thinking
my inside is going

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.120
to be minus one,
one; minus one, one;

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:59.770
so on, as giving me
finite differences.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.750
Minus one, one.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.850
But.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.570
Oh no, let's see.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.467
So I'm doing free-fixed.

00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:08.050
Is that right?

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.390
Am I doing free-fixed?

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:16.360
OK, so am I taking
free at the left end?

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.170
Yes.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.600
Alright, so if I'm
free at the left

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.840
and fixed at the right
end, what's my A?

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.320
We're getting better
at this, right?

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.700
Minus one, one.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.660
Minus one, one.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.610
Minus one, one.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:37.080
Minus one, and the one
here gets chopped off.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.250
You could say if you want
the fifth row of A_0,

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.750
remembering A_0 as the
hint on the quiz, where

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.570
it had five rows for the
full thing, free-free.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:55.920
And then when an end got fixed,
the fifth column got removed,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.470
and that's my free-fixed matrix.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.180
At the left hand
end, at the zero end,

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.282
it's got the
difference in there.

00:21:04.282 --> 00:21:05.740
Difference,
difference, difference.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.870
But here at the
right-hand end, it's

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.030
the fixing, the setting
u, whatever it would be,

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:17.110
u_5 to zero, or maybe it's u_4.
if this is u nought, one, two,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.980
three.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.820
Setting u_4 to zero
knocked that out.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.520
OK.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.130
All I want to do
is transpose that.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.350
And you'll see something that
we maybe didn't notice before.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.440
So I transpose it,
that's minus one,

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.270
one becomes a column, minus
one, one becomes a column.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.480
Minus one, one becomes a column.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.390
Minus one, all there is.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:50.570
That row becomes, so this
was, so-- Have I got it right?

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.140
Yes.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.730
What's happened?

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.370
A transpose, what are
the boundary conditions

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.930
going with A transpose?

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.120
The boundary conditions
that went with A

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.120
were, let me say
first, what were

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.590
the boundary conditions with A?

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.140
Those are going to be
boundary conditions on u.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:19.600
So A has boundary
conditions on u.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:26.340
And A transpose has
boundary conditions on w.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:31.130
Because A transpose acts
on w, and A acts on u.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.820
So there was no choice.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.230
So now what was the
boundary condition here?

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.300
The boundary condition
was u_4=0, right?

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.730
That was what I meant by
that guy getting fixed.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:49.450
Now-- And no boundary
condition at u_0, it was free.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.020
Now, what are the
boundary conditions

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.800
that go with A transpose?

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.410
And remember, A transpose
is multiplying w.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.550
I'm going to put w here, so
what are the boundary conditions

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.990
that go with A transpose?

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.830
This thing, nothing
got knocked off.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.220
The boundary condition came
up here for A transpose,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.940
the boundary
condition was w_0=0.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:21.290
That got knocked
out, w_0 to be zero.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.230
No surprise.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.800
Free-fixed, this is the
free end at the left,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.000
this is the fixed
end at the right.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.720
Did you ever notice that
the matrix does it for you?

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.110
I mean, when you transpose that
matrix it just automatically

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:43.780
built in the correct
boundary conditions on w by,

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.130
you started with the conditions
on u, you transpose the matrix

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.700
and you've discovered what the
boundary conditions on w are.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:58.910
And I'm going to do the same
for the continuous problem.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.360
I'm going to do the same for
the continuous problem, so

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.980
the continuous free-fixed.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:14.410
OK, what's the boundary
condition on u?

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.930
If it's free-fixed, I just
want you to repeat this,

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.160
on the interval zero
to one for functions

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.380
u(x), w(x) instead
of for vectors.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.240
What's the boundary
condition on u,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.010
if I have a free-fixed
problem? u(1)=0.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.860
u of one equals zero.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.280
So this is the
boundary conditions

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.960
that goes with A in
the free-fixed case.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:54.710
And this is part
of A. That is part

00:24:54.710 --> 00:25:00.440
of A. I don't know what A
is until I know its boundary

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.260
condition.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.269
Just the way I don't
know what this matrix is.

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:05.810
It could have been
A_0, it could have

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.720
lost one column, it could have
lost two columns, whatever.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.830
I don't know until I've told
you the boundary condition on u.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.800
And then transposing is going
to tell me, automatically,

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.950
without any further input,
the boundary condition that

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.890
goes on the adjoint.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.110
So what's the boundary
condition on w that

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.160
goes as part of A transpose?

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.940
Well, you're going to tell me.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:36.590
Tell me. w(0) should be zero.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.650
It came out
automatically, naturally.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.940
This is a big distinction
between boundary conditions.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.080
I would call that an
essential boundary condition.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.350
I had to start with it,
I had to decide on that.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.290
And then this, I call a
natural boundary condition.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.110
Or there are even
two guys' names,

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.580
which are associated
with these two types.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.260
So maybe a first chance to
just mention these names.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:10.050
Because you'll often
see, reading some paper,

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:15.840
maybe a little on the
mathematical side,

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.060
you'll see that word used.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.870
The guy's name with this
sort of boundary condition

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.730
is a French name.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.720
Not so easy to say, Dirichlet.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.340
I'll say it more
often in the future.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:33.020
Anyway, I would call that a
Dirichlet condition and you

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.160
would say it's a fixed
boundary condition.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.310
And if you were
doing heat flow you

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.270
would say it's a
fixed temperature.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.290
Whatever.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:45.990
Fixed, is really the
word to remember there.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:51.460
OK, and then I guess I better
give Germany a shot here, too.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.580
So the natural
boundary condition

00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:04.520
is associated with
the name of Neumann.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.960
So if I said a Dirichlet
problem, a total Dirichlet

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.290
problem, I would be
speaking about fixed-fixed.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.410
And if I spoke about
a Neumann problem

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.710
I would be talking
about free-free.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:22.650
And this problem is Dirichlet at
one end, Neumann at the other.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.340
Anyway, so essential
and natural.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.980
And now of course I'm
hoping that that's

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:38.300
going to make this
boundary term go away.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.010
OK, now I'm paying
attention to this thing

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.070
that you made me write. uw.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.120
OK, what happens there?

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.280
uw?

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.240
Oh, right this
isn't bad because it

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.800
shows that there's a--
Boundary condition,

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.400
I've got some little
deals going with them

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:06.550
But do you see that
that becomes zero?

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.170
Why is it zero at
the top end, at one?

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:14.720
When I take u times w at
one, why do I get zero?

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.920
Because u(1) is zero.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.820
Good.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.540
And at the bottom end.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.730
When I take uw at the other
boundary, why do I get zero?

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.500
Because of w.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.780
You see that w was needed.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.350
That w(0) was needed because
there was no controlling u(0).

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.260
I had no control of u
at the left-hand end,

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.990
because it was free.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.290
So the control has
to come from w.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.360
And so w naturally
had to be zero,

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.650
because I wasn't controlling
u at that left-hand, free end.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:58.140
So one way or the other,
the integration by parts

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.970
is the key.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:07.320
So that's said what
I critically wanted

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:13.240
to say about transposing,
taking the adjoint,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.800
except I was just going to add
a comment about this square A

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.270
versus rectangular.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:24.040
And this was a case
of square, right?

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.455
This was a case,
this free-fixed case,

00:29:26.455 --> 00:29:29.480
this example I happened
to pick was square.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.680
A_0, the free-free guy that
was a hint on the quiz,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.090
was rectangular.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:37.550
The fixed-fixed, which
was also on the quiz,

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.120
was also rectangular.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.120
It was what, four by
three or something.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.990
This A is four by four.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:57.410
And what is especially
nice when it's square?

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.540
If our problem happens
to give a square matrix,

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.770
in the truss case if the
number of displacement unknowns

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:09.410
happens to equal the number
of bars, so m equals n,

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:14.870
I have a square matrix A. And
this guy's invertible, so it's

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.070
all good.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.780
Oh, that's maybe
the whole point.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.890
That if it's
rectangular I wouldn't

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.620
talk about its inverse.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.900
But this is a square matrix,
so A itself has an inverse.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.790
Instead of having,
as I usually have,

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.170
to deal with A transpose
C A all at once,

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:40.390
let me put this comment because
it's just a small one up here.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:41.760
Right under these words.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.910
Square versus rectangular.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:49.410
Square A, and let's
say invertible,

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.370
otherwise we're in
the unstable case,

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:55.690
so you know what I
mean, in the network

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:02.670
problems the number of nodes
matches the number of edges?

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:10.410
In the spring problem we
have free-fixed situations.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.660
Anyway, A comes out square.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.940
Whatever the application.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.400
If it comes out square,
what is especially good?

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.170
It comes out square,
what's especially

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.790
good is that it has an inverse.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:30.270
So that in this square case,
this K inverse is A transpose C

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:35.260
A inverse, can be split.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.300
This allows us to
separate, to do what

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.740
you better not do otherwise.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.550
In other words, we--
Our three steps,

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.550
which usually mash together
and we can't separate them

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.270
and we have to deal with
the whole matrix at once.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:58.940
In this square case,
they do separate.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.000
And so that's worth noticing.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:09.280
It means that we
can solve backwards,

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.490
we can solve these
three one at a time.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.940
The inverses can
be done separately.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.170
When A and A
transpose are square,

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.050
then from this
equation I can find w.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.630
From knowing w I
can find e, just

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.010
by inverting C. By
knowing e I can find u,

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.030
just by inverting A.
You see the three steps?

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.330
You could invert that, and then
you can invert the middle step,

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.920
and you can invert
A. And you've got u.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.540
So the square case
is worth noticing.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:46.450
It's special enough
that in this case

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.600
we would have an easy problem.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.790
And this case is called,
for trusses and mechanics,

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:55.840
there's a name for this.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.870
And unfortunately
it's a little long.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:01.600
Statically, that's
not the key word,

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:07.280
determinate is the key word.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:13.380
Statically determinate,
that goes with square.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.490
And you can guess what
the rectangular matrix A,

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.740
what word would I use, what's
the opposite of determinate?

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.420
It's got to be indeterminate.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.590
Rectangular A will
be indeterminate.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:30.000
And all that is
referring to is the fact

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:40.980
that in the determinate case the
forces determine the stresses.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.830
You don't have to take
that, get all three

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:48.280
together, mix them,
invert, go backwards.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:48.780
All that.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:53.450
You just can do them one at the
time in this determinate case.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:58.090
And now I guess I'd better
say, so here's the matrix case.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:02.710
But now in this chapter I always
have to do the continuous part.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:08.990
So let me just stay
with free-fixed,

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:11.690
what is this balance equation?

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:17.590
So this is my force balance.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:23.680
I didn't give it its moment
but its moment has come now.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.800
So the force balance
equation is -dw/dx,

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.050
because A transpose is minus
a derivative, equal f(x).

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:37.540
And my free boundary
condition, my free end,

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:43.170
gave me w of what was it?

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.150
The Neumann guy gave me w(0)=0.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.430
And what's the point?

00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:54.030
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.940
I'm saying that this free-fixed
is a beautiful example

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.840
of determinate.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.110
Square matrix A
in the matrix case

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:07.285
and the parallel in
the continuous case

00:35:07.285 --> 00:35:09.480
is-- I can solve that for w(x).

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.690
I can solve directly for w(x).

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:24.920
Without involving, you see
I didn't have to know c(x).

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.740
I hadn't even got that far.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.890
I'm just going backwards now.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:35.200
I can solve this, just the
way I can invert that matrix.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.040
Inverting the matrix here is the
same as solving the equation.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.420
You see I have a first
order, first derivative?

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.750
I mean, it's a trivial
equation, right?

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:48.350
It's the equation you solved in
the final problem of the quiz,

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.370
where an f was a delta function.

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:55.670
It was simple because it was
a square, determinate problem

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.890
with one condition on w.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:08.330
When both conditions are on u,
then it's not square any more.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.760
OK for that point?

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.170
Determinate versus
indeterminate.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.020
OK.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:19.170
So that's sort of, and
I could do examples.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.750
Maybe I've asked
you on the homework

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.080
to take a particular f(x).

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.120
I hope it was a
free-fixed problem,

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.960
if I was feeling good that
day, because free-fixed you'll

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.430
be able to get w(x) right away.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:34.070
If it was fixed-fixed
then I apologize,

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:39.130
it's going to take you a
little bit longer to get to w.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.490
To get to u.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:41.990
OK.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:47.920
But this, of course,
I just integrate.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:55.110
Inverting a difference matrix
is just integrating a function.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.040
Good.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:03.150
OK, so this lecture so
far was the transition

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:09.380
from vectors and
matrices to functions

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.130
and continuous problems.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.760
And then, of course
we're going to get deep

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:18.260
into that because we got partial
differential equations ahead.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:21.810
But today let's stay
in one dimension

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.220
and introduce finite elements.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.710
OK.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:34.000
Ready for finite elements,
so that's now a major step.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.040
Finite differences, maybe
I'll mention this, probably

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.550
in this afternoon's review
session, where I'll just

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.070
be open to homework problems.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.430
I'll say something more
about truss examples,

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.070
and I might say something about
finite differences for this.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:55.620
But really, it's finite elements
that get introduced right now.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.790
So let me do that.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:02.690
Finite elements and
introducing them.

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:06.290
OK.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.690
So the prep, the getting
ready for finite elements

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.120
is to get hold of
something called

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:23.040
the weak form of the equation.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.150
So that's going to be a
statement of the-- Finite

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.740
elements aren't appearing yet.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.700
Matrices are not appearing yet.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:38.090
I'm talking about the
differential equation.

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:41.340
But what do I mean
by this weak form?

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.680
OK, let me just go
for it directly.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.310
You see the equation up there?

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.420
Let me copy it.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:52.360
So here's the strong form.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.770
The strong form is, you would
say, the ordinary equation.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:39:00.280
Strong form is what
our equation is, minus

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:11.730
d/dx of c(x) du/dx equal f(x).

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.180
OK, that's the strong form.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.650
That's the equation.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:19.110
Now, how do I get
to the weak form?

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:23.310
Let me just go to it directly
and then over the next days

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:27.330
we'll see why it's so
natural and important.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:31.390
If I go for it directly,
what I do is this.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:35.350
I multiply both sides of
the equation by something

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.340
I'll call a test function.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.370
And I'll try to
systematically use

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:43.090
the letter v for the
test function. u will

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:48.880
be the solution. v
isn't the solution,

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.440
v is like any function that I
test this equation in this way.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.320
I'm just multiplying both sides
by the same thing, some v(x).

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.570
Any v(x).

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:03.360
We'll see if there are
any limitations, OK?

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:14.450
And I integrate.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:15.980
OK.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.910
So you're going to
say nope, no problem.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:22.240
I integrate from zero to one.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:30.730
Alright, this would
be true for f.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:34.050
So now I'll erase
the word strong form,

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.500
because the strong form
isn't on the board anymore.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.110
It's the weak form now
that we're looking at.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:44.250
And this is for any, and
I'll put "any" in quotes

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:51.690
just because eventually I'll
say a little more about this.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:56.470
I'll write the
equation this way.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:41:04.830
And you might think, OK, if
this has to hold for every v(x),

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:09.370
I could let v(x) be
concentrated in a little area.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.090
And this would
have to hold, then

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.650
I could try another
v(x), concentrated

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.130
around other points.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:23.360
You can maybe feel that if
this holds for every v(x),

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.950
then I can get back
to the strong form.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.640
If this holds for every
v(x), then somehow

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.310
that had better be
the same as that.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:37.160
Because if this was
f(x)+1 and this is f(x),

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.650
then I wouldn't have
the equality any more.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.200
Should I just say that again?

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.410
It's just like, at this
point it's just a feeling,

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:51.370
that if this is
true for every v(x),

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:55.360
then that part had
better equal that part.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.500
That'll be my way back
to the strong form.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.610
It's a little bit
like climbing a hill.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.690
Going downhill was easy, I just
multiplied by v and integrated.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.500
Nobody objected to that.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.270
I'm saying I'll be
able to get back

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.740
to the strong form
with a little patience.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.160
But I like the weak form.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.700
That's the whole point.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.120
You've got to begin
to like the weak form.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.120
If you begin to take
it in and think OK.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.270
Now, why do I like it?

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:28.020
What am I going to
do to that left side?

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.100
The right side's cool, right?

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.530
It looks good.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:35.520
Left side does not
look good to me.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.370
When you see something like
that, what do you think?

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:42.310
Today's lecture has
already said what to think.

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:46.160
What should I do to
make that look better?

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.410
I should, yep.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.540
Integrate by parts.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.360
If I integrate by
parts, you see what

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:56.870
I don't like about it as it is,
is two derivatives are hitting

00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:01.180
u, and v is by itself.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:05.370
And I want it to be symmetric.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.340
I'm going to integrate
this by parts,

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.090
this is minus the
derivative of something.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:15.900
Times v. And when I integrate
by parts, I'm going to have,

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.450
it'll be an integral.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.980
And can you integrate
by parts now?

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.840
I mean, you probably haven't
thought about integration

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.120
by parts for a while.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.490
Just think of it as taking
the derivative off of this,

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:32.620
so it leaves that by itself.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:41.000
And putting it onto v, so
it's dv/dx, and remembering

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.250
the minus sign, but
we have a minus sign

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.480
so now it's coming up plus.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.580
That's the weak form.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:50.870
Can I put a circle
around the weak form?

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:53.670
Well, that wasn't
exactly a circle.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:54.360
OK.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.880
But that's the weak form.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.310
For every v, this
is-- I could give you

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:10.040
a physical interpretation but
I won't do it just this minute.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:16.210
This is going to hold for
any v. That's the weak form.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:17.600
OK.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.650
Good.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:25.000
Now, why did I want to do that?

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.580
The person who reminds me
about boundary conditions

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.380
should remind me again.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.610
That when I did this
integration by parts,

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:38.480
there should have been also--
What's the integrated part now,

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.550
that has to be evaluated
at zero and one?

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:47.160
This c, so it's that
times that, right?

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:53.110
It's that c(x) du/dx times v(x).

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.849
Maybe minus.

00:44:57.849 --> 00:44:58.640
Yeah, you're right.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.960
Minus.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.070
Good.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:03.870
What do I want this to come out?

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.550
Zero, of course.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.010
I don't want to think
about this anymore.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:11.750
Alright, so now I'm doing
this free-fixed problem still.

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:16.710
So what's the deal about
the free-fixed f problem?

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:22.830
Well, let's see.

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.680
OK, I got the two ends and
I want them to be zero.

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:36.840
OK, now at the free
end, I'm not controlling

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.130
v. I wasn't controlling
u and I'm not

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:43.130
going to be controlling
its friend v.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.880
So this had to be zero.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:52.210
So this part will be
zero at the free end.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:56.220
That boundary condition has
just appeared again naturally.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.250
I had to have it because
I had no control over v.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.830
And what about at the fixed end.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:06.930
At the fixed end,
which-- Is that?

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:07.650
At the free end.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.320
Now, what's up at the fixed end?

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.960
What was the fixed end?

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.230
That's where u was zero.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:20.110
I'm going to make v also zero.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.910
So there's, when
I said any v(x),

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:32.230
I better put in with v=0
at the Dirichlet point,

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:37.070
at fixed point, at fixed end.

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:40.050
I need that.

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:44.450
I need to know that v
is zero at that end.

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.730
I had u=0.

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:50.350
Here's why I'm fine.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:55.000
So I'm saying that any time
I have a Dirichlet condition,

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.030
a fixed condition that
tells me u, I think of v

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:02.500
and you'll begin to think of
v as a little movement away

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:13.170
from u. u is the solution.

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:16.350
Now, remind me,
this was free-fixed.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:21.030
So the u might have been
something like this.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.600
I just draw that.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.140
That's my u.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.370
This guy was fixed, right?

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:29.220
By u.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:34.050
Now, I'm thinking of
v's as, the letter

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:36.070
v is very fortunate
because it stands

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.310
for virtual displacement.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:41.480
A virtual displacement is
a little displacement away

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:46.940
from u, but it has to satisfy
the zero-- the fixed condition

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.210
that u satisfied.

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:50.660
In other words, the
little virtual v

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.340
can't move away from zero.

00:47:53.340 --> 00:48:02.680
So I get this term is
zero at the fixed end.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.060
OK.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.640
That's the little
five minute time-out

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.040
to check the boundary
condition part.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.090
The net result is
that that term's gone

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:21.560
and I've got the weak
form as I wanted.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:26.950
OK, three minutes to
start to tell you how to

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.400
use the weak form.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:39.620
So this is called
Galerkin's method.

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:50.250
And it starts with
the weak form.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:51.700
So he's Russian.

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.170
Russia gets into
the picture now.

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:56.770
We had France and Germany
with the boundary conditions,

00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:00.480
now we've got Russia with
this fundamental principle

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.320
of how to turn a
continuous problem

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.730
into a discrete problem.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.930
That's what
Galerkin's idea does.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.900
Instead of a function unknown
I want to have n unknowns.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:18.210
I want to get a discrete
equation which will eventually

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:26.440
be KU=F. So I'm going to
get to an equation KU=F,

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.320
but not by finite
difference, right?

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.330
I could, but I'm not.

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:36.130
I'm doing it this weak,
Galerkin, finite element way.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:42.780
OK, so if I tell you the
Galerkin idea then next time we

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.370
bring in, we have libraries
of finite elements.

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:48.850
But you have to get
the principle straight.

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:51.240
So it's Galerkin's idea.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:50:01.220
Galerkin's idea was was
choose trial functions.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:10.370
Let me call them call them u_1?

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:16.360
No, I won't call them--
Have to get the names right.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:21.550
Phi.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.280
OK, the Greeks get a shot.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.000
OK.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.050
Trial functions,
phi_1(x) up to phi_n(x).

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:35.840
OK, so that's a choice you make.

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.790
And we have a free choice.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.710
And it's a fundamental choice
for all of applied math here.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:43.430
You choose some functions,
and if you choose them well

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:45.560
you get a great method,
if you choose them badly

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.010
you got a lousy method.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.200
OK, so you choose
trial functions,

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.120
and now what's the
idea going to be?

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:58.270
Your approximate U,
approximate solution

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:03.410
will be some
combination of this.

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:09.160
So combinations of those, let
me call the coefficients U's,

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.770
because those are the unknowns.

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:12.590
Plus U_n*phi_n.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.910
So those are the unknowns.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:23.820
The n unknowns.

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:28.100
I'll even remove
that for the moment.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:31.740
You see, these are
functions of x.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.030
And these are numbers.

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:38.330
So our unknown, our
n unknown numbers

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:41.720
are the coefficients to be
decided of the functions

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.230
we chose.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:47.260
OK, now I need n equations.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.500
I've got n unknowns now,
they're the unknown coefficients

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.180
of these functions.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:58.480
I need an equation so I get
n equations by choose test

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:08.780
functions, V_1, V_2, up to V_n.

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.280
Each V will give me an equation.

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:14.640
So I'll have n equations at
the end, I have n unknowns,

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.390
I'll have a square matrix.

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:20.390
And that'll be a linear system.

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.630
I'll get to KU=F.

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.740
But do you see how
I'm getting there?

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:28.710
I'm getting there by
using the weak form,

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:32.180
by using Galerkin's idea
of picking some trial

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:35.020
functions, and some
test functions,

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.500
and putting them
into the weak form.

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.700
So Galerkin's idea is,
take these functions

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.160
and these functions.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.030
And apply the weak form
just to those guys.

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:50.420
Not to, the real weak form,
the continuous weak form,

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:54.910
was for a whole lot of
V. We'll get n equations

00:52:54.910 --> 00:53:01.570
by picking n V's, and we'll get
n unknowns by picking n phis.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:04.420
So this method, this idea,
was a hundred years older

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.340
than finite elements.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:11.210
The finite element idea
was a particular choice

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:16.250
of these guys, a particular
choice of the phis

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:21.900
and the V's as
simple polynomials.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.520
And you might think
well, why didn't Galerkin

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.760
try those first, maybe he did.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:34.650
But the key is that now,
with the computing power

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.550
we now have compared
to Galerkin,

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:40.050
we can choose
thousands of functions.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.770
If we keep them simple.

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:46.330
So that's really what the
finite element brought,

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:49.440
finite element brought
is, keep the functions

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.440
as simple polynomials
and take many of them.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.610
Where Galerkin, who
didn't have MATLAB,

00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:00.580
he probably didn't even
have a desk computer,

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.130
he used pencil and paper,
he took one function.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:05.620
Or maybe two.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:08.820
I mean, that took him a day.

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.740
But we take thousands of
functions, simple functions,

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:17.840
and we'll see on Friday the
steps that get us to KU=F.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.280
So this is the prep
for finite elements.
