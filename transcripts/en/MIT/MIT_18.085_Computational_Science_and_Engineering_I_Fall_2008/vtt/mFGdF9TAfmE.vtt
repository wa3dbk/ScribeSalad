00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.880
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so this
is the second, last lecture

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.800
on trusses.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.440
Then we've got a
holiday on Monday.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.230
And then after that
we'll be into Chapter 3.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.030
I thought I'd write down just
in case it's any use to you,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.060
the four problems that
I intend to include

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.100
with the next homework.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.560
That won't be due for quite
a while, a week from Monday.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.430
So these will be the
problems on trusses

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.570
that come from particular
trusses drawn in the book.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.650
And then there'll be some
problems from the new material,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.510
that we do next week.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.480
So trusses and really, there's
two main jobs for today.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.220
One is to identify
this matrix A,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.080
the strain-displacement matrix
or the stretching matrix.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.400
How far do the bars stretch?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.870
Everybody remembers A is
going to come in this step.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.450
If we have displacements,
then, of the nodes like,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.320
this would be like a u_1, this
would be a u_1^H and a u_1^V,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.070
this would be a
u_2^H and a u_2^V,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.070
so there are four movements
of the ends of the truss

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.060
and of one particular bar, and
then we'll stretch that bar.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.220
And the question, is how much?

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.470
So that will be one row of
A. So if we follow one bar,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.910
you remember in the
matrix A, there's

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.790
going to be a row for every bar.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.090
So a row for each, row
of A. For each bar.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.560
And if we track down
one of those rows,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.310
we'll have the idea.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.570
And then of course
at the end we'd

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.860
maybe be constructing A
without, sort of a free-free A.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.090
And then at the end,
any fixed displacements

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.350
that will knock out columns
of A. So that's one job.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.835
And then to see,
so the A is going

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:39.430
to be a little more messy.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.930
It's because we're
in two dimensions.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.380
So compared to the
network problems, and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.320
and the line of springs,
now we have more happening.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.990
We've got more columns
because every node has now two

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.590
unknowns.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.140
A horizontal and vertical.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.990
So A is kind of bigger.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.410
And therefore A transpose
C A, you might think,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.480
it's going to be hard
to see what's going on.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.600
But you'll see the
right way to look

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.880
at A transpose C A
is a bar at a time.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.700
That's the nice fact
about A transpose C A,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.330
I might focus on that first.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.820
And then comes the fun part.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.760
I'll draw some more
trusses, that may or may not

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.410
have mechanisms.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.510
They may or may not be stable.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.820
And we can try to
identify the mechanisms.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.370
Actually, as before.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.390
We'll do it by
engineering instinct

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.320
rather than by solving.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.840
I mean, in principle, we
could always use elimination.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.830
Or ask MATLAB or any
other system to do it,

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.030
and look for the
solutions to Au=0.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.860
And decide are the
columns of A independent.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.280
In that case the
truss is stable.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.610
This matrix is
invertible, we know

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.690
all the good possibilities.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.140
And then there's the more
interesting possibility,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.850
of having some
solutions to that.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.520
In which case that
matrix will be singular.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.310
There'll be some modes
in our big system

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.990
that will cause it to fail.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.040
But it's kind of
fun to find those.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.730
OK, while I've written
A transpose C A,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.560
may I remind you about a good
way to do that multiplication.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.310
OK, so imagine I'm
just putting a number.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.420
Here's going to be the
matrix A. So the matrix A

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.930
will have a bunch of rows,
row one, row two, so on.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.410
These rows will correspond
to bar one, bar two, and bar

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.620
three.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.390
OK.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.750
OK, then we have C, so
that's a square matrix.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.100
That each bar has a spring
constant, so c_1, c_2, c_3,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.210
and then we have A transpose.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.710
And those rows, or
columns of A transpose.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.270
So that's the sort of
picture of A transpose C A,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.140
for a three-bar,
three bars only.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.870
But the point is
made right here.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.470
There's a row of
A for every bar.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.210
Right?

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.970
Because our matrix A is m by n.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.110
If there are m bars, a
row for every bar, and it

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.670
tells us how far that
bar is stretched.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.510
And we'll figure out
what its entries are.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.210
That's our main job.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.440
I'm just looking ahead.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.820
Suppose we've got that row.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.320
And that row, and that row.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.790
So a row for every bar.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.960
Now, here I've taken three bars.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.150
Now, how do I multiply
those matrices?

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.380
Well, I can do it
different ways.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.800
But here's a cool way to do it.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.400
Just-- The way I want to
point out is column times row.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.750
If you multiply matrices you're
allowed to-- The effective c_1,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.950
c_2, c_3, is going
to be very simple.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.850
So I'm really paying
attention here

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.740
to A transpose A. If I want
to multiply A transpose A,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.680
I can do row times column
as usual and get one number.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:46.140
Or I can do column times row
and get a whole little matrix.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.720
And that's the bar one matrix.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.620
It's the element
matrix, and that's

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.350
how finite elements
will be assembled,

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.710
and that's why I should
keep mentioning this point.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.880
So the way to do
that column times

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.170
row thing, and then of course
that c_1 just multiplies

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.750
that row, that'll be c_1.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:18.360
Row one, transpose, that's
the column, times row one.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.580
That's what's
coming from bar one.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.150
That column multiplies
the c_1 and that row.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:30.390
You see how nice, that's the
element matrix associated

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.720
with the first bar.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.850
And then there'll be a
second column times the c_2,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.050
times the second row.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:43.710
So plus c_2, row two
transpose, row two.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.230
That's a matrix again.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:52.840
Plus c_3, row three
transpose, row three.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.320
I focus on that because you
don't think of this as a way

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.980
to multiply matrices, but it's
really a nice thing to notice.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.220
And it's better to
notice it now when

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:10.420
we have three bars or something,
than in a big finite element

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.210
code.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.020
Yeah.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:18.840
So this is, just if I complete
it, complete this thought,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.490
this I would call
a one bar matrix.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.640
That's the matrix A transpose
A if there's only one bar.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.790
Actually, one of the problems
at the end of this section

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.770
is find the element
matrix for one bar.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.810
And I guess it's
about what we're

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.970
going to get to when
we do that one bar.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.030
Do you remember
what it was in the,

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.480
just to connect
this thought, what

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.740
was the little matrix
in the case of networks?

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.790
So in the case of
networks, there

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.220
was just one unknown
for each, not two.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.920
So for networks, just, I'm
just going to put down the,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.010
and you'll recognize
it immediately.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.480
The little element matrix
was the c for that,

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.010
and there was a
[1, -1; -1, 1] what?

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.280
Do you remember that guy that
was the [-1, 1] from a row?

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.680
[-1, 1] from a column?

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.590
So this was exactly
c times the [-1, 1]

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.800
from the column times the
[-1,  1] from the row.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.000
That's where this simple
little matrix came from.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.290
And you remember
that the, so what's

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.870
involved in creating
this big A transpose

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:52.020
C A is just create all
these little pieces, which

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.042
are like this, but they're
going to be a little bigger.

00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:56.750
In fact, in a minute
I'm going to ask you

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.860
what size they'll be.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.770
Well, they're
really big matrices.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.950
There are a whole lot of zeroes
there that I didn't even put.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.210
Zeroes are there for rows
and columns that aren't

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.270
touching this particular edge.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.300
And again, this matrix.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.440
There'll be all
kinds of zeroes in A.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.070
Because a typical
row of A, bar one,

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:27.450
is going to have non-zeroes only
for the, yeah what's the size?

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.350
How many non-zeroes
in a typical row of A?

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.390
Getting the count right first
is like half the battle.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.620
How many non-zeroes
in a typical row of A?

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.430
This was the network case
where we had a couple of nodes.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.830
And they were connected.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.730
And we had an
unknown at each end.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.110
So two unknowns were involved.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.590
The little matrix
was two by two.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:58.040
It properly has lots of zeroes
for all the other nodes that

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.470
are not involved.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:04.080
And then that matrix
kind of gets, assembled

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.840
is the word I
think usually used.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.190
All these little guys
get assembled, you

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:15.330
know, pasted, stamped, I hear
as the verb sometimes now.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.980
Take these little matrices
for this little element.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:27.290
And stamp them into the big A
transpose C A. This is the c_1,

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.630
so this gives the
c_1's in the matrix.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.980
And the c_2's and the c_3's.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.830
Alright.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.560
Now, just before we-- I'm
like doing this preliminary,

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.740
before I write down
anything, the exact row.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:48.030
What's the size of, for
trusses, how many non-zeroes

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.390
in a row of A?

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.930
So that's my question.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:58.460
How many non-zeroes in a
typical row, like for that bar,

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:05.470
non-zeroes in a row of A?

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:12.620
So A is the matrix that tells
us how much, that row of A

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.990
is the row that tells us how
much this bar stretched when

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:24.010
this moved along by u H
1, and up by you u V 1,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:32.520
and this moved along by
say, u H 2, and up by u V 2.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.010
Well, I've written all those in.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.980
So that you can
tell me this number.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.940
How many?

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.280
What's your guess?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.520
When I tell you,
you'll say of course.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.350
How many u's are involved in
the stretching of that bar?

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:49.560
Four.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.700
Four.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.680
Exactly.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.940
Instead of one at each end,
we have two at each end.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.700
So the answer is four.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.970
How many, the answer is four.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:03.800
And now the only remaining
question is, what are they?

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.730
What are those four numbers?

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.850
The four non-zeroes in the row?

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.320
So let me just answer that.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.130
They are, so here is that row.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:22.770
So we the two non-zeroes
associated with it.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.549
Well, the way I've numbered
these nodes one and two--

00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:28.090
Since I've numbered
them one and two,

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.570
the non-zeroes are going
to come right at the start.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.340
And then a whole
lot, then this is all

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.930
going to be zero after that.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.810
Because those will be nodes
three, four, or five, whatever,

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.280
that don't involve bar one.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.530
So bar one just connects
node one to node two.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.020
Now, what do you think?

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.570
Well, let me put in
the key quantity here.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.460
This bar is at an angle.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.670
It's at an angle theta.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.760
So there's a theta.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.650
Angle theta.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.300
OK.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:10.840
And so that angle is going
to enter these things.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.980
In fact, here's what you get.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.920
You get, I think if I put the
one up there and the two down

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.250
there, let's see.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.250
What am I thinking now?

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:26.490
I'm saying if u 1 H
is positive, that's

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.330
going to stretch the bar.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.180
That's a positive stretching.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.370
So I'm expecting a
positive u 1 H to give me,

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.660
I'm expecting that sort of
to come in with a plus sign.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:42.100
Now suppose the
bar is horizontal.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.790
Suppose the bar is
horizontal, then

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.960
how much does the
u 1 H stretch it?

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.840
It stretches it by the
whole u 1 H, right?

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.170
If the bar was horizontal,
so theta equals zero.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:02.230
I'm just doing these, we got
to sort out this theta angle

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.770
stuff.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.270
So here's my thing.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.940
If the bar happens
to be horizontal,

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:13.660
then that stretching by
u H 1, will completely

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.370
stretch the bar.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.210
If the bar happened
to be-- Yeah yeah.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.210
And of course, this way.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.820
So that for a horizontal bar,
I'll just be back to this step.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:32.990
I'll have a one and a minus
one. u-- Oh yeah, remind me

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.160
about that.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.900
Why doesn't u vertical, for
a horizontal bar like this,

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:46.400
why does this one
not stretch the bar?

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.960
You remember that
from last time,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:53.810
that was the little bit of
trig that we did when we forced

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.300
ourselves to stay linear.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.680
So we dropped the second
order correction, that

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.160
would come from going this way.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.690
Right?

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.710
I mean you must have
noticed, like walking?

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.050
Suppose you want to walk from
here to the end of the bar, OK?

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.690
Well, if somebody moves
the end of the bar forward,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.520
you have to take
those extra steps.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.520
The bar really stretches.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.140
But, if somebody moves
the bar this way,

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:28.590
then the extra bit of
length is much less.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:33.860
In fact, it's zero
to first order.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.590
This is like taking
shortcuts when

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.410
you walk across the courtyard.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:45.310
So when the angle's
theta, I'm only

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.090
expecting a one and a minus one.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.030
On the horizontal.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.260
And zeroes on the vertical.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.970
OK, now I'm ready
to write it in.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.480
I think when the angle's
theta, when the angle's theta,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.500
any theta, that was
when the angle was zero,

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.050
I think we get a cos theta.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.390
Doesn't your instinct
say that this

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.940
is on the u_1, u horizontal 1.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:17.970
And then the u vertical 1,
tell me what these should be.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:22.870
And then we'll make,
what do you suppose

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.650
is the entry, second non-zero,
the one that corresponds

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.020
to a vertical movement.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.970
Here it would be,
for a horizontal bar

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.790
when theta is zero, I'm
going to see a zero there.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.590
But if the bar is at
an angle like this,

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.280
what am I going to see?

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.670
Everybody's going
to get it right?

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.510
What do I put in there?

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.320
Sine theta.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.330
What else could it be?

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.760
Right, OK, sin(theta).

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.680
And now what about the next
guy, the other end of the bar?

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:59.790
u H 2 and u V 2, those are
the other two non-zeroes.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.380
What your guess
for u 2 H, u H 2?

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:11.820
If I move this forward,
what's the change

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.030
in length of the bar?

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:20.110
What would your guess
be that goes into there?

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.110
Say it again?

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.110
-cos(theta).

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.550
-cos(theta), right, yeah.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.020
The movement of
the other end, like

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.910
if I move this guy a
little bit to this side.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.240
That will shorten the bar.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.340
Forget about that one.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:43.770
If I move this over,
the bar becomes shorter.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:51.860
And the cosine tells me
the key number there,

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.710
how much it becomes shorter.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.660
If the bar was horizontal,
the cos(theta) was one,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.300
it counts a hundred percent.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.570
If the bar is vertical,
and I move it horizontally,

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.940
it comes zero percent.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:11.810
Because the linearity says
there was no first order change.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.980
And now tell me the
final non-zero entry.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.280
And I see I didn't leave
much room for all the zeroes.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:24.580
OK, what's the u 2 V entry?

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.910
-sin(theta), of course.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:33.810
And then come all the zeroes,
for whatever other joints

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.950
are not involved with bar one.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.750
So let me, maybe to
make this picture best,

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.340
I should move that over
to where it belongs.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:49.160
Now, if I add up along a bar,
add up the four numbers there,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.980
what do I get?

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.360
Zero.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.180
You expected that, right?

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.260
In fact, if I add just
that and that I get zero.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.090
If I add that and
that I get zero.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.030
Just the way I got zero here.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.000
In the incidence matrices.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.670
The column of all ones is
certainly going to solve Au=0.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:22.300
Unless the supports
remove those, of course.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.230
If the supports
don't allow all ones

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.040
because some have
to stay at zero,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.840
then I could have
a stable truss.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.160
OK, that's a typical bar.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.840
A typical row.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.910
That's a typical row.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:43.320
OK, and now maybe while I'm
on the same subject, what

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:52.940
is the size, what does
this thing look like now?

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:58.070
This is in A. This
is in the matrix A,

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.970
and now I want to
ask you before I even

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.340
come back to all this stuff,
what about in A transpose A?

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.620
In A transpose A, A transpose
C A, it the whole deal.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:17.210
The element for-- The little
matrix, the element matrix,

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.640
can I call it that?

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:25.790
Or the one-bar matrix,
call it the one-bar matrix.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:31.200
Will be, is what?

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.550
So I want this, it would
be typical-- c_1, row one

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:41.030
transpose, row one,
that's the typical guy.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:48.300
And how many non-zeroes in that?

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.160
Multiplying a row.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.490
Sorry, multiplying
a column that has

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.640
four non-zeroes
times a row that has

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.880
four non-zeroes times a
number, which is just fine.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.860
How many non-zeroes are
going to sit in this element

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.610
matrix, this one-bar matrix?

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.110
16.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.180
16 non-zeroes.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:24.590
And they're going to be, I have
cosine, sine, minus cosine,

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:30.400
minus sine, multiplying cosine,
sine, minus cosine, minus sine.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.620
And all multiplied by c_1.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.850
So that's the matrix.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:40.550
And you see what it looks
like. c squared, cs, so on.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.470
16 guys.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:50.170
So we have four squared as our
element matrix, where here we

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.920
had two squared.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:59.490
And in finite elements,
when you get to elasticity,

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:07.250
and you've got triangles,
you've got triangular elements,

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.280
then there are three
nodes involved.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.120
So you're up to higher numbers.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.320
But this gives you the idea.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.480
And remember that this four
by four, the way I've done it,

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.330
the way I've numbered
it, one, two,

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.430
happens to sit up in
the upper left corner.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:29.550
Of A transpose C A. But
can you sort of imagine

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.810
how the code would be written?

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.570
The code would be
written, take each bar,

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.410
and what do I have to
know about the bar?

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.540
Just imagine a code
that would do trusses.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.940
Actually, the final
problem that I'm not

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.520
assigning in this section says
what would the code be like?

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:55.380
Can we just have a think
about what the code would look

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.780
like if we were to write it.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:03.850
What would the input have to be?

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:08.180
For each bar, what
input do I need?

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:14.710
For this bar, I need to know--
And for the whole truss.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.190
What do I have to tell,
what's the information that I

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.390
need for the whole truss?

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:25.610
I have to know the positions
of all of the joints, right?

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.830
So I'd have to know the
coordinates of that, (x, y),

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:34.930
the coordinates of this one,
(x_1, y_1) for joint one,

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.010
(x_2, y_2).

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:40.130
So I'd have to have a little
list of what would that be?

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.420
m by two?

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.260
Oh, no.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:44.980
N. N by 2.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:50.070
I have N, what do I have now?

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.160
Think of what
information do I have

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.680
to report about this truss?

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.090
I guess I have N,
capital N, joints.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.560
And I need two coordinates,
x, y for each position.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.440
So that's N by 2, this.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.650
OK, and then for every bar,
what do I need to tell it?

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.980
What do I need to put in
the code for a typical bar?

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:19.550
I certainly have to put
in the c for that bar.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.780
And what else do I need to know?

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.980
I need to know which
joints it's connected.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.660
Right?

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.360
I have to tell the system
that this bar is between two

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.770
and one, one and two.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.970
I have to tell it which pair.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:42.690
So I guess I have a list
of m bars, and for each bar

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:48.840
I must tell the system
the two node numbers,

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.460
and the c, the stiffness.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.860
The constant for Hooke's Law.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.600
Right, do you see this picture?

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:02.080
Just sort of visualizing,
creating a code here.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.580
And then the code
would do all this,

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.800
oh, have I given enough
information to find theta?

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.860
Or do I have to
import theta also?

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.720
No.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.120
I told you the
positions, so it'll

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.090
figure out cos(theta)
theta and sin(theta).

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.820
It actually won't
figure out theta,

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.670
that's always a
dumb thing to do,

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.990
find the actual
angle. cos(theta)

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.760
and sin(theta) is the
quantities we want.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.950
So given that position, (x, y),
and this position (x_2, y_2),

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.460
it would know cos(theta)
and sin(theta).

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.170
And having drawn
his picture allows

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.280
me to make once
more the key point

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.530
about small displacements.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:49.360
What's the angle of the
bar after it's moved?

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.720
After it's displaced?

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.180
It was theta before
it was displaced,

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.990
and the angle after is theta.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.980
To first order, the
angle doesn't change.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:07.690
Because these are little
tiny movements of the ends.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.840
I've drawn them much bigger
than they should be drawn.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.870
They're little, tiny
movements of the ends

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:18.520
so that the angle is not
significantly changed.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.200
Otherwise we're into
geometric nonlinearity

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.600
and that stuff, that makes
the problem much, much harder.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.140
OK, are you seeing
sort of the picture?

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.660
I guess what I
haven't completely--

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.890
I've really depended
more on your intuition

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.980
than on a calculation to
say that these are the four

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.410
non-zeroes.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.270
What did I ask you to do?

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.440
I asked you to check that that
was right in the extreme cases,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.570
like if theta is zero,
the bar is horizontal,

00:27:54.570 --> 00:28:00.270
then we just have a 1, 0, -1,
0; vertical isn't happening.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:04.350
If the bar is vertical so that
the angle is 90 degrees then

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:09.350
we would have a 0, 1, 0,
-1; everything's vertical.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.040
And the book draws
a little picture,

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:20.620
and computes delta l from
these four small movements.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.100
And takes the leading
term and sure enough it

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:30.790
produces that row of the matrix.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.910
Gosh, I talk real fast.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:38.880
But do you think you could
now create the stiffness?

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:46.430
If you had a real truss, you
could create the matrix A

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.180
for it?

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.390
C is simple, it's given to you.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.970
You could create
A transpose C A?

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.870
You might just want to
write the command as A'

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:03.900
* C * A or something.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.280
And let MATLAB do the thinking.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.760
But I wanted to
just see what these,

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:18.530
how this four by four piece
appears in this product,

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.660
from each bar.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:26.170
The 16 non-zeroes will
appear in different positions

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:30.750
and you told the code
what those positions are.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:35.190
You had to give the code
a local-to-global picture.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.670
This is the local picture.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.370
Watch one bar.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:45.040
Then it has to fit in
this big n by n matrix,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:50.470
and that means you
have to know what

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.700
joints was that bar connecting.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:30:05.560
So which positions do these
16 non-zeroes assemble into?

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.680
That's some time
devoted to a job

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.770
that I actually don't
plan to require you to do.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.220
Creating this truss problem.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.760
What I think is kind of more
fun and that's, these homework

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:30.050
problems would deal with it,
is part two of the lecture.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:33.870
Going back to
mechanisms, and now

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:42.870
thinking about more
complicated trusses.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:47.140
We now in principle could
find the solutions to Au=0

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.010
because we now
have constructed A,

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:55.000
and we could get MATLAB to do
the work or Python or whoever.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.660
But can I go to part
two now and draw a truss

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:05.080
and ask you about
the mechanisms?

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.240
Let's see.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:15.600
I guess somewhere
in the problem set,

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:25.810
but not one of the assigned ones
is-- Start with those six bars.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:33.350
And six joints, so
these are six joints.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:42.400
And OK, as it stands, how
many-- That's a good question.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:47.100
As it stands, what's the
shape of the matrix A?

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.720
How many rows has it got?

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.760
So as it stands, so
I'll call it A_0,

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.560
for no supports have been added.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.990
A_0, just the full matrix.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.140
Is what shape?

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.330
6 by 12.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:06.830
Good.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.260
6 by 12.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.490
Is 6 by 12.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.890
OK, of course it's not stable.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:13.770
We know that.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.340
We haven't supported anything.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:24.050
So in a typical case,
how many solutions to A,

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:28.430
so I'm going to ask you
how many solutions to Au=0?

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.730
And what's your guess?

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.570
Six.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:42.170
Got six equations,
we've got 12 u's, 12-6,

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.990
so this is going to be 12-6.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:49.560
And of course six
solutions to that equation.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.300
It's what I would expect.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.510
There could be, it
could be possible

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:59.400
that the six equations
are not independent.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.740
If they really dropped
to five then this

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.710
would bump up to seven, I don't
think it's going to happen.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.930
Now, can you describe those
six solutions, not with

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.980
numbers, just with, tell me.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.640
I hope you can, because
I can't right now.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.560
OK, three of them we know.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:31.130
So with no supports at all,
what are three rigid motions?

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.470
And what are they?

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:38.190
The whole truss could move to
the right, the whole hexagon.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.780
It could all move up, it could
all rotate about one point.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:47.090
All three of those would
be movements, displacements

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.930
that don't stretch anything.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.150
OK, three rigid motions.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:59.200
Across, up, and rotate.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.110
OK, and I can get rid of those
by supporting some nodes.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:07.690
But let me see, I don't
know what's going to happen.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:14.290
When I describe this topic
as the fun one in 18.085,

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.420
it's more fun for
you than for me.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:21.580
Because I draw something like
that and I start worrying can

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:26.010
I think of three-- How many
mechanisms to look for?

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:26.930
Three.

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:31.570
That's a big number.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:36.490
I bet you I can find one but
you guys have got to, alright,

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:37.700
tell me some mechanisms.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.290
Let me try to draw them.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.970
What would be one mechanism?

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:47.230
Collapses, yeah, somehow.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.720
How shall I make it collapse?

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.980
Can squeeze in, yeah,
maybe that's the first one.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:35:05.320
This guy comes in, this
guy, what does that do?

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.490
I've got 15 minutes here, I
could pull that board down

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:10.560
and draw another one.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.080
What is this one here?

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.780
Let's see, if that comes in, do
these guys have to go up a bit?

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.550
Yeah, because that
angle's not 90 degrees.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:24.680
So we've got a first
order change in this.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.000
So this comes in a little,
this goes up a little,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.480
this guy maybe stays straight.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.160
Would you go for this,
I mean, please say yes?

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.990
Something happens there, right?

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:50.430
These things go in
and those go out.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.330
Could you create
the-- I mean if this

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:57.930
was a equal-side,
regular hexagon,

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:03.000
you could put in all
the numbers for all 12,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.440
I would be looking
for 12 numbers.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.870
Six joints and they
each have two u's,

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:15.180
so that wouldn't be so
simple but you could do it.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:20.600
So that would be one.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.220
Looking for number two.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.820
What would be another one?

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:32.460
So sort of squeezing
in like whatever.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.360
What do you think?

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.080
Any others?

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.580
Maybe that's possible.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:49.690
Maybe I just look at it,
you think that would work?

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.350
We could hope those
were independent,

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.390
but I wouldn't
put my life on it.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:59.696
I have this squeeze in, this
squeeze in and this squeeze in,

00:36:59.696 --> 00:37:03.170
I would worry a little bit.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:06.860
I can see another one.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.350
AUDIENCE: Half, for--

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.780
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Fold it in half.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:16.679
AUDIENCE: Along, I guess that
sort of gets into 3-D, but.

00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:18.970
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah, we've
got to stay in the plane,

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:24.220
right.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.790
I have instead of what?

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:28.400
OK.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.440
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Squeeze that out.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.420
Yeah.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.170
Good.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:42.530
Number two.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:47.210
And then I can see, here's one,
here's an easy one to think of.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:51.420
Leave these three alone
and just rotate these guys.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.950
Bring this down, right?

00:37:54.950 --> 00:38:03.880
Just bring these three
vertically down, or something.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:11.890
You see why it's sort of, did
you like that one alright?

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:16.440
It seems simple to me, looking
at it, just leave these guys--

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.060
Rotation, let this turn down.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:22.490
This turn down, let's
say, and this go down.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:27.640
Maybe these would all
drop by the same amount.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:33.310
Maybe.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:38.650
So anyway, whatever.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:42.480
Let's put some supports on them.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.290
And get these numbers down.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:50.400
So let's support, as
usual, the bottom guy.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.190
OK, so different problem now.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:58.970
I won't call that A_0, I'll
call it A. I'll ask myself,

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.620
is it stable or unstable?

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:06.400
The matrix is now six by what?

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.570
Eight, because
I've taken away, I

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.290
have four reaction forces,
two at each support,

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.930
horizontal and vertical.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:20.170
I've got four free nodes.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.200
And six by eight.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.440
Let me put in-- So six by
eight, what am I expecting now?

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.830
Any rigid motions?

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.770
No, no rigid motions now.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:38.360
How many solutions
am I expecting?

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.380
Two, I think.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.350
Probably two.

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.760
How many mechanisms?

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.790
Well, no rigid motions.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.060
So probably two mechanisms.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.400
Now, can we find two mechanisms?

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.840
Alright, this is
like more reasonable.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.430
We can see whether whether
we get two mechanisms

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.370
and whether they're
really different.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.870
OK, what are the mechanisms now?

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.830
These guys are fixed.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:13.180
So forget my little sketch
here, and think again.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.910
What do you see?

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:18.140
Alright, let's
have one mechanism.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:23.380
What would one mechanism be now?

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.720
There have to be two.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.240
What do you think?

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.950
Sit on it.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:35.680
Alright, bring these guys
down, and then these guys

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.730
will go out, is that it?

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:43.340
OK, so a number, mechanism
number one, sit on truss.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.080
OK.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:45.680
Alright.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.890
Now, I don't know
what number two

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.850
is, that's why I'm taking time.

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:56.162
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:56.162 --> 00:40:57.120
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.450
Or could we do this, could we
bring these guys in and let's

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.260
go up?

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.720
It's the same thing.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:10.220
OK, so squeeze truss.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.370
Squeeze sides.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.260
Is that the same
thing that I had,

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.610
number one the same as two.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.390
Oh jeez, OK.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:24.590
Is that what-- Everybody
is agreeing with this?

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.090
OK.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:28.521
So I didn't get, my
number two was no good.

00:41:28.521 --> 00:41:29.020
OK.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.250
What's a better number two?

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.490
Hold an edge?

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:35.440
Like that one.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.690
I'm just doing what
you say, I'm not.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:47.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Just
this guy, rotates like so.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.710
And this guy will
rotate, and this guy.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:56.020
That looks pretty good to me.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.510
Good, is that correct?

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.110
Say that one again?

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.550
So the first one was
when these two came down

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.730
and these went out.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:07.600
Right, OK.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.650
And now your suggestion
is, you picked on this guy

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:12.570
and held it fixed.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:15.370
And then this one came
down a little bit.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.820
It'll, of course,
how will it move?

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.190
It will move
perpendicular, right?

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.690
Small movement.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.460
The bar is not going
to change length,

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.830
that's the whole point, right?

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.670
The bar is not changing length.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:32.550
So the movement must be, it
must be a simple rotation.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.860
Around here.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.420
OK.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.340
Right, and of course
again you might say well,

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.500
the bar really did change
length because that's not

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.510
quite the same as that.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.890
But then again that's
my second order basis.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:50.300
So that one came down,
and what did this one do?

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.740
Came down the same.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:58.530
OK, and this one it also moves.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:03.770
What is that?

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:07.800
OK, so what am I going
to call this one?

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.670
Fix one.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.170
Yeah.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.520
Fix one node.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.530
And that makes sense.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:16.720
Fix one joint, yeah.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.420
And then, and rotate the rest.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.210
I think that would be possible.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.460
Yep.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:29.960
OK, a small prize
for anybody who,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:37.430
maybe handwritten, a picture
of two really nice mechanisms.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.870
Somehow this one seems
a little un-symmetric

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:43.340
in a problem that's
so symmetric,

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.820
so I would guess that
somewhere along the line

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:50.850
we could find a kind of
more some symmetric one.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:55.890
But I don't see what
it is right now.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:44:03.520
Can the whole thing
rotate a little?

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:10.890
Could that rotate, could
the whole thing rotate?

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:12.510
Yeah, maybe it could.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.540
This guy would go up,
maybe that's possible.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:20.370
That's somehow got
everybody into the action.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.310
So I'll put "or rotate".

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:27.440
OK, so you see what
questions you get into.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.630
May I just draw a
different truss?

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:38.930
So those homework questions
are other trusses.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:46.090
Here's one that I drew
in the book itself.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:52.290
Yeah, may I draw this,
I called it a treehouse.

00:44:52.290 --> 00:45:01.210
OK, so I have, so here's one
that's actually in the book.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:07.680
And it's got a couple of
bars going up, and one over.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.850
So that's the start.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:14.170
Then it's got a
diagonal and that one.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.530
And then here comes
the treehouse.

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:23.000
OK, right.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.190
Well, just to get, let's
again get the count right.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:34.220
So what's the matrix
A for this treehouse?

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:37.920
A is how many by how many?

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.770
How many bars are
you seeing here?

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:46.820
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, eight bars.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:51.720
And how many unknown
displacements?

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.530
Ten.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.550
We got five joints
that are not supported,

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.010
and each one has two unknowns.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.770
So A is eight by ten.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:06.130
So I expect two mechanisms.

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:15.300
OK, so again I'm looking
for two mechanisms.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.245
OK, what's one?

00:46:19.245 --> 00:46:20.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:23.970
PROFESSOR STRANG: It's what?

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:29.400
This guy just falls, right.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.450
This looks unfortunately
very much like the treehouses

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.630
that I built for my kids.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:44.540
Well, so linear algebra
sentenced them to fall, right?

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.370
OK, that's one.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.830
I probably propped
it up with one more

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.340
bar, but of course that
wouldn't be enough,

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.690
because it's got two mechanisms,
so if I make it nine by ten

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.530
I haven't saved the kids.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:06.780
OK, with eight by ten,
what's the other mechanisms?

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.770
The whole thing could
turn the-- Nothing

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.320
preventing turning here.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.340
They can't move but
they could turn.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:19.760
So the whole thing could go
over, right, the whole thing

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.720
could just-- That would be a
horizontal movement of all five

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.220
nodes.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.730
The horizontal of
all five nodes.

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:31.970
And again, slightly downwards,
but that's a second order

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:34.220
effect.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:38.930
OK, so that's the second truss.

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:40.140
OK.

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:47.250
So this is really like
practice for discrete problems,

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:50.310
for the problems of
plane elasticity.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:57.860
And the point is that there are
two unknowns for each point.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.347
If we have
differential equations.

00:47:59.347 --> 00:48:00.930
So the differential
equations of plane

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:04.190
elasticity are
not really simple.

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.790
They're not really simple.

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:08.620
And 3-D elasticity even more.

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:15.100
Because the points
are physical points

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:22.140
and they can move three ways,
and it gets quite interesting.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:28.130
And those are the major problems
of computational mechanics.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:34.540
OK, let's say, holiday time,
and I'll see you next Wednesday
