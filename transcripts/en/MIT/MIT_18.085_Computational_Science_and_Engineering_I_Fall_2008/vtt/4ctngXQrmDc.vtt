00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.950
PROFESSOR STRANG: So,
thanks for coming today.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:30.370
This is a key lecture in
the application of Fourier,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.090
you could say.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.640
So convolution is the big word.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.250
And a major application
of convolution

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.200
is filtering, signal processing.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.530
So we'll develop
that application.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.940
But it's nothing
but convolution.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.860
So the key idea is
these convolution rules,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.340
where they come from.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.510
And what these new
symbols, that's

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.400
the symbol for the
convolution of two functions.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.390
They could be functions here.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.240
Here they're long
vectors of coefficients,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.240
and so these are the rules.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.240
So it's just a little
bit of algebra.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.110
But it just is so central
to all this subject.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.290
Signal processing is certainly
the most important little thing

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.310
to know.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.230
That if I multiply
two functions,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.650
so that's where we
started last time.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.790
If I have a function
f with Fourier

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.900
coefficients c, and a function
g with coefficients d, then,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.060
oh, wrong.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.590
I convolve the
coefficients, right.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.900
So f has coefficients
c, g has coefficients d.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.920
So if I multiply the functions
I definitely do not just

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.580
multiply each c times the d.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.640
I do this convolution operation,
which we have to remember.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.790
That's our main first step is
to remember what that was about.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.550
And then this is
the other direction.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.910
So we didn't see this before.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.980
That I mean, there's always
this fantastic symmetry

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.360
between physical space
and frequency space.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.810
And convolution in one is
multiplication in the other.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.240
It's so easy to remember.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.890
If I multiply in one
space, I do a convolution

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.240
in the other space.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.490
If I do a convolution
of functions,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.500
I do a multiplication
of coefficients.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.510
So that's the rule to know.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.440
And now if we expand
on it, by sort

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.750
of seeing again what it means.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.780
So let me do a quick
repeat of this first step

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.840
to remember what this symbol,
convolution symbol, means.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.790
And then another
thing I have to do.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.380
Here, I'm talking about the
infinite case, functions,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.810
and with a whole infinite
sequence of coefficients.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.530
I've got to do the
cyclic case, too.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.590
Which goes with the
discrete transform.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.630
OK, but let's start
with the infinite case

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.160
as we did last time.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.500
Maybe, here's something.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.780
Here's a suggestion.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.480
We had f(x).

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.840
We started with f(x), as
the sum -- and remember,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.050
to have nice formulas, we're
doing the complex version --

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.470
c_k*e^(ikx).

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.350
Let me suggest something.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.880
Let me write z for e^(ikx).

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.060
So I'm going to just write
that at the sum of c_k*z^k.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.600
So z is e^(ix).

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.300
This is like a good
point to make anyway.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.220
When we have this e^(ikx),
it's natural to think of that

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.520
as a complex number
on the unit circle.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.020
Right?

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.180
That's always the
message, e to the i

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.390
real is on the unit circle.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.100
Absolute value one.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.760
And this is great for
periodic functions.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.870
Because if these
functions have period 2pi,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.750
and if we think of our function
as being on the circle,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.290
it obviously has period 2pi.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.770
I mean, the picture says, yes.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.030
If I go 2pi, I come back.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.625
So x is the angle, right?
x is the-- In this picture,

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:59.050
a little bit unusual maybe,
x there would be the angle.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.320
And it's just a little
bit easier to write.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.630
And maybe it even has an
official name, the Z-transform.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.660
How do you like that?

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.791
You learn a transform
just, in fourteen seconds.

00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:14.290
Z-transform.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.980
It'll make it easier
to multiply by g.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.070
So g is going to be
the sum of d_k*z^k.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.100
So just think of these
as long, well I'm

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.400
tempted to say long polynomials.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.140
I mean, very long, because
they can be infinite series.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.460
Infinite negative powers
and positive powers.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.410
But just think of it as a
bunch of powers of z times

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.670
a bunch of powers of z.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.090
And if you multiply a
couple of polynomials,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.230
you're doing convolution.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.890
I guess my message is,
you've been doing convolution

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.740
since the second grade.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.380
That's the real message.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.020
Here, let me show you.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.530
This is convolution too.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:14.550
Suppose I have to
multiply a 123 times 456?

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.910
OK, so what do you do?

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.640
Remember back, it's a long
way back but we can do this.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.470
One, two, three times
four, five, six.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.460
So I multiply the three,
oh there's a little point.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.170
Where that second-grade
teacher's going to panic.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.010
I'm going to write that as 18.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.040
And that's 15, and that's 12.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.830
Sorry about that, yeah.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.930
And 12, 10 and 8, right?

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.140
Four, five and six.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.970
So you see the nine
multiplications

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.740
that you have to do?

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.650
Nine multiplications,
three times three.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.994
OK, right now
imagine those were,

00:07:04.994 --> 00:07:06.160
they could have been longer.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:13.810
But they were finite length
filters, we could say.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.200
And now, what does
convolution do?

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.990
Just what you did
in multiplication.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.690
When I add 12, 10 and
6, what am I doing?

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.580
I'm putting together the
three times the four,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.340
the two times the five,
and the one times the six.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.510
That's what convolution,
those are the things

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.220
that convolution puts together.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:40.710
So we got an 18, a 27, 28.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.020
13, and 4.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.750
So I guess I'm saying
that, alright, here's

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.110
what I really want to say.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.600
I want to say that the
convolution of those,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:04.010
with these, four, five, six,
is this sequence here-- Oh.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.980
Yeah, that's right.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.430
4, 13, 28.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.020
27, and 18.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.060
If you just look at that.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.690
Where did that 13 come from?

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.360
Let's just remember, where
does that 13 come from?

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.160
That came from, this was z^0.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.890
This 13 is 13 z to the
first power, right?

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.100
We're just checking
all the powers here.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.520
There's 13 z to the first power.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.220
Where do we get a first power?

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.620
We get a z^0 times 5z^1.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.460
So that's 5z^1.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:49.520
And we also have
2z^1, times 4z^0.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.040
Right?

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.170
Two times four gave the eight.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.070
So the eight from there
and the five from there

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.650
produce that 13.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.120
And that's just what you
did in multiplication.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.630
Right?

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.620
So that's multiplication
of two series.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.490
That's not cyclic.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.010
This is definitely
not yet cyclic,

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.750
but we'll make it
cyclic in a minute.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:20.720
This is the infinite one, except
that we had all zeroes beyond.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.500
OK, so that if you, in
non-cyclic convolution like

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.280
this, if I have
length m and length n,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.790
then I get length
m+n, maybe m+n-1.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.830
OK, so that's convolution.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.590
Without carrying numbers.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.190
Without doing it right.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.360
OK, so and what does
that correspond to?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.770
Let me just, so you
see it every way.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:57.410
That corresponds to 1+2z+3z^2,
multiplying 4+5z+6z^2.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.830
And it gave-- That's times.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:10.160
And it gave this
thing up to 18z^4.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.400
Just, exactly the multiplication
that you've always done.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.380
OK, so that's the idea.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.510
Over on that board I'm
going to put a formula

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.230
for this convolution operation.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.740
But my point on this board
is, you've done it always.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.900
When you multiply a
couple of polynomials,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.930
you collect powers.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.760
And that's all convolution
is doing, collecting

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.820
each power separately.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.120
OK, let's do it.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:46.950
So then f(x)g(x) is, when
I multiply that polynomial

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:53.330
or series by that polynomial,
I get some polynomial in, with

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.890
coefficients, oh I
was changed to l,

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.640
just to have a
different symbol there.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.270
And what was the formula for l?

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.620
For h_l?

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.780
What is the coefficient of z^l?

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.230
If I multiply that by that, do
you remember the story there?

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:21.100
When I multiply that by that
and I looked for the terms that

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.580
gave me z^l?

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.350
OK, well that means that this
power times this power is going

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.220
to be z^l.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.030
So that the index, do you
remember what happened?

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:38.160
It was a lot of different, just
the way-- This h_l is here.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.750
Here's h_2 or something.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.990
I've got to do an addition.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:49.730
Because a bunch of c's come in
with different d's, and what's

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.820
the deal then? c_k
comes in with which d?

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.820
This is the magic number there.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:04.420
What's the subscript that if I
look at the coefficient of z^l,

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.760
I look at each of these.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.240
And then I pick out the one of
these that will give me a z^l.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.690
And which one is it?

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.550
d_(l-k).

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.690
It's that magic quantity
that the eye spots perfectly.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:32.850
k and l-k, adding to l simply
because z^k z^(l-k) multiplies

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.600
to z^l.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.880
Same thing.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.540
Right?

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:43.930
OK, this is, now I'll
use that notation.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.800
This is c convolved
with the d. c

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.640
convolved with d is h.
c convolved with d is h.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.810
So this is the l-th component.
c convolved with d is my symbol.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.450
This h is the convolution.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.660
And that's the convolution rule.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.720
It's just whatever
operation you have

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.990
to do to get the right answer.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.460
The right answer
when you multiply.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.540
So that one.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.640
Ready for the discrete case?

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.200
The finite case?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:25.270
The case when, you have
power, when z becomes w.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.040
The discrete case.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.850
The cyclic case, sorry.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.950
Maybe emphasize the cyclic
case, meaning it circles around,

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:39.730
is the case when z becomes this
very special z, on the unit

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.390
circle that we know as w.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:47.510
OK, and we have to say,
and of course it's w_N,

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:54.730
I have to tell you in the cyclic
case how long the cycle is.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.840
So this would be a case.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.590
Watch what you do here
to make this cyclic.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:09.990
OK, I have three inputs,
so N is three here.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.150
Now I'm going to do the cyclic.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.190
So instead of z's, I
should be putting w's.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.420
I will.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:23.240
Just to emphasize, it's good to
think of it with the w there,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.510
because the w has this special
property that's critical

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:31.750
to everything, OK so now I'm
going to, I think of this

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:38.230
as 1w^0, 2w^1, and 3 w squared.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.800
I'm thinking of the same
multiplication here,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.570
but now w's.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:51.540
OK, so I'll end up with 18w^4,
and four was the constant

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.700
and 13 w's and so on.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.910
All these numbers.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.940
What's the difference?

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.070
Ready for the key point?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.340
Now, what's happened
in this cyclic case?

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:12.010
Well, the difference
is what is w^4?

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.740
If we're in the cyclic
case, N is three now,

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.420
our guys have length
three, our circle

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:24.270
is, w now is 1/3
of the way around.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.860
So that's my w,
here's my w squared.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.640
Here is my one.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.850
But here it is also w cubed.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:39.900
So w is the same as w^4,
w^2 is the same as w^5.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.320
So, what's the difference?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.440
What can I do now?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:54.300
If I'm in this discrete
case, then my inputs

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.030
are a vector of length N, three.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.380
A vector of length N, three.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:06.180
And I want to get out to
a vector of length three.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.180
I'm not happy with that
in the cyclic case,

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.920
because I'm not happy with w^4.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.790
So now tell me again that last,
when I do the multiplication

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.920
and I just do it, there's
no difference except in how

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.710
I write the answer.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:35.010
18w^4 is the same as? w. w^4 is
the same as w, when N is three.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:41.290
So that 18w^4 cycles
back in, with this 13.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:45.650
So now if I do the, can
I show you the symbol?

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.730
I'll just do a
little circle there.

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:52.130
To say this is now the
cyclic convolution.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.620
Then this isn't the
answer any more.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.090
The answer now for
cyclic convolution,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.190
I only want three numbers.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.600
And if you can tell me what
those three numbers are,

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.250
we've got it.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.240
Move those over a little to
make room for the three numbers.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.940
So there's the answer,
the space for the answer.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.430
What do I write in?

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:19.750
How many, what's
the constant term?

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.460
It's 31, right.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.410
It's 31.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.290
Where did 31 come from?

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:31.540
It came from, you could say,
cycling that 27w^3 back with

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.000
the four.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.250
Because there's no,
w^3 is the same as one.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.730
So I've gone around the circle
when I come around to w^3.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.820
So that 27 and 4
combined into that 31.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.930
And let's see.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.130
So what multiplications
am I doing here?

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.280
One times four gives
me the constant.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:00.520
Two times six, that's two
w's and six w squareds,

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.870
that's 12w^3, that's 12.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:10.880
And then 3 w squareds
and five w's is 15w^3.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.330
But that's the same as 15.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
So that's why we get 31.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.670
We got 4, we've got
12 and we've got 15.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:25.350
OK, now what's the second
component, the w component

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:32.510
of the cyclic convolution?

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.120
Tell me what number do I write
in, in that middle position?

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.100
How many w's do I have?

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.300
31 again.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:47.050
This 28, this 18 is
coming back by three.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.920
To 13.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.010
You see, I could have
done that multiplication.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.540
So coming back to 31, am
I going to get another 31?

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.030
No, what's the w^2 guy?

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:01.830
28.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.330
Yeah.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:09.730
28, because there's no w
to the fifth to come back.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:15.890
So 28 uses three
multiplications.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:21.320
The 31 there used the
four and these two.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.630
This came back over to here.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.640
And this 31 used,
this 18 came back.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.920
I could have put the 18 here.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.450
You know, I could have
lined it up just three.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.470
So I'll write a formula for it.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.790
So that's the answer.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.610
31, 31, 28.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.740
Could I just suggest a
little check on that?

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.460
Just to check on the numbers.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:52.590
I think that if I add up
these numbers, I get six.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:57.770
And if I add up those
numbers I get 15.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.180
And if I multiply
that, I get 90.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.410
And if I add those
numbers I get 90, right?

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.440
So those add to 90.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.820
So I'm just saying the
miracle check is add these,

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.040
multiply by the sum of those.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.720
And you get the sum of those.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.700
Why is that?

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.480
Somehow seems right, doesn't it?

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:29.790
Because somehow I've taken
all nine products here, and so

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.460
when I add all the results,
I'll have the sum of all nine

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.220
of these possible products.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.590
So I'll have 6 times 15.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:41.310
Actually, here's a
good way to look at it.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.730
In doing this, I just set w=1.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.840
I just set w=1 in
the polynomial.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.220
When I set w to one, this
becomes six, this becomes 15

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.540
and the answer becomes
90, when w is one.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.040
Yeah.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.910
So that's another way to see.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:07.420
And actually, this
multiplication,

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:13.400
the second grade
version, had w, well,

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:19.600
I'm almost going to say
w=10, but not quite that.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.540
Because it's written in
the opposite order, right?

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.290
If w was ten, this would be one.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.270
Well, anyway, w can't
be ten, it's got

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.580
to stay on the unit circle, so.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.760
So somewhere in the non-cyclic
case, it's something like w=10,

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.090
or w=1/10, maybe.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.040
Whatever.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.190
OK.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.670
Could you take the
convolution now,

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.270
let me give you just
another example.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.700
Do it mentally.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:55.560
What's the convolution
of [0, 1,  0, 0],

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.990
let me make a little longer.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:02.200
So I take the, first of all,
the non-cyclic convolution

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.810
of [0, 0, 1, 0].

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.010
OK.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:11.780
What's the ordinary-- how
long is the answer now?

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.320
This is just practice.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.590
How many components
am I going to have

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:22.650
in the ordinary convolution of
those two guys of length four?

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.930
I think it's seven.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.610
I think it'll be seven.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:34.250
Because we'll have here one, we
have no, we have z^0, z^1, z^2,

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.910
z^3.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.450
And here we'll have again the
same, it would go up to z^6,

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:43.020
but remember there's a z^0,
so that's why we have seven.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.440
And what will it be?

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.600
What will it be?

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.020
I guess, actually, this wasn't
a brilliant example, was it?

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.970
But let's finish it.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:01.330
So I'm just multiplying
z by z squared, so

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.650
what do you get for an answer?

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:13.600
I think the one shows
up in the z cubed.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.970
Is that right?

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:22.000
Yeah. z to the first power here,
z squared here, z cubed here,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.490
and we always have to remember
everything in Chapter 4 starts

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.640
at zero.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.340
Zero, z^0's the first one.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.030
OK, that's not too
great an example,

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:40.580
because what happens if I do
the circular cyclic convolution?

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.500
What would be the
cyclic convolution?

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:47.150
Now I'm expecting
four guys only, right?

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.250
The cyclic keeps
the same length.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:55.150
And what would be the answer?

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:58.330
Well, there's nobody to fold
back, so it would be just

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:59.910
[0, 0, 0, 1].

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:06.210
So let me update this a
little bit with a one here.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.090
OK, just to practice.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.000
So suppose I do
that convolution.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.850
Un-cyclic, first.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.220
What do I change here now?

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.780
I've now got a z squared
and I've also got a z cubed,

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.170
but I only have a
single one there.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.330
Let's make it a little
more interesting.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.930
OK, make it like so.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:36.530
Alright, z+z^2 is what
we're looking at, z+z^2 is

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.820
multiplying z^2+z^3.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.870
And in the long
form, what do I get?

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.920
Let me make space, tell
me what numbers to put in.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.140
If I multiply z+z^2 times
z^2+z^3, I get what?

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.420
1z^3, how many z^4?

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.220
Two of them.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.240
How many z^5?

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.760
One, and nobody there.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.890
OK.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:09.600
And now the cyclic
version would be what?

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.540
What's my answer now
for the cyclic version?

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.850
Let me take those out.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:21.680
So the cyclic version would
bring the two back to the zero.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.320
Would bring that
one back so there.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.440
That zero will still be zero.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.070
And I checked that I
haven't missed anything

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.760
by adding those up to get
four, and adding this up

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.610
to get two times two.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:38.660
Yeah.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.700
OK, so that's the rule.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.330
And it's a lot cleaner
to see these answers

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:52.770
than to see this formula.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:57.390
And I need, actually of course,
now mentioning that formula,

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.640
I need a cyclic formula.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.080
So can I write above
it the cyclic formula?

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:12.580
What do I get when I'm,
instead of this sum, which

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:17.390
went from k equal minus
infinity to infinity,

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:25.000
in the cyclic case, h_k is just
going to be a sum from zero

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.720
to N-1, and there'll be
a c_k, and a d something.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:42.620
And now this is the cyclic
case, so I guess this makes us,

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.460
I think what our situation
now is we understand

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.620
the cyclic case from examples.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.590
And now we just have the job of
how do I put it into algebra.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.270
How do I put it into symbols?

00:26:55.270 --> 00:27:02.280
What's the point?
c_k d_n, let's say.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:08.780
But oh no, I'm
looking for h_l, yeah.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.260
So what's the deal?

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.780
Here l was k.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.900
That one is the sum of
that one and that one.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.630
So here, l is the
sum of k and n, but.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:28.720
What's the but?

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:35.360
I mean somehow I've got some
wraparound to do, right?

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.200
When I'm doing the cyclic
multiplication and I'm doing

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:47.890
the wraparound because w^N,
the wraparound comes from that,

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.490
right?

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.710
That's why I never get as high
as N, because when I get to N

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.460
I go back to the zeroth power.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:02.960
OK, so what's the relation
of k and n and l here?

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:07.440
We just need the right
word to express it.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.740
What's the word?

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.770
Mod.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:17.360
So that's the word I'm
looking for. k+n is l.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.320
With wraparound and
wraparound means,

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:35.590
the nice notation that people
use is mod N. Let's practice.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:45.670
What is two plus two mod seven?

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.400
Four.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.950
Two plus two is
four, even in 18.085.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.360
Right, OK.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:29:03.570
But two plus two mod three
is, two plus two mod three is?

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:04.120
One.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.520
Everybody sees it?

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:13.690
I'm taking z^2 times z^2,
z^4, but I'm doing with N=3,

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:18.020
so z^3 is one, so that z^4
is really just z to the first

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.080
power.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:27.300
So this is the
little nifty notation

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.450
that says make it cyclic.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:34.860
Bring it back so that l
only has the values here,

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.750
zero up to N-1.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.410
And then stops.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.070
OK.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:50.830
OK, so we'll have more
practice with examples

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:56.410
when we do some filtering.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.770
Have you got that
fundamental-- So we've

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:03.490
talked about this rule
one here. f times g

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.530
goes to those coefficients.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.160
And if it's the
cyclic case then I

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.460
put a circle around that star.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.450
And I do the wraparound.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:23.750
But it's just, it's
the Z-transform,

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:28.590
it's polynomials in z
or polynomials in w,

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.360
and when it's polynomials in w,
you use that special property

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.700
that w^N is one.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:38.150
Yeah, OK.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:43.420
Now, I see I've written
another line, there.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.390
That I could convolve functions.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.520
Let me do a couple
more examples.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.390
Couple of examples.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:59.200
First, before I go
to that line, OK.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:05.520
So I'm up to this line.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:12.640
A couple of examples here.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:18.840
Let's see, what example
would I want to do?

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:28.270
Let's see, OK, I want to do one
example with a delta function.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.080
One example with
a delta function.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.870
One example with
the delta vector.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:41.890
Yeah, let me take the
function g(x) identically one.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:45.820
OK, constant function.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.000
In this rule.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.300
I want to see what
happens with the rule.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:32:00.140
OK, then f(x) g(x) is
the same as f(x), right?

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.770
Because this function g(x)
is so simple, it's just one.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:09.520
Now, what about the coefficient?

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.480
So I have the coefficients
of c, what are the Fourier

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.370
coefficients, what are the d's?

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.900
Ah yes, what are the d's?

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.840
So I'm testing my rule on a
really really simple case,

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.600
g(x) identically one.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.970
What, you have to
tell me, in order

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.490
to check the right
side of the rule

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:34.440
you have to tell me the Fourier
coefficients for that very

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.530
special function.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.270
What would be the
Fourier coefficients?

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:42.260
If I expand the function
one in a Fourier series,

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.000
what do I see?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.890
I see a one.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.240
Yeah, that's it, I see one.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:54.570
So what are its coefficients?
d_0, right, is one?

00:32:54.570 --> 00:33:01.610
And the other d's
are all zero, right?

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:07.580
So my vector of d, my
vector of d's is a whole lot

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.600
of zeroes on the negative side.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.780
A one right there in the center,
and then a lot of zeroes.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:24.770
And now I want to
convolve that with c.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.450
I'm practicing the
convolution rule

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:34.590
on a case that's so simple
it's confusing, right?

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:45.570
I mean, it's a big mess,
this multiplication.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.070
What do I get out of this?

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:58.280
If d is this vector, if d has
this property that d_0 is one

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.450
and others are zero,
all others are zero,

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:06.250
so this is my
little example, what

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:10.940
does this sum boil down to?

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:17.900
Well, I only get
something when l=k, right?

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.760
I only got something when
l=k, because then I have d_0

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.560
and that's the only
d that's around.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.430
So in this sum,
something happens only

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:31.970
when k and l are the same.

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:33.160
And then what happens?

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:37.190
Then I have a one, I
have c_l, and that's h_l,

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.280
so that's all I'm
concluding then.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.210
That this h is the same as c.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:48.210
I'm sorry, it's so dumb.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.570
My point is that in
convolution, this is

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.450
the thing that acts like one.

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:56.480
Because in
multiplication, that's

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.380
the thing, that's the
function that acts like one.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.890
That's the function that is one.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:11.640
So this is the one in-- Oh,
would you allow me to do this?

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:18.820
I'm going to create a
matrix with these d's.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:24.560
There's another way
to see convolution.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.680
Yeah, there's another
way to see convolution

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.490
and discrete convolution.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:31.090
Maybe the discrete
one's the better.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:36.860
Yeah can you stand one more
way to write the formula?

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.720
One more way to write,
now I'm going to do,

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:47.940
I'm going to do
discrete convolution.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.720
Discrete cyclic.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.010
So how am I going to write it?

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:57.210
I'm going to write it by
a matrix multiplication.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.905
Because you know
that in this course

00:35:58.905 --> 00:36:01.190
a matrix was going to show up.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:06.290
So it's going to be a
matrix multiplication.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.780
So I just have to
tell you the matrix,

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.300
so this is going
to be some matrix.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.020
Let me take N to be four.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:20.240
So then I have, you watch.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:32.080
So I have four d's, and
the output is the four h's.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:37.350
And the rule I'm
following is this rule.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:43.660
Is this, the same old rule
but with the cyclic part.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.070
And now I want to show you the
matrix that'll just do this.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:54.120
Look, I've put the c's
in the first column.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:37:00.340
And then I go, yeah,
here's another.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:07.380
So it's a cyclic matrix.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.230
So let me finish it up.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.240
It's going to be four by
four, it's going to be cyclic.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:18.340
So I have a c_0, c_0,
c_0, c_0 on the diagonal.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.315
That's fine, that's
because z to the zero

00:37:21.315 --> 00:37:24.740
is multiplying all the d's
and leaving them in place.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.200
And then I have
c_1's, and then I

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.520
think I come around
again here for a c_1.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:38.750
And I have c_2's, see
where see c_3, c_2.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:43.510
And I come around again,
to a c_2 and a c_2.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:49.490
And c_3 comes around to
a c_3, a c_3 and a c_3.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:59.400
Well, can you, I hope you can
see, this is cyclic matrix.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.150
It's only got one, it
starts with a vector c,

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:10.640
and those are on the diagonal
and the diagonals wrap around.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.350
That's the other
word that you often

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:16.140
see when you see the
word cyclic, wraparound.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:23.760
It's because you
think of a circle.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.640
If you go a second
time around, it's

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.530
wrapped around the first time.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:32.000
OK, just can you look and see
that this is the right formula

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.300
for h_0? h_0 is c_0*d_0.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.950
Where does that come from?

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:43.230
Remember, h_0 is the coefficient
of z^0 in the answer.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:47.980
So it comes from c_0*d_0 to
the zeroth power in the input.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.930
And then why is
there is a c_3*d_1?

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:58.450
Why is there a c_3*d_1, and then
a c_2*d_2 and then a c_1*d_3

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:02.630
all piling up into h_0?

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.380
Tell me now, why
is there a c_3*d_1?

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.370
Because we're doing mod
four is one way to say it.

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:12.840
Three and one add to four.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:20.750
Because c_3 is the w cubed
guy, and d_1 is the coefficient

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:30.790
of w^1 and w^3 times w^1
piles back into the constant.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.840
And you see the
pattern of that matrix?

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.420
So these matrices
are very important.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.620
So they circle around.

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:45.570
Oh, we've actually met
a matrix of this type,

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.920
the first day of 18.085.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.160
What was that matrix?

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.760
It was one of our
four great matrices.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.650
And now here it is back again.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:00.700
Which one was it?

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.430
Well, you remember
the letter for it.

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.170
Which isn't going to change.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:11.170
And do you remember
the particular matrix?

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:14.320
Well, everybody does
remember that matrix, right?

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:19.510
Twos were on the diagonal,
minus ones were on the diagonal,

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.180
and the diagonal
curve continued.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.510
Minus one was on this diagonal
and that continued and zeroes

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.120
was on this diagonal.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:35.610
So this is cyclic convolution,
the circulant matrix,

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:42.050
cyclic convolution
by c, what's the c

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:46.920
that produces that
convolution matrix?

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.720
It's just, it's got--
well there it is.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:56.380
The first column is it.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.350
Right, right.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:09.530
And somehow I would say
that that's an even vector.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.190
It's sort of, I
associate it with cosine.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.300
It's an even vector.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:18.810
Here is the zero term, and
then these are the same,

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.030
not to worry about that part.

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:25.210
Do you see that we've
seen that matrix before?

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:28.440
And the cyclic
convolution means you

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.400
take its second
differences, of course.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.750
We're taking second differences,
but everything in our world

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.260
is cyclic.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:47.210
So the result, the x_4 is x_0.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.990
So we're taking second
differences -- well,

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:55.990
maybe I should say d -- we're
taking second differences d_i,

00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:02.260
2d_i's, minus d_(i-1)
minus d_(i+1).

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.720
I don't know if this is--
So there's a minus one,

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.070
two, minus one.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:11.760
And we're cycling around
so that d_0 is d_4.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:20.180
And d_1 is d_5, and
d_(-1) is d_3, whatever.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:25.140
OK, I'm just reminding you,
we've seen these before.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:33.280
OK, so this is another way
to remember the formula.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.950
OK now, can I ask you
a practical question?

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:39.910
A practical question.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:47.610
Let me bring back this
second grade multiplication.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.810
Well, I have a granddaughter
named Elizabeth,

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:51.230
I'll have to admit
I didn't think

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:52.590
about mentioning Elizabeth.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.270
She's six.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:59.710
And she delights in sending
me long multiplications.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.570
I mean, really long.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:04.570
And then every time I
talk to her on the phone,

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:06.330
she says have you
done that one yet?

00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:07.880
And I say, I'm working on it.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.340
I've got MATLAB at work.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.260
Because they're ridiculous
and I haven't figured out

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:15.970
how to tell her.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:20.230
I mean, she just
writes page after page.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.240
Times 100, plus
three, minus seven,

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.510
just whatever she things of.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:31.130
OK, now I need help from
the convolution rule. here,

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.960
actually.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.360
So let's suppose that
Elizabeth has given me

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.070
a multiplication in
which I have a thousand

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:41.470
digits times a thousand, right.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.880
Which Mathematica is prepared
to do exactly, right?

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:51.100
MATLAB will mess up, but
Mathematica and Maple

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.360
and symbolic packages will
do exact computations.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.770
So what would be the right way,
well let may make it 1,024.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:08.220
1,024 digits times 1,024 digits.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.260
Let's do the cyclic
version first.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.340
Elizabeth doesn't
know about cyclic.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.740
Maybe I could teach her that.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.650
That'll keep her busy while
I'm doing the multiplication.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:23.040
OK, right.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.060
Only, her older brother
would explain it

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.320
to her, that's the trouble.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.080
OK, so how am I going
to do, or how are you

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.810
going to do on the
quiz, multiplication

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:37.070
of a 1,024 digits times 1,024?

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.880
And I'll make it easy
by making it cyclic,

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.310
so I just want 1,024
digits in the answer.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:45.420
OK.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.390
How would you do it?

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:55.930
Well, before today, you would
have just multiplied, right?

00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:00.730
You would have written down
1,024, two lines of 1,024,

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:03.490
done an addition.

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:08.090
And you would have had a
million multiplications to do.

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:10.360
But how would you do it now?

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.680
Apart from giving
it to Mathematica.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.760
What's a faster way to do it?

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:21.450
What's a faster way
to do a convolution?

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.460
The fast way to do
a convolution is

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.300
to use the convolution
rule, go this way.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:32.000
So take these numbers,
these 1,024 numbers,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.930
in c and these
1,024 numbers in d,

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:40.250
and, well what do I have to do?

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:41.820
I want to use the
convolution rule,

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:47.190
because multiplying is fast.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.200
Now I've got functions.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.110
But I'm in the cyclic case.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:58.520
So I'm in the cyclic
case, so what should I do?

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.020
How can I change this
to be the cyclic case?

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:08.830
This is like f_j g_j.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:15.690
So multiplication of components
of things in function space

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:18.170
is convolution of coefficients.

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:22.130
So now, this is the cyclic.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:25.820
So let me make it cyclic.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.320
So again, what's your problem?

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.740
The problem is to do this
cyclic multiplication.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.440
What's the idea?

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:41.270
The idea is to transform c back
to f, to transform d back to g.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.510
Do the multiplications,
now I have

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.610
only 1,024 multiplications.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:47.690
Not 1,024 squared.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.350
That's the point.

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:52.710
And if I do this
directly, I've got 1,024

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.380
squared multiplications to do.

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.230
Much better.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:01.160
Transform back to
here, do just 1,024--

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.430
what's the MATLAB command for
that, when you're multiplying

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:06.630
each component by itself?

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.730
It's not the dot
product, notice.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:13.300
It's not the dot product
because I'm not summing.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.920
Do you know the
MATLAB command, if I

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.950
have a sequence of numbers
of numbers, a vector

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:25.520
f of length 1,024, and I
want to get that result?

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.940
What's the result?

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:32.450
It's a vector of length 1,024
that takes each f times its g.

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.600
But doesn't do any adds.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.120
That's what's there.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.880
What's the MATLAB
command for that?

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.370
Dot, yeah.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.620
Dot star, right.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.680
So that dot says
component by component.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.980
OK, so what's the plan here?

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:53.100
I do c's back to f.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:48:00.740
By the Fourier matrix. d back
to g, by the Fourier matrix,

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.470
then I do a very
quick multiplication.

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:05.520
And then what?

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.440
Then I mustn't forget.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.830
That I'm in frequency space,
and what do I have to do?

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:16.680
I've got to get back
into coefficient space.

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:24.160
So I do the inverse transform
of-- Here's the formula, then.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:32.550
I'm doing the inverse transform
of, so the transform of c

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:39.930
dot star, the transform of d.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:44.690
To get c, d.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:47.560
Is that right?

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.630
So I took c, and I got
back into the function.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.210
I took d, and got
back to its function,

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:55.920
with the Fourier matrix.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:59.740
OK, I'm in the Fourier
and now I'm in this space.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.000
I've added up coefficients
to get in this space.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.050
Now I do the dot
star, the fast one.

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:08.390
And then I transform back.

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:11.850
So why is that faster?

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:14.960
Than just doing it?

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:20.850
Because what's the
cost of F times c?

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.180
And how am I going to do that?

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.730
I'm going to do with the fast
Fourier transform, right.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:26.650
That's the point.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:32.300
I can multiply by F, or
by F inverse, faster.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:36.120
So I have three of
these transforms.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.800
I've got to get two guys
into the other space,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.480
and the answer back out.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.460
So I have sort of
three of these N

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:53.190
log N's but that will
easily beat N squared.

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.690
Right?

00:49:53.690 --> 00:50:01.560
So if you have a
convolution to do,

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:05.950
and it's possible to do this,
get into the other space

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:09.380
where it's just an element
by element multiplication.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.710
And that would apply
in either direction.

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.910
Because the rule goes both ways.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:17.240
If I have this
convolution to do,

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.980
I would find the
coefficients here,

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:24.200
the c's, the coefficients
of d of the g's.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.470
I would do this one
by one multiplication,

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:31.200
and then I have the
Fourier coefficients

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.860
of the convolution.

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.770
Right, OK?

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:37.110
Do I have a moment?

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:37.870
Well, hardly.

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:39.830
Just, can I write
down what the formula

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.380
for a convolution of two
functions would look like?

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.380
Sorry, f(x) convolved with g(x).

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.610
Let me make it cyclic.

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:53.300
Just to see what
it would look like.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.140
What am I expecting
for that convolution?

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:58.570
I'm expecting a function,
and somehow there's

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:02.450
going to be an integral instead
of a sum, where I had sums,

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:04.140
but now I have integrals.

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:05.890
And here's the point.

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:13.000
I'll have f(t) times g(x-t) dt.

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:20.160
All I'm asking you to look at
is the fact that the way here I

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.480
had k, and l-k.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.190
For functions, your eye
sees that right away as a t,

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.420
and an (x-t), dt.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.290
These add to the answer.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.880
These add to the result, that x.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.670
That would be the
cyclical one, yeah.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:41.930
So I could go
zero-- These are all

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:46.780
periodic functions, so all
2pi periods are the same.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:50.250
The book will do that properly.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:54.440
OK, we've got the filtering
to discuss on Monday.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:59.030
You can see that this
convolution stuff just

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:03.220
takes a little new thinking,
but it comes out nicely.
