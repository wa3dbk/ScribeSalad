00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.390
PROFESSOR STRANG: So.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.600
I got the preparation
for finite elements.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.060
Again we're in one
dimension, because that's

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.620
where you can see first and most
clearly how the system works.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.120
So the system was, really,
to begin with the weak form

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.020
that I introduced last time.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.780
The Galerkin idea
that I introduced just

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.940
at the very end of last
time, and that idea

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.250
is that instead of the
continuous differential

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.640
equations where--
Galerkin's idea

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.230
is how do you make it
discrete, and he'll

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.240
choose some trial functions.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.490
Those are functions.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.870
And some test function.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.980
And I didn't get to
say, but I'll say now,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.450
very often they're the same.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.820
So very often the phis
are the same as the V's.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.970
And probably they will be
in all my examples today.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.770
And then what's new today is,
what choices would you make?

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.230
You have pretty wide choice,
but there are some natural ones

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.420
to start with.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.460
And so that's
where we are today.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.070
And then also the
other part of today

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.240
is how do we get from all that
preparation to the equations

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.830
that we actually solve.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.430
The KU=F, where does
the K come from,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.100
where does the F come from?

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.950
The F is going to come,
of course, somehow

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.060
from this right-hand
side and the K

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.220
is going to come
from the left side.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.210
OK, so that's the
overall direction

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.240
if you want to know how
finite elements work,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.320
that's the key line there.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.640
And then here I've recalled
what the step was, here's

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.350
our differential equation.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.800
And there's its weak form.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.020
This is the weak form.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.130
And let me put this in.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.940
Here I've reproduced
what we reached

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.260
last time, the weak form.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.160
That was the strong form
with its boundary conditions;

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.900
now we get the weak form
with its boundary conditions.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.390
And the weak form
involves u, so it's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.200
the boundary conditions
on u, the fixed ones,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.530
that get used in the weak form.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.350
The free ones don't
appear in the weak form,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.540
but by the magic of
integration by parts,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.960
the free ones will sort of
come out in a natural way.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.820
But we have to build in the
essential, Dirichlet boundary

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.640
conditions like that
fixed right-hand end.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.620
OK, and because I think of v as
a little movement away from u,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.420
but my u's are all
fixed at the end,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.530
therefore v has
to be fixed, too.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.540
OK, so this is important.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.320
But we haven't made
it down to Earth yet.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.260
We were doing a lot
of ideas last time,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.830
which are the center of
things, but now let's

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.450
get down to Earth.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.950
And down to Earth really means,
what functions do we choose?

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.040
And then how do we
get the equation.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.240
So that's the job today,
the principal job and this

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.040
is of course what
you would actually

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.490
code up to run a finite
element simulation.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.830
You would make a decision
on these functions.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.170
And let's start with
piecewise linear functions.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.070
So a typical phi is
maybe centered at a node,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.150
so it goes up and down.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:33.450
So if that's node two,
let's number these nodes:

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.520
one, two, three, four, and five.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.600
Well, that's five there but
I'm going to have, let's see.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.850
What do I have here?

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.640
At a typical node,
two, my function

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.670
is zero except in the
intervals that touch node two.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.140
So here's phi_2.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.530
phi_2(x).

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.295
That's its graph.

00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:07.500
It comes along, it's
piecewise linear up,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.010
it's piecewise linear back
down, and it's zero again.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.310
So that would be phi_2.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.190
Then phi_1, there'll be a phi_1.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.740
Like so, exactly similar.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.640
The whole point is
keep the system simple.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.330
That's what the finite
element idea is.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.110
Use simple functions
for the phis.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.390
And I'm taking them
also to be the test

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.510
function v. Keep those simple.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.850
Now, what about
at the boundaries?

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.350
OK, well we've said our
functions have to be,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.390
I'm doing free-fixed.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:54.890
So fixed comes to zero there and
all my functions will do that.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.180
But this end is
free, so watch this.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.910
This is another, what
I'll call a half-hat.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.970
If I call those hat
functions is that OK?

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.270
It makes a nice short word.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.060
So these are hat functions.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.600
And then a fuller description
would be piecewise linear,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.190
but hat functions is clear.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.770
OK, now notice I'm sticking
in here what I maybe

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.690
could call a half-hat.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.050
Because my V's and
my phis, my functions

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.510
are not constrained
at that left-hand end.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.810
That's free.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.610
So there's a phi_1,
and there's a phi_0.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.120
And a phi_3, and a phi_4.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.020
So altogether, I'm
going to have five.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.340
And I've started the
numbering at zero,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.600
I guess it just happens.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.600
So let's accept that.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.670
So I'm going to
have five functions.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.560
And they will also be
my five test functions.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.570
So let me first think of
them as the trial functions.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.070
Phi.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.460
So what was the point
about trial functions?

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.160
The point about is, my
approximate, my finite element

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.170
solution U(x) is going to
be a combination of those.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.440
Some U_0, times
the phi_0 function,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:29.887
up to U_4 times
the phi_4 function.

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:30.970
And these are my unknowns.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.830
U_0, U_1, those numbers.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.980
I have five unknowns.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.030
And I'm using hat functions.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:45.240
So I should, really, why
don't I draw a graph of U(x).

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.910
So I don't need the
words piecewise linear.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.870
You see, I have a kind
of space of functions.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:08:01.080
My functions are all,
my approximations

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.080
are combinations of these
fixed basis functions.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.530
You could call these phis, trial
functions, basis functions,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.100
you're always choosing,
in applied math,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:19.880
a bunch of functions whose
combinations are going to be,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.660
is what you're
going to work with.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.500
And here I'm making
them hat functions.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.160
OK, so what does a combination
of those guys look like?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.310
I'll even erase the
word hat functions;

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.860
we won't forget that.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.090
So what would a
combination of-- Here's

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:42.470
the same interval zero, one,
with the same mesh, one, two,

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.790
three, four guys inside.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:50.590
What would-- It just helps
the visualization to see.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:57.360
If I combine these guys, so
those were, despite the way

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.920
it might look, that's
one separate function.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.660
Two, three, four and five.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.860
And now suppose I
take a combination.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.060
What kind of a
function do I get?

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:14.230
How would you describe this,
a combination like this?

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.710
Of those five guys?

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.890
What will it look like?

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:25.280
Between every node it will
be a straight line, right?

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.220
Because all these guys are
straight, between those.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.010
So a typical function
will start at what?

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:36.880
This height will be
U_0, because, well

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.000
let me draw a few things.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.020
OK, so I'll put U_0 a
little higher because I

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.830
want to end up down at zero.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:49.140
So that might be the height U_0,
and U_1 might be pretty close.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.820
U_2 might be coming down a bit.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.120
Coming down a bit,
coming down a bit.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.850
And ending at zero.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:01.610
So those were meant
to be corners.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.570
That wasn't a very good bit.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.750
There, OK.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.260
It wasn't meant to be, yeah.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.720
So that height is U_0.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.330
Now, notice why?

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.210
Why is that?

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.440
Why is the coefficient
of phi_0 exactly

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:24.210
the height, the
displacement, at zero?

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:29.490
Because all the
other phis are zero.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:34.390
All the other phis are
zero at this point.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.980
Only this guy's coming in.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:42.010
So we'll only see in
this, at this point,

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.130
see, even phi_1 has
dropped to zero.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.640
So we're only going to
see phi_0 times U_0.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:54.930
So, I should have said, we take
all these heights to be one.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.380
Height is one.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.060
Course it doesn't matter
because we're multiplying

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.680
by u's, but so let's settle.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.540
They all have heights one.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.260
And this is sort of a key part
of the finite element idea.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.910
You see, Galerkin,
when he created

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.470
just two or three
functions phi, he

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.700
tried to follow
the exact solution.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.651
He had an idea in his mind what
the solution to the problem

00:11:21.651 --> 00:11:22.150
will be.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.370
And he wanted to take two
or three functions that

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.200
would get him close to it.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.530
Here we choose the
functions, they're

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.470
in the finite element
library before we even

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.490
know what the equation is,
or the boundary conditions.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:42.820
These functions are like,
the hat function choice.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:48.810
And they have this beautiful
sort of a connect to nodes.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.510
In a way where-- In fact, I
got involved in finite elements

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.370
in the first place
just to understand

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.700
what's the difference
between finite elements

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.470
and finite differences.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.340
Because the finite
elements, as you'll see,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.130
are associated with nodes.
phi_1 is the only guy

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.660
that's not zero at node one.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.570
And therefore, what
will this height be?

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.440
What's that height?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.780
So that maybe comes
down a little.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.530
What's this height?

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.720
U_1.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.000
It's the coefficient of phi_1,
because phi_1 is sitting there.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.320
And all the other
phis are zero there,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.650
so this height is really U_1.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.860
And U_2, and U_3, and
U_4, and U_5 is zero.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:41.410
So that was U_1, U_2, and so on.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.070
What I'm saying is, and
we'll see it happen,

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:49.530
is that this KU=F equation
that we finally get to is going

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.310
to look very like a finite
difference equation.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.640
But it's coming from
this different direction.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:04.640
And this way allows
many more possibilities,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.170
gets things sort of
more naturally right.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:13.060
It takes less-- With the
finite difference equation,

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.020
we had to go in there and
decide what it should be.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.330
With finite elements, our
decision is just the phis.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.750
Once we've decided
the phis, Galerkin

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.730
tells us what the equation is.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.430
And we'll get to the
KU=F, what it is.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:38.300
But here I'm getting you to see
what our approximate solution

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.230
can look like.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.490
And this beautiful fact that
the coefficients in here

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.740
have a physical meaning.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.730
They're actually
the displacements

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.540
at the nodes for these
simple functions.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.390
OK.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.710
You got a picture of what
the trial functions are,

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:02.930
some people would think about
the functions as these guys.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.620
Other people might think of
this picture, the combinations.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.290
So those are the
individual basis functions.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.330
That's a typical combination
of the typical one.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:21.750
OK, so we're looking for
an equation for these U's.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.390
Five equations, of course.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.720
Because we've got five U's.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.520
So that's my final step here.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.420
What are the five
equations for the five U's.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.410
And those are the equations
that I'm going to call KU=F. OK.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.910
So here's now a critical moment.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.790
Where do the
equations come from?

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.830
Well, the equations
come from the weak form.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.270
So I take the weak form.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:59.730
And in for u, for u here,
I guess it's just there.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:00.540
I put this.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.320
I put capital U.
So can I just copy,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.510
this is the weak form for
before we've made it discrete.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.470
Before we've chosen n phis.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.980
OK, now let's choose the
n phis, so now this'll

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.360
be the weak form.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:27.170
Again, the weak
form with Galerkin.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.764
After the decision.

00:15:28.764 --> 00:15:30.555
So it'll be the integral,
from zero to one,

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:33.290
of this c(x), whatever it is.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:39.810
Times the U(x)-- sorry, times
the dU/dx, right? dU/dx,

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.070
so what is dU/dx?

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.300
Oh, you have to pay attention.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.870
This was a true solution.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.090
Little u.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.940
But now this is
where I'm working.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:58.560
I'm working with capital U. So
instead of the d little u dx,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.350
it's d capital U dx.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.580
Maybe I'll put it in
there. d capital U dx.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.500
And then I'll put
down here what it is.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.160
What is it?

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:15.210
It's U_0*phi_0, can I use
prime just to-- Or d phi_0/dx,

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.620
whatever?

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.740
Can I use prime for derivative?

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.690
Just save a little space.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.980
So this is the
derivative of my guy.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:32.010
U_1*phi_1'(x), up
to whatever it was.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.190
U_4*phi_4'(x).

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.680
That's what that term is.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.750
And that multiplies dv/dx.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:50.650
Where v is, here v
is any test function.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.700
Any test function, only
required to have v(1)=0.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:00.010
But now, I'm going discrete.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:06.260
So instead of any test function,
I'll use these five functions.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.110
So I've got five functions.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.660
The phis are the same
as the V's, then.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.420
V_1, V_2, V_3 and V_4.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.230
Same guys.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:24.570
So now I'll put in
dV, can I say dV_i/dx?

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:31.825
And on the right hand side I
have the integral from zero

00:17:31.825 --> 00:17:47.450
to one of f(x)*V_i(x)dx, i is
zero, one, two, three, or four.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.690
I'm testing against five V's.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:55.630
So I have this equation
for five different V's.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.770
So i equals zero,
one, two, three, four,

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.050
gives me my five equations.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.350
Here are my five unknowns.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.500
This is my five by five system.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.950
Let me just step back a minute
so you see what happened there.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.420
So what do you have to do?

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:19.120
You chose the basis functions,
the phis and the V's.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.550
Then you just plug into the
weak form, you plug in dU/dx,

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.350
is coming from there.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.360
So this is dU/dx.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.980
You have to plug dV/dx, you
have to do the integrals.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.480
You have to do the
integrals, that's

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.420
something we didn't have
in finite differences.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.530
Finite elements involves
doing the integrals, left side

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.880
and right-hand side.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.570
OK, so, and here we have five
different integrals to do.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.710
We have f(x) times
each V. This will be,

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.770
this number will be F_i.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:06.890
So my F vector is going to
be an F_0, F_1, down to F_4.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.830
The five guys that I get
from these five integrals.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.700
Alright.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.570
And the K matrix is
sitting here somewhere.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.800
That's the last thing,
that's the final thing,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.070
is to see what is the K matrix.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.510
Which is coming.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.840
This is somehow K's times
U's are sitting here.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.340
F's are sitting over there.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.500
So it may be good to
see the F's first.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.740
So do you see this now?

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.840
We made the choices,
then what's our job?

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:44.250
Our next job is to do
all the integrations.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.380
Integrate my function against V.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:52.840
Let's make the natural
first example, let f be one.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.220
First example, let f be one.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.360
All right.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:08.670
So if f is one, I'm going
to find the system KU=F.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:15.140
So if I know f(x) is one, then
I have everything I need to find

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.830
these numbers.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:23.800
OK, actually we can
probably do those by,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.500
you can probably tell
me what they are.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.400
If f(x) is one, now.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.910
So this is example one.
f(x) is a constant.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.110
One we have solved before.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.260
What's the integral of V_0?

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.390
Right, that's what I have to do.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.790
What's the integral of
this, f(x) being one,

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.800
I'm just asking, I
just have V_0(x)?

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.640
The integral of V_0(x),
and let me again draw V_0,

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.010
which is phi_0.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:01.230
It's a half hat and then
it goes along at zero.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.060
What's the integral
of that function?

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.600
One, yeah.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.710
How do I think
about that integral?

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.750
It's the area of the triangle.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.480
It's the area.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.460
That's what an integral
is, it's the area.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:20.670
So the area is, I've
got delta x there.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.750
Right, delta x as the base.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.870
One as the height, and
you see the formula

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:31.880
for the area of a triangle, it's
got a half in there somewhere,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.580
right?

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.390
A half.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.950
OK, can I factor
out the delta x?

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.860
Because the delta x
is going to come in.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.380
I think there's a half there.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.940
And then what about F_1?

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:51.740
What's the integral of this
times V_1(x), the next V?

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.900
It's the area under
this dashed function.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.960
Which is now the basis 2
delta x, so I get a one.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.260
Is that right?

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:06.450
I get a one, one, one, one.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:10.570
OK, so that was obviously
not too tough, right?

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:17.090
That was straightforward
and notice something.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.640
Even here, in fact,
we see it here.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.980
I don't know if you
remember about that half.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.110
Do you remember something about
when we did finite differences

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.970
and we had a free boundary?

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:37.810
And we lost an order of accuracy
if we didn't do it right?

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:40.030
Do you remember that?

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.120
At the fixed boundary
we were fine,

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.570
but with finite differences
at a free boundary,

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.170
where I was using the
matrix T. With one,

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:55.650
minus one at the top row, I
lost an order of accuracy.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.670
Unless I made some change
on the right-hand side.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.350
Look what's happening.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.790
The finite element method
is making the change for me

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.340
on the right hand side.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:11.250
So the finite element method
is going to automatically keep

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.420
the second order accuracy.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.840
Keep the second order accuracy.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.030
So that's a key point.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:22.050
That these piecewise
linear functions

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:27.310
are associated with
second order accuracy.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.950
Later we'll move
up to parabolas,

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.660
to cubics; that will move
up the order of accuracy

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.380
in a nice way.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.950
Where with finite
differences we would have

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:42.620
had to create new finite
difference formulas.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.370
Our minus one, two,
minus one formula,

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.350
that was good for
second order accuracy.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.990
Then we would have
to figure out,

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.010
in the quiz had
partly started it,

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.820
what if there's a c(x)
in there, what do you do?

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.230
Finite differences, there's
more thinking involved.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.090
Finite elements is like
just press the button.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.410
Well, there's a little more
to it than that of course,

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.520
because it's taking
a full lecture.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:17.930
But in the end it's more
systematic, you could say.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.390
So that's the F. Now
are you ready for the K?

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.590
So this is the key part, OK?

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:30.620
So you have to can get
this thing to simplify.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.820
So what am I looking for here?

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:39.050
This whole left-hand
side should be K times U.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:45.520
So I'm looking to see what
multiplies-- I'm looking

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.700
to make sense out of this.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.740
What's the first equation?

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.910
Right, so the first equation or
the zeroth equation, I guess.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.540
The zeroth equation,
the one that'll

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.730
run along and have
this right-hand side,

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:05.770
the zeroth equation is the
equation when i is zero.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.250
It's the equation that
comes from testing

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:13.510
our weak form for V_0.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:17.200
For that particular form.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.260
Maybe I'll just start
over on this board.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.750
Then I can write a
formula, but I'd rather you

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.120
see how it comes.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.680
So I'm looking at equation zero.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.040
So take i=0.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:41.350
So I have my left side
is my integral, of c(x).

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:46.150
Times this combination that
I wrote, U_0*phi_0' plus...

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:59.240
U_4*phi_4', times
dV_0/dx*dx equal,

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.020
and on the right side
is where I got the F_0,

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.440
which I already figured out
to be delta x times a half.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.890
It's the left side that
I'm worrying about.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:14.100
OK, you see what's
happening here?

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:19.800
This is some matrix.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.960
Its zeroth row is what we're
finding -- multiplying U_0,

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:34.360
U_1, U_2, U_3, and U_4
-- equaling the F vector.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.590
I'm supposed to be getting
the first row of the matrix,

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:42.980
the top row of the matrix,
from the top V. OK,

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.440
so let's just do these.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.900
We've got integrals to do again.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.830
Alright, what is dV_0/dx?

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.100
Do you see?

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.970
Let me just see?

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:02.240
What number is going in here?

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.810
What number is going in there?

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.490
Yeah, if we see
that we're golden.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.100
What number is going in there?

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:15.920
That's the thing that multiplies
U_0 in the first row that

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:22.930
means I should use V_0, so this
is the point, this is K_00.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.850
And what's its formula?

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.060
You realize I'm starting
the count at zero

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.040
because all these
counts-- So what is K_00?

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.040
It's an integral.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:40.000
Of what? c(x), good.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.360
Times this guy, because it's
multiplying, times this guy,

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.530
V_0', dx.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.600
That's what you have to do.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.050
That's what you have
to do. c(x) times

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:03.450
phi', it's phi_0', that's
what would sit there.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:11.720
And maybe, well, let's
figure that one, shall we?

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.300
I have to know c(x), right,
that's part of the problem.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.230
What would you like
me to choose for c(x)?

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.730
One.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.890
Thank you.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.570
I'll choose one.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.940
Let this be one.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.900
Or I could make it
capital C and you

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.770
would see a capital C appearing
everywhere, but let's make it

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:30.410
one.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:32.270
So what are we doing now?

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.230
What's our equation?

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.050
Our right-hand side is
one, our c(x) is one,

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:41.500
our equation has
reduced to -u''=1.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.260
The first equation
in the course.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:50.360
So we're back to September
the 3rd or whatever it was.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.830
But doing it now
by finite elements.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:58.960
OK, so let c(x) be one and
tell me what this integral is.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.790
So c(x) is now, we're
taking-- In our problem,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.570
we're supposing it's one.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:11.700
Let me just say:
Suppose it's function.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:20.230
Then we have lots of integrals
to do involving that function.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:24.050
And we might not do them
exactly, that would be alright.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:29.460
It's certainly totally OK to
do the integrals approximately,

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.140
because we're doing
everything else approximately.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.910
So we just have to be sure
that we do the integrals

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.330
with sufficient accuracy so
that we don't lose accuracy

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.780
in the integrals.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.810
Of course, with
a one we're going

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.420
to do the integral exactly.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.550
But if c(x) was some
variable function,

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.320
I wouldn't have
to do it exactly,

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.940
I would just have to do
it with enough accuracy

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.010
so that I don't
lose extra accuracy

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:02.510
beyond what I'm losing in the
whole Galerkin approximation.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.250
OK, ready for that number.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:11.490
What number comes out of that?
phi_0', let's graph phi_0'.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.520
And of course it's the
same as V_0', so can I

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.850
put a little graph here?

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:22.442
Here is zero to one, and
I'm going to graph phi_0'.

00:30:22.442 --> 00:30:23.150
So what's phi_0'?

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.850
Oh, it's negative, isn't it?

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.870
My little graph
isn't going to work.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.390
I didn't leave enough room.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:39.319
It's negative.

00:30:39.319 --> 00:30:40.610
So I'll just write it in words.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:44.110
It's the same as
V_0', and what is it?

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:50.290
Tell me what it is, what's the
derivative of that function?

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.180
It's what?

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.830
Negative one.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.300
Wait a minute.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.070
Yeah, it's going to have
a certain value, yeah.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.640
You can tell me what it is
beyond that point real fast.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:15.270
So it's something up to
delta-- So what is the slope?

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:20.140
What's that slope
there, of phi_0?

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:25.790
It's not negative one, because
remember, what's the base here?

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:30.610
That's not the point
one, I'm sorry.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:36.590
All these were delta x's.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.790
Those were just
numbering the nodes.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:43.200
But the actual length
scale is the delta x scale.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.150
So now tell me what it is.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:52.280
The derivative is negative
one over delta x, right?

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.290
It dropped by one when it
went across by delta x.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:02.690
And this is only up to node one.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:06.890
Up to delta x and
then zero afterwards.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.050
This is a key point.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:14.450
That all our
functions are local.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.800
Our functions are local.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.810
What does that mean?

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:23.650
You can tell me what am I
going to get when I integrate,

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:28.160
for example, when later
on I might be integrating

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.250
phi_1' against V_4'.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.240
What's the answer?

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.130
This is the key point.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:43.060
Later, when I'm looking
for the one, four entry,

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:47.260
when I'm looking there,
I'm going to do an integral

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.760
of phi_1'.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.790
I'll erase for a moment
and do this in my head.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:33:01.180
When I integrate
phi_1' against V_4'.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:06.480
Maybe it's the fourth row.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.480
And the first guy over, maybe
it's this guy I'm doing.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.950
Doesn't matter a whole lot.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:16.900
Because the answer is,
when I integrate phi_1'

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:22.500
against V_4' just, it's
nice to get the easy ones.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.620
It's zero.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.460
Why is it zero?

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:31.350
Why is the integral of
phi_1' against V_4' zero?

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:37.820
Because these phis are local.
phi_1' is only non-zero here.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.240
V_4' is only non-zero over here.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.420
The two don't overlap.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.570
Anywhere the one is not
zero, the other is zero.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:52.870
So that's a zero there.

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:59.840
In fact, our overlaps, I'm just
sort of looking ahead here.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:05.740
Our overlaps, a phi
overlaps itself, of course.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.850
And its right-hand neighbor
and its left-hand neighbor.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:13.070
But nobody two or
three or more away.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:19.420
I think our K, all our integrals
are going to be zero outside,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.540
we'll have another
tri-diagonal matrix.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.700
We're going to have
zeroes all here.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:36.610
And we'll only have
entries of phi against V

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:40.480
when they're either the
same or just differ by one.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.340
So we'll only have
three diagonals.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.430
OK, we were about to find
out what that number is.

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:53.170
So the slope of this is
minus one over delta x,

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:59.410
and that's-- I'm sorry, let
me go back to zero, zero.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.460
OK.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.560
This is what we're keeping
our fingers crossed for.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.810
What's that number?

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:15.690
So I have this thing,
actually is it just squared?

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.320
And that's the slope.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:21.340
And then the phi and the
V I'm choosing the same,

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.520
so that's the slope again.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.070
I think I'm just
getting one over delta

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:30.610
x squared for that times
that times the one.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.630
So what's K_00?

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:35.100
One over delta x.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.940
Where'd the delta x come from?

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:44.120
Because we're only integrating
over, it looks like zero to one

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.310
but they're all zero.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.070
We're really only
integrating, the only reality

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.750
was out to node one.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.500
Out to delta x.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:36:00.750
You see that the number there,
the number here on the diagonal

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:08.620
is one over delta x.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:14.340
OK, how about doing K_11 for me?

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.570
So again, now these guys
will be the same guys.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.320
It's a square.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:24.860
No it's the integral phi_1'
against V_1', they're the same.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:32.090
And what is phi_1', which
is the same as V_1'?

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.430
What's the derivative now?

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:39.730
It's, ah.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.650
What's the slope
of this function?

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:46.520
It goes up and goes
back down, right?

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.880
I have a plus part,
so the slope going up

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.280
is the one over delta x.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.250
And then the slope coming down
is minus one over delta x.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:04.270
So this was up to
delta x and then

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:08.900
to two delta x, and then zero.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.590
That's a much more
typical thing,

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.110
the slope goes the
function, the hat function

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.450
goes up to the top of the hat.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.140
Back down.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.360
The slope up and the
slope down are easy.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.680
And now the integral's easy.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.490
So I'm just squaring,
well, when I square it,

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.930
this squared is the one
over delta x squared.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:34.280
This is the same, because
the minus will get squared.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.320
So what's K_11?

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.510
What's K_11 now?

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:46.120
Have you got K_11 in your head?

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.280
This is one over
delta x squared.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.880
And now what is the integral?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.830
Two over delta x.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:04.160
Because now we're integrating
from zero to two delta x,

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.650
because that's where my
functions are going out

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.490
from zero to node two.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.110
If the function's numbered one.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:16.280
So it's two delta
x times this; I

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:22.670
think we get a two over
delta x on that diagonal.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:28.040
Would you care to guess
the rest of the diagonal?

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:36.240
Yes, you tell me what's
K_22 and K_33 and K_44?

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.390
They're all the same.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.110
We're just shifting over.

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:44.600
So two over delta
x goes down there.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.050
Alright, one more to do.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.820
One more integral to do.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.000
This next guy.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.520
So can you tell me what
do I get now for K_01?

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:07.310
K_01, so now this is the
case where I'm in row zero,

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:12.690
so this should be V_0, because
that tells me the row I'm in.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:13.340
But phi_1.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.420
What happens when I integrate,
just see the picture here.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:30.590
Let me just draw it small.
phi_1', so let me draw phi_1.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.130
And V_0.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.720
OK.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.340
But it's the
derivatives that I want.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.500
It's the slopes that I want, OK?

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:45.250
So what do I get
from here on out?

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.580
Zero, because this
guy only got to there.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.940
That's the half hat, the
first guy stopped at delta x.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.020
So whatever is happening here is
going to be multiplied by zero.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.460
So it's just here.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:04.520
One delta x interval
for this one.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.450
They just overlap in
one interval, of course.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:11.590
This guy and its neighbor
only overlap in one interval.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.750
And what's the deal
about the two slopes?

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.240
They're opposite.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.170
One's coming down,
one's going up.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.840
But the slopes are
one over delta x

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.510
and minus one over delta x.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.934
Do you see what's
happening here?

00:40:25.934 --> 00:40:26.600
I'm integrating.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.000
Here I have a slope
of one over delta x,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.990
and here I have a slope
of minus one over delta x,

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.730
so I should multiply those.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:41.950
Minus one over delta x squared,
integrate, what goes in K_01?

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:47.570
What's that number?

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:54.270
It's that times that
integrated, but now the integral

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:56.305
is only going
really out to delta

00:40:56.305 --> 00:41:01.400
x because basically I'm
just stopping there.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.740
So-- But there's a minus now.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.410
Because it's not the square.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.950
It's this times its neighbor.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:10.790
One's going up, and
one's going down.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.570
So it's delta x
squared, and then

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:23.610
the length of the interval, this
is a minus one over delta x.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:28.700
Would you care to guess
the rest of this matrix?

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.500
What's the rest
of that diagonal,

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.900
above the main diagonal?

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.930
It's all the same.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:43.760
That stays the same,
because when I do phi_2*V_1,

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.440
my picture is just
like shifted over.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.400
But I still have one coming
down, and one going up.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.610
When I do phi_3*V_2, same thing.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:42:00.210
And if I do phi_1*V_2,
it'll be the same.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.910
I'm going to get this
minus one over delta

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:07.470
x all the way on
that diagonal, also.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.660
Symmetry.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.990
It's going to come
out symmetric.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.410
Actually, since
the course started

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.910
by speaking about
properties of matrices,

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.600
let me just say K is
going to turn out to be

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.510
symmetric positive definite.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.350
And what's more,
for this example

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:27.040
we recognize K completely.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:33.090
You will say: Why did you take
so long to get to this result?

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:40.840
K is the one over delta x
part times, what's the matrix?

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:47.480
It's T. It's T. So it's one,
minus one, minus one, two,

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:53.220
minus one, minus one, two, minus
one, minus one, two, minus one,

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:57.670
and I guess we had five of them.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:01.180
Oh, but nobody there, right?

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.910
That's not there.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:06.480
That fixed-- Why do we
not have a minus one?

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.040
Because we've got no,
there isn't a six.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.990
That would be column-- We've
got one, two, three, four,

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:17.130
five columns; there's
no U_5, there's no V_5,

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.190
we've got them all.

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:27.760
And the F, so that-- So KU, this
thing multiplies U_0 to U_4,

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.330
to U_4, and it
produces F, which is

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:39.570
one over delta, which is what?

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:44.900
Oh, delta x is in
the numerator, right.

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:53.790
Times a half, one,
one, one and one.

00:43:53.790 --> 00:44:00.430
That is the finite
element system KU=F.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:04.640
For this simple problem.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.880
It's exactly what
finite differences did.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.180
So you can see why my first
introduction to finite elements

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:15.370
was with the question:
what's the difference?

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:18.330
The finite element community
at that point, this

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:23.230
was like the golden
age of finite elements,

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:26.430
all this was just
beginning to be created.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:33.140
These elements were being used.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.440
Especially in civil and
structural engineering,

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.380
that's where a lot of the
earliest papers came out of.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.260
And then, in a model problem
it didn't look anything new.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:50.060
It looked like our original
finite difference matrix.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:55.590
But there were some new things.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:59.320
First, there was this new 1/2,
that we hadn't particularly

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.150
noticed with finite differences.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.680
We, we could catch onto that.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.740
Here's a minor difference.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.390
You notice that the
delta x is-- Strictly

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.880
speaking the delta
x is up here then,

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.700
but when I divide
by delta x then I'm

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.990
back to the finite difference.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:19.340
I have the one over
delta x squared,

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.090
it looks like finite
differences again.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:24.040
So everything looks the same.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:30.750
But, of course, if c(x) isn't
one or if f(x) isn't one,

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:31.380
oh yeah.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:37.230
If c(x) isn't one then
I've got integrals to do.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:38.850
I would approximate those.

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:41.150
And I could then come out
with something that would

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:43.360
look like a finite differences.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.910
Let me take our other
favorite model problem.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:51.300
What would be the F if,
yeah, here's a question.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.680
What would be the right
side if my vector,

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.480
instead of being one, what's
my other favorite choice?

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.030
Delta.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:08.770
So I take delta at x minus, let
me take delta at x minus 1/4,

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:10.070
first.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:12.330
Suppose that's my f.

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:18.060
Then I've got to
change all these guys.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.590
And what would they be?

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:24.780
What would be the
new right-hand side

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:33.090
when I have this point load?

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.840
I have to go back to
the integrals, right?

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.980
I have to go back to these guys.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.440
These integrals,
with that new f,

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:49.310
this is now delta of x minus
a 1/4, times each V, times dx.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:52.200
I have to integrate
delta of x minus 1/4

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.460
against every hat function.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.560
And see what it equals?

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.380
And what will I get?

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.950
You're going to
tell me right away.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:04.780
What are those integrals?

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.730
That's a point load at node one.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:14.030
Times the V integrated
over the whole thing.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:18.060
What do I get?

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.270
I get a one, yeah.

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:25.220
That integral is going to pick
out the value at a quarter.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.100
Right, that's what the
delta function does,

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.020
the spike is at a quarter.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.690
Has area one, so it picks
out the V_i at a quarter.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.150
V_i at a quarter will be?

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:46.930
One for the-- I think we
get a [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:55.430
Again a little bit what
our finite differences

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:59.140
suggested that we should do.

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.230
Alright, here's one
final one for today.

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:05.880
Suppose the delta
function is not at a node.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.970
Suppose it's at 3/8.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.680
Or it could be at
any point a, but let

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.870
me just take a typical, a
special one where I can do it.

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:22.280
Suppose the load is at 3/8.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:27.000
What do I get for
the integrals now?

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.280
So now, it's delta
of x minus 3/8.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:40.490
The spike is at this point here.

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.420
That's where delta is
now, spiking at 3/8.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.670
Is that right?

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:51.380
We had 1/5, tell me what-- oh,
I should have had 1/5 before,

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.410
sorry.

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:55.230
Change that on the videotape.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:59.800
All those 1/4s were--
That 1/4 was 1/5,

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.600
and now what do I want?

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.710
Three?

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:07.070
I wanted to take a nice
one that was halfway.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.180
I just forgot what halfway was.

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.370
Where is halfway there?

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:16.100
3/10 now for delta.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.850
So that was-- Before I
had it for when delta.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:24.730
So previously was
delta at x minus 1/5

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:34.620
and now delta at x minus
3/10, what's the F now?

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:35.690
What's the F now?

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:39.810
So the spike is right in the
middle between one and two.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:43.850
What's do those
integrals come out to be?

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:49.000
If I integrate delta function
times the different hats,

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.830
what do I get?

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:52.980
What do I get, yeah.

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.960
I get a zero for this
first guy because it

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.880
didn't touch the half hat.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.150
And then what do I get there?

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.190
Half.

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:03.480
And what do I get
at the next one?

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.750
Half again.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:07.630
And then the other
guys it doesn't touch.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.970
You see, it
automatically does it.

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.980
Does those smart things.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.800
It automatically makes
the smart choice.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:21.700
And if the spike was
at a, at any point a,

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.770
then at that typical
point a wherever it is,

00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:27.830
like there, spike
could be there.

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:31.840
Then I would have, what would
I have if the spike was there?

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.840
I'd have a little bit of
phi_3, and a big bit of phi_4.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.780
And the two parts
would add to one.

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.920
It would take the
right proportion.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:47.080
It would be the proportion,
by however much this spike was

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:51.540
near there, it would give
that extra weight to phi_4.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.870
OK.

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.570
So there is the
finite element method.

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:02.180
It produced something that you
might say, oh, we knew that.

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:08.340
But you've got to see that it
deals automatically with c(x),

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.220
it deals automatically
with f(x),

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.810
it deals automatically
with the free boundary.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:18.715
You see, the solution
there is going

00:51:18.715 --> 00:51:22.600
to take sort of a balance,
a pretty close balance,

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:27.420
of this half hat with this one,
and the solution will actually

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:30.800
be a pretty close to free.

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.540
It'll be pretty close to having
the right zero slope there.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:36.360
OK, good.
