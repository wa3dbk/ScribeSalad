00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.200
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so I've
got Quiz 2 to give back to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.040
with good scores.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.050
So it's Christmas early.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.800
Or, good work on that exam.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.510
That's fine and so we all
know Fourier series is

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.450
like a central topic on the
final third of the course,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.470
and I'll just keep
going on Fourier series.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.360
I'll give you homework
on 4.1 and 4.2.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.180
So 4.1 is what we complete
today, the Fourier series.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.910
4.2 is the discrete
Fourier series.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.990
So those are two
major, major topics

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.190
for this part of the course.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.960
This is the periodic one and
4.2 will be the finite one,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.910
with the Fourier
matrix showing up.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.830
OK, so can I pick
out, I've made a list

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.570
of topics last time that
were important for 4.1,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.780
for Fourier series.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.830
And I think these are the
remaining entries on the list.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:42.970
I did the Fourier series for the
odd square wave, the minus one

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.090
stepping up to plus one.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.760
And you remember that, well just
let me put that example down

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.560
here.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.450
That was the step
function; easier

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.270
if I draw it than if I
try to write equations,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.480
so it was minus
one up to plus one,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.180
ending at-- of
course period 2pi.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.890
And I guess we called that S(x),
for S signaling step function,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.400
S signaling square wave.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.010
And S the general a signal
that the function is odd.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.100
And that means that it
goes with sine functions.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.450
And I think the numbers that
we found from the formula was

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.620
sin(x)/1, sin(3x)/3, sin(5x)/5,
it's just a great one

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.680
to remember.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.120
And that's the example
that has the important,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840
and I don't know if I
wrote down Gibbs' name.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.945
He was the great
physicist at Yale, well,

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:10.520
a hundred years ago or
more, and did this key idea

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.260
that appears all the time,
that any time you have a step

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.380
function then the Fourier
series, it does its best,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.910
I if I take a thousand
term, it'll do its best

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.960
but it will overshoot by
an amount that Gibbs found,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.070
and then it will
get really close

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.480
and then it will overshoot
again and then, symmetrically.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.010
Or anti-symmetrically,
I should say.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.030
So that's the Gibbs phenomenon
of great importance.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.120
I write this one out
because first it's

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.140
an important one to remember.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.410
Second it'll give
us a good example

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.620
for this important equality,
that the energy in the function

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.970
is the energy in
the coefficient.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.250
That'll be good.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.270
OK, actually maybe I
should do that one first

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.900
because the delta function
has got infinite energy

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.560
and we don't learn anything
from this equation.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.570
So let me jump to the
energy in the function

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.900
and the energy in
the coefficient.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.910
So what do I mean by energy?

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.300
Well, it's quadratic.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.640
Right?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.980
It's the length squared here.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.120
It's the length squared
of the function.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.500
So let me compute, maybe I'll
do it on this board underneath

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.140
and leave space for
the delta function.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.540
The energy in x space
is just the integral--

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.630
It's the length squared.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.090
The integral of
S(x) squared. dx.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.900
It's just what you would expect.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.990
We have a function,
not a vector,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.180
so we can't sum
coefficients squared.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.740
Instead we integrate
all the values squared.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.550
And of course, this is a
number that we can quickly

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.280
compute for that function.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.800
So what does it turn out to be?

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.200
Well, what is S(x)
squared for that function?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.580
One, obviously.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.480
The function is one here.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.970
I'm looking at the original
S(x), not the series.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.410
The function is one there
and minus one there.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.100
When I squared
those, S(x) squared

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.570
is one everywhere so I'm
integrating one everywhere

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.450
from minus pi to pi.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.840
So I get the answer 2pi.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.900
So that's a case
where the energy

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.100
in the physical
space, the x space,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.260
was totally easy to compute.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.660
Now, what about energy,
what is this equality?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:03.630
This really neat easy
to remember equality?

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.480
I'm just going to find it by
taking this thing squared.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.050
What's the integral of
the right-hand side?

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:20.590
The two are equal, so
suppose I just fire away?

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.980
I integrate the square
of that infinite series.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.050
You're going to say, well
that's going to take a while.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.750
But what's going to be good?

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.630
The key point, the first
point in last time's lecture,

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.180
the first point in every
discussion of Fourier series,

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.220
is orthogonality.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.530
Sines times other sines
integrated are zero.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.790
So a whole lot of terms will go.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.090
So I take that
thing, I square it.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.680
So let me let me
do that one here.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.880
The interval from
minus pi to pi.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.140
May I take out the
(4/pi) squared?

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.510
Just so it's not confusing.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:16.210
Now, this is the sin(x)/1,
sin(3x)/3, sin(kx)/k,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.770
and so on.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.760
All squared. dx, and
so what do I get?

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.580
The (4/pi) squared.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.210
And now I've got a
whole lot of terms.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.600
But the thing is, I can do this.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.660
Because when I square this,
I'll have a lot of terms like

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.870
sin(x)*sin(3x), and when I
integrate those I get zero.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.290
So the only ones
that I don't get zero

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.540
are when sin(x)
integrates against itself.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.070
And sin(3x) against itself.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.780
So when sin(x) integrates
against itself,

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.410
that's sine squared.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.655
Its integral is, you
remember the integral

00:07:56.655 --> 00:08:03.260
of sine squared, which is,
its average value is 1/2.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.750
We're over an interval-- I
think I'm going to get pi,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.580
for sine squared.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.770
Because sine squared-- We could
do that calculation separately.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.130
It's just a standard integral.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.600
The integral of
sine squared is pi.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.580
Actually, yeah it
just uses the fact

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:25.460
that sine squared x is the same
as whatever it is the same as.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:33.360
Is it 1-cos(2x) or something?

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.220
Over two.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.230
Or plus, who cares?

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:42.400
Because the integral of
whichever, plus or minus,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.412
let me, well I suppose
for history's sake

00:08:46.412 --> 00:08:47.370
we should get it right.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.190
Which is it?

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.800
Is it a minus, so
it looks OK now?

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.690
OK, alright, if it's
wrong I didn't say.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.490
OK, but I'm going to integrate.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.520
So the integral of
the cosine is zero,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.240
and the integral of the 1/2
is the part I'm talking about.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.520
That 1/2 is there all the
way from minus pi to pi.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.520
So I get a pi.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.300
From all these sines.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.410
And now, what are all the terms?

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:21.170
Well, one over one squared,
that just had a coefficient one,

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.960
but what's the next guy?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.720
You remember I'm squaring
it, I'm integrating.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.750
But I have a 1/3 squared.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.610
And 1/5 squared.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.940
And so on.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.110
And here's a great point.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.850
These two are equal.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.270
I've got the same function,
expressed in x space,

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:49.050
and here it's expressed in
sine space, you could say.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.710
In harmonic space.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.210
OK, so that's equal.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.070
And that's going to be
the fact in general.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.070
In general, that
the integral of S(x)

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.220
squared, so the general fact
will be the integral of-- Well,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.590
I'll write it down below.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.540
But let's just see what
we got for numbers here.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.530
So I had pi on both sides.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.990
And so if I lift that over
there, I get something

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.460
like-- what do I have?

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:22.060
Pi squared over 16, maybe I
have pi squared over eight.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.430
You just get a
remarkable formula.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.820
Putting that up there would
be pi squared over 16,

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.550
and the two makes it an eight.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:36.640
And here I have the sum of
1/1 squared plus 1/3 squared

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.700
plus 1/5 squared.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.830
So, that's an infinite
sum that I would not

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:50.460
have known how to do
except it appears here.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.770
The sum of one over
all those squares.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.600
If I picked another
example, I could

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.010
get the sum-- Oh, this was
all the odd numbers squared.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.160
If I picked a
different function,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.140
I could have got one that
also had the sin(2x)/2

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.800
and the sin(4x)/4.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.490
So this would have been
the sum of all the squares.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.580
Do you happen to know
what that comes out to be?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.070
I mean, here's a
way to compute pi.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.320
We have a formula for pi.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.390
And we'd have another formula
that involved all the sums.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.150
Maybe I have room
for it up here.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:37.280
This would be the sum
of 1/n squared, right?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.900
This here I have
only the odd ones.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.620
And I get pi squared over eight.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.300
Do you happen to know what
I get for all of them?

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.810
So I'm also including
1/2 squared,

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.160
there's a quarter also in here.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.960
And also a 16th.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.270
And also a 36th, in this one.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:01.080
And the answer happens to
be pi squared over six.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:08.100
Pi squared over six.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.660
The important point about
this energy equality

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:19.010
is not being able to get a
few very remarkable formulas

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.800
for pi.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.050
There's another remarkable
formula in the homework.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.480
This is a little famous.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.360
Do you know what this is?

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.890
This is the famous
Riemann zeta function.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:39.230
The sum of 1/n^x is
the zeta function at x.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.840
Here's the zeta function at two.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.100
So if I could draws a zeta.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.700
Maybe?

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.980
There's a Greek guy in
this class who could

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.470
do it properly, but anyway.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.650
I'll chicken out.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:02.530
Zeta of, at the
value two, zeta(2).

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.630
So we know zeta(2),
we know zeta(4).

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.495
I don't think we
know zeta(3), I think

00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:18.000
it's not a special number
like pi squared over six.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.440
So the zeta function, the
sum of 1 over n to this thing

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.350
is, actually that's the
subject of a problem

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.170
that Riemann did not solve.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.836
There's a problem
Riemann did not solve,

00:13:31.836 --> 00:13:36.480
and nobody has succeeded to
find it, to solve it since.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.830
There's a million-dollar
prize for its solution.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.150
My neighbors think I
should be working on this,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.760
but I know better.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.570
It's going to be solved one
day, but it's pretty difficult.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:56.250
And that is to know where this
zeta function, where it's zero.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.880
Of course, it isn't zero at two.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.260
Because it's pi
squared over six.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:05.210
And actually the conjecture
is that it's zero,

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:10.140
all the zeroes are at
points, complex numbers

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.330
with real part 1/2.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.280
So they're on this famous
line, the imaginary line

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.480
with real part 1/2.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:25.250
And that's the most important
problem in pure mathematics.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.130
So here we go.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:31.310
We got a formula for pi out
of this energy identity.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:36.250
And I'll write it again,
once I have the complex form.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.300
OK, but you see
where it comes from.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.460
It just comes from
orthogonality.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.710
The fact that we could
integrate that square

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.920
is what made it all work.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.650
OK, let's do the delta function.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.710
So that's an even
function, the delta, right?

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.760
Now I'm looking at
the delta function.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.030
Minus pi to pi.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.360
It has the spike at
zero and it's certainly

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.990
even so we expect cosines.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.990
And what are the coefficients?

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:15.580
So it's just an
important one to know.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.760
Very important example.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.950
So what's a_0?

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.900
In general, the coefficient
a_0 in the Fourier series

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:28.680
is the-- If I have a
function, delta(x), S(x),

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.460
whatever my function, the a_0
coefficient is the average.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.210
a for average, a_0
is the average value.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:46.000
So this is 1/(2pi) the
integral from minus pi to pi

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.920
of my function.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.400
Where did that come from?

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.020
I just integrated.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.850
I just multiplied
both sides by one.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.480
Or by 1/(2pi), and integrated.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.970
And those terms disappeared,
and I was left with a_0,

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.900
and what's the answer?

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.730
Everybody knows that integral.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.560
The integral of the
delta function is one,

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.620
so I just get 1/(2pi).

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.410
So 1/(2pi).

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.600
OK, now ready for a_1.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.550
How much of cos(x) do I have?

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.150
Can I just change this
formula to give me a_1

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.230
and you can tell
me what it gives?

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.150
Well let me do it here.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.540
Here's a_1.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.550
What's the formula for a_1?

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.720
It's just like b_1,
like the sine formulas.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.220
You have to remember
you're only dividing by pi.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.010
Because that average
value was 1/2, as we saw.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.780
And then you have the integral
of whatever your function is.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.940
delta(x) in this case.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.440
Times the cos(1x).

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.360
If we're looking for a_1 we've
multiplied both sides by cos(x)

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.460
and integrated.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.960
And what answer do we get?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.430
For a_1?

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:11.520
What's the integral of
delta(x) times cos(x)?

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.110
dx, so I should put in a dx.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.340
And the answer is?

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.860
One, also one.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:21.150
The delta function, this
spike, picks out the value

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.212
of this function at the spike.

00:17:24.212 --> 00:17:25.670
Because of course
it doesn't matter

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.620
what that function is
away from the spike,

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.357
because the other
factor, delta, is zero.

00:17:31.357 --> 00:17:33.190
Everything is at that
spike, all the action,

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.690
and this happens to
be one at the spike.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.080
So I get a 1/pi.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.010
And actually, the same
formula for all these guys.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:48.280
This will be the same with
cos(x) changed to cos(2x).

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.550
And what will be the answer now?

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.360
Again, one.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.030
Right?

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.740
It's the value of this integral.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.900
The formula for
a_2 would have come

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:05.520
by multiplying both sides
by cos(2x), integrating.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.530
And the integral of cos
squared would give me the pi,

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.960
and I'm dividing by
the pi, and I just

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.970
need that integral
and it's easy.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.090
It's also 1/pi.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.880
So all these are 1/pi.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.150
Let me just put in the formula.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:31.880
1/(2pi), and all the
rest are 1/pi. cos(3x).

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.970
All the cosines are there.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.940
All in the same amount.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:43.060
And the constant term
is slightly different.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:49.330
OK, that's the formal Fourier
series for the delta function.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:55.130
Formal meaning you
can use it to compute,

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.320
of course some things will
fail, like what's the energy?

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.120
If I integrate, if
I try to do energy

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.370
in x space of the delta
function, or energy in k space,

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.180
what answer would I get?

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.720
Right, the integral of
delta squared, its energy,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.320
is infinite, right?

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.430
The integral of delta, if
I have delta times delta

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.800
then I'm really
in trouble, right?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.860
Because this delta says,
if I can speak informally,

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.060
that delta says take the
value of this function

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.230
at zero, but of course
that's infinite,

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.450
so that would be infinite.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:39.940
That would be the
energy in x space.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.620
What about the
energy in k space?

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.530
Well, let's think, what's
the energy in k space?

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.590
I'm going to do the squares
of the coefficients,

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.600
you remember that's
what I had down here?

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.450
And I'll have it
again in a moment.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.620
It's the sum of the squares
of the coefficients, fixed up

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.800
by factors of pi.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.730
And here, all the
coefficients are constants.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.590
So that sum is infinite.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.890
Again, it's the sum of
squares, of constant,

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.040
constant, constant,
constants, and that series

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.910
doesn't converge, it blows up.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.300
So the energy is infinite.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.910
That's OK.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.010
The key is that formula.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.620
OK, there's the
formula to remember.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.510
There's the formula.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.800
On forever.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:40.370
Every frequency is in
here to the same amount.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.520
OK, good.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.920
That's the delta
function example.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:51.100
OK, ready to go to complex?

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.990
Complex is no big deal
because we know, actually,

00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.375
you can tell me the complex
series for the delta function.

00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:02.720
I'll write it right underneath.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.000
The complex series for
the delta function,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.890
just turn these guys
into e^(i*theta)--

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:18.510
e^(i*x)'s, and e^(i*2x)'s,
and e^(-i*2x)'s.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.460
Just term by term,
just to see it.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.820
To see it clearly for
this great example.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.780
So what does cos(2x)
look like in terms

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:34.600
of complex exponentials?

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:45.800
Everybody knows cos(x) is the
same as e^(ix) and e^(-ix),

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.080
right?

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:51.480
Divided by two, because
this is cos(x)+i*sin(x),

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.820
this is cos(x)-i*sin(x), when
I add them I get two cos(x)'s.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.610
So I must divide by two.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.440
Let me divide by
two all the way.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.670
So I'm dividing
this 1/pi by two.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.750
You'll see it's so much nicer.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.470
So 1/(2pi) times the one,
that's our first guy.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.020
And now I've got the next guy.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.520
Right?

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.650
Because I need to divide by
the two to get the cosine,

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.870
and there's my two.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.340
OK, what's the next?

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.710
What do I have next?

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.740
From this guy.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.790
1/pi, still there.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.900
What's cos(2x), if I
want to write it in terms

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.560
of complex exponentials?

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:51.330
So this guy now, I'm ready for
him, is e^(i*2x) and e^(-i*2x).

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.990
Divided by two,
and there's my two.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.690
Do you see what's happening?

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.350
There's an example
to show you why

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.960
the complex case is so nice.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:12.140
Here we had to remember a
different number for a_0.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:17.090
Here it's just, so the
next one will be e^(i*3x),

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:26.460
and e^(-i*3x), so that the delta
function in the complex Fourier

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.270
series, all the terms have
coefficients one divided

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.510
by the 2pi.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.180
That's a great example.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.850
And of course we see again that
the sum of squares, oh yeah.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:47.740
So let's do the complex
formula, by which I

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:53.850
mean I'm taking any function
F, not necessarily even, not

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:57.390
necessarily odd, not
necessarily real.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.550
Any function can now
be a complex function,

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.870
because we're going to
use complex things here.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:12.950
So I'll have all the
complex exponentials.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.220
For integer k.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:19.670
This k is an integer but it
can go from minus infinity

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.960
to infinity.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.820
That's the complex form.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:32.790
F(x) is a series again.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:37.030
The beauty is that every
term looks the same.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:41.390
The thing you have to remember
is that negative k is allowed,

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.860
as well as positive k.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.010
You see that we
needed the negative k

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:52.950
to get cosines. k was minus
1 there, k was minus 2 there.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.540
And for sines we
would also need them.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.850
So cosines go into
it, sines go into it.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.870
F(x) could be complex.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.800
That's the complex series.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.520
So maybe we could have
started with that series.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.030
But we didn't, we
came to it here.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.400
But what's the formula
for its coefficient?

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.460
OK, actually, so the
next half-hour now,

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.830
we have to think complex.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.380
And that will bring
a few changes.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.760
So watch for the changes.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:32.990
You see we're almost
in the same ballpark,

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.410
but there are a couple
of things to notice.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.530
So let me write down
that series again.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:43.310
Minus infinity to infinity
of some coefficient e^(ikx).

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.740
Now, what is c_k?

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:54.800
What is the formula for c_k?

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.830
As soon as we answer
that question,

00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:02.690
you'll see the new
aspect for complex.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.290
How do I find coefficients?

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:09.320
I multiply by
something, I integrate,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.970
and I use orthogonality.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.850
Same idea, just
repeat after repeat.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.200
The question is, what
do I multiply by?

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.360
If I wanted to
know c_3, suppose I

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.430
want to know a formula
for c_3, the coefficient.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:29.470
What am I going to
multiply by that's

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.860
going to give me the
orthogonality I need,

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.540
that all the other integrals
are going to disappear,

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.890
that's the key?

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.740
I want to multiply by something
so that when I integrate,

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.020
all the other integrals
are going to disappear.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.780
And let's just do it.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:48.750
Here, suppose I have e^(i5x).

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:56.260
And I'm looking for c_3.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.820
So I'll look at e^(i3x).

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.460
So watch.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.840
This is the small
point we have to make.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.760
So I'm looking for e^(i3x).

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.460
So I'm going to
multiply by something,

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.900
and I'm going to integrate.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.070
And what would be the
good thing to multiply by?

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.840
Well, you would say, if you
were just a real person,

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.070
you would say multiply
by e^(i3x), integrate.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.540
And hope for getting zero.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.230
You won't get zero.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:38.000
If I multiply e^(i3x)--
I'm sorry, you might say--

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.690
What am I doing here?

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.670
I'm trying to check
orthogonality.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.110
Let me instead of three use kx.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.160
So that's a typical complex one.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.340
It's any one of these guys.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:28:00.850
And I want to see
what's orthogonality.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:02.650
That's what I'm asking.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.840
Everything hinged
on orthogonality.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.440
We've got to have
orthogonality here.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.160
But let me show you what it is.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:18.670
The thing you multiply by to get
the c_3 is not e^(i3x), it is?

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.020
e^(-i3x).

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.120
You take the conjugate.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.720
You change i to minus
i in the complex case.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:34.880
So if I take e^(ikx)
times e^(-ilx),

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:40.350
and notice that minus,
I claim that I get zero.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.700
Except if k is l.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.720
And when k is l, I
probably get 2pi.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.540
If k is l.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.020
I get zero if k is not l.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.120
That's the beautiful
orthogonality.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.750
I'm not too worried about the
2pi, I'll figure that out.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:08.110
So what I'm saying is, when
you're taking inner products,

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.260
dot products, and you've
got complex stuff,

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:17.090
one of the factors takes
a complex conjugate.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.350
Change i to minus i.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.240
Do you see that we've got a
completely easy integral now?

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.750
What is the integral
of this guy?

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.430
How do I see that
I really get zero?

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:31.010
So this is the first time I'm
actually doing an integration

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.720
and seeing orthogonality.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.030
Anybody likes
integrating these things,

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:43.470
because they're so
simple to integrate.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.330
Before I plug in
the limits, what's

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.460
the integral of this guy?

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:53.160
How do I rewrite that
to integrate it easily?

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.150
I put the two
exponents together.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:30:03.700
This is the same as
e^(i(k-l)x), right?

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.020
The exponentials
follow that rule.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.580
If I multiply exponentials,
I combine the exponents.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.730
And now I'm ready to integrate.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.610
And so what is the
integral of e^(i(k-l))x?

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:22.235
When I integrate e
to the something x,

00:30:22.235 --> 00:30:29.580
I get that same thing again
divided by the something.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.710
So now I've integrated, and
now I just want to go from zero

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:40.610
to 2pi, plug in the
limits from x=0 to x=2pi.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:44.200
This is what the integral
is asking me for.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.400
So I'm actually doing
the integral here.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.600
I put these together
into that, I integrated,

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.880
which just brought
this term down below,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:01.900
because the derivative
will bring that term above.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.340
Oh, they weren't
meant to change.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.830
Actually, it's wrong but right.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.360
To change those
integration limits.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.360
I mean, any 2pi would
work, but thank you.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.010
You're totally right, I should
have done minus pi to pi.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.970
Why do we get zero?

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.240
That's the whole point.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.710
Here we actually
did the integral,

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:28.730
and we can just plug
in x=pi and x=-pi.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.430
Or we could plug
in zero and 2pi,

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:35.630
or I could plug in any
guys that were 2pi apart,

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.380
any period of 2pi.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:43.590
Why do we get zero?

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:48.040
Do you have to do the
plugging in part to see it?

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.860
You can, certainly.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.550
But the point is, this
function is periodic.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.920
That's a function
that has period 2pi.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.000
So it has to be the same at
the lower and the upper limit.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.620
That's what it's coming to.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.120
That's a periodic function.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.430
It's equal at these two limits.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:10.990
And therefore, when
I do the subtraction

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.830
I take it at the top
limit, minus the answer

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.880
at the bottom limit,
it's the same at both.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.240
So I get zero.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:22.740
So there is the actual
check of orthogonality.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.110
So the key point
was, orthogonality,

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.480
or inner product, for complex
functions, one of them

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.610
has to take the
complex conjugate.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:37.080
Let me just do for vectors, too.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.560
Complex vectors.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.680
I may have mentioned it, let
me take the vector [1, i]

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.240
as an extreme example.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:54.060
And suppose I wanted to find
the inner product with itself.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.170
Which will be the
length squared.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.740
What's the inner product of
that vector, that complex vector

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.750
[1, i], with itself?

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.410
Let me just raise
it up so we see it.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.540
Focus on this.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:12.930
Usually the length squared would
be one squared plus i squared.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:13.560
No good.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.260
Why no good?

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.660
Because it's zero.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.370
One squared plus
i squared is zero.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:26.690
We want absolute values squared.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.560
Absolute values,
we need squares.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.370
We need positive numbers here.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:35.060
So the length of this
squared, I would-- So

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:41.090
let me call that vector v. I
want to take not v transpose

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:50.130
v, that's the thing that would
give me zero, if I did [1, i].

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:53.480
I have to take the
complex conjugate.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.140
One of the two factors, and
it's just a matter of convention

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.490
which one you do, this is
the thing that gives me

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:03.610
the length of v squared.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.630
And it's the same
thing for functions.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:10.430
It's the integral of F(x)--
Do you want me to write it

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:16.930
as, it's the integral of
F(x) times its conjugate.

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:21.620
That gives me the
length of F squared.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:27.300
And of course I can rewrite
that as the integral of F.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:33.160
We have this handy notation
for F times its conjugate.

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:40.050
It's like re^(i*theta)
times re^(-i*theta),

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:51.420
the product of re^(i*theta)
times re^(-i*theta) is what?

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.150
This is the complex number,
this is its conjugate,

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.820
when I multiply, you notice
that i went to minus i

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:06.960
when I drop below the real axis,
I just change i to minus i.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.100
So those cancel and
I get r squared.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.910
The length, the
size of the number.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:17.810
It's just, if you
haven't thought complex

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:22.090
just make this change
and you're ready to go.

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:29.430
Yeah just v bar transpose v, F
bar transpose F, if you like,

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:33.390
or F squared.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.320
And when we make
the correct change

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.810
we still have the orthogonality.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.820
OK?

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.870
So that's what orthogonality
is, now what's the coefficient?

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.990
So now, after all that
speech, tell me what

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.930
do I multiply both sides by?

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:55.830
Let me start again
and remember here.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:36:03.440
So my F(x) is going to
be sum of c_k*e^(ikx).

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.940
And if I want to
get a coefficient,

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.480
I'm looking for a
formula for c_3.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.870
So how do I find c_3?

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:17.070
Let me slow down a second.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.210
How to find c_3?

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:27.430
Multiply both sides by what?

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.680
And integrate.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.620
Minus pi to pi.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.200
What goes there?

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:41.530
If I want c_3, I should
multiply both sides by, should I

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.110
multiply both sides by e^(i3x)?

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.630
Nope.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.360
e^(-i3x).

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.310
Multiply both sides by
e^(-i3x) and integrate.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:57.700
e^(-i3x) d x.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.880
And then on the right
side I get what?

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:07.460
I get c_3, because that'll
be e^(-i3x) times e^(+i3x),

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:14.310
I'll be integrating one so
I get a 2pi, and all zeroes.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.140
From all the other terms.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.960
Orthogonality doing
its job again.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.290
All these zeroes are
by orthogonality.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:28.580
By exactly this
integration that we did.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:35.960
If k is three and l is seven
or k is seven and l is three,

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.340
the integral gives zero.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.480
So what's the formula then?

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:47.190
This is all gone, divide
by 2pi and you've got it.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.360
There you are.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.200
That's the coefficient.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.760
OK.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.780
We have to move to
complex numbers,

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:01.760
and now in those 20 minutes--
The only change to make

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.730
is conjugate one of them.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:11.180
One of the things when
it can be complex.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:16.470
So that's the complex series.

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.330
What's the energy
inequality now?

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:25.010
Let me do the energy equality
in x space and in k space.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:30.940
If I take this, now
I'd like-- So that's

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.090
an equality of two functions.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:38.200
Now I'd like to get it,
I want to do energy.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.530
This is fantastic.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.160
And extremely
practical and useful.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.490
The fact that the energy is
going to come out beautifully,

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:45.990
too.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.280
So what am I going
to do for energy?

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:55.190
I'm going to integrate
F(x) squared, dx.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:56.070
That's the energy.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:39:00.730
That's the energy in x
space, in the function.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.190
What do I do now?

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:11.310
I integrate this series.
c_k*e^(ikx) squared.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.470
Oh no, whoa.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:18.220
If I put a square
there, right, I'm fired.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.775
Right?

00:39:18.775 --> 00:39:19.650
What do I have to do?

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.840
I will put a square
there, but I have

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.190
to straighten out something.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.000
What do I do?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.260
Those curvy lines,
which just meant

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:35.460
take the thing and square,
should be changed to?

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.480
Straight.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.420
Just a matter of
getting straight.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.860
Straightening this out.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.700
OK, straight.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.750
There we are.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.120
OK.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.570
Now, that means the thing
times its conjugate.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:49.380
That's the thing
times its conjugate.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.520
So what do I get?

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.540
All the terms disappear
except the perfect,

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.450
the ones that are squared.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.870
So what do I get here?

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.900
And the ones that are
squared I'm integrating one,

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.050
so I get a 2pi.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.290
So there's a 2pi.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.910
This whole subject's full of
these pi's and 2pi's, it's

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:11.510
just part of the deal.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:15.230
Now, what's left?

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.510
And now I'm looking
only at the terms where

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:22.560
I'm integrating something
by its conjugate,

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.320
by its own conjugate.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.040
And then I'm getting c_k
times its own conjugate,

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.380
so I'm getting all the terms.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.880
I'm getting no cross
terms, just the terms

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.620
that come from that
times it's own conjugate.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:40.340
Which is c_k squared.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:46.470
That's the energy
in the coefficients.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:50.400
That's the energy in k
space, and of course that sum

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.670
goes minus infinity to infinity.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.330
I've got them all.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:41:00.220
That's the energy in k space,
here's the energy in x space.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:06.410
You can expect that
this orthogonality

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:11.760
is going to give you
something nice for the energy.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.850
For the integral of the square.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:16.780
Alright, so you saw that.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.150
And let's see.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.000
So we saw it for, we
actually got a good number

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.880
for the square wave.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.280
We got infinity for
the delta function.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.170
I've put on here
as a last topic,

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:36.730
to just give the word function.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:42.000
Part of what this course is
doing is to speak the language,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.410
teach the language
of applied math.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.960
So that when you see
something, you see this,

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.910
you recognize hey I've
seen that word before.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.980
So I want to know, what's
the right space of functions?

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:07.530
This is my measure for the
length squared of a function.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:11.580
My square wave is great.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:14.180
It's length squared
was whatever it was,

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.760
pi squared over something.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:22.060
And that's its length squared.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:26.580
The delta function
gave infinity.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:30.470
So it's not going to be allowed
into the function space.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.370
It's a vector of
infinite length.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.640
Like the vector 1,
1, 1, 1, 1 forever.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.550
Too long.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:42.830
Pythagoras fails, because we sum
the squares, we get infinite.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:49.350
So what functions, what vectors
should we allow in our space?

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.800
So we're going to
have a space that's

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.980
going to be infinite-dimensional
because our coefficients,

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.800
we've got infinitely
many coefficients.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.070
Our functions have
infinitely many values.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.930
So we've moved up from
n-dimensional space

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:05.910
to infinite-dimensional space.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:13.880
And everybody calls it after
the guy who, Hilbert space.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.420
So I don't know if you've seen
that word before, that name

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.350
before, Hilbert space.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:24.110
It's the space of functions
with finite energy.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.110
Finite length.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:31.780
So this function is in it, the
delta function is not in it.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:37.270
And the point is that this
space of functions, we've

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:40.830
got-- These guys
are a great basis

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.540
for the space of functions.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.900
The sines and cosines
are another basis

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.410
for this space of functions.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.650
We just have a whole
lot of functions,

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:55.420
and all the facts of
n-dimensional space.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.630
So what are important facts
about n-dimensional space?

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:07.090
One that comes to mind that
involves length is the-- A

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:16.580
key fact about length
is, length and angle,

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.510
I could say
actually-- Many people

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:22.660
would say this is the
most important inequality

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.940
in mathematics.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:36.310
That the dot product
of two vectors,

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.350
it's called the
Schwarz inequality.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:43.990
Several people found
it independently,

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:50.560
Schwarz is the single
name most often used.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:55.980
What do you know about the
dot product of two vectors?

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.740
Somehow it tells you the
angle between them, right?

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.800
Somehow the dot
product of two vectors

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:09.490
is, if I divide by the
length of the vectors,

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:13.140
so the dot product of vectors
divided by the length,

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.750
do you know what
this is, in geometry?

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:17.830
It's a cosine.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:21.650
It's the cosine of the
angle between them.

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:25.010
And cosines are never
larger than one.

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:28.400
So this quantity here is
never larger than one;

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.570
in other words,
this is never larger

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:33.620
than the length of one
vector times the length

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.890
of the other vector.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:37.140
I could do an example.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:42.250
Let v be [1, 3].

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:46.730
And let w be [1, 6].

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.070
I don't know how this
is going to work.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.020
What's the dot product
of those two vectors?

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.090
Oh, it's 19.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.420
Sorry about that.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:46:02.720
Let's change this, I'd
like a nice number here.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.890
What do you suggest?

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:08.640
Make it five somewhere?

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.670
Five wouldn't be bad.

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:19.000
It wouldn't be too
good either, but.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.050
Ah, OK.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:22.250
What's the dot product of those?

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.490
16.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.400
And now what am I
claiming, that that's

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.560
length less than the length
of this vector, which is what?

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.620
What's the length of [1, 3]?

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:33.440
Square root of ten.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.170
It's good to do these small
ones, just to remember.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.910
The length of that
vector is the sum

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:39.830
of the square root of
the sum of the squares.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.160
Square root of ten.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.030
And the length of this guy?

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:48.450
Is the square root of 26.

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:53.180
And so I hope, and
Schwarz hopes, that 16

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.760
is less than that square root.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.300
Can we check it?

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:02.000
Let's square both sides,
that would make it easier.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.220
So the right-hand side when
I square both sides will be?

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.900
260.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:14.270
When I square both sides,
and what's the square of 16?

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.350
256.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:18.470
That was close.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:24.510
But, it worked.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.660
I'll admit to you--
Oops not equal.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.930
Ah.

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:32.930
Less or equal,
Schwarz would say.

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:37.090
And it's actually less than
because these vectors are not

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:38.260
in the same direction.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.350
If they were exactly
in the same direction,

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:43.620
or opposite directions,
the cosine would be one

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.220
and we would have equal.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.420
But since the angle, you see the
angle between those two vectors

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.350
is a pretty small angle.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.010
The cosine is quite near one.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:58.160
But it's not exactly one.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.690
So I'm glad somebody
knew 16 squared.

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:05.080
Does anybody know 99 squared?

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:09.320
The reason I ask
that is, or 999.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.780
I'll make it sound harder.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:16.200
The hope, when I was
about 11 or something,

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.630
I was I was always
hoping somebody

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:19.950
would ask me 999 squared.

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:24.030
Because I was all
ready with the answer.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:25.690
Nobody ever asked.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:26.330
Anyway.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:28.520
But you've asked, I think.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.350
So 998,001.

00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:36.140
And now I I've finally got a
chance to show that I know it.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:39.480
OK, have a great
weekend and see you.
