00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.370
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so review
session on the first part

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.900
of the Fourier chapter, these
two topics that we've done

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.400
and that homework
is now coming on.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.960
Fourier series, the
classical facts.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.760
Plus, paying
attention to the rate

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.570
of decay of the
Fourier coefficients,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.310
it's an aspect not
always mentioned.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.400
And the energy
equality is important.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.570
So it's not just here's the
function, find the coefficient.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.480
That's part of it
but not all of it.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.800
And then the discrete
series we were doing today.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.120
OK, so those are the
two topics for today,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.580
and then the next
review session,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.140
which would be two
weeks from now,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.470
would focus especially on
convolution and Fourier

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.680
integrals.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.140
OK, so I'm open to
questions on the homework,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.260
or off the homework.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.150
Always fine.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.460
I didn't know how many questions
to ask you on the homework.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.410
I wanted you to have enough
practice doing this stuff

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.120
because the time for this
Fourier part of the course

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.710
is a little shorter.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.740
Thanksgiving comes into it,
so needed to do some exercise.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.210
And you've got a good question.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.710
Thanks.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.510
PROFESSOR STRANG: Number
18 on the homework, OK.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.860
Ah yes, OK.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.300
Right, alright.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.490
So the idea of that
problem, I'm really

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.860
asking you to read the
two pages, the last two

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.490
pages of the section.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.480
That use Fourier series to
solve the heat equation.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.840
So we've used,
briefly, Fourier series

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.110
to solve Laplace's equation.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.380
So that was, just to recall.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.210
So Fourier series to
solve Laplace's equation

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.370
was when the region
was a circle.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.330
The function was given, the
boundary values were given.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.860
It's 2pi periodic
because it is a circle.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.140
And we solved Laplace inside.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.510
Because on the boundary,
the perfect thing we needed

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.980
was the Fourier series
to match the boundary.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.630
Now, I'm taking another,
classical, classical

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.230
application too.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.590
The heat equation.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.100
So I made it heat equation.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.210
So this direction is time,
this direction is space.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:23.230
The heat equation is
u_t=u_xx, if the coefficient--

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.220
Everybody here knows there
would be a c in there,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.080
but let's take it to be one.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.560
Then what are the solutions,
and how does a Fourier series

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.150
help you to match the
initial functions?

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.450
So I'm matching, I'm
given u(x,0) here.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.630
OK.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.070
Along this is at time zero.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.210
So that says at a time
zero, so I have a bar.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.440
I have a conducting bar.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.790
And this is such a
classical example

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.410
that I didn't feel you
could miss it completely.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.810
Even though we look
beyond formulas.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.320
But here's one where the formula
shows us something important.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.520
OK, so what are solutions
to this equation?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.700
You look for solutions,
so the classical idea

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.880
of separate variables.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.670
Look for solutions that are of
the form some function of t,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.760
maybe I'll try to use the
same letters as the text.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.090
Some function of t, times
some function of x, OK?

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.600
And the text uses, look for
solutions u(x,t) that are

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.340
of this form.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.460
Some function of t,
and I didn't remember.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.450
Ah yes, it's A(x)B(t).

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.450
OK, that's what I
mean by separating.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.470
So those will be especially
simple solutions.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.770
And when we go to match
the initial condition,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.840
I'll just plug in t=0
and I'll see the A(x)'s.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.280
Well, what are they?

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.260
In this case, so their
eigenfunction-- oh,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.020
I have to tell you about the
remaining boundary conditions,

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.885
don't I?

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:24.590
Because that will decide
what the A(x) has to satisfy,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.540
and will decide what
those eigenfunctions are.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.770
So, let's see.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.970
In this problem I think
I picked free conditions.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.210
So I made the interval minus
pi to pi, that's a change.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.690
Minus pi to pi just so we
have nice Fourier series.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:54.140
And here I have this boundary
is free, du/dx, u', at x=-pi,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.160
for all time, so up
this line, is zero.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.830
And also u' at plus pi,
and all time is zero.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.810
So up those lines,
heat's going out.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.110
That's what that means.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.940
Is that what that means, or does
that mean heat can't go out?

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.050
No, so what's happening?

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.370
Heat's not going out.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.640
Is that right?

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.460
The slope is zero, right?

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.812
The slope is the
temperature gradient,

00:06:25.812 --> 00:06:27.520
we're requiring the
temperature gradient.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.580
So the ends of the
bar are insulated.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.390
So this is insulated.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.790
No passage through, right?

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.940
Is that what that means?

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.780
Yeah.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.300
It's like there's nobody,
it's cut off there.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.170
The rod isn't extended
for heat to go further.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:55.160
OK, so that tells us
what the x and the t,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.230
what the A(x) and B(t) are.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.810
So here's the point.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.000
You plug that hoped-for solution
into the equation, right?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.210
So I plug it in here.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.310
What do I have on the left
side, just the time derivative?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.260
So that's A times-- A(x)
B'(t), you see taking the time

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.900
derivative doesn't touch A(x).

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.130
On the right-hand side,
I don't touch B(t),

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.970
but I have a second
derivative of the x part.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.470
So far, so good.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:35.090
Now, a little trick.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.080
If I divide both
sides by A and by B,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:48.250
I get B'/B equaling
A''/A. Right?

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.160
Just, put the A under
here, put the B under here.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.470
Now what?

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.390
This is neat, because
that function is only

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.320
depending on time.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.770
This function depends only on
x, so that the both sides have

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:06.900
to be constant.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.890
One can't actually change with
time, because this side is not

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.410
changing with time.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.080
And this couldn't
actually change

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.590
with x, because that's
not changing with x.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.030
So those are both constants.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.810
So both constants.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.090
Let's see, I'll maybe
just put a constant.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.050
And various constants
are possible.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.670
OK, so now you see
the point here.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.580
Now I have two
separate equations,

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.630
I have an equation for
the B part, dB/dt, B'.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.920
If I bring the B up
there, I have equals,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.330
the constant times B. And I
know the solution to that.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.730
B(t) is, as everybody
knows, what's

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.180
the solution to a first order
constant coefficient equation?

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.540
Just e^(ct)*B(0).

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.140
Good, we've got B. We've
got a B(t) that works,

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.820
and now what's the
A that also works?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.200
That has A''.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.940
And I bring the A up, so now I
have A''=cA, so the A that goes

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.450
with it is?

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:32.540
Oh, OK, I've used a c
there, so what's the good?

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.970
I want-- Two derivatives
should bring down a c.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:42.100
Let me change c to
minus lambda squared.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.640
How about if I look ahead,
change this constant to minus

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.430
lambda squared, because
I want something

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.840
where two derivatives bring
down minus lambda squared,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.750
and what will do that?

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.720
Any amount of
cos(lambda*x), right?

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.530
Because two derivatives will
bring down a minus lambda

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.230
squared.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.980
And any amount of sin(lambda*x).

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:18.480
And this is now e to the
minus lambda squared t.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.300
I'm doing this fast, but
actually it's totally simple.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.400
The conclusion is that I now
have a bunch of solutions

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.880
of this special separated form.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.470
Where B(t) could be that and
A(x) could be either of those

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.690
or any combination of those.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.910
And I have to use the
same lambda for each,

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:46.110
so that the two equations will
work in the original problem.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.500
Good.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.080
Now, so far, no
boundary conditions.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.650
What I've got so far is
just a lot of solutions.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.740
These times that.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.390
With any lambda.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.580
But of course the
boundary conditions

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.060
will tell me the
lambdas, first of all.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.970
And how do they tell me?

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.810
The only boundary condition
I have is this free stuff.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:14.640
So it's free, the slope should
be zero at pi, and zero at?

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.980
So that's the x direction.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.710
So that's going to tell
me-- I've forgotten.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.240
Do I want cosines or sines?

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.640
Cosines.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.990
I want the derivative
to be zero at pi.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.910
Yeah, so I think I
want cosines, good.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.690
And then lambdas can't
be anything at all.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:41.570
Because, should lambda be an
integer or something like that?

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.850
I think maybe lambda
should be an integer,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.090
because I want to plug in pi.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.560
So let me take the
second derivative.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.670
Is minus lambda
squared cos(lambda*x).

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.910
And then I want to plug in x=pi.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:04.910
And I want this to be zero.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:10.010
So lambda should be an
integer, is that right?

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:13.900
At multiples of pi, the
cosine is zero, yes.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.270
Is it?

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.070
No.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.150
Did I want sine?

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.800
Maybe I wanted sine.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.590
Oh, it's the first derivative
I'm looking at, thank you.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.300
Thank you.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.740
OK, good.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.580
OK, now I've got it.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.410
Thank you.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.120
And now I see lambda
should be an integer.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.090
Lambda should be, zero
is, yeah zero's alright.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.150
That's the constant
term, yeah, we need that.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.320
Zero, one, two, and so on.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.480
So do you see that
I've now got, now I

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.860
can take-- I've got
a lot of solutions,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.510
and I have a linear problem.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.170
So I can take any combination.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:05.140
So finally I have final
solution is that u(x,t) is any

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:12.690
combination, with coefficients
I'm free to choose, of A(x),

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:18.570
which is cos(nx), because
lambda had to be an n.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.700
And n could be anywhere
from zero on up.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:31.070
Times e to the minus, lambda
is n, so that's n squared t.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.150
Did I get that?

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.970
Let me draw a circle
and step back.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:35.620
What's up?

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.280
PROFESSOR STRANG: I
could have negative n's,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.820
they wouldn't give me
anything new, right?

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.510
I mean cos(nx) and
cos(-nx) are just,

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.070
one's just the
negative of the other.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.040
So these are the good guys.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.360
I've got a cosine series because
I've got free n's, right.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.570
Because of the
boundary conditions.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.300
Do you see that?

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.970
That's pretty nice.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.770
There's my A(x),
there's my B(t),

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.090
I can take any combination.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.600
Usual stuff.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.530
You get to that solution.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.950
OK, and now I have to meet
the initial conditions, right?

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.990
Boundary conditions
are now built-in

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.220
because I chose cosine.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.270
Or you did.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:30.810
Now, this will tell
me what the c's are.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.030
I'm going to set t=0.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:38.380
At t=0, I'm given the
initial condition, u(x,0),

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.440
and I have the same
sum of c_n*cos(nx)*e^0.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.330
So this will tell me the c's
are the cosine coefficients

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.850
of the given initial conditions.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:56.890
So I expand, so here's where
Fourier series has paid off.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.620
Expand the initial function
in a cosine series.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.550
And then go forward in time.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.360
This is just the
old e^(lambda*t).

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.300
Only the lambda we're talking
about here is minus n squared.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.260
And you see what's
happening here?

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.260
What's going to
happen for large time?

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.780
So this is a very
physical problem.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.220
That I think you cannot take
18.085 without seeing this

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.600
problem.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.430
You can't learn
about Fourier series

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:36.410
without using it for
the initial value.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:41.610
And then propagating in time
with the usual exponentials

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.150
for each one.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.690
And now as n increases
what do I see?

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.710
Faster and faster decay.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:54.040
For large n, these are going
to zero extremely fast.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:00.090
So that what you see
with a solid bar, which

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:07.830
starts with the temperature
u in some-- Oh, probably

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.400
not negative unless
it's a really cold bar.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.410
But, anyway, it starts with
some initial temperature.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.880
That flattens out fast.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.990
The heat flows, to equilibrate.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:26.010
What I approach is the
constant term, c_0.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.330
This approaches c_0.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:33.920
Because all these other n
positives, they go to zero.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.690
So the heat distributes
itself equally.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:43.570
OK, and now I guess the
particular u(0) in the problem

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.430
was a delta.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:52.470
OK, and so the
particular u(0) was all,

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:58.610
was from that really hot point.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.620
So we know the coefficients.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.910
We know the cosine coefficients
for the delta function,

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.240
we know these c's,
and what were they?

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.530
1/(2pi) was c_0.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.740
And the other c's
were 1/pi, I think.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.320
Is that right?

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.120
Maybe they're all 1/(2pi).

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.030
Maybe.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:22.970
Yeah.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.140
Whatever.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.500
They disappear fast.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.210
And this is what we approach.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:31.230
So the heat from the
delta function is, yeah.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:37.030
So is that everything
the problem wanted?

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:37.530
Yeah.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.690
Yeah.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.560
I think we've done it.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.680
We'll put in the c_n's
to complete that picture.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.350
Into here.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:51.480
And then c_0 is the one
that survives over time.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.820
Yeah.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.800
I guess you've, once I got
rolling I couldn't stop

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.870
and that's u.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.630
For investing time
this afternoon

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:10.350
you get a fast look at this
classical, classical problem

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.600
of separating the variables
using the Fourier series

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.350
for the initial function.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:24.190
And recognizing that we're
doing this on a finite interval.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:31.670
If the bar was
infinitely long, then we

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.410
would be talking about
Fourier integrals.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.890
And that's what's
coming up a bit later.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.320
We would integrate
instead of sum.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:40.900
Yeah.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.380
But the idea would
not be different,

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.720
if we had infinite
bar then we would not

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.150
be restricted to n
equals zero, one, two,

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.610
three; any n, any
cosine, wouldn't

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.440
have to be an integer at all.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.360
Any number, any frequency
would be allowed.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.780
And so we would have to
integrate that, yeah.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:08.330
And that's a classical
problem too, again.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:13.210
It's come up in a modern way,
that the famous Black-Scholes

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.460
equation.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.200
So.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.480
The heat equation is for 18.086.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.490
Here, we brought it up because
we could solve it fast.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.990
But the actual, yeah.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.290
The most important
solution I could give you

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.170
to the heat equation would
be the one that starts

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.650
from that point source of heat.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.730
But on the whole line.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.770
The one that would be
integrals instead of sums.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.850
Yeah.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:52.320
So we came pretty close to
solving the most important heat

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.330
equation problem.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:58.170
But we're doing the periodic
case, with just cosines,

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:05.050
and the infinite line case
would be the most famous of all.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:05.550
Yeah.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.820
And it has a
beautiful form, and I

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.190
was going to say that the heat
equation's pretty classical.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:22.660
But let's see, where can I write
the magic words, Black-Scholes.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:26.860
Next to the heat equation,
so that's the heat equation

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:36.880
but it's also-- do you know
these names, Black and Scholes?

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.180
Anybody in Mathematics
of Finance?

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:47.030
So these much-despised
option, derivative options,

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.760
so people on Wall
Street, traders,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:55.560
will carry around a
little calculator that

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.720
solves the
Black-Scholes equation

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.820
so they can price the
options that they're

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.780
bidding to buy and sell, so
they can price them fast.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.480
And that little calculator
does a finite differences,

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:14.650
or a Fourier series solution
to this Black-Scholes equation,

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.880
which actually, if you
change variables on it,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.610
is the heat equation.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.540
So what you see
here as is actually

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.210
important on Wall Street
except, it's probably not

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.650
the right moment to mention it.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.010
Right?

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:38.180
So you can blame the whole
meltdown on mathematicians.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.900
But that wouldn't
be entirely fair.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.820
They didn't mean it, anyway.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:49.940
But that's been the biggest
source of employment,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:55.340
I guess, apart from teaching,
in the last ten years.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.480
People who could work out
the partial differential

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.070
equations, and they get more
complicated than the heat

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.630
equation, you can be sure.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:09.650
And so the classical
one, these guys

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.620
are economists at MIT and
Harvard, or they were.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:18.590
And I guess maybe the
Nobel Prize in Economics

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.420
came to part of that group.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.290
And also to Merton.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:28.750
Maybe Black, possibly
Black died before the time

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.210
of the Nobel Prize.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.690
Anyway, they were the first.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.930
And it's a beautiful
paper, beautiful paper too.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.850
Just to figure out
how do you price

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.410
the, what's the value
of an option to buy,

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:49.250
that allows you to buy or
sell a stock at a later time?

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.160
Yeah.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.770
So it's, well of course you
have to make assumptions

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.560
on what's going to
happen over that time

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.620
and that's where Wall Street
came to grief, I guess.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:08.160
If you had to put
it in a nutshell,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.020
I mean, the options, the
standard straightforward

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.790
options, those are fine.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.510
Using Black-Scholes,
and then what's happened

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.760
is they now price more and
more complicated things.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.100
To the point that the banks
were buying and selling

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:32.030
credit default swaps, insurance
swaps, that practically nobody

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.950
understood what they were.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.190
They just assumed that if there
was always a market for them,

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.360
like insurance, somehow
it wouldn't happen.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.060
And you get on.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.370
But it happened.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.290
So, now we're in trouble.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:50.560
OK, that's not
18.085, fortunately.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.280
Or math, but.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.320
Anyway, a lot of people
got involved with things

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.050
they didn't really know about.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:07.280
And then were selling them as
well as of course the mortgage

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:07.840
problems.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.650
Anyway.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:20.250
Ready for other questions on
our homework, or these topics.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.710
Yeah.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.230
OK.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.837
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:24.670
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:35.230
PROFESSOR STRANG:
OK, right, yeah.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.100
Have an image of waves, so --

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.600
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.390
I suppose if I had to have a
picture of the discrete thing,

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:50.250
if my picture of
the function case

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.950
was a bunch of
sines, and cosines,

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.090
somehow adding up
to my function.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:01.380
And if time, if I'm
solving the heat equation

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:09.030
then those separate waves
are maybe decaying in time.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:09.920
Here.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.220
So that when I add
them up at a later time

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.530
I get something different.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:18.420
Or if it was the wave equation,
which is probably your image,

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.510
they're moving in time.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.780
So they add up to different
things at different times,

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.120
because they can move
at different speeds.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.870
Yes, so a function is
a sum of waves, right?

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.520
Then what would the
discrete guy be?

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.640
I guess I would just have to
imagine the function as only

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.130
having those n values.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.750
And my wave would
just be, a wave

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:51.200
might be just n values there.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:57.630
But still, if I have a
time-dependent problem,

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.050
maybe that thing is
pulsing up and down.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:05.400
It's just that it's only got
a fixed number of points.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.230
And I'm not looking at
the whole wave on a, yeah.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:15.270
But I don't think it's
essentially different.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.090
And of course, the fast Fourier
transform and the discrete case

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:23.360
is used to approximate
the continuous one.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.880
Yeah.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.700
You can look in
Numerical Recipes

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.080
for a discussion of
approximating the Fourier

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.300
series by discrete
Fourier series.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.910
I mean, that's an
important question.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.930
Because of course,
Fourier series

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.270
has got all these integrals.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:46.650
The coefficients come
from an integral formula.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.300
We're not going to do
those integrals exactly,

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.000
so we have to do them
some approximate way.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.220
And one way would be to
use equally spaced points

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.820
and do the DFT.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.360
Can you just remind me what
that integral formula is?

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.600
I don't want you to, it
was on the board today.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.840
What's the formula for the
coefficient c_k in the Fourier

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.640
series.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.810
I'm really just asking
you this because I

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:24.410
think you should have
it in some memory cache,

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.830
you know in fast memory,
rather than in the textbook.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.630
OK, so what's the
formula for c_k,

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.250
in the Fourier series case?

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.910
Everybody think about it.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.130
It's going to be
an integral, right?

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.730
And I'll take it over
zero to 2pi, I don't mind.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.650
Or minus pi, pi.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:46.160
And what do I integrate?

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.760
This is the Fourier coefficients
of the function f(x)?

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:55.180
So I take f(x), I
remember to divide by 2pi,

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:59.050
I'm doing the continuous
one, what do I multiply by

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.340
to get the coefficients?

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.220
e^(-ikx).

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:16.030
So I've forgotten
whether I assigned some

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.000
of these very early questions.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.740
It just gave you the
function and said

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.440
what's the coefficient.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.590
If I just look at one or two.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.400
Suppose my function is f(x)=x.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.940
I guess in that
problem, in Problem 1,

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.700
I made it minus pi to pi.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.420
Suppose f(x)=x.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:44.740
So you have to integrate
x times e^(-ikx).

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.780
Well, you got an integral to do.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.920
OK, it's doable but
not instantly doable.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.890
Let me ask you some questions
and you tell me about it.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.530
So I draw the function.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.040
The function is x
from minus pi to pi.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.330
And tell me about
the coefficients,

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:13.860
how quickly do they decay?

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.790
This is like some constant
over k to some power p,

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:23.450
and what's p?

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:27.620
What rate of decay are you
expecting for the coefficients?

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.910
Well you say to yourself,
it looks like a pretty nice

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.950
function, smooth as can be.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:37.500
But, what's the answer here?

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:43.100
The rate of decay will be,
what will that power be?

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.530
One.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:49.090
Because the function jumps.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:53.630
The function has a jump there,
and the Fourier coefficients

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.170
have got to deal with it.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.980
So the Fourier series
for this is going to be,

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.550
if I took 100 terms it
would be really close.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:09.240
And then it'll go down here to
the, but it's got to get there.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:13.060
And got to start, and
pick up below there.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.870
So it's got the same issue,
the Gibbs phenomenon,

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.440
that the square wave had.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.550
It's got that jump.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.780
So it'll go like 1/k.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.660
OK, coming back.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.650
Could you actually
find those numbers?

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.750
And do you remember how
to do integral like that?

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.710
Well, look it up, I
guess is the best answer.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.830
But whoever did it
the first time, well,

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.490
it's integration
by parts, somehow.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.640
The derivative of this
makes it real simple,

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.800
and this we can integrate
really easily, right?

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.810
So we integrate that, take
the derivative of that.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:31:02.280
We get a boundary term,
so I don't exactly

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.830
remember the formula.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:09.960
But it'll have a couple
of terms, but not bad.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.230
And we'll see this 1/k.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.930
OK, and that's the formula.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:21.180
If I changed x to
something else, let's see.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.760
As long as I'm looking at
number one, what if I took e^x?

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.660
Oh, easy.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:31.900
Right? e^x, yeah, let's do e^x,
because that's an easy one.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:36.580
Now, e^x looks like, so
what's my graph of e^x?

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:42.490
It's quite small here at minus
pi, and pretty large at e^pi.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.750
What's the rate of
decay of the Fourier

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.830
coefficients for that guy?

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.200
Same.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.960
Got to jump again.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.930
Drops down here.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.580
So let's find it.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.340
Let's find those
Fourier, that integral.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:02.040
That's e^(x-ik).

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.520
Sorry, let's put down
what I'm integrating here.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:13.560
I'm integrating e to
the x times (1-ik).

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.230
Right?

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.970
That's what I've
got to integrate.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:22.460
The integral is the same
thing divided by 1-ik.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.711
I plug in the endpoints,
minus pi and pi,

00:32:28.711 --> 00:32:29.710
and I've got the answer.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:30.890
And I divide by 2pi.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.000
Yeah.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
So that's a totally doable one.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.221
Let's plug it in.

00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:37.720
1/(2pi).

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:45.460
And then the denominator is
this 1-ik, yeah, well there you

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.630
see it already, right?

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.860
You see already the
1/k in the denominator.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.760
That's giving us
the slow decay rate.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:00.190
And now I'm plugging
in equal-- equal--

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.880
e^(pi(1-ik)) minus
e^(-pi(1-ik)).

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:21.910
So as k gets big,
this is slow decay.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.370
Now, what's happening
here as k gets large?

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.890
Oh, k is multiplied by i there.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:32.830
So this e^(pi*ik)
is just sitting,

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:36.210
it may even be just one or
something, or minus one,

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:36.820
or whatever.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.900
Is it?

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.290
Yeah. k is just an
integer, this is k*pi*i,

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.440
that's just minus
one to something.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.280
So all that numerator
is minus one

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:52.460
to the to the k-th
power or something.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.480
Times e^pi.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:05.010
So e^pi is there. e^(-ik) at--
e^(-i*pi*k) is just minus one.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:10.750
And this is maybe e to the minus
pi times the same, e^(+i*pi*k).

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.160
I think that's
minus one to the k.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.760
Well, wait a minute.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.020
Maybe they're not
both, whatever.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.500
It's a number.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.550
It's a number.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.090
That's just of this size.

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:31.580
There's the big number,
there's the small one.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:37.440
And divided by that,
that's the thing that shows

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.920
is yes, there is this jump.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.330
Right?

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:45.920
OK, that's a couple of sets
of Fourier coefficients.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.280
You could ask yourself,
because on the quiz

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.360
there'll probably
be one, and I'll

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.490
try to pick a function
that's interesting.

00:34:54.490 --> 00:35:00.640
And I mean, I don't plan
to pick xe^x or anything.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.690
Yeah.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.120
OK, good.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.970
Yes, thanks.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:11.167
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Fourier series

00:35:11.167 --> 00:35:13.250
has twice the energy as
another, what's that mean?

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:13.680
PROFESSOR STRANG: I don't know.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.670
I guess.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.630
Hm.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.050
Maybe we're talking
about power, and things

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:29.010
like if we were dealing
with electronics,

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:33.860
I guess I would interpret
that energy in terms of power.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.860
So that's what I'd be seeing.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.660
I'm not thinking of
a really good answer

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.070
to say well, why is
that energy equality,

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.950
but it's really useful.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.700
You know, so much of
signal processing,

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.880
and we'll do a bit
of signal processing,

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:57.920
is simply based on
that energy equality

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:04.170
there, and the moving
into frequency space.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.940
And convolution.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.320
Actually, they would
call it filtering.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.780
So we'll call it filtering
when we use convolution.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.640
But it's pure convolution.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:22.710
Pure linear algebra,
for these special bases.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.350
So, OK.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:29.670
I could try to come up with a
better answer, or more focused

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:42.650
answer than just to say power
or, to use an electric power

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:45.300
word is just one step.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.901
Yeah, thanks.

00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:48.400
Yes.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.180
PROFESSOR STRANG:
4.3, eight or nine.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:37:00.330
Let's just have a look and
see what they're about.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.220
OK, just some regular guys.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.910
Yeah so that, OK,
let me look at,

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:12.180
you want me to do 4.3 eight?

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:19.597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:19.597 --> 00:37:20.680
PROFESSOR STRANG: Ah, yes.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.190
Good, good question.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.370
OK, so 4.3 eight gave
a couple of vectors,

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:28.080
a little bit like the
ones I did this morning.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.490
I mean here the c in 4.3
eight has a couple of ones,

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.560
and this morning I just
had a [1, 0, 0, 0].

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.210
But no big deal.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.850
Now, yeah.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:44.950
So if two vectors
are orthogonal,

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:49.990
are their transforms orthogonal?

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.810
I think, yes.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:52.940
Yes.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.950
The Fourier, so the, yeah.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:00.380
So maybe this is
worth a moment, here.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.560
Yeah.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:06.370
Because what do we,
let me write down

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.890
the letters for my question,
and then answer the question.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:18.960
OK, so suppose I have
two vectors, c and d.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.550
And they're orthogonal.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:26.430
And then I want to
ask about their,

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:33.670
if I multiply by the Fourier
matrices, are those orthogonal?

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.840
That's sort of the question.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.380
So here the vectors
in frequency space,

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.120
here they are in physical space.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.550
I don't mind if you
started in physical space

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:47.680
and went to frequency with
F inverse, same question.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:53.430
Does the Fourier
matrix preserve angles?

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.360
Does it preserve angles?

00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:01.580
Do matrices, and F
wouldn't be the only one

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:06.590
with this property, do--
They preserve length, right?

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.980
If you preserve length, do
you preserve angles too?

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.520
Preserve length, you're
just looking at one vector.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:18.650
We know that we preserve
length, and how do we know that?

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.460
Let's just remember that.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.140
So here's the length question.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.030
And this'll be the
angle question.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:26.940
So this is the
energy inequality,

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.500
coming back to that key thing.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:37.080
This is c bar transpose c,
and over here we have (Fc,Fc)

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.030
and this is what I
did this morning.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:46.330
So that's c bar transpose
F bar transpose F c, right?

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:51.010
That's, why the bar as
well as the transpose?

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.450
Because we're doing complex.

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:59.600
OK, let me make a
little more space.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.920
And what did we do this morning?

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:07.700
We replaced that by, well I
wish it were the identity.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:11.670
But it's a multiple of the
identity, that's what matters.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:17.620
So this was N, this is
the identity with an N,

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.500
c bar transpose c.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:25.290
So the conclusion was that
this thing is just N times

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.500
this thing.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.040
Well, and times this one.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.460
I'm expecting oh, but
over here we got a zero.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.780
So my N is going to wash out.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.970
OK, let's just do the
same thing for angle.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:46.020
This is the key energy
equality for length.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:51.770
And all I want to say
is, this Fourier matrix,

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:57.230
like other orthogonal matrices,
is just rotating the space.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:00.130
It's sort of
amazing to think you

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:05.340
have one space, physical
space, and you rotate it.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.300
I'll use that word.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.160
Because somehow that's what
an orthogonal matrix does.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.210
Well it's complex
N-dimensional space.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:18.860
Sorry, so it's not so easy to
visualize rotations in C^N,

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.020
but it's a rotation.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.350
Angles don't change,
and let's just see why?

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.100
The inner product
of this with this

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.920
is c bar transpose,
F bar transpose,

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.590
because I have to
transpose that.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:36.960
Times Fd, what do I do now?

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:43.790
This one was c bar
transpose d, with zero.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.980
You see you have it?

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:50.210
Again, this fact that
this rotation and inverse,

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:56.090
and the transpose is the
identity, apart from an N. So

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.300
again, inner products
are multiplied

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.750
by N. Not only the
length squared,

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.070
which is inner
product with itself,

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:08.480
but all inner products
are just multiplied by N.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.500
So if they start zero
they end up zero.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.340
Yeah.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.980
That was your question, right?

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.540
Yep, right.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.860
So if I have a
couple of vectors,

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.100
as I guess that
problem proposed,

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.700
it happened to propose
two inputs that

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.290
happen to be
orthogonal, then you

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:30.460
should be able to see that
the transforms are, too.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.300
Yeah.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.950
Yep.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.660
Can I ask you about question
two, was that on the homework?

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:41.470
Problem two in Section 4.3?

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:43.950
Was it?

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:49.880
All I want to say is
that's a simple fact.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:56.200
Let me just write that fact down
so we're looking at that fact.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:01.750
If I look at this F
matrix, it's so simple

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:05.790
but it leads to lots of
good, it's just a key fact.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:12.690
But if I look at my F matrix,
am I looking at rows here?

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.351
Yeah, I happened
to look at rows,

00:43:14.351 --> 00:43:16.100
columns would be the
same, it's symmetric.

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:23.520
So here's row one, here's row
two, I'm sorry that's row zero.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.830
This is row one.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.850
And let me look at row N-1.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:38.700
This is w, w^(N-1), this
was w^2, this is w^(2(N-1)).

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.070
And so on.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.910
Everybody's got
the idea of the--

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:48.110
And then all these in-between
rows, two, three, et cetera.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:55.580
And the question asks,
show that this and this

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.640
are complex conjugates.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:03.590
That that row and that row are
the same, except conjugates.

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:08.430
So if we look at the
row number one in F,

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:14.040
we'll be looking at row
number N-1 in F bar.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.920
Now, why is that row the
conjugate of that row?

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.320
Why is this the
conjugate of this?

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.940
Why are those two conjugates?

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:29.690
So I'm asking you to explain
to me why w bar is the, why

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:40.180
is the conjugate of this, this?

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:46.410
So it's just one more neat fact
about these important, crucial,

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.000
numbers w.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.460
And so how do I see this?

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:54.650
Well, this is w-- This
is one way to do it.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:57.990
This is w^N times w^(-1).

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:00.590
And what's w^N?

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:01.140
One.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.640
Everybody knows, w^N is one.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.650
So I have w, so I'm
trying to show that.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:12.910
Well, we know that this is true.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:18.240
So we know that the
conjugate of w, right?

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.450
There's w.

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:25.770
Here's its conjugate, and
it's also the inverse.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:31.100
This w is some e^(i*theta),
this is some e to the the i some

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.470
angle.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:35.450
Then always, it's sitting
on the unit circle.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:40.840
So its reciprocal is
also on the unit circle.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:46.780
The reciprocal has e^(-i*theta),
so it's just the conjugate.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.090
That's a great fact.

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:54.810
That's a beautiful fact
about all these w's.

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:55.740
And their powers.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:59.020
Conjugate and inverse the same.

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:01.450
Right.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.630
So that was the
key to problem two.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:08.250
I don't think I asked
you to go through all

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:12.070
the steps of problem
three, but just in case

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.580
you didn't read problem
three, let me tell you

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.410
in one tiny space what happens.

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:22.210
In problem three you discover
that the fourth power of F

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:25.670
is the identity.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:34.200
Except there is an N squared,
because from two F's we got

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.700
an N, so from four F's-- So
that's another fantastic fact

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.320
about the Fourier matrix.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:45.640
That its fourth power,
it must be somehow,

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:50.070
the Fourier matrix
is rotating, yeah.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.080
Somehow, I don't
know, how do you

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.580
understand that the
Fourier matrix is,

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.870
its fourth power brings
you back to the identity.

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:03.050
Apart from, we just
didn't normalize it.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:07.850
So that we wouldn't, to
avoid that N squared,

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:09.340
so we had to use it.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.590
Yeah.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.880
That's pretty amazing.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.110
Pretty amazing.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:18.020
So if I had normalized
it right, if I

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:22.900
took F over the square
root of N, that's

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:28.120
the exact normalization
to give me a,

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:32.780
to put the N's where they
belong, you could say.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.460
Then the fourth power of
that matrix is the identity.

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.420
Yeah.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:43.230
New math and new applications
keep coming for these things.

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.750
I'll tell you, actually.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:48.950
You could tell me
eigenvalues of this matrix.

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.950
Yeah, this is a good question.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.700
What are the eigenvalues
of a matrix whose fourth

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.375
power is the identity?

00:47:57.375 --> 00:47:58.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:59.416
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah, one.

00:47:59.416 --> 00:48:01.660
What else could
the eigenvalue be?

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.200
If the fourth power
of the matrix is I,

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.810
what are the
possible eigenvalues?

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:16.430
So let me, so this matrix is,
can I call it M for the-- Or

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:30.180
maybe U for the matrix F--
So if U^4 is the identity,

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.570
what are the eigenvalues?

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:34.890
What could, well of course
u could be the identity,

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.040
but it's not.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:41.060
It's the Fourier matrix.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:46.330
So the eigenvalues could be
one, what else could they be?

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.410
Minus one is possible.

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:55.000
Because minus the identity,
that'd be fine. i, and minus i.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.660
Four possible eigenvalues.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.540
And when the matrix
reaches, I think

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:06.510
if you put the four by four
Fourier-- I don't know.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:09.680
If you, say, put the
four by four Fourier

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.910
matrix into MATLAB, and see
what you get for eigenvalues,

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.820
I've forgotten whether you
get one of each of these.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:20.790
Or whether somebody's
repeated at the level four,

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:23.030
but then go up to
five or six you'll

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:25.430
see these guys start showing up.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:28.070
Different multiplicity.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:28.900
Right?

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:34.500
The 1,024 matrix
has got these guys.

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.610
Some number of times,
adding up to a 1,024.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:38.760
Right, yeah.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.300
So it's quite neat.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.020
Now, here's a question,
which I actually

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.950
just learned a good answer to.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.970
What are the eigenvectors?

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.520
What are the eigenvectors?

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.270
You could give a sort of
half-baked description.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.740
Because once you
know the eigenvalues.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:01.400
But to really get a handle on
the eigenvectors, that's has

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:08.370
been a problem that was studied
in IEEE transactions papers.

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:12.670
But not really the right, not
a nice specific description

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:13.770
of the eigenvectors.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:18.980
And somebody was in my
office, this fall, a guy,

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.400
post-doc at Berkeley
who's seen the right way

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.620
to look at that problem and
describe the eigenvectors

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.010
of the Fourier matrix.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.850
So that's, like,
amazing to me that such

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:34.210
a fundamental
question was waiting.

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:40.020
And turned out to involve
quite important, deep ideas.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.580
OK, ready for one
more for today?

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.720
Anything?

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.340
Or not.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:52.750
OK, so I hope you're
getting the good stuff now

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.030
on the Fourier series.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:57.030
Fourier discrete transform.

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:59.590
Please come on Friday,
because Friday will

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.300
be the big day for convolution.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:09.620
And that's the essential thing
that we still have to do.

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.670
OK, see you Friday.
