00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.840
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, hi.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.810
So I've got homework
nine for you.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.020
Ready to return at the end.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.440
Also, the department asked
me to do evaluations,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.490
but that's the end
of the lecture.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.250
Then, so everybody knows
there's a quiz tomorrow night.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.030
And shall I just remember the
four questions on the quiz?

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.580
I mean, not the details but the
general idea of the questions.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.110
Details OK too.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.070
Yes.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.270
Yeah, so there'll be one
question on a Fourier series.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.870
And you should know
the energy equality

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.460
for all of these possibilities,
connecting the function squared

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.740
with the coefficient squared.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.630
A second one on the
discrete Fourier transform.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.200
Cyclic stuff.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.060
The third one on the
Fourier integral.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:35.490
And have a look at the
applications to solving an ODE.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.920
I did one in class.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.310
The one in class was
the one in the book

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.800
-u''+a^2*u=f(x),
so this will be.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.610
So have a look at
that application.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.770
This is, of course, on
minus infinity to infinity.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.310
and then a fourth
question on convolution.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.000
OK.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.610
And this afternoon,
of course, I'll

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.950
be here to answer any
questions from the homework,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.270
from any source,
for these topics.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.060
Are there any questions
just now, though?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.950
I'm OK to take questions.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.660
I thought I'd discussed
today a topic that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.870
involves both Fourier series
and Fourier integrals.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.650
It's a kind of cool
connection and it's

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.300
linked to the name
of Claude Shannon who

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.440
created information theory, who
was a Bell Labs guy and then

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.790
an MIT professor.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.560
So I should put his name in.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.060
Shannon.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.400
OK, so this is, yeah.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.160
You'll see.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.680
So it's not on the
quiz but it gives me

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.790
a chance to say something
important, and at the same time

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.140
review Fourier series
and Fourier integrals.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.130
So let me start
with the problem.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.250
The problem comes for
an A to D converter.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.620
So what does that mean?

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.550
That means, this A is analog.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.080
That means we have a
function, A for analog.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.590
And D for digital.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.270
So we have a function,
like-- So f(x), say,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.650
all the way minus
infinity to infinity,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.300
so we'll be doing,
that's where the Fourier

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.190
integral's going to come up.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.380
So that's analog.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.210
All x, it's some curve.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.940
And people build,
and you can buy,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.530
and they're sold in large
quantities, something that

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.900
just samples that function.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.750
Say, at the integers.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.300
So now I'll sample
that function and let

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.880
me take the period of the
sample to be one, so that I'm

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.010
going to take the values f(n).

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.350
So now I've got
something digital

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.510
that I can work with,
that I can compute with.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:36.370
And, so the sampling theorem--
Well, I mean, the question is--

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.450
Yeah, the sampling theorem
is about this question,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.410
and it seems a crazy question,
when do these numbers --

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.420
That's just a
sequence of numbers.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.690
This x was all the way from
minus infinity to infinity.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.520
And similarly, n is numbers
all the way from minus infinity

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.520
to infinity, they're
just samples.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.800
When does that tell
me the function?

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.260
When can I learn
from those samples,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.950
when do I have total
information about the function?

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.170
Now, you'll say impossible.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.990
Right?

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:24.410
So suppose I draw a
function f(x), OK?

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:31.560
And I'm going to sample
it at these points.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.150
All the way, so these are the
numbers, these are my f(n).

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.780
Sampling at equal
intervals, because if we

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.510
want to use Fourier
ideas, equal spacing

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.220
is the right thing to have.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.340
So when could I recover
the function in between?

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.580
Well, you'd say, never.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.640
Because how do I know
what that function

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.530
could be doing in between.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:04.640
So let me take the case when
all the samples are zero.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.540
And let's think about that case.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:12.700
Suppose, what could the
function be if all the samples,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.500
if these are all
zeroes, forever.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.900
OK, well there's one
leading candidate

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.830
for the function,
the zero function.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.370
Now, you'll see the whole
point of the sampling theorem

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.140
if you think about other,
what other functions?

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.460
Familiar functions, yeah.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.030
I mean, we could, obviously,
any, all sorts of things.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.670
But since we're
doing Fourier, we

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.110
like to pick on the sines,
cosines, the special functions,

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.440
and think about
those in particular.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.100
So, somebody said sines.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.850
Now, what function, so a
sine function certainly,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.300
the sine function hits
zero infinitely often.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:14.160
What frequency, so sine of what
would give me the same answer?

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.440
The same samples.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.930
If I put this sine function
that you're going to tell me,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.450
so you're going to tell
me it's sine of something

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.540
will have these
zero values at all

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.390
the integers, at zero, one, two,
minus one, minus two, and so

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.940
on.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.780
So what would do the job?

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.730
Sine of?

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:45.390
Of what will hit zero.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.790
So I'm looking for
a sine function,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.620
I guess I'm looking first
for the function that

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.130
just does that.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.880
And what is it? sin(pi*x).

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.160
And now tell me some more.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.150
Tell me another function.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.360
Which will also, it
won't be that graph.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.620
sin(2pi*x).

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.800
And all the rest, OK?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.500
Let me just use a word
that's kind of a handy word.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.300
Of course, let's put
zero on the list here.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.210
OK.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:29.000
So this is where k, the
frequency, usually appears.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.790
This is where k--

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.390
The word I want to
introduce is alias.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:44.670
This frequency, pi, is an alias
for this at frequency zero.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.110
Here's the, it's a
different function

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.370
but yet the samples
are the same.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.200
So if you're only
looking at the samples

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.360
you're getting the
same answer but somehow

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.070
the function has
a different name.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.360
So that frequency and this
frequency, and all those others

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.880
would be alias.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.010
Can I just write that word
down, because you see it often.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.760
Alias.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.850
That means two frequencies,
like pi and 2pi,

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.580
and zero or whatever, that
give you the same samples.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:27.980
OK, so now comes
Shannon's question.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.810
So we have to make some
assumption on the function.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:38.730
To knock out those
possibilities.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:44.160
We want to know a limited
class of functions.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.370
Which don't include these guys.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.290
So that within this
limited class of functions,

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.900
this is the only candidate
and we have this possibility

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.110
of doing the impossible.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:02.340
Of determining that
if I know zeroes here,

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.670
the function has to
be zero everywhere.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.620
OK, now the question is
what class of functions?

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.140
We want to eliminate these
guys, and sort of, your instinct

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:19.260
is, you want to eliminate
functions that, you know,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.770
if it's not zero then it's
got to get up and back

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.400
down in every thing.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.980
It could do different things
in different intervals.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:33.160
But somehow it's got to have
some of these frequencies.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.370
Pi or higher.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.810
Would have to be in there.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.450
So this is the instinct.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:48.870
That if I limit the frequency
band, so I'm going to say f(x)

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.560
is band-limited, can
I introduce that word?

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.740
I'll maybe take a
moment just ask you

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.480
if you've seen that word before.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.850
How many have seen this
word, band-limited?

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.410
Quite a few but not half.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.070
OK.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:10.600
Band-limited means the band
is a band of frequencies.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.290
So the function's
band-limited when

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.270
its transform, this tells me
how much of each frequency

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.190
there is.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.420
If this is zero, in some band.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:32.480
In some band, let's say, all
frequencies below something.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.110
And let's not even
put equal in there.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.580
OK.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.190
But that's not critical.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.120
Band-limited, I have to tell
you the size of the band.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.590
And the size of the band,
the limiting frequency

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.130
is this famous
Nyquist frequency,

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.270
so Nyquist is a guy's name.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.420
And the Nyquist frequency
in our problem here is pi.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.090
This is the Nyquist frequency.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:08.780
If we let that frequency,
that's the borderline frequency.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.510
And there would be a similar
Nyquist sampling rate.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.680
So Nyquist is the
guy who studied

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.220
the sort of borderline case.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:26.940
So the point is that if our,
say, band-limited by pi,

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.710
I have to tell you, so
band-limited means there's

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.550
some limit on the band.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:37.030
And our interest is when that
limit is the Nyquist frequency.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:43.310
The one we don't want to allow,
so we-- This is the point.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.320
So this will be the idea.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:52.570
That if we take this
class of function,

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.600
that band-limited-- Those are
called band-limited functions,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.770
and they're band-limited
specifically

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.940
by the Nyquist limit.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.050
If we take those,
then the idea is

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:13.990
that then we can reconstruct
from the samples.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.980
Because the only function
that has zero samples in that

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.560
class is the zero function.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.490
You see that class
has knocked out,

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:26.130
is not allowing these guys.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.270
Of course, haven't
proved anything yet.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.920
And I haven't shown
how to reconstruct.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.790
Well, of course, we quickly
reconstructed the zero function

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:41.200
out of those zeroes, but now
let me take another obviously

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.570
important possible sample.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.560
Suppose I get zero samples
except at that point, where

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.910
it's one.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:14:00.270
OK, now the question is
what function, f(x)--

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.490
Can I fill in, in between zero,
zero, zero, zero, one, zero,

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:11.010
zero, zero, can I fill in
exactly one function that comes

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.040
from this class?

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.030
So that I have now the answer
for this highly important

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.930
sample?

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.310
The sample that's all zeroes
except for the delta sample,

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.420
you could say.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.130
OK, so I'm looking
for the function now

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.760
which is one at that point.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.780
And zero at the others.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.150
So here's a key function.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.370
And I'll show you what it is.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.980
So the function, this function
that I'm going to mention,

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:49.860
will get down here, it'll
oscillate, it'll go forever.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.450
It's not like a spline.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:58.030
Splines made it to zero
and stayed there, right?

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.140
The cubic spline, for example.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:08.480
OK, but I guess, yeah,
that somehow that function,

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.160
we're not in that league.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.650
We're in this
band-limited league.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:20.080
In a way you could
say that, I mean,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.140
what's the key connection
between dropoff of the Fourier

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.280
transform?

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.790
So if the Fourier
transform drops off fast,

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.640
what does that tell
me about the function?

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.850
It's smooth, thanks.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.260
That's exactly the right word.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.280
If the Fourier transform
drops off fast,

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.080
the function is smooth.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.060
OK, this is really
an extreme case.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.470
That it's dropped off totally.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:50.770
You know, it's not just decay
rate, it's just zonk, out.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.870
Beyond this band of frequencies.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.700
And so that gives,
you could say, sort

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.620
of a hyper-smooth function.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.890
I mean, so smooth that
you know everything

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.130
by knowing the sample.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:07.710
OK, now I'm ready to write
down the key function,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.420
a famous function that
has those samples.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:17.960
And that function
is sin(pi*x)/(pi*x).

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.450
I don't know if you ever
thought about this function,

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.640
and it has a name.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.700
Do you know its name?

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.220
Sinc.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.980
It's the sinc function.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.060
Which is a little--
you know, the name's

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.390
a little unfortunate.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.680
Mainly because you know,
you're using those same letters

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.550
S I N but it's a
c that turns it,

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:46.120
that gives it-- So this is
called the sinc function.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.660
sinc(x).

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.530
But the main thing
is its formula.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:56.410
OK, well everybody sees that
at x=1, the sin(pi) is zero,

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.600
at x=2, the sin(pi) is zero, all
these ones we've seen already.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.230
And now what happens
at equals zero?

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.460
Do you recognize that this
function, as x goes to zero,

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.230
is a perfectly good function?

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.750
I mean, it becomes 0/0 at x=0.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.860
But the limit, we
know to be one.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:18.360
Right?

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:25.550
This sin(theta)/theta is one as
theta approaches zero, right?

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.630
So that does have
that correct sample.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.130
And now what's the,
I claim that that

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.690
is a band-limited function.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:40.650
And you'll see that that
function pushes the limit.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:46.620
It's right-- Nyquist
barely lets it in.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.190
Now here's a calculation.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.470
So this is our practice.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:59.360
What is f hat of k
for that function?

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.450
Now, let me think
how to do this one.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:07.720
So just to understand
this better,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.390
I want to see that that
is a band-limited function

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.130
and what is its
Fourier transform.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.980
OK, now once again here we have
a function where if I want to

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:25.220
do-- How best to do this?

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:33.010
You could say well, just do it.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.830
As I would say on the quiz,
just go ahead and do it.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:41.470
But you'll see I'm going
to have a problem, I think.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.040
But this gives us a chance
to remember the formula.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.450
So what's the formula for the
Fourier integral transform

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.680
of this particular?

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.640
So my function is
the sinc function,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.400
sin(pi*x) over sin(pi*x).

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:03.000
So how do I get its, I
do a what here? e^(-ikx),

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.650
and am I doing dx or dk?

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.290
dx, right?

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.790
And I'm going from minus
infinity to infinity.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.640
And am I, do I have a 2pi?

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.160
Yes or no?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.850
Who knows, anyway?

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.150
Right.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.960
In the book I didn't?

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.750
OK.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:33.100
Now, well, I don't
know the answer.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.640
But so let's, it's much better
to start with the answer,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.350
right, and check
that-- So let me

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.470
say what I think the answer is.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:51.340
I think the answer is,
it's a function that's

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:59.060
exactly as I say, it pushes
the limit from, this is k.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.770
It's the square wave, it's
zero, the height is one.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.010
It's the function that's
zero all the way here,

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.660
all the way there.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.740
I think that that's the Fourier
transform of that function.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:20.370
And just before we check it,
see how is Nyquist got really

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.550
pushed up to the wall, right?

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:26.590
Because the frequency
is non-zero right,

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:30.170
all the way through pi.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:36.020
But pi is just one point there.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:41.460
And anyway, I think we won't get
into philosophical discussion

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.460
about whether, you know,
is that limited to pi?

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.440
I don't know whether to put,
you saw me chicken out here.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.620
I didn't know whether to
put less or equal or not,

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.640
and I still don't.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:00.770
But this is making the point
that that's the key frequency.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.260
So this particular
function, what I'm saying

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.080
is this particular function
has all the frequencies

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.480
in equal amounts over a band,
and nothing outside that band.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.260
And that's the Nyquist band.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.250
OK, now why is this the
correct answer here?

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:25.080
I guess the smart way would
be, this is a good function,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.140
easy function.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:32.270
So let's take the transform
in the other direction.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.710
Start from here and get to here.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:35.210
Right?

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.500
That would be convincing.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:41.470
Because we do know that
that pair of formulas

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:46.220
for f connected to f
hat connected to f,

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.620
they go together.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:54.750
So if I can show that I go
from here, that that Fourier

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.710
integral takes me
from here to there,

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.080
then this guy will take me back.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.550
So let me just do that.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:05.120
Because that's a very very
important one that you

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.470
should be prepared for.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.970
Right.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.580
So now what do I want to do?

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:23.780
Here's my function of k, and
I'm hoping that I recall-- Now,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.240
what do I do when I
want to do the transform

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.010
in the opposite direction?

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:37.120
It'll be an e^(+ikx),
right? d what? dk, now.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.700
From k equal minus
infinity to to infinity.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.800
And now I think I do put
in the 2pi, is that right?

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:50.740
And the question is, does that
bring back the sinc function?

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.640
If it does, then this was
OK in the other direction.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.790
If the transform's correct
in one direction then

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.430
the inverse transform
will be correct.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.370
So I just plan to
do this integral. f

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.380
hat of k, of course, is an
easy integral now. f hat of k

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:13.320
is one over, between
minus pi and pi,

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.040
so I only have to do over
that range where f hat of k

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.480
is just a one.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.660
And now that's an integral
we can certainly do.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:30.490
So I have 1/(2pi), integrating
e^(ikx) will give me e^(ikx)

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.100
over ix.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.680
Now, remember I'm
integrating dk.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.510
Oh, look.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:40.690
See, we're showing this
x now in the denominator.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.340
That we're hoping for.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:50.360
And now I have to do that
between k is minus pi and pi.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:56.550
So this is like,
so I get 1/(2pi),

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:06.390
e^(i*pi*k) minus
e^(-i*pi*x), right?

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.790
Over the ix.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.560
OK so far?

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.710
I was doing a k integral
and I get an x answer.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.350
And I want to be sure that
this x answer is the x answer I

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.890
want, it's the sinc function.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:24.890
OK, it is.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:25.900
Right?

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:31.290
I recognize the sine,
e^(i*theta)-e^(-i*theta),

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:36.530
divided by two, I guess.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.260
Is the sine, right?

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.700
So I have 1/(2pi).

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:46.740
And here is ix-- Well, no,
the i is part of that sine.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:54.930
So I'm just using the fact that
e^(i*theta)-e^(-i*theta) is,

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:59.650
this is cosine plus i
sine, subtract cosine.

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:05.630
But subtract minus i sine, so
that will be 2i*sin(theta),

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.080
right?

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.530
We all know, and now
theta is pi*x here.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:17.780
So I have two-- let me keep
the i there, and 2i*sin(pi*x).

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.780
You see it works.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.170
Just using this, replacing
this by the sine,

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.440
the two cancels the two.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.060
The i cancels the i, and I
have sin(pi*x) over pi*x,

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.010
that's the sinc function.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:42.380
OK, so that's the function
we've now checked.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.860
We've checked two things
about this function.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.190
It has the right samples,
zero, zero, zero, zero,

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.790
one at x=0 and
then back to zero.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.650
It is band-limited,
so it's the guy,

00:25:55.650 --> 00:26:00.570
if this was my sample, if this
was my f(n), zero, zero, zero,

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:05.820
one, zero, zero, zero,
then I've got it.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.950
It's the right function.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:15.840
OK, we can create
Shannon's sampling formula.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.830
Shannon's sampling formula
gives me the f(x) for any f(n).

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.370
Maybe you can spot that, now.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.200
So this is going to use
the shift invariance.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.120
Oh yeah, let's-- Tell me what
the, let's take one step here.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.300
Suppose my f(n)'s were zero,
zero, zero, zero, and a one

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.780
there.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:46.720
So suppose-- This is, for the
exam too, this idea of shifting

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.890
is simple and basic.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.270
And it's a great thing
to be able to do.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.050
So this wouldn't be
the right answer.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.230
That function produced
the one at zero.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:04.500
Tell me what function,
copying this idea,

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:11.570
will produce all zeroes except
for a one at this point.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:17.400
So I'll put this
question over here.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:24.220
Suppose I'm all zeroes at that
point but at this point I'm up

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.400
and then I go back to zeroes.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:33.440
What function is giving me that?

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.820
You see it does decay because
of the x in the denominator,

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.580
it kind of goes to
zero but not very fast.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.370
OK, what's that function?

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.810
I replace x by x-1, right.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:53.940
So the function here
is sin(pi(x-1)),

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.360
divided by pi(x-1).

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.230
I just change the x to x-1.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:05.940
Now again, at x=0, this
is sin(pi), sin(-pi),

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:10.500
it's safely zero, but at x=1
that's now the point where

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.660
I'm getting 0/0.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.080
And the numbers are right to
give me the exact answer, one.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:24.110
OK, so now we see what to do
if the sampling turned out

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.790
to give us this answer.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:29.440
And now can you tell
me the whole formula?

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.660
Can you tell me
the whole formula,

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.210
so now I'm ready for
Shannon's sampling theorem.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:41.200
Is that f(x), if
f(x) is band-limited,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.040
then I can tell you
what it is at all x.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.730
So I'm going back to the
beginning of this lecture.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:52.880
It's a miracle that
this is possible.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.690
That we can write down a
formula for f(x) at all x,

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.530
only using f(n)'s.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.550
OK, now it's going to be a sum.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.250
From n equal minus
infinity to infinity,

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.970
because I'm going to use all
the f(n)'s to produce the f(x).

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:17.910
And now what do I put in there?

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:23.500
So I want my formula
to be correct.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:28.810
I want my formula to be
correct in this case,

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:34.130
so that if all the f's were
zero except for the middle one,

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.200
then I want to put
sin(pi*x)/(pi*x) in there.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.120
The sinc function.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.500
And I also want to
get this one right.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.650
If all the f's are zero, so
there'll only be one term.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.920
If this is the term, I
want that to show up.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.710
OK, what do I-- Yeah,
you can tell me.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.740
Suppose this is hitting at n.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.640
We'll just fix this
and then you'll see it.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:06.460
Suppose that all the others, n,
n-1, n+1, all those, it's zero,

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.630
but at x=n, it's one.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.730
Now what should I have chosen?

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.420
What's the correct--
I'm just going

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.190
to make it easy for
all of us to, yes.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:25.460
What's the good sinc function
which peaks at a point n?

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.790
Again, I'm just
shifting it over.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.810
So what do I do?

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.920
Put in, what do I write here? n.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.500
I shift the whole thing by n.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.660
So that's the right answer
when this hits at n.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.150
So now maybe you
see that this is

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:51.970
going to be the right
answer for all of them.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:56.130
You see that, we're using
linearity and shift invariance.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.240
The shift invariance is
telling us this answer

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.620
for wherever the one hits.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.350
That's what we need.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:08.740
And then by linearity,
I put together

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.200
whatever the f is
at that point, that

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.320
would just amplify the sinc.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.800
And then I have to put them
in for all the other values.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.410
That's the Shannon formula.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:25.940
That's the Shannon formula, and
this function is band-limited,

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.160
let's see.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.630
What's the-- Oh, yeah.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:34.120
What's the, do you
see that this one,

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.180
that this guy is band-limited?

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.970
We checked, right?

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:42.640
We checked that this
one, sin(pi*x)/(pi*x),

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.190
that was band-limited because
we actually found the band.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.510
Now, that just gives us
another chance to think.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.560
Allowed.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.280
What's the Fourier
transform of this guy?

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.560
My claim is that it's
also in this band.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:04.200
Non-zero only in the band, and
zero outside the Nyquist band.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.440
What is the transform of that?

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.360
What happens if you
shift a function, what

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.280
happens to its transform?

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:23.670
So that's one of the key rules
that makes Fourier so special.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:28.300
If I took this sine, let
me write this guy again.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.710
This was the un-shifted one.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.180
That connected to
the, what am I going

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:40.440
to call that, the box function.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.950
The box function,
the square wave.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.380
Well, box is good.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.040
Now, what if I
shift the function?

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.670
If I shift a
function, what happens

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.120
to its Fourier transform?

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.300
Anybody remember?

00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:02.090
You multiply it by, so
if I shift the function,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.410
I just multiply
this box function,

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.790
this is a box function in
the k, times something,

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:19.140
e to the i shift, and
the shift was one, right?

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:24.210
Is it just e to the ik, d
being the shift distance.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.340
Oh, the shift distance was n.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.970
Right.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.430
And possibly minus, who knows.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.500
OK, but what's the point here?

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:38.100
The point is that it's
still zero outside the box.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.700
Inside the box, instead of being
one, it's this complex guy.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.660
But no change.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.810
It's still zero outside the box.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.370
It's still band-limited.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:54.010
So this is the
transform of this guy.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.820
And then the transform
of this combination

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.960
would be still in
the box, multiplied

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.130
by some messy expression.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.000
So what was I doing there?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
I was just checking that,
sure enough, this guy

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.420
is band-limited.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:20.770
And it's band-limited, it gives
us the right f(n)'s, of course.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:29.180
Everybody sees that at x=n,
let's just have a look now.

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.900
We've got this great formula.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.330
Plug in x=n.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:37.660
What happens when you plug
in at one of the samples,

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:43.710
you look to see what this A to
D converter produced at time n,

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.210
and let's just see.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.200
So at x=n, the
left side is f(n).

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.130
Why is the right
side f of that n?

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.440
That particular n?

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:59.070
Maybe I should give a
specific letter to that n.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:04.840
So at that particular sample,
this left side is f(N),

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.940
and I hope that the
right side gives me

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.670
f at that capital N.
That particular one.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.400
Why does it?

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.510
You're all seeing that.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:19.170
At x equal capital N,
these guys are all zero,

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.920
except for one of them.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:27.700
Except for the one when little
n and capital N are the same.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.880
Then that becomes the one.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.440
And I'm getting f at capital
N. So it will give me that,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:39.030
for the n=1, the one term, yeah.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.900
I don't know if it was
necessary to say that.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:48.390
You've got the idea of
the sampling formula.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.770
I could say more
about the sampling,

00:35:51.770 --> 00:36:03.570
just to realize that the
technology, communication

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:07.340
theory is always
trying to, like,

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.480
to have a greater bandwidth.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.510
You always want a
greater bandwidth.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:17.220
But if the bandwidth, which
is this, is increased,

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.240
well by the way,
what does happen?

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:30.190
Suppose it's band-limited
by pi, oh, by pi/T.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:35.610
Let's just, I normalize
things to choose samples

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.400
every integer.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.380
Zero, one, two, three.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:43.290
And that turned out that the
Nyquist frequency was pi.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:50.260
Now, what sampling
rate would correspond

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.980
to this band, which
could be-- Well, let

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.860
me just say what it is.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.730
That would be the
Nyquist frequency

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:10.710
for sampling every T. Instead
of a sampling interval of one,

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:17.920
if I sample every T, 2T, 3T,
-T, my sampling rate is T,

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.870
so if T is small, I'm
sampling much more.

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:24.910
Suppose T is 1/4.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:29.430
If T is 1/4, then I'm
doing four samplings.

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:33.040
I'm taking four samples,
I'm paying more for this A

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.720
to D converter, because it's
taking four samples where

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.780
previously it took one.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.420
How do I get paid back?

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.240
What's the reward?

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:51.850
The reward is if T is 1/4,
then the Nyquist limit is 4pi.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:55.390
I can get a broader
band of signals

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.390
by sampling them more often.

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.490
Let me just say that
again, because that's

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.070
the fundamental idea behind it.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:08.350
If I sample more often, say, so
fast sampling would be small--

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:20.850
Fast samples would be small
t and then a higher Nyquist.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.140
A higher band limit.

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:24.390
More functions allowed.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:29.270
If I sample more often I'm able
to catch on to more functions.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:33.190
If I sample-- And
that's what, I mean,

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:37.460
now, communications
want wide bands.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.280
And this is where
they get limited.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.060
I mean, this is, you could
say, the fundamental,

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.830
I don't know whether to
say physical limit, sort

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:53.610
of maybe Fourier limit
on sampling theory.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.810
Is exactly this
Nyquist frequency.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:00.160
OK, questions or
discussion about that.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.110
OK.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:07.350
So that's an
example that allowed

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:13.110
us to do a lot of things.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:16.380
I did want to ask for your
help doing these evaluations.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.840
Let me say what I'm going
to do this afternoon.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.260
I'm going to answer all
the questions I can,

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.180
and I planned, when
there is a pause,

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:34.990
and nobody else asks, I plan
to compute the Fourier integral

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:38.580
and Fourier series,
say, Fourier series,

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:48.510
for a function that has, it's
going to be like the one today

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:53.820
except this is going to
have a height of 1/h,

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.490
and a width of h.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:03.630
So that's, in case you're not
able to be here this afternoon,

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:06.520
I thought I'd just say in
advance what calculations

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.740
I thought I would do.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.570
So there's a particular
function f(x),

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.880
it happens to be
an even function.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.520
We'll compute its
Fourier coefficients, in

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.870
and we'll let h go to zero.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:21.930
To see what happens.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.540
It's just a good
example that you

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.180
may have seen on older exams.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:32.740
OK, well can I just
say a personal word

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:36.210
before I pass out--
So evaluations,

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:39.640
if you're willing to help, and
just leave them on the table,

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.930
would be much appreciated.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:45.630
I'll stretch out the homeworks.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.570
I just want to say I've
enjoyed teaching you guys.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:49.960
Very much.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.730
Thank you all, and-- Thanks.
