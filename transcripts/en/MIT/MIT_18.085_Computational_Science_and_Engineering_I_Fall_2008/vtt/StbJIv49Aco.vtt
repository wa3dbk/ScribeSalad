00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:08.290
PROFESSOR: I love
teaching this course,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.780
and I tell the class
that the first day.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.180
Partly because of
them, I've learned

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.120
that they are really serious.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.460
And I have something
that I hope they get,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
which is the idea--
many of them took

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.220
calculus, differential
equations, survived it,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250
didn't especially enjoy it.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:40.530
And I'm always hoping that
they see what math is about,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.430
and how it looks for the
pattern in a whole lot

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.040
of different applications.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.160
Often engineering,
but many others too.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.000
Science, economics,
biology, wherever.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.930
And if they see the
pattern, then they're

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.100
really seeing what
mathematics brings

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:11.350
beyond just formulas, which is
not what the subject's about,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.430
but getting answers
and understanding.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.900
So one part of the
course is the modeling,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.320
getting the equations,
what's the structure.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.070
And the second
part of the course

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.850
is how do you solve
the equations?

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.970
Sometimes analytically,
sometimes numerically.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.780
And that's, of
course, the reality

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.480
of being a scientist
or engineer now.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.040
So this course is
three times a week.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.340
Very typical hour's lecture.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.860
And a fair amount of homework,
including some MATLAB

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.500
homework, because that's the
reality of how people get

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.720
answers.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.090
And also, of course,
analytical, pencil and paper

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.860
homework to see the
central ideas in use.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.350
And office hours from TAs.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.520
Because a lot of people
haven't had linear algebra.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.540
They haven't had 18.06
when they take this course.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.440
And so they ask, do I have
to know linear algebra?

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.240
And I say, well, maybe
not, but you soon will.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.220
Well, I think it's
so fantastic to be

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.390
able to have OpenCourseWare and
try to do something beyond MIT.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.420
And so, what am I trying to do?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.390
I guess, I think that the
teaching of applied math

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.860
has a big step
forward still to take.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.830
That we, in many
situations, we're

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.280
doing what we did a
while ago, and not

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:06.400
really bringing it home, making
the subject what it can be.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.740
And part of that has got
to be numerical solution

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.290
of the equations, and
also new applications.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.810
Well, 18.085, or
really 18.075, has been

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.810
an MIT course for a long time.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.870
And Professor Hildebrand's
textbooks were used.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.960
He was an exceptionally
good teacher.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.390
But computing wasn't
part of it, really.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:48.710
And it has become part of what
all users do to get answers.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.820
So the course had
to move forward,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.345
and the first step
was about 20 years ago

00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:59.640
with a new textbook,
a different approach.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.430
And I have had a wonderful
time teaching classes

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.425
over those years, and now it's
ready for the next generation.
