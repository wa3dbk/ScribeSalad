00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.700
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.490
I hoped I might have
Exam 2 for you today,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.190
but it's not quite
back from the grader.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.400
It's already gone to the second
grader, so it will not be long.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.670
And I hope you've had a
look at the MATLAB homework

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.650
for a variety of possible--
I think we've got,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.910
there were some errors in
the original statement,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.760
location of the coordinates,
but I think they're fixed now.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.900
So ready to go on that MATLAB.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.740
Don't forget that it's four
on the right-hand side and not

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.900
one, so if you get
an answer near 1/4

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.330
at the center of the
circle, that's the reason.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.760
Just that factor
four is to remember.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.420
I'll talk more about the
MATLAB this afternoon

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.000
in the review
session right here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.380
Just to say, I'm highly
interested in that problem.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.620
Not just increasing
N, the number

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.950
of mesh points in
the octagon, but also

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.190
increasing the number of sides.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.530
So there are two numbers there,
we had N points on a ray,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.600
out from the center.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.290
But we have M sides
of the polygon.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.320
And I'm interested in both
of those, getting big.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200
Growing.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.650
I don't know how.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.420
And maybe a reasonable
balance is to take,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.810
I think N proportional to
M is a pretty good balance.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.100
So I'd be very happy;
I mean I'm very

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.890
happy with whatever you do.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.320
But I'm really interested
to know what happens

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.100
as both of these increase.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.520
How close, how quickly
do you approach

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.930
the eigenvalues of a circle.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.410
And you might keep
the two proportional

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.580
as you increase them.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.850
So let me say more about that
this afternoon, because it's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.790
a big day today,
to start Fourier.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.450
Fourier series, the new
chapter, the new topic.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.550
In fact, the final major
topic of the course.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.810
So I tried to list here,
so here I'm in Section 4.1,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.620
so I'm talking about
Fourier series.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.990
So Fourier series is for
functions that have period 2pi.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.440
It involves things like sin(x),
like cos(x), like e^(ikx),

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.110
all of those if I increase x by
2pi, I'm back where I started.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.390
So that's the sort of functions
that have Fourier series.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.880
Then we'll go on to the other
two big forms, crucial forms

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.920
of the Fourier world.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.900
But 4.1 starts with the
classical Fourier series.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.660
So I realize you will
have seen, many of you

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.610
will have seen
Fourier series before.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.190
I hope you'll see
some new aspects here.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:48.030
So, let me just get organized.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.140
It's nice to have some examples
that just involve sine.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.680
And since the sine is
an odd function, that

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.500
means it's sort of
anti-symmetric across zero,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.820
those are the functions that
will have only sine, that

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.960
will have a sine expansion.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.590
Cosines are the opposite.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.340
Cosines are symmetric
across zero.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.800
Like a constant, or like cos(x).

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.650
Zero comes right at
the symmetric point.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.320
So those will have only cosines.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.660
And a lot of examples fit in
one or the other of those,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.180
and it's easy to see them.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.050
The general function, of course,
is a combination odd and even.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.870
It has cosines and
it has sines, it's

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.330
just the sum of the two pieces.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.160
So, this is the
standard Fourier series,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.060
which I couldn't
get onto one line,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.590
but it has all the
cosines including

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.740
this slightly different
cos(0), and all the sines.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.640
But because this one has
these three different pieces,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.970
the constant term, the other
cosines, all the sines,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.590
three slightly
different formulas,

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.120
it's actually nicest of
all, to use this final form.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.150
Because there's
just one formula.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.520
There's just one kind.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.380
And I'll call its
coefficient c_k,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.210
and now they multiply e^(ikx),
so we have to get used

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.770
to e^(ikx).

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.430
We may be more familiar
with sin(kx) and cos(kx),

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.050
but everybody knows e^(ikx)
is a combination of them.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.710
And if we let k go from
minus infinity to infinity,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.410
so we've got all the
terms, including e^(-i3x),

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.840
and e^(+i3x), those would
combine to give cosines

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.480
and sines of 3x.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.800
We get one nice formula.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.350
There's just one
formula for the c's.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.500
So that's one good reason
to look at the complex form.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.110
Even if our function
is actually real.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.980
That form is kind of neat,
and the second good reason,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.380
the really important
reason, is then

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.630
when we go to the discrete
Fourier transform,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.190
the DFT, everybody writes
that with complex numbers.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.670
So it's good to see
complex numbers first

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:30.320
and then we can just
translate the formulas from--

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.510
And these are also almost always
written with complex numbers.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.850
So this is the way to see it.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.130
OK, so what do we do
about Fourier series?

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.080
What do we have
to know how to do

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.990
and what should we understand?

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.040
Well, if you've
met Fourier series

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.800
you may have met the formula
for these coefficients.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.140
That's sort of like step one.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.340
If I'm given the function,
whatever the function might be,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.710
might be a delta function.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.240
Interesting case, always.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.340
Always interesting.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.970
Always crazy right?

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.370
But it's always interesting,
the delta function.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.320
The coefficients
can be computed.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.470
The coefficients, you'll see,
I'll repeat those formulas.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.110
They involve integrals.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.230
What I want to say
right now is that this

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.380
isn't a course in integration.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.770
So I'm not interested in doing
more and more complicated

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.030
integrals and finding
Fourier coefficients

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.850
of weird functions.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:41.760
No way.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.480
I want to understand
the simple, straight,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.280
the important examples.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.970
And here's a point that's
highly interesting.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.900
In practice, in
computing practice,

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.960
we're close to
computing practice here.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.630
In everything we do.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.020
I mean, this is really
constantly used.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.380
And one important question is,
is the Fourier series quickly

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.374
convergent?

00:08:09.374 --> 00:08:10.790
Because if we're
going to compute,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.640
we don't want to compute
a thousand terms.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.850
Hopefully ten terms, 20 terms
would give us good accuracy.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.370
So that question comes down
to how quickly does those a's

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.320
and b's and c's go to zero?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.580
That's highly important.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.270
And you'll connect
this decay rate,

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.760
we'll connect this with the
smoothness of the function.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.770
Oh, I can tell you
even at a start.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.220
OK, so I just want to
emphasize this point.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:50.060
We'll see it over and over
that like for a delta function,

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:56.140
which is not smooth at all,
we'll see no decay at all.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.800
In the coefficients.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.110
They're constant.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.820
They don't decrease as we go to
higher and higher frequencies.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:13.800
I think of k here, I'll use
the word frequency for k.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.260
So high frequency means high
k, far up the Fourier series,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.350
and the question is, are
the coefficients staying up

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.240
there big, and we have
to worry about them?

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.200
Or do they get very small?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.970
So a delta function is
a key example and then

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.170
a step function.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.590
So what will be the
deal with those?

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.330
If I have a function
that's a step function,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:44.730
I'll have decay at rate is 1/k..

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.490
So they do go to zero.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:53.040
The thousandth coefficient
will be roughly of size 1/1000.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.930
That's not fast.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:02.210
That's not really fast
enough to compute with.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:08.430
Well, we meet step functions,
I mean, functions with jumps.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.450
And we'll see that their
Fourier series, the coefficients

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.840
do go to zero but not very fast.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.590
And we get something
highly interesting.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.850
So when we do these
examples, so I've

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:27.130
sort of moved on to examples,
so these are two basic examples.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.160
What would be the next example?

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.780
Step function.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.200
Well, yeah, or maybe a hat next.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.840
A hat function would be, you
see what I'm doing at each step?

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.140
I'm integrating.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.200
A hat function might be the
next, yeah, a ramp, exactly.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.520
Hat function, which is
a ramp with a corner.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.960
Now, so that's one
integral better.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.740
You want to guess the decay
rate on that one? k squared.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.220
Now we're getting better.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.080
That's a faster follow-up.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.310
One over k squared.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.220
And then we integrate again,
we'd get one over k cubed.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.520
Then one more integral,
one over k fourth

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.080
would be a cubic spline.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.020
You remember the cubic
spline is continuous.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.050
Its derivative is
continuous, that

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.950
gives us a one over k cubed.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.930
Its second derivative
is continuous,

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.320
that gives us a one
over k to the fourth,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.060
and then you really
can compute with that,

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.270
if you have such a function.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.510
So, point: pay
attention to decay rate.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:37.000
That, and the connection
to smoothness.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.520
So examples, we'll start
right off with these guys.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.560
And then we'll see the
rules for the derivative.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.890
Oh yeah, rules for
the derivative.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.200
The beauty of Fourier series
is, well, actually you

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.270
can see this.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.170
You can see the rule.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.630
Let me just show you
the rule for this.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:04.200
So the rule for derivatives,
the whole point about Fourier

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.890
is, it connects
perfectly with calculus.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.690
With taking derivatives.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:16.310
So suppose I have F(x)
equals, I'll use this form,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.360
the sum of c_k e^(ikx).

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.230
And now I take its derivative.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.700
dF/dx.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.850
What do you think is the
derivative, what's the Fourier

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.500
series for the derivative?

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.940
Suppose I have the Fourier
series for some function,

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.520
and then I take Fourier
series for the derivative.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.000
So I'm kind of going
the backwards way.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.520
Less smooth.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.020
I'm going from, the derivative
of the step function

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.400
involves delta functions,
so I'm going less smooth

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.720
as I take derivatives.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.520
It's so easy, it jumps at you.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.390
What's the rule?

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.240
Just take the derivative
of every term,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.850
so I'll have the sum
of, now what happens

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.700
when I take the derivative?

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.290
Everybody see what
happens when I

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.250
take the derivative of that
typical term in the Fourier

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.070
series?

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.050
What happens?

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.450
The derivative brings
down a factor ik.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:32.180
With k being the thing that--
So it's ik times what we have.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:38.200
So these are the Fourier
coefficients of the derivative.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.260
And that again makes exactly the
same point about the decay rate

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.000
or the opposite,
the non-decay rate.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.390
As I take the derivative you
got a rougher function, right?

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.430
Derivative of a step function
is a delta, derivative of a hat

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.250
would have some steps.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:02.580
We're going less smooth as
we take more derivatives.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.430
And every time we
do it, we see, you

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.520
understand the decay rate now?

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.510
Because the derivative
just brings a factor ik,

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:18.640
so its high frequencies
are more present.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.900
Have larger coefficients.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.760
So and of course,
the second derivative

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.200
would bring down ik squared.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:35.080
So that our equations,
for example,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.180
let me just do an
application here.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.300
Without pushing it.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:46.220
Our application, we started
this course with equations like

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:51.750
-u''(x) = delta(x-a).

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.770
Right?

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.290
If we wanted to apply to
a differential equation,

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.890
how would I do it?

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.560
I would take the Fourier
series of both sides.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.750
I would look at, I'd jump
into what people would

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.880
call the frequency domain.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.980
So this is a differential
equation written as usual

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.850
in the physical domain.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.060
And with physical
variable x, position.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.710
Or it could be time.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.100
And now let me take
Fourier transforms.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.800
So what would happen here?

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.870
If I take the Fourier
transform of this,

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.000
well, we'll soon see, right?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.100
We get Fourier
coefficients of the deltas.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.800
Of the delta function.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.350
That's a key example,
and you see why.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.970
Over here, what will we get?

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.930
And now I'm taking
two derivatives,

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.560
so I bring down ik twice.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.820
So I'm looking.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.660
Here it would be
the sum of whatever

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.440
the delta's coefficients are.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.840
Shall we call those d?

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.490
The alphabet's coming
out right. d for delta.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.750
So the right side has
coefficients, d_k.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.130
And what about the left side?

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.700
What are the coefficients--
If the solution

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:15.270
u has coefficients c_k,
so let's call this u now.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.380
Has coefficients c_k,
then what happens

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.430
to the second
derivative? ik, ik again,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.050
that's i squared k
squared, the minus sign.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:33.270
So we would have the sum
of k squared c_k e^(ikx).

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:38.200
This is if u itself has
coefficient c_k, then -u'' has

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.750
these coefficients.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.140
So what's up?

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.380
How would we use that?

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.640
It's going to be easy.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.760
We'll just match terms.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.580
Right?

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.690
I can see, what's my
formula, what should c_k

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.880
be if I know the d_k?

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.440
I'm given the right-hand side.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.200
We're just doing what's
constantly happening,

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.090
this three step process.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.710
You're given the right side.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:09.820
Step one, expand it
in Fourier series now.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.070
Step two, match the two sides.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.720
So what's the formula for c_k?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.120
In this application,
which, by the way

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.650
I had no intention to do this.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.520
But it jumped into my head and
I thought why not just do it.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:30.670
What would be the
formula for c_k?

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:35.420
It'll be d_k divided
by? k squared.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.680
You're just matching terms.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.960
Just the way, when we expanded
things in eigenvectors,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.130
we'd match the coefficients
of the eigenvectors,

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.230
and that involved
just the simple step,

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.740
here it's d_k over k squared.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.500
Good.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.610
And then what's the final step?

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.280
The final step is, now you
know the right coefficients,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.150
add them back up.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.540
Add the thing back
up, like here,

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:10.701
only I'm temporarily calling
it u, to find the solution.

00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:11.200
Right?

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.930
Three steps.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.480
Go into the frequency domain.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.410
Write the right-hand
side as a Fourier series.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:26.460
Second quick step is
look at the equation

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.600
for each separate
Fourier coefficient.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.610
Match the coefficients
of these eigenvectors.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:35.670
Eigenfunctions.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.790
And that's this
quick middle step.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.600
And then you've got the
answer, but you're still

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.570
in Fourier space, you're
still in frequency space.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.750
So you have to use
these, put them back

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.090
to get the answer
in physical space.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:51.660
Right?

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.180
That's the pattern.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.140
Over and over.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:59.280
So that's sort of the general
plan of applying Fourier.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.290
And when does it work?

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.710
When does it work?

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.690
Because, I mean it's
fantastic when it works.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:13.520
So what is it about this
problem that made it work?

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.920
When is Fourier happy?

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.840
You know, when does
he raise his hand,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.210
say yes I can
solve that problem?

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:26.200
OK, what do I need here
for this plan to work?

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.830
I certainly don't need always
just -u'', Fourier could do

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.750
better than that.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:37.340
But what's the requirement
for Fourier to work perfectly?

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.860
Well, linear equation, right?

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.380
If we didn't have
linear equations

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.640
we couldn't do all this
adding and matching and stuff.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.600
So linear equations.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.340
Well, OK.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.070
Now, what other
linear equations?

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.590
Could I have a c(x) in here?

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:01.070
My familiar c(x),
variable material property

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.070
inside this equation?

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.320
No.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.940
Well, not easily, anyway.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.930
That would really mess
things up if there's

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.580
a variable coefficient
in here then

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.760
it's going to have its
own Fourier series.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.480
We're going to be
multiplying Fourier series.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.380
That comes later and
it's not so clean.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.500
So we want, it
works perfectly when

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.110
it's constant coefficients.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:33.220
Constant coefficients in
the differential equations.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.090
And then one more thing.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.470
Very important other thing.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.710
The boundary conditions.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.850
Everybody remembers
now, it's a part

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:47.180
of the message of this course
is that boundary conditions are

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.980
often a source of trouble.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.800
They're part of the problem,
you have to deal with them.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.030
Now, what boundary conditions
do we think about here?

00:20:56.030 --> 00:21:02.070
Well, fixed-fixed
was where we started.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.420
So if we had fixed-fixed
boundary conditions what would

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.390
I expect?

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:12.450
Then things would give me
a sine series, possibly.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.640
Because those are the
eigenfunctions we're used to.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.800
Fixed-fixed, it's sines that
go from zero back to zero.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.770
Fixed-free will have
some sines or cosines.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.020
Periodic would be
the best of all.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:32.040
Yeah, so we need nice
boundary conditions.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:38.060
So the boundary conditions,
let me just say,

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.860
periodic would be great.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:47.200
Or sometimes fixed-free.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.430
Our familiar ones, at
least in simple cases,

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.890
can be dealt with.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.540
OK.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:04.790
So now, boy, that board is
already full of formulas.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:09.640
But, let's go back to
the start and say how

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.290
do we find the coefficients?

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.300
So because that
was the first step.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.270
Take the right-hand side,
find its coefficient.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.250
If we want to, just as
applying eigenvalues,

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.990
the first step is
always find eigenvalues.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.440
Here, in applying
Fourier, the first step

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.380
is always find the coefficients.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.640
So, how do we do that?

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.270
And at the beginning it
doesn't look too easy, right?

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:40.410
Because let me take
the first guy, sin(x).

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.390
Let me take an example.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.550
A particular S(x).

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.360
The most important,
interesting function.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.620
S(x), I want it to
be an odd function,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.620
so that it will have only sines.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.500
And it should have period 2pi.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.480
So let me just graph it.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.910
So it's going to
have coefficients,

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:14.030
and I use b for sine, so it's
going to have b_1*sin(x),

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:18.310
and b_2*sin(2x), and so on.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.830
And so it's got a whole
infinity of coefficients.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:24.330
Right?

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.440
We're in function space.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.930
We're not dealing
with vectors now.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:32.480
So how is it possible to
find those coefficients?

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.840
And let me chose
a particular S(x).

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.250
So I'll put, since
it's 2pi periodic,

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:45.100
if I tell you what it
is over a 2pi interval,

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.260
just repeat, repeat, repeat.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:52.300
So I'll pick the 2pi interval
to be minus pi to pi here.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.670
Just because it's a nice way,
and so that's a 2pi length.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:02.200
There's zero, I want to
function to be odd across zero.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.060
And I want it to be
simple, because it's

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.240
going to be an important example
that I can actually compute.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.480
So I'm going to make it a one.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.640
And a minus one there.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.380
So, a step function.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:21.030
A step function, a square--
And if I repeat it, of course,

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:25.540
it would go down,
up, down, up, so on.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.590
But we only have to
look over this part.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.020
OK.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.060
Now, well, you might
say wait a minute

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:41.690
how are we going to expand
this function in sines.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.010
Well, sines are odd functions.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.260
Everybody knows what odd means?

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:56.000
Odd means that S(-x) is -S(x).

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.690
So that's the anti-symmetric
that we see in that graph.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.960
We also see a few
problems in this graph.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:11.710
At x=0, what is our sine
series going to give us?

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:16.110
If I plug in x=0 on the
right-hand side I get zero,

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.790
certainly.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:21.220
So this sine series
is going to do that.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.040
And actually Fourier
series tend to do this.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.790
In the middle of
a jump it'll pick

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.130
the middle point of a jump.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.310
Fourier series generally,
it's the best possible,

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.390
will pick the middle
point of the jump.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.540
And what about at x=pi?

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.070
At the end of the interval?

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.910
What does my series
add up at x=pi?

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:47.710
Zero again, because
sin(pi), sin(2pi), all zero.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.560
And that'll be in the
middle of that jump.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.500
So it's pretty good.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.720
But now what I'm hoping
is that my sine series

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.520
is going to somehow get
real fast up to one,

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.100
and level out at one.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.370
We're asking a lot.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:12.440
In fact, when Fourier proposed
this idea, Fourier series,

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.400
there was a lot of doubters.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:23.740
Was it really possible to
represent other functions,

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.470
maybe even including
a step function,

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:31.390
in terms of sines
or maybe cosines?

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:33.640
And Fourier said
yes, go with it.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.570
So let's do it.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:42.510
OK, so and he turned out
to be incredibly right.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.880
How do I find b_2?

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.640
Do you remember how to-- I
don't want to know the formula.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.230
I want to know why.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:56.440
What's the step to find
the coefficient b_2?

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:02.400
Well, the step
is-- The key point.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.950
Which makes everything possible.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.770
Why don't I identify
the key point

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.130
without which we would
be in real trouble.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:17.010
The key point is that
all these sine functions,

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:22.720
sin(2x), sin(3x),
sin(4x), are orthogonal.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.340
Now, what do I mean by two
functions being orthogonal?

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.440
Somehow my picture
in function space,

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.695
so my picture in
function space is

00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:38.030
that here is, this is
the sine x coordinate.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.600
And somewhere there's a sin(2x)
coordinate and it's 90 degrees

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.160
and then there's a
sin(3x) coordinate,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.510
and then there's a sine, I
don't know where to point now.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.340
But there is a sin(4x),
we're in infinite dimensions.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:56.990
And the sine vectors
are an orthogonal basis.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.730
They're orthogonal
to each other.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.640
What does that mean?

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.800
Vectors, we take
the dot product.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.610
Functions, we take, we don't
use the word dot product as much

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.020
as inner product.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.510
So let me take the inner
product of-- The whole point

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.460
is orthogonality.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.250
Let me write that word down.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.040
Orthogonal.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.990
The sines are orthogonal.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.450
And what does that mean?

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:27.280
That means that the integral
over our 2pi interval,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.320
or any 2pi interval,
of one sine, sin(kx),

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.810
let's say, multiplied by
another sine, sin(lx),

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:42.600
dx is, you can guess the answer.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.880
And everything is
depending on this answer.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.610
And it is?

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:51.060
Zero.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.400
It's just terrific.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.840
If k is different
from l, of course.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.310
If k is equal to l then I
have to figure that one out.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.310
I'll need that one.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:09.380
What is it if sine, if k=l so
I'm integrating sine squared

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.770
of kx, then it's
certainly not zero.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:16.600
I getting like,
the length squared

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.820
of the sin(kx) function.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:25.100
If k=l, what is it?

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.490
It has some nice formula.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.210
Very nice.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:28.880
Let's see.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.710
Sine squared, do I need to
think about sine squared kx?

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:37.150
Sine squared kx,
what does it do?

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.640
Well, just graph sine squared x.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.370
What would the graph
of sine squared x

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:48.020
look like, from minus pi to pi?

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.110
So it goes up, right?

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.960
Doesn't it go up?

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.350
And then it goes back down.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.890
OK.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:00.270
Sorry, I made that
a little hard.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.410
Is that right?

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.850
And then it keeps it up.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.350
Right.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.660
So, what's the integral of that?

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.020
I'm not seeing quite why.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.410
The answer is its
average value is 1/2.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:23.170
The integral of sine squared
is half of the length.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:28.000
The whole interval
is of length 2pi,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.390
and we're taking the
area under sine squared.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.540
I may have to come back
to it, but the answer

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.690
would be half of
2pi, which is pi.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:37.690
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:41.830
So you could say the
length of the sine function

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.000
is square root of pi.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.010
So these are integrals.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.830
You told me the answer was zero.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:55.610
And I agreed with you, but
we haven't computed it.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.900
And nor have we really got that.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.020
So a little bit to fix, still.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:08.190
But the crucial
fact, I mean, those

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:12.920
are highly important integrals
that just come out beautifully.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.600
And beautifully
really means zero.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.610
I mean, that's the beautiful
number, right, for an integral.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:23.440
OK, so now how do I use that?

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.550
Again, I'm looking for b_2.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.950
How do I pick off
b_2, using the fact

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:37.370
that sin(2x) times any other
sine integrates to zero.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.360
Ready for the moment?

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.520
To find the coefficient b_2?

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.690
I should, let me start this
sentence and if you finish it.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:51.940
I'll multiply both sides of
this equation by sin(2x).

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.990
And then I will integrate.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.680
I'll multiply both
sides by sin(2x),

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.890
so I take S(x) sin(2x).

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:12.350
And on the right hand, I
have b_1 sin(x) sin(2x).

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.380
And then I have
b_2-- Now, here's

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.960
the one that's going to live
through the integration.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.300
It's going to survive, because
it's the sin(2x) times sin(2x),

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.290
sin(2x) squared.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:34.650
And then comes the b_3 guy,
would be b_3 sin(3x) sin(2x).

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.320
Everybody sees what I'm doing?

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.090
As we did with the weak form
in differential equations,

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.130
I'm multiplying
through by these guys.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:51.560
And then I'm integrating
over the interval.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.750
And what do I get?

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:59.170
Integrate everyone dx.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.060
And what's the result?

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.760
What is that integral?

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.270
Zero.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.530
It's gone.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.280
What is this
integral, the integral

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.630
of sin(3x) times sin(2x)?

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:15.570
Zero.

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.580
All those sines
integrate to zero,

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:25.250
and I have to come back and
see it's a simple trig identity

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.350
to do it.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.140
To see why that's zero.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:33.770
Do you see that everything
is disappearing, except b_2.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.050
So we finally have the
formula that we want.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:42.070
Let me just with put
these formulas down.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:47.680
So b_k, b_2 or b_k, yeah
tell me the formula for b_k.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.490
Let me go back, here.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.590
What did b_2 come out to be?

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.620
So I have b_2, that's a number.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.230
It's got this right-hand side.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.760
That's the integral
that I mentioned.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.230
You'd have to compute
that integral.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:07.750
And then what about this stuff?

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.850
This sin(2x) squared?

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.160
I've integrated that.

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.930
And what did I get for that?

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:20.310
This is b_2, and then
this is some number.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.400
And it's pi.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.010
So this is b_2, and
multiplying, right?

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.750
That b_2 comes out,
and then I have

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.860
the integral of sine squared
2x, and that's what's pi.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:37.210
So that's b_2 times pi here,
and I just divide by the pi.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:41.400
So I divide by pi and
I get the integral

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:52.440
from minus pi to pi of my
function times my sine.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:58.250
That's the model for
all the coefficients

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:02.850
of orthogonal series.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.490
That's the model.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:11.000
Cosines, the complete ones,
the complex coefficients.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.210
The Legendre series,
the Bessel series,

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.440
everybody's series will
follow this same model.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.750
Because all those series are
series of orthogonal functions.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.910
Everything is hinging
on this orthogonality.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:31.340
The fact that one term
times another gives zero.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.250
What that means, really.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:41.970
I want to say it
with a picture, too.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:46.540
So let me draw two
orthogonal directions.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:53.700
I intentionally didn't make
them just x and y axes.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.350
This might be the
direction of sin(x),

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.440
and this might be the
direction of sin(2x).

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:05.090
And then I have a function.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:08.060
And I'm trying to find
out how much of sin(2x)

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.160
has it got in it?

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.090
How much of sin(x)
has it got in it,

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:15.750
and then of course there's also
a sin(3x) and all the other

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.550
sin(kx)'s.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:22.870
The point is, the point
of this 90 degree angle

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:34.160
there is, that I can split this
S(x), whatever it might be,

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.000
I can find its sin(x)
piece directly.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.840
By just projecting it,
it's the projection

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.090
of my function on
that coordinate.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.060
If you don't like
sin(x), sin(2x), S(x),

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.630
write v_1, v_2, whatever.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.180
To think of it as vectors.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:01.580
What's the sin two--
So that is b_1*sin(x).

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.730
That's the right
amount of sin(x).

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:12.590
And the whole point is that that
calculation didn't involve b_2

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.590
and b_3 and all the other b's.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:19.310
When I'm projecting onto
orthogonal directions,

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.070
I can do them one at a time.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.920
I can do one one-dimensional
projection at a time.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:35.360
This b_k*sin(kx) is the, so
I'm just saying this in words,

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:44.820
is the projection of my
function onto sin(kx).

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.610
And the point is, I
could do this and get

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.290
this answer because of
that 90 degree angle.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.220
If I didn't have
90 degrees, do you

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.890
see that this wouldn't work?

00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:02.700
Suppose my two basis functions
are at some 40 degree angle.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.150
Then I take my function.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.270
Can I project that
onto this guy?

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:13.510
And project that onto this guy,
so the projections are there?

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:14.790
And there?

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:20.680
Do they add back to the
function that I started with?

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.190
The given function?

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.310
No way.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:26.080
I mean, these are
much too big, right?

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.140
If I add that one to this one
I'm way out here somewhere.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.290
But over here, with
90 degrees, these

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.950
are the two projections,
project there.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:37.900
Project there.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.260
Add those two pieces
and I got back exactly.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:48.080
I just want to emphasize the
importance of orthogonality.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.780
It breaks the problem down into
one-dimensional projections.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.020
So here we go with b_k*sin(kx).

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.910
OK, let me do the
key example now.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.800
This example.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:08.030
Let me find the coefficients of
that particular function S(x).

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:13.140
This is the step function,
the square wave, S(x),

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.190
let's find its coefficients.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.390
I'll just use this formula.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:22.190
OK, maybe I'll erase so that
I can write the integration

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.480
right underneath.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.030
OK.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:26.650
Oh, one little point here.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:30.320
Well, not so little,
but it's a saving.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.520
It's worth noticing.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.050
The reward for picking
off the odd function

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:45.380
is, I think that this integral
is the same from minus

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.350
pi to zero as zero to pi.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.340
In other words, I think
that for an odd function,

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:57.260
I get the same answer if I
just do the integral from zero

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:03.280
to pi, that I have to do.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.510
And double it.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:10.790
So I think if I
just double it, I

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.820
don't know if you
regard that as a saving.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:18.560
In some way, the work
is only half as much.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.080
It'll make this
particular example easy,

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.560
so let me do this example.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.230
What are the
Fourier coefficients

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:29.430
of the square wave?

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:34.730
OK, so I'll do this integral.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:39.580
So from zero to pi,
what is my function?

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.710
My N from the graph?

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.630
Just one.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.230
This is going to
be a picnic, right?

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:50.700
The function is one here.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:58.960
So S(x) is one, so I want 2/pi,
the integral from zero to pi

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.240
of just sin(kx) dx, right?

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:09.790
Which is, so I've got 2/pi,
now I integrate sin(kx),

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:15.070
I get minus cos(kx), right?

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.900
Between zero and pi.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.190
And what else?

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.200
What have I forgotten?

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.460
The most important point.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:28.390
The integral of sin(kx)
is not minus cos(kx).

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:34.070
I have to divide by k.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.760
It's the division by k
that's going to give me

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.530
the correct decay rate.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:42.920
2/(pi*k).

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.460
Alright, now I've got a
little calculation to do.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.070
I have to figure out what is
cos(kx) at zero, no problem,

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.310
it's one.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:55.840
And at the other point, at x=pi.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.060
So what am I getting, then?

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.620
I'm getting 2/pi-- no, 2/(pi*k).

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.200
With that minus sign,
I'll evaluate it at x=0,

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.550
I have one minus whatever
I get at the top.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.440
cos(k*pi).

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.090
That's b_k.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:32.970
So there's a typical, well not
typical but very nice, answer.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.350
Now let's see what
these numbers are.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:39.930
So let me take a 2/pi out here.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:44.060
And then just list
these numbers.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.090
So k is one, two, three,
four, five, right?

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.450
Tell me what these
numbers are for-- Let me

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:55.490
put the k in here because
that's part of it.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:59.520
So it's a constant, 2/pi.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.200
At k=1, what do I get?

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.850
At k=1?

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:09.970
This is the little bit
that needs the patience.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:15.190
At k=1, the cosine of pi is?

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.850
Negative one.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:20.270
So I have net minus
minus one, I get a two.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:25.590
I get a two over
a one. k is one.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:30.740
Alright, that is the
coefficient for k=1.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.980
Now, what's b_2, the
coefficient for k=2?

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:39.140
I have 1-cos(2pi),
what's cos(2pi)?

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.060
One.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.060
So they cancel, so I get a zero.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.210
There is no b_2.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.130
What about b_3?

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:51.870
So now b_3, I have 1-cos(3pi).

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.780
What's the cosine of 3pi?

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.490
It's negative one again.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.680
Right, same as the cosine of pi.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.300
So that gives me a two, and
now I'm dividing by three.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.670
2/3.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:08.400
Alright, let's do two
more. k=4, what do I get?

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.570
Zero, because the cosine of
4pi has come back to one.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:13.780
So I get a zero.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.520
And what do I get from k=5?

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:26.190
1-cos(5pi), which is? cos(5pi)
is back to negative one,

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:29.170
so one minus negative
one is a two.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.610
You see the pattern.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:40.930
And so let me just copy the
famous series for this S(x).

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:44.910
This S(x) is, let's see.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.100
The twos, I'll make
that 4/pi, right?

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.090
I'll take out all those twos.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:58.640
So I have 4/pi 1-cos(5pi), I
have no sin(2x), forget that.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.750
Now I do have some sin(3x)'s,
how much do I have?

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.930
4/pi sin(3x)'s.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:12.110
But divide by three, right?

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:16.000
And then there's no
4x's, no sin(4x)'s.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.030
But then there will be a 4/pi
sine, what's the next term now?

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.360
Are you with me?

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.450
So this is a typical nice
example, an important example.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.750
Sine of what?

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:33.960
5x, divided by five.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.120
OK.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.850
That's a great example,
it's worth remembering.

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:40.490
Factor the 4/pi
out if you want to.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:46.110
4/pi times sin(x),
sine(3x)/3, sin(5x)/5,

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:49.790
it's a beautiful example
of an odd function.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:53.820
OK, and let's see.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:46:00.930
So what do you think,
MATLAB can draw this graph

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.640
far better than we can.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.170
But let me draw
enough so you see

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:09.790
what's really interesting here.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.290
Interesting and famous.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.810
So the leading term
is 4/pi sin(x), that

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.250
would be something like that.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.860
That's as close
as sin(x) can get,

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.320
4/pi is the optimal number.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.980
The optimal coefficient.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.230
The projection.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:32.150
This 4/pi*sin(x) is the best,
the closest I can get to one.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.760
On that interval.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.010
With just sin(x).

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.950
But now when I put
in sin(3x), I think

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:44.440
it'll do something
more like this.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.860
Do you see what's
happening there?

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.130
That's what I've got with
sin(3x), and of course

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:50.670
odd on the other side.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.790
What do you think it
looks like with sin(5x)?

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:59.540
It's just so great you have
to let the computer draw

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.720
it a couple of times.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.310
You see, it goes up here.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:08.000
And then it's sort of, you
know, it's getting closer.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.460
It's going to stay
closer to that.

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.420
But I don't know if you
can see from my picture,

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.730
I'm actually proud
of that picture.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.100
It's not as bad as usual.

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:27.190
And it makes the crucial
point, two crucial points.

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:31.090
One is, I am going to get
closer and closer to one.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:38.510
These oscillations, these
ripples, will be smaller.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:41.300
But here is the
great fact and it's

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.040
a big headache in calculation.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:51.950
At the jump, the first
ripple doesn't get smaller.

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:57.150
The first ripple gets thinner,
the first ripple gets thinner.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:59.340
You see the ripples
moving over there,

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:01.950
but their height doesn't change.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.200
Do you know whose name
is associated with that,

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.980
in that phenomenon?

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.900
Gibbs.

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:14.950
Gibbs noticed that the
ripple height as you

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:18.030
add more and more terms,
you're closer and closer

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:23.430
to the function over more
and more of the interval.

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.950
So the ripples get
squeezed to the left.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:29.560
The area under the ripples
goes to zero, certainly.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.450
But the height of
the ripples doesn't.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:36.015
And it doesn't stay constant,
but nearly constant.

00:48:36.015 --> 00:48:39.560
It approaches a famous number.

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:43.980
And of course we'll have the
same odd picture down here.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:47.400
And it'll bump up
again, the same thing

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.810
is happening at every jump.

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.200
In other words, if
you're computing shock.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.950
If you're computing
air flow around shocks,

00:48:54.950 --> 00:49:00.190
with Fourier-type methods,
Gibbs is going to get you.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.300
You'll have to deal with Gibbs.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:09.060
Because the shock has
that extra ripple.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.980
OK, that's a lot of Section 4.1.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.010
Energy, we didn't
get to, so that'll

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.440
be the first point on Friday.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.430
And I'll see you this afternoon
and talk about the MATLAB

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:21.610
or anything else.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:22.860
OK.
