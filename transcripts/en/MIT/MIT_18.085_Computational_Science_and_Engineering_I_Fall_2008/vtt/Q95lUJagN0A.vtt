00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.610
PROFESSOR STRANG: This
is my second lecture

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.430
on the example, the model
of graphs and networks.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.220
Really perfect, beautiful
model for the whole framework.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.230
And important in itself.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.700
So, I guess a major thing
that I still have to do

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.080
is discuss A transpose.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.140
See how A transpose
just naturally appears

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.800
in the balance law.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.500
Kirchhoff's current
law, KCL, is just

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.290
like a model for
balance equations.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.700
By balance I mean, in
equals out, essentially.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.030
Flow in equals flow
out because we're

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.860
talking about steady state.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.550
So in each node, at
node three, for example,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.500
I have three edges.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.210
So the law, Kirchhoff's
current law at that point

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:29.810
is going to tell me that the
flow w_2 plus w_3 minus w_5

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.150
would be zero if there's
no current source,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.850
or if I'm feeding current
into there, some current f_3,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.000
then it would match f_3.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.330
So maybe having just
said those words,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.790
let me just say, w_2,
I'll say it again,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.160
w_2 plus w_3 minus
w_5, and I'm hoping

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.860
that I'll find that in
the third column here.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.790
And I do.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.850
Because I'm thinking,
and we'll write it down,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490
I'm thinking to
take a transpose,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.040
so it'll be the
third row, and here I

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.810
see the w_2, w_3
and minus w_5 that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.780
will show up in the
third equation there,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.900
the in equals out at node three.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.630
Well I'll write that
down, because it's-- So,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.400
two or three jobs for today.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.390
And then Monday I plan to
spend a part of the lecture

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.620
and all of the review
session in review,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.650
it's a great chance to go
back to the things we've done

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.860
and collect them, assemble
them, organize them and see them

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.480
again.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.950
So that's my goal for
both sessions on Monday.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.050
And questions, then,
about every aspect.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.600
So, before I get to A
transpose, this part

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.490
I had written down last time,
but there's a little more

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.880
to say.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.840
And what I was saying
and want to continue with

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.750
is the source terms.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.160
I put in this b but I didn't
draw anything on the network.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.010
So let me draw what
these b's represent.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.140
So this second, lower, row
is about edge equations,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.610
edge variables.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.020
So those batteries
b are on the edges.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.120
And there will be,
b has length five.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.220
There are five edges.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.320
This is a vector of length
five, this matrix, A,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.690
you remember was five by four.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.410
It produced from four
inputs, from four potentials

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.370
at the four nodes, A produces
Au, five potential differences.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.010
So those are the
differences in potentials.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.920
But then also there
can be source terms

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.270
from batteries in the
edges, and the minus sign

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.280
is there because I'm
talking about voltage drops.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.440
So when I say
differences I'm really

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.280
speaking about voltage drops.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.720
Because that's the
way current flows.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.560
OK, this is the
moment that I hate.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.480
Putting the batteries in.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.580
I think you draw a battery
with a long and a short?

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.650
Is that right?

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.460
And then you put a
plus and a minus?

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:04.340
Well, can I just say, life
is too short to get those,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.930
to get this sign right.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.210
You may say when my
car battery stalls

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.880
how do I, because it's
important at that moment, right?

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.930
When you start it
up you're supposed

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.330
to put the right battery, the
right lead on the positive

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.250
and the right on the negative,
or your blow yourself up.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.420
OK.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.670
So what's my solution?

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.330
Because I literally refuse
to deal with these signs.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.220
So my solution is call AAA.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.710
OK, they're paid to
blow themselves up.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.090
They can do it.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.360
But so this is serious
now, I don't want

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.820
to be asked about these signs.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.040
And I forgive you for
messing up the signs.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.330
So possibly that's plus,
possibly minus, I don't know.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.290
But there's a battery
in there of length b_1,

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.230
of voltage-- A nine-volt
battery, b_1 would be nine.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.780
And depending how it
was placed in there,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.510
the b here would be a
plus nine or a minus nine

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.000
in the first component.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.020
And then if I had
another battery here,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.990
a b that's on edge four,
there would be a battery b_4,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.230
and that would show
up there in Ohm's law.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.330
Because Ohm's law will
look at the difference

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.400
in these potentials,
but then it'll also

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.790
account for the battery, right?

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.130
The voltage that comes from
the battery, and somehow

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.730
combining the Au, which is
the difference in these guys,

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.760
with the b_4, I'll know
what is the voltage drop

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.010
across the resistor.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.060
And that's what
Ohm's law applies to.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.870
Ohm's law says the voltage
drop across the resistor

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:00.300
times the conductance, so this
is Ohm's law, that on that edge

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.220
the voltage drop across the
resistor times the conductance

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.570
gives the current.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.410
So that's the physical law.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.470
Is that OK?

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.850
For batteries.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.950
Now a comment on
current sources.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.530
So what's with current sources?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.180
How would I draw those?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.990
Well, very often maybe I
might draw a current going

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.590
into node one, so that would be
in f_1 that goes into node one

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.980
and maybe comes out at ground.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.010
So that would be a typical f.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.850
That if I imposed
a current source,

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.380
if I sent a current
source through there

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.490
it would go down and
come out at ground,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.480
and our question is what are
the currents in the five edges?

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.740
What are the potentials
at the four nodes?

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.890
Well, I'm making
this one ground.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.240
So I'm grounding
this one to be u_4=0.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.370
And you remember
of course why I had

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.980
to do that, because this matrix
A transpose A, as it stands

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:10.060
is-- What's the matter with
A transpose A as it stands?

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.960
It's singular, right?

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.360
And as I, looking ahead,
just a small comment,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.640
that this will have
exactly the same thing

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.030
in so many other applications
in big, finite element codes,

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.030
you produce a stiffness matrix
that's initially singular.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.970
And then you impose the
boundary conditions.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.780
That's the efficient
way to do it,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.080
is create the matrix
first, that's the big job,

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.010
then impose the
boundary conditions,

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.100
that's the small but
occasionally tricky part.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.540
Now I indicated
what happened here.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.770
When u_4 was zero, that
means that A times u, the u_4

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.960
there, the zero is multiplying
this, is not unknown any more.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.150
It's known.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:03.440
And so that column is not
really any more needed in A.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:11.590
Because u_4 is gone from my
list of unknown potentials.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:18.500
Now, at the same time, when I
went over to A transpose A--

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.620
I'm making this
comment because there

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.680
were several good
questions about it.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:30.820
I claim that also,
that row, coming,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.030
which of course comes from
the fourth row of A transpose.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.640
The fourth column of A is
gone, so the fourth row

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.800
of A transpose should be gone.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.150
And we might just think
why's that, what's going on?

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.200
Of course, it produces
exactly what we want.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.870
It leaves us with a
three by three matrix

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.000
that's not singular any more.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.140
I've removed that [1, 1, 1, 1]
from the null space by fixing

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.910
a potential.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.850
Grounding a node,
and the problem

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.990
becomes just what we want.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.350
And I'll write
down the equations

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:15.080
when I get the Kirchhoff current
law to complete the loop.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.880
Now, what's going on?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.910
Let me remove this
current source,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:28.690
just so we focus on what
I'm speaking about now.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:34.360
On this type of
boundary condition,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.590
this is like fixing
a support, right?

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.060
It's like fixing a support
in our spring mass problem.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.070
Can I squeeze in a little
spring mass problem,

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:56.760
so I have a spring, and then
I'm fixing this displacement,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.840
u_4 to be zero.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:06.220
Now, I want to try
to think through what

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:11.660
happens in a balance
equation, A transpose w,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.850
let me make it A
transpose w equal f,

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:23.410
because that's the case with
right hand side allowed.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:28.730
And now what happens
when I fix this,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:34.780
I'm asking you to think back
about force balance, which

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:41.370
we certainly saw was an A
transpose w equal f business.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:47.480
And then parallel will be the
current balance, at that node.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:54.240
OK, so what was the
deal on force balance?

00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.480
A transpose with
this fixed in here.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.600
What was the thing with A
transpose that that fixed in?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.880
We did not write the
equation A transpose w equal

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.790
f at this point.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.120
We did not write the force
balance equation at that point.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:19.960
When I fixed u_4, in this case
it was the displacement so I'm

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.130
fixing it at zero
displacement, I

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.390
didn't have a force balance
in the A transpose part

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.680
at this node.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.670
Now, you could say why?

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.310
Because of course
forces have to balance.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.020
But what's going on?

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.430
What's really happening here
is I don't have to write out,

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.680
I don't have to-- the
displacement here is known.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.700
It's not unknown.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.260
And let me say it in a sentence.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.530
Force balance does hold
because the support

00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:01.890
supplies whatever force it takes
to balance the internal forces.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:09.120
So, in other words, let me say
that again, the force balance

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.720
will hold and it will
tell me, after I've

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.120
solved the rest of the
problem, it'll tell me

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.850
what the support has to supply,
how much force the support is

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:19.720
actually supplying.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.430
It's a reaction force,
it would be called.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.710
So a reaction force is
whatever the support has

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.530
to do to fix that displacement.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:35.810
And so I solved
the fixed problems

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.020
for all the other displacements
and all the spring forces.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.320
And then I could
come back at the end

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.060
and say OK, what was the force
in that spring and therefore

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:51.340
how much is that support,
what's the force being supplied

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.770
by that support.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.920
See what I'm saying?

00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:05.270
That the force balance at
this node comes afterwards.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:12.020
That equation is like knocking
that one out of this problem.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.860
It would be the same here,
I fix the potential at zero.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.760
I fix ground at zero.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.960
Current flows.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.540
Maybe some, maybe I might
fix that potential at one.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.350
I fix that potential at zero.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.770
Current flows.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.010
OK.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.730
Ta-da, I find out, I
compute what they are,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:40.200
and this row and
column will be gone.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.620
Find out what they are.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.840
At this node, what's happened?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.010
What's happening to the
balance of currents?

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.820
Does this current have
to balance that current

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.220
at the ground?

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.070
No.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:15:00.700
The ground, whatever
current comes here

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.110
plus whatever current comes
here, goes into ground.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.920
Do you see the point?

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.200
Kirchhoff's current
law, the balance

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.840
of currents that in
equals out, is true

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.000
but it's not an
equation I have to solve

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.920
in finding the
currents, it's something

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.540
I can discover at the end.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.860
I can say OK, how much
current flowed from ground?

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.280
And similarly up here.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.167
If I fix u_1 to be
zero, then you, no, I

00:15:32.167 --> 00:15:34.500
don't want to fix it to be
zero too, that would be a way

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.850
to make very little happen.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.940
Let me fix u_1 to
be one, so this is

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.810
a standard important problem.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.210
It's like what's the
resistance in the net-- what's

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.870
the net system resistance?

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.500
If I fix this at one fix this
at zero, some current will flow,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.740
it'll come out here.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.800
And that'll be the
current going into here.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:06.680
Somehow there'll be a balance
there, and a balance there.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.680
But it's found later.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.220
Just the way the force in
the support is found later.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.430
OK, that takes a
little thinking.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:23.400
I just wanted to, because I had
blithely knocked this row out.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.000
And you could do
it on the basis,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.740
well if you knock
out this column of A

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.360
then you're knocking out
the row of A transpose,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.050
and therefore A transpose
A will be three by three.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:40.340
And it'll go down to two by
two if I fix that potential.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.730
And if I don't fix it at
zero, if I fix it at one

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.180
then something will move
to the right hand side.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:57.590
OK. that's that point I
hope at least discussed.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:03.220
So now we have the
whole pattern here.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:09.480
Except that I really have still
to justify the fact that it

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:14.650
truly is A transpose, the
transpose of that matrix,

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.010
that comes into
Kirchhoff's current law.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.200
I guess in the first
minute of the lecture I

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.800
looked at that particular node.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.410
Let's look at all the nodes.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:28.100
Let me look at A
transpose w equals zero.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.960
OK.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.150
So I'll copy a transpose
because I truly

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.790
believe that Kirchhoff
would want me to do it.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:45.080
OK, so that becomes a row, that
becomes the next row, of course

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.500
I see three guys
going into node one,

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.370
then the one that
I looked at before.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:59.310
That's the three edges, node
three, and then the last one.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.340
Let's keep the last
one in for now.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:08.310
And because if I didn't fix
that I'd have that last one.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:12.290
There we go, so that multiplies,
what does that multiply now

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.020
in Kirchhoff's current law?

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.680
Multiplies w, so currents.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:22.480
So here the currents, one,
two, three, four and five.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.300
All I'm doing now is
just, like, convincing you

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.230
that it really is a
transpose, that if I look at,

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.250
let me pick that
node now, if I look

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:38.840
at that node I see
edge one coming in,

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.820
I see edge three going out,
I see edge four going out

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.410
and when I look at
that second node,

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.980
I look here at the second
row, I see edge one coming in,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.020
edge three and edge
four going out,

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.280
multiplying those currents,
and that will give,

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.580
that current balance
there gives that zero.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.080
Right?

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.510
That current balance
at node two gives that

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.770
zero in the right hand side.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.720
And then, of course,
other zeroes are here too.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.860
This is minus w_1, minus
w_2, so I have a zero.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.240
This is with no current sources.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.930
OK.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.890
And this one, of course.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:29.070
I guess I'm hoping that you
say yes, the A transpose really

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:35.010
was the right matrix to express
in equals out, Kirchhoff's

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.040
current law.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.020
OK.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.620
Of course, by now you're
probably getting blasé.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.600
You expect it to be A transpose,
you don't need any convincing.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.980
But it's kind of good to
see each time because it's

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.620
like, well, it's not a miracle.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.100
But it's like a miracle.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.930
It's as good as a miracle.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.930
Because to get A
transpose is just

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.590
what makes everything right.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:11.340
Now, here's a question.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.830
This is a question
worth thinking about.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.120
What are the solutions?

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.540
If I only look at this
piece of the framework,

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.330
if I just look at Kirchhoff's
current law, it's telling me,

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.950
and I have zero current sources.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.410
Well let's take
that, let me take

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:35.210
just this piece of the
whole framework and ask you,

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:41.210
how many vectors w,
how many solutions?

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.780
Are there any solutions?

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.510
Well, of course, there's
always the zero solution.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:50.300
But I always ask you, what
are the solutions when

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.790
zero is on the right hand side?

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.770
So, what are the w's that
solve Kirchhoff's current law.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.390
Now that's a new question.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.930
We haven't asked that before.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:04.880
What we asked before was
the question Au, Au=0,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.590
remember it was then A.
This five by four matrix,

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.880
u had four components.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.720
Just remind me, and I'm
putting that column back in,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.840
so this is still here.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.760
In the un-reduced,
un-grounded case.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.090
Well, just so we get
started, remind me

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:35.120
what the solutions u were for
Au equals zero. [1, 1, 1, 1].

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.330
Or any multiple of it.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.280
A whole line of vectors.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.090
[c, c, c, c], any constant c.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:47.040
OK, so this had, there
were four columns.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.140
But only three were independent.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.900
OK.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:56.580
Now, now I've made
them into rows.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.170
And I made the
rows into columns.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.640
So now I have five columns.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:08.240
What I'm leading to is, I
want to count in advance

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.900
how many w's I should be looking
for, and then look for them.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.420
OK, so the first question is
how many different solutions w.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.280
First of all, are
there some solutions?

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.880
Is there is a solution w,
other than zero of course,

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.980
to this system?

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.950
Well, as we said
last time, we've

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.180
only got four equations here.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.810
We've got five unknowns.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.490
Of course there's at
least one solution.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.190
Four equations, five unknowns,
I can do elimination,

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.490
whatever systematic
procedure you want me to do.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.030
In the end, I'm going
to find a solution.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.100
Now, I might find
more solutions.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.590
So that's the question.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:57.840
So what's the, now this is the
key fact of linear algebra.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.930
Which is, it just tells us
the numbers of everything.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.950
So this told us that there
were three independent columns.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:15.130
Of A. Now, for that key
theorem, which tells me that,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:19.040
how many independent
rows of A are there?

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.970
Three.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.940
That number is equal.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.860
I just want to say that's
a pretty remarkable fact.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:32.930
If I have a 50 by 80 matrix
and that 50 by 80 matrix

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:38.240
has 17 independent columns,
then this great fact

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.330
tells me that there are
17 independent rows.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:47.960
And if those 50 times 80,
4,000 numbers are random,

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.690
boy, you can't look at
it and see what are they.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.740
Independent rows.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.660
But if you know there are
17 independent columns then

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.570
there are 17 independent rows.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.990
So, what does that mean here?

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.450
That means that out
of the five columns

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:10.810
of A transpose, which were rows
of A, three are independent.

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.220
So just tell me, how many
solutions I'm looking for.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.470
Before I look for them.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.750
So the number of-- The
number of independent w's,

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.700
independent solutions
will be what?

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.770
What's your guess?

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:28.620
Two!

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.320
Two is the right guess.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.700
Two, because I have
altogether five unknowns,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.650
I subtract three equations
that are really there,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.670
I have three real
equations there

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.300
even though it looks like four.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.940
And I get two.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.460
So that general
picture is n-- Oh, I'm

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:54.070
sorry it's actually m because
I'm doing the transpose here.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:25:00.890
So it's m w's minus r, the rank.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.840
So that's m is five,
the rank is three

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.520
and this counts the number
of independent solutions.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.960
So it's a nice, it
couldn't be better.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.520
It's a fundamental count of
how many solutions are there.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.090
You're really taking the
number of unknowns, five,

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.490
and you're subtracting
the number of equations

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.270
that are really there,
three, and that leaves you

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:30.780
with two solutions which we
will have to find in a minute.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:35.930
Can you say why there's really
only three equations there?

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:41.910
Why do I say that that
fourth equation is not

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.600
contributing anything new?

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.040
I believe that that fourth
equation is a consequence

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.400
of the first three.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.830
And, therefore, if it's
there or if it's not there,

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.490
it's not telling me
anything new about in=out.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.060
In other words, if I
have a closed system,

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.700
closed because it's
zero on the right side,

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.430
if I have a closed system and
I have in=out at those three

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:14.400
nodes, then I'll automatically
have in=out at the fourth node,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:19.060
because the total in is zero.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.690
And the total out is zero.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.850
So if I'm right at three I'll
be right at the fourth one.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.360
And now just tell
me with the numbers,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:37.050
how would I get this equation
w_4+w_5=0 from the first three?

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.450
Well, it's probably
the same way that I

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.400
got that column,
that that column was

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.920
connected to those columns.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.940
What do I do?

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.900
Add them.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.640
If you add that equation to
that equation to that equation,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.930
add those three
equations, what happens?

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.320
the w_1's cancel, the w_2's
cancel, the w_3's cancel,

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.940
this says there's a
minus w_4 and a minus w_5

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.280
that adds to zero plus
zero plus zero, minus w_4,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.850
minus w_5 equalling zero
is the same as plus w_4

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.930
plus w_5 equals zero.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.380
The four equations add
to zero equals zero.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.530
That's what the
central thing is.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.210
The four equations add
to zero equals zero just

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.740
the way the four columns up
here added to the zero column.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:29.730
OK.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.070
So we got the count.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:37.010
Now, this is the
interesting part, always.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.860
What are the solutions?

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.900
What are the actual w's?

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.570
OK.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.890
You could say, wait
a minute, you're

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:52.210
asking me to solve four
equations and five unknowns,

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.710
and just say what the answer is.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.010
Well, normally that's
not reasonable.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:02.140
But here we can get
help from the graph.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.570
Let me give you an idea here.

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:09.380
So what are we looking for
on the graph, that solves it?

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.760
We're looking for
a bunch of currents

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.860
that balance themselves.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:15.360
Right?

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.490
We've got zero on
the right hand side.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.810
So we're not getting
any help from outside.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.200
How could you send
current in this loop

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.750
in a way that would
satisfy Kirchhoff.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.650
He'd be happy.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.270
The balance law would be true.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:37.810
OK. b-- I'm just
looking at currents.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.380
Current w_1, w_2, w_3.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.010
Is there any
combination of w_1, w_2,

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:52.510
w_3 that would balance itself,
that would make Kirchhoff OK?

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.820
Well, here's the idea.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.620
Send that current around a loop.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:05.120
Loop currents are solutions
to Kirchhoff's balance law.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.970
If I send an amp on
that edge, on that edge

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.640
and backward on
that edge, right?

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.830
It's around a loop at every
node, it's totally OK.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.310
So I believe that a
particular solution will

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:29.280
be for these things to be,
let's see what did I say? w_1,

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.710
I'll send one around. w_3 will
be a one. w_2 was backwards,

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.260
it wasn't traveling on w_4.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.790
I think that's a solution.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.180
That loop current
gives me a solution so

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:49.340
let me call this solution,
that's the first solution.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.910
And if we do these
multiplications, of course

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.670
it's going to come out right.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:58.930
OK, so that's
solution number one.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.270
A w that works.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.490
OK, with that hint, tell
me a second w that works.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:08.030
In fact, since
there are only two,

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:12.820
you'll be giving me
the rest of the answer.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.680
So that was a loop current
that went around that loop.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.730
Tell me another one.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:25.640
Well, we're a big class
but everybody's seen it.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.620
How about around that loop?

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.540
So that would be
another thing and it's

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.620
pretty clearly not
the same as this one.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:41.390
So I'm really truly finding
two independent solutions.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.670
And what is that
second solution?

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:48.810
Let me maybe just
put it in here.

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:52.860
And they're both giving
me [0,  0, 0, 0].

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:57.560
And now, what is this number two
solution, the loop number two?

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.790
One and two are
not involved now.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:07.900
Number three, see I'm usually
sending it counterclockwise,

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.430
that's the sort of convention.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:13.460
But you know, of
course you just have

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.270
to follow some convention in
connection with the arrows.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.570
So that would go backwards
on three, I think.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:24.630
Forwards on four, and
backwards on five.

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.770
So that would be
solution number two.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:29.650
OK.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.040
Now, tell me what all
the solutions are.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.960
I found two particular
solutions, two particular loop

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.970
currents, particularly easy.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:45.090
What would be all the solutions
to Kirchhoff's current law,

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:47.800
A transpose w equals zero?

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.980
Every w now since I've
found the right number,

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:57.840
every w will be a
combination of those two.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.900
Ah, well wait a minute.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.110
Have I got them all?

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.720
I should have thought,
what about current

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.660
around the big loop?

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.870
That would certainly
satisfy Kirchhoff.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:19.560
Plus one, one, so why is
this not number three?

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.690
Around the big loop
I have a one and then

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.760
a one on the fourth position.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.420
Backwards on five,
backwards on two.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.310
And so there is number--
So I'll put number three

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:36.130
with a question mark.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:41.670
What's up with that guy?

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:46.510
You know, unless mathematics
has got to close up shop,

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:51.070
this better be a
combination of those.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.170
And of course, it is.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:56.090
If I send something around
the top loop and something

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.440
around the second loop
and add them together,

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.740
they'll cancel on
the middle edge

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.000
there and produce number three.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.580
So this is probably
just the sum.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.240
If I add that one to that one,
I think I get number three.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.270
So number three is true.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.510
It's a solution but
it's not a new one.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.590
OK.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:25.720
That was simple, right, once we
saw that loops gave the answer.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:33.330
But, it's, actually
it's quite important

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.570
and appears everywhere.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:42.400
In fact the theory of
electrical networks,

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.880
current laws and so on.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.060
I mean that used to be
a, like, basic course

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.340
in electrical engineering.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:52.220
There was a text by Professor
Ernst Guillemin, I remember.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:56.420
It's sort of not so central
to the world any more.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:03.260
And now-- Bu the structure
is just right somehow.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:08.040
And what I wanted to say is
you could take, in those days

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.190
you maybe took loop
currents as the unknowns.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.510
You could think of
currents in the loops

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.300
as your principal unknowns.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.620
We don't do that now.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:23.400
But, oh, there's, yeah
it comes up again.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.250
Knowing all the solutions to
A transpose w equals zero,

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:31.350
well, you'll see, what's ahead?

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:36.430
It will be the continuous analog
of this, where I have flows,

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:40.970
not just around a
graph, but in a region.

00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:43.510
And Laplace's equation
is going to come up,

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.830
and the equations of
divergence and gradient,

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:50.830
all that great stuff
is coming in Chapter 3.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:59.160
And this is somehow
the discrete case.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.000
These loop currents, that has
something to do with the curl.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.560
And these differences
that A takes

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.800
has something to
do with gradients.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.890
And this, Kirchhoff's
current law

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.580
has something to
do with divergence.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:21.010
Can I just say ahead of time,
what we're doing is really

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:27.270
good to see and get it
because then you have a way

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:33.390
to understand vector calculus.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:36.410
This is discrete vector
calculus we're doing.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.170
OK.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.810
Now, it's just right.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:45.290
Forgive me for my sermon here.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.910
Alright.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:50.980
Now, may I bring the
pieces together finally?

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:56.930
May I bring the three
steps together into,

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:01.910
well first you would say
bring them into one equation.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:05.880
Put the three steps, combine
the three steps into one.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.800
OK.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.760
So, what happens if I do that?

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:18.250
I take that last step A
transpose-- f is A transpose w.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:24.880
So now I'm going to
get one equation.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.790
Which is the
equation that's going

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.320
to have the stiffness matrix
in it, A transpose C A.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.380
It's the conductance matrix.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.050
And it's the equation
that a big finite element

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:43.490
code, a circuit simulation
code-- It's the matrix

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.870
they have to find and work with.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.450
And those codes are enormous,
and SPICE by the way

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:54.540
is the sort of grandfather
of circuit simulation codes.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.750
Somebody at Berkeley had
the sense to see hey,

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.700
we've got giant circuits now.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.730
Modern circuits have
thousands of elements.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:09.160
And you can't do it by eye the
way we can do this one by eye.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.780
You've got to organize
it and write a code,

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.660
and SPICE is the start.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.530
So one way to do it is to
end up with one equation.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:22.210
So that was f equals
A transpose w.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.550
I'm now going, I'm just
assembling the whole loop.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:28.500
But w is Ce.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:41.400
So that's A transpose
Ce, but e is b minus Au.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.750
Nothing new there.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:49.290
Nothing new maybe except that it
involves both the f and the b,

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:52.180
where our earlier
examples involved either

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:56.920
an f, in masses and springs,
or a b in the squares.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.060
Now they're both here.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.760
So now, that's my
equation, f equals this.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.600
And now let me just move that to
the, let me just recollect it,

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.180
that's A transpose C A, the
big thing that I wanted to see.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.220
I'll put it on the left side.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.560
And what will I have
on the right side?

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:21.740
I'll have A transpose C b.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:25.050
And I'll have, f is now
coming over to the other side

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.710
with a minus.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.360
Minus f.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.840
That's the big equation.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.840
You could say that's
the fundamental equation

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.440
of equilibrium.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.030
And you see how it's right?

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:43.230
It involves the A transpose
C A, which we expect.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.960
Over here was the
A transpose C b.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.760
Now, which problem,
before networks,

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:56.130
produced an A transpose
b or an A transpose C b?

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.750
That was least squares.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:01.540
And now, so that's the
least squares, the b term.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.570
The b is there with
a couple of matrices

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:07.660
because b entered the
problem just one step around.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.930
It had two more steps to go.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:13.160
It had a C step and then
an A transpose step.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.040
Whereas f up here is
at the very end and now

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.310
it appears with a minus sign.

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:22.810
That's different from
springs and masses

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.510
simply because the sign
conventions, you could say.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.480
OK, there is the equation.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.890
OK, fine.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.090
So that's what
you have to solve.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.760
And actually I think of that
as the fundamental problem

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.310
of numerical analysis.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.170
How to solve that equation.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.010
More effort, more thinking
goes into that than probably

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.560
any other single problem.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.150
In some form.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:52.030
OK, and here's some
part of that thinking.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.100
Part of that thinking, and
another important possibility,

00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:00.840
is to keep-- This was like the
one equation, the one field

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.470
problem, this corresponds
to the displacement method.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:11.940
Can I use words that I'm
not going to use seriously

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:17.120
for another few weeks?

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.030
This would correspond to
the displacement method

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.640
in finite elements.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.710
In FEM, FEM for
finite element method.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.880
That's the displacement
method, it's the method

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.800
that that most people use.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.040
It's the standard method.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.910
OK.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.410
But it's not the
only possibility,

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.860
and let me show you a second
one that involves two equations.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.380
Because that's also
very important,

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.860
with many other applications,
that we will see but

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.110
haven't seen yet.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:54.320
So my two equations, I really
should say two systems,

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.330
because one equation, that's
a vector equation of course.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.480
So I have a system of two
vector equations, that

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.820
would go into a block
matrix and you'll see it.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:11.170
OK, so what what two
unknowns am I going to keep?

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.880
u, I'm keeping.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.530
Displacement, I'm keeping.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.770
But I'm also going
to keep what I

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.120
think of as the other
important unknown, w.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.500
So the other important
unknown is w.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.810
So now I have two
equations and one of them

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.700
is just that, is
just the current,

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.110
is just the current law, the
balance law A transpose w equal

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.610
f.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:39.480
The only guy I'm
eliminating is e.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:45.910
Initially you could say I've a
three field system. u, e and w.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:50.090
Now, e and w are
so easily connected

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:53.850
that I'm going to eliminate
e. e is c inverse w.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.240
I did it actually here.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.610
This w is C(b-Au),
that's we know.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:06.680
If I multiply by the C inverse,
then I have C inverse w is,

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.900
and I bring the Au over to the
far left and I have only the b

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.670
left.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:19.200
Everybody saw that, I
did a C inverse there

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:26.330
to get e off by itself and
then I substituted for e,

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.420
I put in the u part
so e's now gone,

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:40.540
and the equation is C
inverse w plus Au equals b.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:46.090
That's my two field system.

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:50.920
Now, there's a matrix here.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.187
This is really nice.

00:42:53.187 --> 00:42:54.270
I just want to write that.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:57.520
I've got to what I want but
now I want to look at it.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:04.190
So I think of a two by two
block matrix multiplying [w, u]

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:07.590
and giving me [b, f].

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:10.460
And I want to ask you
about that matrix.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:17.290
So this is the matrix for
when I've only eliminated e

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:21.340
and I've still got
w as well as u.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:26.850
OK, you can read off
what's in that matrix.

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:28.870
What goes up here?

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.650
C inverse, of course.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.210
Positive diagonal, usually.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.060
Easy.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.980
What goes here is a rectangular,
that guy is rectangular.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.830
A transpose is multiplying
w, so it goes down here,

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:47.750
and this equation
has no u in it.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:55.190
That matrix is worth noticing.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.410
And let's spend the rest of
this, the remaining minutes,

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.320
just to think about that matrix.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.930
I just want to say,
what if I keep w and u,

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:08.710
this is an important
possibility.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:12.820
And it's important in finite
elements which as you know

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:17.010
is just a terrific way to
solve a whole lot of continuum

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:18.100
problems.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:23.470
And what's it called when
I have w and u together,

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:27.040
both unknowns, not
eliminating w now,

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.020
it's called the mixed method.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:36.580
So this corresponds to the
mixed method in finite elements.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:45.420
It corresponds to the
possibility of keeping w and u.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.490
Well, and you might
say, wait, isn't there

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:50.690
a third possibility?

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:52.670
And what would that be?

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:56.430
Keep only w.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.670
Here we kept only u,
here we've got them both,

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:07.570
this is kind of the mother
of all equilibrium equations.

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.570
And another possibly
would be to keep

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.670
only the w's, to make the
currents the primary unknowns.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:19.620
And that, in the finite
element structural context,

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.590
that would be saying
make the stresses.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:25.885
So of course it'd be
called the stress method.

00:45:25.885 --> 00:45:27.260
It'd be called
the stress method,

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:31.660
and Professor Pian in
Course 16, now retired,

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.000
was one of the major developers
of the stress method.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.960
The difficulty with
the stress method,

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:41.330
the reason it
didn't win big time,

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:46.375
is that the w's, if you make
them the unknowns you've got

00:45:46.375 --> 00:45:49.970
a constraint on them,
Kirchhoff's-- Not all w's are

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.230
allowed.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.510
Somehow over here
all u's are allowed,

00:45:55.510 --> 00:46:00.830
and that made it much easier
to set up the problem.

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:05.320
So the displacement method
is the 95 percent winner.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:10.400
But there are problems where
maybe C inverse is complicated,

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.530
or C is too
complicated and you're

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:18.540
better to-- We can see that.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.470
That's later in the
book, but we want

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:24.400
to see now about that matrix.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.970
Well, if I wrote
that matrix down,

00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:32.080
and let me write just so
you-- I want to ask you

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.070
about that block matrix.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.840
What's its size?

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.260
Now just focus entirely
on that block matrix,

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.460
because that's
what I care about.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.300
What's the size of that matrix?

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.790
Let's see, what's the
size of C? m by m.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.740
What's the size of A? n by n.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.840
So what do I have here?

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.470
I've got n rows and
m plus n columns,

00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:59.680
and there's n more rows.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.310
It's of size m+n.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.760
It's got the n
u's and the m w's.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.910
Of course, m+n.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:12.890
And the natural size, right.

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.500
So it's got more
unknowns but we'll

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.880
see, oh in
optimization you bring

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.050
in Lagrange multipliers, that's
just exactly parallel to what

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.070
we're doing here.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.080
You have more, you have
extra bunch of unknowns.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.460
That's what we have.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:32.190
Now what else about that matrix?

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:35.880
I was going to write down
a very, very tiny model

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.800
for that matrix.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.220
I'll just make it two by two.

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:44.830
Here's a model for that
matrix where C is just a one

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.560
and A is just a one.

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.000
I mean, it's kind
of laughable, right?

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.190
That model, this
is the real thing.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:48:00.330
But it gives you an
example to check against.

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:04.250
OK, what's a property
of that matrix?

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.070
It's, again?

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:06.880
Symmetric.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.610
Good.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:09.820
That's a symmetric matrix.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.360
Because what happens if I
transpose that block matrix?

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:18.700
That A block will flip
over here as A transpose,

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.310
the A transpose block
will flip up there

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:26.050
as A, what happens to
the C inverse block?

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:28.520
C is a symmetric guy.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.900
In fact, it was just
diagonal in our imagination.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:37.110
The key point is it's symmetric,
its inverse is symmetric,

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:39.320
its transpose is the same.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.200
So that's a symmetric matrix.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.450
That's a good thing, right?

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:49.270
Now we've got a matrix that's
symmetric, square symmetric.

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:53.490
OK, what's my other
question about that matrix?

00:48:53.490 --> 00:49:00.570
Is it or is it not
positive definite, right?

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.510
We've got to answer
that question.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:06.040
Have we got a positive
definite matrix?

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.830
Would all the
pivots be positive?

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.990
Would the eigenvalues
be positive?

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:15.970
What's your guess?

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:16.790
No.

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.160
That matrix is not positive.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.440
No way that a matrix
with a zero there,

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.740
a zero block, or that
matrix with a zero number

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.060
could be positive definite.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.210
No, no way.

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:39.770
The energy in this guy, this
u transpose Au, you remember,

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:46.280
would be u_1 squared
and u_1*u_2, twice.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:50.040
And no u_2 squareds.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:55.300
And that thing is
definitely indefinite.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:59.050
Right?

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:01.840
In the u_1 direction
it looks good,

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.800
that's things positive there.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.070
But if I took u_1 and u_2
to have opposite signs,

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:11.470
and made u_2 big
enough then of course

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:12.650
this just brings it down.

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:16.030
So the graph of that
would be a saddle point.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:18.170
The graph of that
would be a saddle.

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:26.040
OK, and now here I have the
same thing on an m+n size.

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:26.920
So what do I have?

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.890
Actually, you could see.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:34.120
The last exercise is mentally
do elimination on that matrix.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.160
Mentally do elimination
on that matrix.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:42.910
So start with the first m rows.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.000
We'll work with those first.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.090
What will elimination do,
what will the pivots be like,

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:51.460
what will happen at the
beginning of elimination?

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:55.790
When I start with this matrix?

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:59.430
Well it meets C inverse right
away, that diagonal matrix,

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:00.850
and it's extremely happy.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.300
Those will be the pivots, right?

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.740
They're sitting
on the diagonals,

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.510
zero off the diagonals.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:09.460
They'll be positive pivots, I'll
have m positive pivots here.

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:15.740
And then I get down to where
A comes in the picture.

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:20.800
So on the last board here,
let me just copy this matrix,

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:25.320
[C inverse, A; A transpose, 0].

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.210
An elimination is going to,
it'll be very happy with that.

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:35.570
But it's going to put, so
it's happy with that row.

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:36.660
Block row.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:41.130
It's going to do an elimination
to get a bunch of zeroes there

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:45.740
and what did it do?

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.310
This was elimination,
this was subtracting,

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:50.700
yeah what did it subtract here?

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:55.080
It multiplied these
pivot rows by something

00:51:55.080 --> 00:52:01.270
and subtracted from these lower
rows and got the zero block.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.130
And what did it multiply by?

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.480
What do I multiply that
block row, and this

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.730
is a perfect, perfect exercise
to see how blocks are just

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:12.880
like numbers.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.110
You can deal with them.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.230
What do I multiply
that block row by

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:22.880
and subtract from the
row below to get a zero.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.090
You said C A transpose, but
I don't think that's it.

00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:31.100
A transpose C. You've got to
multiply by A transpose C.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.690
First of all, C A transpose
wouldn't be a possibility.

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:35.970
Wrong shapes.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:42.210
A transpose C is the four
by five, five by five guy.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:45.470
So you multiply A transpose
C, that cancels that,

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.720
leaves the A transpose, when you
subtract it gives you a zero,

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.100
and what does it give you there?

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:55.310
What shows up there?

00:52:55.310 --> 00:53:00.710
A transpose C multiplies
at A, subtracts

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:04.780
so it's actually what shows up
there is minus A transpose C

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.200
A. Let me write it in there.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.980
Minus A transpose
C A. So that matrix

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.880
is exactly what
comes from this one.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.870
It's exactly what we
do when we eliminate w.

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:18.250
That's what elimination is.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:21.400
I just eliminated w by
getting a zero there.

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.500
And I got only an equation,
but notice the minus.

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:32.030
So, final question, what are
the signs of the last n pivots?

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:35.370
The first m were all positive,
and they were sitting

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.120
on the diagonal already.

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.430
The last n are not
so easy to see,

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:44.860
but we can see what
sign they have.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.390
And what sign do the
last n pivots have?

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:50.090
Minus.

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:53.160
Because they come from
a negative definite.

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.850
Minus A transpose C
A is shown up there.

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:58.630
So that's the saddle point.

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:03.230
Saddle points are, when you
have two-field problems,

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:05.680
you're talking
about saddle points,

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:09.590
and the mixed method in finite
elements is exactly that.

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:17.420
And the tricky part is
then with the mixed method,

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.800
you're sort of not so
perfectly guaranteed

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.980
that the matrix is invertible.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:26.210
Because we have plus
stuff and minus stuff.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:28.620
OK, thank you, that's great.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:33.830
And I'll see you Monday all
about the exam and review,

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:36.310
it's a great chance
to think back.
