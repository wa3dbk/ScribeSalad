00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.400
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.750
So this is lecture 22,
gradient and divergence,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.400
headed for Laplace's equation.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.940
So the gradient will
be our operator A;

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.480
the divergence, or
minus the divergence,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.570
will be A transpose,
and then A transpose A

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.860
will be the Laplacian.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.980
We get to Laplace's
equation Wednesday.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.930
Today I wanted to
take them separately.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.080
To understand the
meaning of gradient,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.350
the meaning of divergence,
the connection between them.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.180
I mentioned at the
end of last time

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.690
that one is the transpose of the
other, or minus the transpose.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560
I'll try to keep
gradient on this side,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.300
and if I could only
transpose the blackboard,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.220
I could do divergence-- I'll
do divergence on that side.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.450
And I guess if I could
get a rotating blackboard,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.100
right in the middle
I could do curl.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.290
That would be
perfect. [LAUGHTER]

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.790
OK.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.260
So some of this will
not be new to you.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.020
But maybe some of the insights
or the ways of looking at it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840
could be new.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.960
This is the background
of vector calculus.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.710
So we have things
like vector fields.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.221
That means I have a vector
[v 1, v 2] at each point (x,

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:44.720
y).

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.170
So I could draw a little
arrow at every point

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.550
to show the direction and
magnitude of that vector.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.320
I have a field of vectors.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.730
OK, so.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.310
From last time,
our basic setup is,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.070
the gradient is this
first operator, A. The one

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.900
we see at the beginning.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.840
One change.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.360
Instead of calling the result
e, let me connect to velocity.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.010
I'll be thinking of
u as a potential,

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.800
I'll use the word potential for
u, and I'll use v instead of e

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.900
for the velocity component.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.810
So that's the A.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.300
And then on the other
side, I start with a w.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.590
Again, it's a vector field,
it's actually a momentum.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.820
Very often the step between
here and here, well most often,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.150
the step between here and
here will be the identity.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.110
That's what gives
Laplace's equation.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.260
So you'll have to watch,
I'm sometimes confusing

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.720
the v's with the w's.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.290
Because when I go to Laplace's
equation and c is the identity,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.820
they're the same.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.780
But I would like, today, to
try to keep this left side

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.450
separate, the gradient, from
the right side, the divergence.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.460
And understand what they mean,
and how to work with them.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.420
And of course, a big connection
is the divergence theorem,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.800
or the Gauss-Green
connection, identity.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.940
We'll get to that.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.920
OK, gradient first.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.090
First, what does it mean?

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.790
If I have a function u, what
does its gradient tell me?

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.030
And then the second is kind
of a backwards question.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.480
Suppose I have the v. Is
it the gradient of some u?

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.740
So one direction from u to
v, and the second direction

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.560
will be from v back
to u when possible.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.610
OK, meaning of the gradient.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.640
So the gradient is
just the obvious thing,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.000
the two derivatives in
the x and y direction.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.580
So of course the gradient
gives you the rate of change,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.730
the partial derivatives of u.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.550
But how do you see
that in a picture?

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.470
Let me draw an important curve.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.510
I'll start with a very simple u.
u is x squared plus y squared.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.120
So that's my example.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.330
Example one.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.860
And what I've drawn is
an equipotential curve.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.980
Or isopotential might be a more
appropriate word these days,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.690
but we still say equipotential.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.540
It means that, along this
curve, u is a constant.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.150
And for this
particular potential,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:59.000
this simple one to work with,
x squared plus y squared,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.950
the curve is a circle.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.860
So the curve would be a circle.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.020
OK, now what do I learn
by taking the gradient?

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.680
So the gradient of u -- this
is my v -- is the x derivative,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.130
which is 2x, and the y
derivative, which is 2y.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.630
OK.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.930
Let me take a typical
point on the curve

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.800
and draw that gradient vector.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.990
So this is the xy-plane, this
is the curve u equal constant.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.840
When I have a curve
u equal constant

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.850
and I draw the gradient
of u, where does it point?

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.940
This is the first
and most important

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.360
simple idea about
the gradient vector.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.610
The gradient vector points--
Does the gradient vector point,

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.730
could it point any old way?

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.780
No.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.370
The gradient vector is
perpendicular to the curve.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.030
And we can see that,
for this simple example,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.650
that vector [2x, 2y], that's
a vector radially outwards,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.310
right?

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.490
If here's the origin,
and if, at this point --

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.165
I don't know its coordinates,
whatever they are, maybe (2,

00:06:20.165 --> 00:06:25.750
1) or something -- the gradient
vector would be [4, 2].

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.950
It would be a multiple-- Here's
the position vector, [x, y].

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.660
The point is, the gradient
vector points out.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.600
Perpendicular to the curve.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.900
That's what the
gradient tells you.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.720
It tells you, in
this situation it's

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.170
telling me which direction is
perpendicular to the curve.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.290
Now how do I understand that?

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.230
How do I see that?

00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:01.120
I think of this-- Let me try
to draw the whole surface,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.580
u equal x plus y squared.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.070
What would that whole
surface look like?

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:13.780
Let me try to put that picture--
This is a 2-D picture right

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.290
now.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.440
It's sort of a cross-section.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.810
Let me put this 2-D picture
into a 3-D picture to see.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.290
So the 3-D picture is a
picture of the whole surface. u

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.840
going up, x and y going around.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.510
And what kind of a curve,
what kind of a surface

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:37.160
do I have for that function,
x squared plus y squared?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.360
Well, it grows, right?

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.960
It's sort of, I
use the word bowl.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.430
And we've seen it before.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.990
It sort of goes
up, right, and it

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.060
goes up faster and faster as I
go out, because of the squares.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.610
And now what I want
to do is, suppose

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.360
I take the cross-section,
suppose I take this bowl.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.840
Do you see a
beautiful bowl there?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.370
And now, I cut through it,
horizontal cross-section,

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.690
at the height c.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.750
What do I get if I take
this surface in 3-D,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:31.090
and I cut through it by a plane,
the plane at that height, c.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:37.270
So if the plane went through
there, that distance was c.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.610
It cuts out a cross-section
out of the bowl.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.040
And what's the cross-section?

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.020
It's the circle.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.690
It's this one.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:53.030
So out of the bowl, this plane
is cutting this cross-section.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.670
This is height u equal constant.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.030
So I'm really intersecting
one surface, the plane u

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.650
equal constant, with the bowl.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.400
And the intersection of those
two is the equipotential,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.570
the curve u=c.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.530
Right?

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.610
You see the two pictures?

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.740
And now, what does the gradient
tell me in that picture?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.170
What does the gradient of
u tell me in that picture?

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.240
Over here, it pointed
outwards, but now we're

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.690
going to kind of see why.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:35.330
So, it pointed outwards
for this nice function u.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.420
I could have made a
more general function u,

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.940
but let me just stay
with this simple one.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.380
So suppose I'm climbing.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.490
This is like, I'm climbing
out of a volcano or something.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.740
Usually, I would say a
mountain, but the way

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.280
I've drawn the thing, it's
not much of a mountain.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.120
So OK, volcano.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.050
Climbing out of it.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:06.370
And I got up to this point,
which was this point.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.040
Now, what does the
gradient tell me?

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.750
That when I'm climbing away,
I reach -- duh duh duh duh --

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.000
I get up to here.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.780
What does the gradient tell me?

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.690
It tells me which way to go.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.980
It tells me the steepest
direction upwards,

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.040
and it tells me how steep.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.980
Right.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.440
So it tells me those two
things, direction and magnitude.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:33.260
Direction is, well for
this special function

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.700
you know the direction is,
like, straight outwards,

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.540
straight upwards.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.510
And how steep is it?

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:45.230
What's the steepness?

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.050
It's the size of, it's the
magnitude of this vector,

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.480
grad u.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:11:02.270
Which is the-- This is not--
How big is this vector?

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.770
This is my vector grad u.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.260
This is another shorthand
notation for gradient.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:17.330
The size of that vector is
the square root of what?

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.730
The length of a vector
is the square root

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.050
of the sum of the squares.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.550
So I have the length of v is
the square root of 4 x squared

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:31.070
plus 4 y squared.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.970
OK.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.750
Now, it gets steeper
and steeper, of course.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:45.350
The cross-sections here
would be all circles

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.910
for this simple function.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.420
And the gradients would
keep pointing out,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:58.230
and we'd have a function that
comes from a surface like that.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.790
OK, this is what I wanted to say
about question one, the meaning

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.110
of the gradient.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.960
The thing to remember, if you
remember the two pictures,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.450
you've really got
the idea of what

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.940
the gradient is telling you.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.220
For a function of one
variable, the derivative

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.870
is telling you the slope.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.680
Well, we've got slopes in the
x direction, slopes in the y

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.740
direction, and the
gradient direction

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.300
tells us the steepest slope.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:34.300
And it tells us, yeah,
tells us what that slope is.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.020
OK, so much for the
meaning of the gradient.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.040
Now, backwards.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.490
Suppose I have v.
Because these gradient

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.560
fields are extremely important.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.360
I mean, they're
wonderful fields.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:57.760
If you've got a v_1 and a v_2
that is the gradient of some u,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.200
you want to know that.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.080
I mean, that's good news.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.630
Most fields will not.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:10.630
So let's figure out, when is--
Can I lift that up now, and do

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.100
the other gradient thing now?

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:22.060
Or maybe I'll put the final
gradient blackboard here,

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.760
and then make way
for divergence.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.260
OK, so I'm asking
now question two.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.250
I'm given v_1 and
v_2, and I want

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:39.110
this to be du/dx for some u,
and I want this to be du/dy.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.640
So I've got two equations.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.930
If I'm looking for u.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.230
Remember, I'm now starting
with these, looking for the u.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.230
OK.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.130
So, am I going to find Au?

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:00.870
Am I going to find a function
u, whose x derivative

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:07.180
is my v_1 that was given, and
the y derivative is my v_2?

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.600
Well, chances are not good.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.100
Right?

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.740
I've got two equations
here, but only one unknown.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.430
So generally, it's like
a rectangular system.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.170
Usually there's no solution,
but sometimes there is.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:28.200
So we have to find out, what's
the test for consistency

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.050
for these to have a solution?

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:39.330
And this brings us right
away to the key identity

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.300
from partial derivatives.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.940
OK.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.460
Can you see some
condition that has

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.310
to-- How can I connect
these two equations,

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.930
and therefore
connect v_1 and v_2?

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.360
That'll be the test for
weather-- You could say,

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.930
in matrix language, I'm
asking whether [v 1, v 2] is

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.320
in the column space
of the gradient.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.850
Is it something I can get
from this tall thin matrix?

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:21.660
OK, they key idea is take the y
derivative of that equation, d

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.440
second u/dydx.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.400
And take the x derivative of
this equation. dv_2 dy-- dx,

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.100
is the second derivative
of u, with respect

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.210
to-- the x derivative
of the y derivative.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.540
OK.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:45.640
So it's like I'm operating
on the equations.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.260
I'm doing what
I'm allowed to do,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.590
I'm doing the same thing to
both sides of each equation.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.060
Now I'm going to eliminate.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.020
And what am I going to find?

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.430
What's the key point here?

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.710
The key, key point
about second derivatives

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.340
is that that equals that.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.310
Right?

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.690
Take any function.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.130
Do we want to practice
with a function,

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.990
just to see it be true?

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.360
Take, let u be x cubed y.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.300
Just for the heck of it.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.500
OK, I don't know what--
Is that going to produce

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.440
anything interesting?

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.760
Then maybe I'd better
make it y squared.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.240
I don't know why I'm doing this,
it just is like an example,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.770
to make it believable.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:33.380
OK, so du/dx, u_x, is --
and I'll often use u sub x

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.070
as a sort of shorthand
-- will be what?

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.390
3x squared y squared.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.830
And u_y, taking the
y derivative is just,

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.270
x is constant, 2x cubed y.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:53.560
And now let me do u_xy,
the y derivative of this.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.500
Which is what?

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.490
It's been a long weekend,
but hey, we can do these.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:05.290
The y derivative of that is
going to be 6x squared y.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:09.100
And the x derivative
of this is going to be,

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:15.210
so I should say y-- I've
got the y derivative

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.500
and now I should take
the x derivative of that.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.230
And what do I get?

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:25.270
The x derivative of
that is 6x squared y.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.830
And look!

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:27.680
They're the same.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.380
Hooray.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.010
OK.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:36.160
So if the function is smooth
and has these derivatives,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.140
they'll come out the same.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.620
And therefore, so
what do I conclude?

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:48.310
What's the test on v_1
and v_2 that it must

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.930
pass to be a gradient field?

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.820
For there to be a function u,
that solves these equations.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.000
These are solvable
only when what?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.900
Well, if these are the same,
these have to be the same.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:11.552
So it's solvable only
when-- I need dv_2/dx -

00:18:11.552 --> 00:18:19.140
dv_1/dy to be what?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.810
Zero.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:21.670
OK.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.080
That's the conclusion.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.390
Those have to be the same.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.460
dv_2/dx - dv_1/dy
has to be zero.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.990
OK.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.420
Because those are the same.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.520
I guess I came to this early
because it's the key identity

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.140
of vector calculus.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.140
Well, the key identity
behind vector calculus

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:51.510
is this fact about
the derivatives.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:58.790
Can I just throw out a question
that you might think about?

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.510
We already have seen, so often
now, the second derivative,

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.570
like v_xx.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.090
Or u_xx, suppose.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.940
So here's a little
question to think about.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.710
So think.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.030
OK.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.170
I just want to bring
finite differences

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:26.930
in for a moment. u_xx
we've got a handle on.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:33.150
We know that that's like u at
x+h -- and if there was a y,

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:40.970
put in the y -- minus 2u at x
-- and I can put in a y there --

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.210
plus u at x-h, y.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.900
We've seen that.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.140
That'll be the x derivative,
second x derivative-- sorry,

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.530
second x difference.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.280
Since we're taking x
derivatives and x differences,

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.350
it's x that moves,
and y doesn't move.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.640
Just the central idea
of partial derivatives.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.000
u_yy will be similar
with y moving.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.470
And my question to you is -- and
we could have asked it way way

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.690
back -- what's a finite
difference approximation

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:23.190
to u_xy, to the
cross derivative?

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:27.630
That equals what?

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.940
I want to go to
finite differences.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:39.260
OK, what finite differences?

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.790
Which finite differences?

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.440
Maybe that's a question
to think about.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.820
If I can remember,
I'll include it just

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:55.130
as a small homework question for
the homework on this material.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.570
So that's looking
ahead, really, today.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.440
We're not making
things discrete.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.780
We're in continuous x and y.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.090
We have vector fields.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:20.440
And we now know the test
for a gradient field.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.190
I'm tempted to use
the word curl here.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.100
I'm tempted to
use the word curl.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.275
I want to connect that test --
may I use the word curl without

00:21:32.275 --> 00:21:39.170
-- and I'll say why I'm not
going to do everything properly

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.710
with curl right away.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.200
I would describe this as curl.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:51.820
The test is, the curl
of v has to be zero.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:22:01.080
So for me, that's the curl of v.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.790
You're going to
say, wait a minute.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.040
I learned about curl, and that
doesn't look like the curl

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.650
to me.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.390
So I'll say wait another minute.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.160
It's not that far off.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.090
OK, what's your objection?

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.230
Your objection is that the curl
is in three-dimensional space.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.490
Right?

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.580
When you saw curl,
and of course it

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.580
comes in this
section of the book,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.850
we had functions of x, y, z.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:39.300
And the curl had
three components.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.035
And those three components--
Do you remember curl?

00:22:42.035 --> 00:22:44.160
I mean, if you remember
curl, you're a good person.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.800
Because it's got
this-- You sort of

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.580
remember that it has
things like this.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.110
Right?

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:00.100
Sort of, differences of
derivatives, and the indices

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.250
follow a certain pattern.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.300
I'm saying that this
is the natural--

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.280
this is the curl in a plane.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.350
What do I mean by
the curl in a plane?

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:23.211
So in 3-D, v has components
of v_1, v_2, and v_3.

00:23:23.211 --> 00:23:23.710
Right?

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.830
That depend on x, y, z.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:33.540
In the plane, in 3-D, I
have a vector field v, which

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.260
has components v_1, v_2, v_3.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.820
All depending on x, y, z.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:45.550
That's the general 3-D picture,
where you usually see the curl.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.350
Now, in the plane,
what's happening?

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.930
In the plane, we
have two components.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.290
So what's happening?

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.460
Think of this.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.520
So in 3-D, our velocity
field is like, the flow

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.920
is going all over the place.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.530
Right?

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.910
It's a three-dimensional flow.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:11.750
But now suppose my flow
stays in the plane.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:18.200
So in 2-D-- so now I have
to put 2-D up above here.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:26.280
So in 2-D, a plane field is
what I'm working with today.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.080
My v is some v_1(x,y).

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:37.870
No z, no dependence
on z. v_2(x,y),

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.290
the y direction of the
velocity doesn't depend on z,

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.300
because this is a plane
field, same on every plane.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.730
And the third component
of this plane field,

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:52.060
the velocity perpendicular
in the z direction, is zero.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.140
OK.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:53.960
Zero.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.850
So what I want to
say is that if I

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:03.790
look, if I specialize to plane
fields, to fields like these,

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:08.970
then the only component of the
curl that survives is this one.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.680
See, the other components of
the curl, which I'm not even

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.860
writing down-- the other
components of a curl

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.130
have derivatives of
v_3, but v_3 is zero.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.510
And they also have derivatives
of these guys with respect

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.310
to z.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.270
But they don't depend on z.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.610
So that's why all the
other pieces of the curl,

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.820
like, are automatically
zero for a plane field.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.040
So that the only
component that's

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.040
significant-- The test curl
v equals zero boils down

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.990
to a test not on three
things, but just on one.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.230
And that's the one.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:50.365
So because I want to
stay mostly with plane

00:25:50.365 --> 00:25:52.650
fields and
two-dimensional problems,

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:57.490
I just had to comment that, if
the curl was to get in here,

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.790
it would fit fine.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.770
And if I restrict the curl to
the fields I'm working with,

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.190
plane fields, then there's
only one component I'll

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.180
have to think about,
it has to be zero

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.950
to have a gradient field.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.830
OK, now I guess I should
just do an example or two.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.170
Can I give you a
v_1 and v_2, and you

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.870
tell me, is it a gradient field
or is it not a gradient field.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:27.330
Let me give you a different,
let me just change these guys.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:33.270
Suppose I change
that to y and x.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:39.730
So there is a v, a different
v. That's a vector field.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:44.400
At every point x, y,
I've got a little vector.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.160
I could try, even, to draw them.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.970
And I'm going to ask you,
is it the gradient of any u.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.620
And if it is, what's that u?

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.120
So let me show you what
I mean by a vector field.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:03.710
I mean, at a typical point
like x=1, y=0, the vector--

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:07.920
Let's see, if x is
one and y is zero,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:19.300
then what's the gradient at
that point? [0, 2], am I right?

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.590
I won't draw it too
big, or you won't

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.100
be able to see a darn thing.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:31.710
OK, what about at
the point (1, 1)?

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:37.590
Which way is my vector
field going? [2, 2].

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.960
So what's that look like?

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.050
Plotting the vector field
v at a bunch of points.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:51.790
So you get like a
map of little arrows.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.260
So here it would go that way.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.430
Is that right?

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.840
Huh.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.350
I wasn't expecting
that, to tell the truth.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:05.330
Let's see, so can I get
in some more points?

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:06.650
Let's see.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.110
What if I have there.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.000
What's-- At (1/2, 0).

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.770
Then, v is [0, 1].

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.160
Where is this flow going?

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.680
See, if the point is
along this line, where

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:34.230
y is equal to x, then the flow
was going out along this line.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.070
Can you give me some
other point here,

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.420
just so we get some
handle on this?

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.090
There's the point
(2, 1), let's say.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.860
Let me put it over a little bit.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.460
How about the point (2, 1)?

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.920
What's the vector if
I just want to draw --

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.500
I'm just drawing here.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.290
And of course, code would do
it much better than I'm doing.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.580
(2, 1), that gives
me [2, 4], right?

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:04.870
So [2, 4] is over two
and up, it's like this.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:10.630
I think -- but I
don't swear to it --

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.450
that if I connect
all this-- See,

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.900
now you have to take
a big leap of faith.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.670
Imagine, like, at every point
we've got these little arrows,

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:24.340
and I want to connect them up.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.510
Let me do something.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.970
I'll do that, but let me
come back to the question

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.130
I should have asked you first.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:35.420
Is this a gradient field?

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.730
Does it satisfy the curl zero
condition that we put in a box

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:40.820
here?

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:45.930
Does that satisfy dv-- There
is v_2 and there's v_1.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:54.210
Is dv_2/dx, whatever that test
was, minus dv_1/dy equal zero?

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.180
Yes, no?

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:05.010
Yes, right? dv_2/dx is
two, and dv_1/dy is two.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:09.070
So what's the conclusion then?

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.900
It satisfied my
little test, so this

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.590
must be the gradient of some u.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:18.720
Right?

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.590
That's the question we have.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.960
Which vector fields-- And we
found that this is one of them,

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.300
it passes the test.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.790
It's the gradient of some u.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.920
What's the u?

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.790
What's the function u,
which is supposed to exist,

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.630
whose gradient is that.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:38.800
2xy.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.610
Did everybody spot that one?

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:41.120
2xy.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:48.060
Because the x
derivative has to be 2y.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.080
So I just integrate
with respect to x.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.050
This is the x derivative.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.080
It's 2y.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.640
Take the integral with
respect to x, and I get 2xy.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:05.250
And there could be some term
that depended only on y.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:11.530
Anyway, this works.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:21.900
I think that this, maybe
gives me somehow-- Oh, yeah.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.810
What's the
equipotential curve now?

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:28.690
Oh, yeah, this picture's
going to come together.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:34.100
What is the equipotential
curve for this potential?

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.370
It was a circle for the first
guy, but circles are out now.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.760
I changed v. I've got a
new potential function.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:50.310
And now I want to draw, in
this graph, the equipotentials.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.430
Suppose u is one.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:32:00.180
Suppose I draw the curve
2xy=1 in that picture.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.830
What kind of a curve is it?

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.870
Do you recognize this?

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.550
The Greeks would.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.790
Recognize 2xy=1.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.690
Or you could say y=1/(2x).

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:14.890
That gives you a quick
handle on the curve.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.420
It comes down like that.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.740
Right?

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.290
And what's the Greek
name for that curve?

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.930
Oh, come on.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.960
It's a hyperbola.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.370
It's a hyperbola.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.190
Hyperbolas-- You
remember the Greeks,

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.290
they had these conic sections.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.340
They had ellipses, they had
parabolas, the marginal case,

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.340
and then they had hyperbolas.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.240
And they all come from
second degree things.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:54.740
If I have a x squared and 2bxy
and c y squared equal one,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.530
that's one of those curves.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:01.345
And if it was x squared
plus y squared equal one,

00:33:01.345 --> 00:33:02.750
it was a circle.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.410
If it was x squared plus
7y squared equal one,

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:11.030
it would be an ellipse.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:15.430
The positive definite-- It all
comes down to linear algebra,

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.040
of course.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.870
If that little matrix
is positive definite,

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.650
so that means a
and c are positive,

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.680
and ac is bigger
than b squared, you

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.950
know the test for
positive definite.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.290
What kind of curve
do the Greeks have?

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.570
What kind of equipotential--
What kind of a curve have we

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.730
got here?

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.750
An ellipse.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.500
If this curve, if
that little matrix

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:48.710
is indefinite, as,
for example, here.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:53.590
So with this one, what would be
the matrix, what's the matrix

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:58.210
that goes with 2xy, if
I match this with this.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:59.300
That's the matrix.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.170
There's no a squareds,
there's no x squareds,

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.350
there's no y squareds.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:08.700
And there are 2xy's, I
think the matrix is that.

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.690
So it's this nice
symmetric matrix.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.760
Is that a positive
definite matrix?

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.570
Certainly not.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:17.590
It's indefinite.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.380
It's eigenvalues are
plus one and minus one,

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.550
adding to the trace zero.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:29.540
So indefinite matrices
correspond to hyperbolas.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.970
And later on,
definite matrices will

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:36.170
correspond to elliptic partial
differential equations.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:39.330
And indefinite
matrices-- Like Laplace.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.950
And indefinite matrices
will correspond

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:45.780
to hyperbolic partial
differential equations,

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.180
like the wave equation.

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.930
What's the-- Now we're here.

00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:54.840
I didn't expect to get here.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.740
What's the marginal case?

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.550
What's the marginal case
between positive definite

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:04.100
and indefinite is...?

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.130
Semidefinite.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:05.860
Great.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.610
And what kind of a
curve do you think

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:12.670
comes when this little
matrix is semidefinite.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:18.010
It's the one in between
ellipses and hyperbolas.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:23.551
The marginal guy is a parabola.

00:35:23.551 --> 00:35:24.050
Right.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.480
So semidefinite would
correspond to a parabola.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.010
Right.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.690
OK.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:29.190
Good.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:35.210
Anyway, all I was going
to say is, this u=2xy,

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.040
that's our potential.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:43.530
If I draw equipotential
curves, they're hyperbolas.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.880
And now, what's the point about
these little arrows that I got

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:53.790
started on.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.850
What was the very first point
about the answer to the meaning

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.600
of the gradient was what?

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:07.730
These are the gradients of u,
so those arrows point where?

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.990
Perpendicular to the hyperbolas.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:12.950
Perpendicular to the hyperbola.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:19.300
We're trying to see the geometry
-- its beautiful geometry --

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.760
behind the gradient.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:29.630
So if v is a gradient,
then it comes from some u.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:33.410
I can plot the u equal
constant, the equipotential,

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:36.680
and then the gradients
will be perpendicular.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:42.130
So they really are
a little-- OK, good.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.870
OK, those are pieces
of information

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:51.560
that you have, but
always need saying again.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.930
And to get the picture
in your mind-- I suppose,

00:36:54.930 --> 00:37:01.660
finally, I should choose a
v which is not a gradient.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.030
Just to finish.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.450
How shall I adjust that v?

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.980
This v was a gradient.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.260
Can you just change
it a little bit --

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:15.650
practically anything you
do will screw it up --

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.030
to make it not a gradient?

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:23.150
So I just changed this two,
what shall I change the two to?

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:26.710
To three.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.830
That would totally foul it up.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:32.120
So that vector field, which
I could draw little pictures

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.570
of, but there would be no
u that it's coming from.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.800
There would be no u.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.080
These little arrows would
not line up perpendicular

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.630
to some beautiful curves.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.190
I don't get a u from that.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:50.870
Because the y derivative
of that is three,

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.630
and it doesn't equal the
x derivative of that.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.950
So that's a no-good one.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.250
Let's go back to the good one.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.470
OK.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.400
OK, good.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.450
Is that OK for gradients?

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.660
We got the meaning of gradients.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.620
They point perpendicular
to equipotentials.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.170
They tell how
steeply those-- They

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.470
tell the separation between
the equipotentials, right.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.680
It's like, if you're
a mountain climber,

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.190
you're looking at your
map, your contour map,

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.020
and that's all I'm drawing here.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.160
I'm drawing a contour
map that every guy who

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.030
goes climbing in New
Hampshire is going to have.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:33.880
And it shows little circles,
those are level heights, right?

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.600
Those are level contours.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.700
And if you want to climb
as fast as possible,

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.070
you go perpendicular
to those contours.

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:46.290
And the distance
between contours

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.950
tells you how steep it is.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.370
So it's all nice geometry.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:53.040
OK.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.900
I've got to get to
divergence here.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.390
Divergence.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.370
I should have said
though-- Damn.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.990
There's more to say
about gradients.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:17.170
That question of whether
[v 1, v 2], the vector field,

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.510
is this question.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.970
The question of is it
the gradient of some u.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.300
So we now have a test.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:28.070
We now have a test.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:32.840
This is our test, right?

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.320
That's our test.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:41.190
But I have to connect it
with Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.790
Do you remember, we
haven't talked so much

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:45.680
about Kirchhoff's
voltage law, but I'm

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.610
connecting it with
the discrete case,

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:51.900
to add in a little more insight.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.170
What did Kirchhoff's
voltage law say?

00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:01.860
In that case, A was
a difference matrix.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.070
It was the incidence
matrix for our graph.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:12.550
And the question was-- I
have to take two moments

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.270
to think about that.

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:20.090
So Kirchhoff's voltage
law, for a graph.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:22.380
A is an incidence matrix.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:30.020
You know, the minus one, one
guys, one for every edge?

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:38.130
And let me call
it v again, or e.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.630
I called it e at that time.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:44.820
Let's just look at an x.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.320
Right.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:58.920
A is this long thin matrix,
times-- sorry, u's. u's.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.800
Let me say it all at once.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.950
Which vectors have the form Au?

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:13.500
Which vectors are combinations
of the columns of A?

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:18.980
The test is,
Kirchhoff's voltage law,

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:23.220
that if I go around any
loop in the graph --

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:31.060
so if I have a u_1 here, u_2
here, u_5 here, and u_7 here --

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.900
then Au will produce
u_1-u_7 on that edge.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.030
It'll produce a
u_2-u_1 on that edge.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:42.210
It'll produce a
u_5-u_2 on that edge,

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.590
if the edges are
all going that way.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:49.530
And it'll produce a
u_7-u_5 on that edge.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:56.460
So I've got four components
of Au, four differences.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.140
And what does Kirchhoff's
voltage law tell me

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.860
about those four differences?

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.730
Which I can certainly
see directly.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:12.390
Those four differences, u_1-u_7,
u_2-u_1, u_5-u_2 and u_7-u_5.

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:16.930
What's the obvious fact
about those four guys?

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:21.530
They add to zero.

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:27.560
The total drop around
a loop is zero.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.980
You see, if I cancel
those, if I add

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.880
them, the u_1's cancel, the
u_2's cancel, the u_5's cancel,

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.980
the u_7's cancel.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:35.951
We know this.

00:42:35.951 --> 00:42:36.450
OK.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.830
So that's Kirchhoff's
voltage law.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:46.150
It's got to have
a continuous form.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:53.910
This tells me, this is
the test on v at a point.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:57.690
What's the test on
v around a loop?

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:01.110
I just want to connect
that-- I have to connect that

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:06.900
to a second test.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.750
I'll just mention it, and
you'll find it in the book.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.990
That's the pointwise test.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.760
That was the easy test.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.880
We applied it to this and
we got the answer yes.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.160
If it was 3y, 2x, we
got the answer no.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:26.070
Now let me give you
a test that looks

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.160
like Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.170
So I'm going to integrate
around a closed loop.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:33.480
What am I going to integrate?

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:38.970
I think I integrate v--
Oh boy, I'd better look.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.251
It's easy to get these wrong.

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:41.750
Yeah.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.080
So I would call
this the vorticity.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.110
And then I would
say the vorticity

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:49.290
is zero for a gradient field.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:53.110
Now my integral guy is
going to be the circulation.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:53.960
Oh yeah.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.500
Because I'm following the path.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:03.550
So it's just v_1*dx+v_2*dy
should be zero.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:08.020
Around every closed loop --
that's idea of this thing,

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.840
that it tells me the integral
goes around a closed loop --

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:23.370
if I follow the velocity field,
the total circulation is zero.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:27.740
I put this up here as a
fact in vector calculus

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.230
that's connected to that.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:32.050
These, one is zero
when the other is zero.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.160
There's a Stokes'
theorem that tells me

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.480
that this integral is found
from a double integral of this.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.520
So if one is zero,
the other is zero.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.910
I'm just saying, here
is the natural analog

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:48.110
of Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:49.310
OK.

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:51.600
I had to say something
about voltage law,

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.440
because for the
divergence, which I'm now

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:59.910
going to get to-- Whatever.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:05.950
Let me ask about
divergence of w equal zero.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:10.030
What does that mean?

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:14.270
That's going to be the
equivalent of whose law?

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.790
Please tell me.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:20.200
Which law is going to be the
equivalent of-- Divergence

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.460
of w equal zero is going
to mean there's no source.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.970
Whatever goes in, comes out.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:30.500
Whose law is that?

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.470
That's Kirchhoff again.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.350
Well, yeah, other
people in physics.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:33.850
Right.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:38.660
But in our little world,
it's the other Kirchhoff law.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.750
It's Kirchhoff's current law.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.740
It's the one, it's the
A transpose, right?

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.620
This is what we're thinking of
as A transpose w equal zero.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:55.670
Kirchhoff's current
law, in equals out.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:46:00.190
How will I translate that
in equal out for functions?

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:05.240
Now I don't have--
On a graph, I just

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:09.530
had the total flow, the
net flow at every node.

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:12.990
Notice the divergence
is at every node.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:17.640
The circulation was
around every loop.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.370
OK.

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:21.720
So in equals out was just
the sum of four things.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:25.660
OK, here I'm going
to have in equal

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:31.250
out-- How am I going to
express in equal out?

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:33.220
Divergence of w equals 0.

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:37.380
Yeah, what I need is
the divergence theorem.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.830
Let's just face it,
we've got to have that.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:45.240
So I have a region here.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:52.690
I have a w everywhere,
w, [w 1, w 2].

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:54.060
Then the divergence theorem.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.150
This is the great
identity, which

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.851
of course has a discrete form.

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:01.350
OK.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:06.880
The divergence theorem says that
if I integrate over the region,

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:12.280
over this region
R, the divergence,

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:17.120
that's (dw_1/dx+dw_2/dy), dxdy.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.545
So that's like
telling me the source,

00:47:26.545 --> 00:47:30.840
I'm integrating over the
source at every point.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:38.460
At every point here, this
measures in minus out.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:44.480
But now, when I put the whole
thing together by integrating,

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.040
what's the right-hand
side of this equation?

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.800
Do you know the
divergence theorem?

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:55.390
And let's remember it
and see why it's so.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:48:01.660
What I'm doing is in equals out
for the whole region at once.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.160
Right?

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.830
When I-- This is like
in equal out at a point.

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:08.190
But now I'm putting all
the points together.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:15.090
So the only way out will be
out through the boundary.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:19.450
And so I'll need to
say how much flows out.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:25.180
This is the total source, the
total in equal out inside.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.370
The only way to get out
is through the boundary.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:35.650
So this is the integral
around the boundary of-- So

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:39.730
what's the flow out?

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:45.610
It's, yeah, it's somehow--
Think now, what should go there?

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:49.850
This is flux I'm talking about.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:53.890
Flux is short word for
the total flow out.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:57.260
OK.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:02.830
So now I've got
to get this right.

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:10.510
In vector notation, it would
be-- w tells me the flow.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:16.210
But flow outwards, see,
suppose w points that way.

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:20.080
Then the actual flow
out is not all that.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.690
Because a lot of that
is just going sideways.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.230
It's this part.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.810
It's the flow perpendicular
to the boundary.

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:33.130
So it's w dot n, the
normal component of flow.

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:42.070
And I integrate that
around the boundary.

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:46.190
There you have a
key, key theorem.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:51.080
In 2-D. And it's an
equation for the flux.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.370
It's like the fundamental
theorem of calculus,

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:58.730
but now we're in two dimensions.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.260
And this is what it looks like.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:05.090
OK, so I'm obviously not going
to finish with the divergence

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:07.750
theorem today.

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:10.090
So what's the conclusion?

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:15.200
If the divergence
is zero, then what?

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:25.500
If the divergence is zero, if
this is zero at every point,

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:35.390
then this is zero
across every loop.

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:38.990
Can I call this thing a loop?

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:42.500
That closed loop.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:49.860
That's the conclusion
that we want to reach.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.700
So this is the
divergence theorem.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:59.660
The text gives a proof,
not to repeat in class,

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:03.680
but it's a crucial
formula to know.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.700
That the integral of the
divergence is the flux.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.450
OK.

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.040
Let's come back
to that Wednesday,

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.160
and I'll have lots
of homework for you.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:17.577
Thanks for turning
in these today.
