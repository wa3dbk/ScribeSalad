00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.520
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so I
feel I should have brought

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.700
pizza instead of math problems.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.190
I mean, but this is
our final, final hour.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.820
Open for any questions,
any discussion

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.210
about Fourier topics.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.610
Looking toward tomorrow
evening's exam.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.140
And, well, hoping you'll
find the whole course

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.190
useful at many
times in the future.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.090
So, somebody emailed me
that the posted solution,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.200
so I just posted
a quick solution

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.270
to the un-collected
homework ten,

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.590
and so I haven't even
looked to see what

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.590
did it say for this question.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.760
But what is the answer?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.320
If I convolve the delta function
with the delta function,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.990
what do I get?

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.070
Delta, right.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.930
If I convolve
anything with delta

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.850
I get delta because I'm
over in the other space.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760
I'm multiplying by one.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.430
Yeah, so if I use the
convolution rule to go over

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.000
to the other space, where this
becomes just one times one

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.080
I'm getting one, and transform
back and I've got delta.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.150
Well that question won't
be on tomorrow's exam.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.770
But I thought we could
deal with that fast.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.080
Now I'm open to questions
about any topic.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.850
Homework or not.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.940
Yeah, thanks.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.460
PROFESSOR STRANG: I could try.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.320
Did I make up the exam?

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.210
Probably.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.530
Yeah, I'll recognize it.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.050
OK, alright, I'll read it out.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:25.180
OK, so this an exam from
2005, not that far back.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.617
OK, so it has some questions.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:33.450
Shall I tell you what
the whole question is,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.320
but it looks like
this Part D is sort

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.930
of separate from the others.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.610
But why not, this gives us
some questions to think about.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.440
So if I just read
out the questions.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.170
One was, find the coefficients
of-- The function is e^(-x).

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.620
That would naturally
occur to me as a function

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.240
that you could-- So,
from zero to 2pi.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.890
And then periodic.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.260
Always good to graph it.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.910
So will e to the
minus x look like?

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.060
It'll come down to,
much steeper than that,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.140
but that would do it.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.710
So that's e^(-x).

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.920
Here it's one, and
here it's e^(-2pi).

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.620
And then repeat, repeat, repeat.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.150
So find its Fourier
coefficients.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.430
I'll just say what the
question is and you can ask me.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.610
And then what's the decay rate.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.520
Oh, maybe you can tell
me the decay rate.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.660
Even before you tell
me the coefficient.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.840
What would the decay rate
be if I expressed this

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.140
as a combination of
Fourier terms, harmonics.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.840
How quickly will those
coefficients drop off?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.040
So 1/k, only.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.050
That's right, 1/k, because this
function has a jump at zero.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.360
Well, at zero and again at 2pi,
at every one of those points.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.540
It has a jump, I guess,
of about this distance,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.670
between one and that number.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.880
Which would be the jump that we
would see of course every time.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.930
Yeah, so the coefficients
would decay like 1/k.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.800
Then it asked to compute the sum
of those coefficients squared.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.970
OK, so how can we find the sum
of those coefficients squared

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.040
even before I know
what they are?

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.140
Well, you know
the answer, right?

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.940
How am I going to
do this problem?

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.740
Yeah, so I'm looking for the sum
of the squares of coefficients

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.710
and then there's
this magic trick.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.390
What is it that helps me to
find that sum of squares?

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.970
How do I go about that?

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.560
I connect it to the integral
of the function squared.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.465
Integral zero to 2pi of
the function squared.

00:05:08.465 --> 00:05:11.160
And you remember
the reason, and I've

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.950
left a little space
for the fudge factor.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.070
2pi, or 1/(2pi), we can figure
out what it is by taking

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.190
a simple case.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.490
Yeah, why don't we take a simple
case to figure out should there

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.770
be a 2pi or a 1/(2pi) or what?

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.530
What's a simple case here?

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.860
Suppose I take f(x)=1.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.240
Suppose I take the function
f(x)=1, then the right side--

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.200
So if f(x) is one, the right
side would be 2pi, I guess,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.630
the integral of one.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.660
And the left side would be what?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.870
What would be the
Fourier coefficients

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.510
of the constant function?

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.580
Well just c_0, the only one
we would have would be c_0,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.150
the constant term, the c_0*e^0.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.550
And it would be one.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.890
So I'd have a one
there, when k is zero,

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.670
and otherwise I
wouldn't have anything.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.690
So this would be one
squared, this would be a one.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.600
So I do need to divide by 2pi.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.610
Do you agree with that?

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:26.420
To make it correct I'd better
have a 1/(2pi) to get that

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.790
to be right.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.770
OK, and then this gives
me the answer then,

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.540
I just do this integral,
e^(-2x), then f is e^(-x).

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.240
So f squared would be e^(-2x),
which I can certainly integrate

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.710
and get some expression.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.890
Yeah, OK.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.210
So that's a
straightforward part.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.960
And now to the Part D, which you
asked about which is, oh wow.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.700
OK, so now I'm asking
about an equation u, du/dx,

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.830
plus u(x) equals
a train of deltas.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.860
So delta(x) made periodic.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.360
Can I write it that way?

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.530
So this is the periodic case.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.820
So I'm looking for
a periodic answer.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.620
So I'm in the
Fourier series world

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.360
when I take-- I'll be
looking for coefficients, not

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.430
the integral transform.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.750
OK.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.140
So alright, so I'm
making it clear.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.390
So how do I proceed now,
with such a problem?

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.100
So I've mentioned this morning
that a problem like this

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.800
could appear.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.470
So I'm happy to discuss it.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.730
What do I do?

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.700
Transform.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.910
Absolutely.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.650
Take Fourier transform.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.440
OK, so what happens when I
take Fourier transforms of u?

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.410
Well, I guess, so
we're doing periodic,

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.660
so we're going to go
to coefficients, right?

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.710
I'll call them, shall I call,
shall-- I think of u(x),

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.620
shall I just call
its coefficient c?

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.700
It's the only function I have
around so I might as well use

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.580
c for it.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.820
So here's the function,
and Fourier takes this

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.370
to the set of coefficients, OK.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.610
And the point is that
we can separate--

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.500
I mean this is the whole
reason why Fourier's so great.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.350
That we can do each
frequency separately.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.510
So let's see then.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:44.430
So this has coefficient c_k,
and what are the coefficients,

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:50.080
what's the k-th coefficient, so
this is all the e^(ikx) term.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:09:00.100
What's the k-th coefficient of
the derivative? ikc_k, right?

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.530
And what's the k-th coefficient
of the delta function?

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.100
One, right?

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.740
Is that right or is there
1/(2pi) or something?

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.900
Is it 1/(2pi)?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.380
OK, 1/(2pi).

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.560
Yeah, I guess that's right.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.610
Because the coefficient,
I would have

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:23.420
to take the integral
times, yeah, the integral

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.920
with the delta function
will give me the one,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.670
and then there's a 1/2pi.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.840
Right, OK.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.040
So now I've got the answer.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.890
Now I have this
equation at each k.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.060
Following each
eigenvector, following

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.410
each separate frequency.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.520
And it's easy to do.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:53.180
It's just 1/(2pi) And
there's 1+ik, I think.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.300
OK, and now those are the c_k's.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.780
So I think maybe this is it.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.630
Sum from minus infinity,
I know what the c_k is.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.930
2pi(1+ik), times e^(ikx).

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.620
That's my u(x), I think.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.830
Had to be, right?

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:26.100
So I just did the sort
of automatic steps.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.020
When I made up
this exam, I don't

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.370
know whether I was thinking
I could find out-- Can

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:45.560
I actually do that sum to
produce some function u(x)

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.910
that I am familiar with.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.890
I'm not sure.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.190
Anybody reading the
question, so the question

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.440
says solve this
differential equation.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.610
Doesn't say what
it means by solve.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:03.710
Anyway, I've done it.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.930
I guess.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:13.410
Shall we agree that I
passed on this question?

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.620
If we knew some tricky
way to do this addition,

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.670
but I don't immediately see it.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.330
So that's good.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.380
OK, you're welcome.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.210
Thanks.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.070
OK, so that was a very
good question to ask.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:32.120
Because it got,
it got the method

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.340
of how do you deal with
a differential equation.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.220
By the way, this could be
a difference equation, too.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.510
That could be u at
x+h minus u at x-h.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:52.650
Shall I just emphasize that that
wouldn't have been any harder?

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:59.910
u(x+h)-u(x-h) over 2h,
let me take, for example,

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.760
plus u equals delta.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:09.060
This is like I've taken a
centered difference there,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.560
instead of a derivative.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.780
How would you write
a solution to that?

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:18.374
Same method.

00:12:18.374 --> 00:12:19.540
So what would the method be?

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.700
I'd take transforms.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.280
So here this would
have coefficient c_k,

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.350
this would have
coefficients 1/(2pi).

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.670
And what would be the
coefficients of these guys?

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.100
Well, there's a 1/(2h).

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:38.670
So what are the Fourier
coefficients of u(x+h)?

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.280
Just to see that
all these things--

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.040
I've got constant
coefficients here.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.570
Why shouldn't Fourier work?

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:53.951
So if it's u(x+h), so there's
an e to the something factor,

00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:54.450
right?

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:58.780
When I've shifted a function
then in the transform

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.370
I see an e to the i thing.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.710
So let's just see.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:10.000
If u(x), so if u(x) is
the sum of c_k*e^(ikx),

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:21.220
then u(x+h) would be the sum
of c_k*e^(ik(x+h)), right?

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.300
No, nothing surprising there.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.220
So now I'm seeing the factor.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.780
There's c_k, it's multiplied
by the factor e^(ikh).

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:43.210
So this is the same c_k, but
an e^(ikh), from that one.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:47.030
And this would be the minus, and
this would shift the other way.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:52.500
So it would be the same
c_k, and probably e^(-ikh).

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.470
If I did that right.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.420
Yeah.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.700
Anyway, once again, we
have still linear problem.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:05.360
This is c_k times
something equals 1/(2pi).

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.030
By the way, this thing is
what I would call the transfer

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.590
function.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.010
You see that language?

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.640
We haven't used
that language much.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.950
Or at all, it's sort of more
of a systems theory, control

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.200
theory word.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:29.520
But hey, we're always doing
the same correct thing.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.670
That's the thing that transfers
the input to the output.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.690
So maybe the transfer
function is one over.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.940
Maybe I include the division
in the transfer function.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:47.510
So finally I get c_k
is this 1/(2pi) guy,

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.410
divided by whatever that was,
1/(2h) times that number,

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.140
minus 1/(2h) of that plus one.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.870
Whatever is
multiplying c_k there.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.250
It's a transfer function.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:14:59.750
Yeah.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.910
So there's another word which
we could have, and should have,

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.930
used before today.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.870
But here it is.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.920
OK, so that's some thoughts
about that question.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.660
Any other direction to go?

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.737
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:15.737 --> 00:15:17.070
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yes. go ahead.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.200
Yeah.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.420
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Lab problem 12, OK.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.000
4.5, Fourier
integrals, number 12.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.360
Oh yeah, maybe that was also.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.050
A question was
raised about was it

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:42.310
right on the posted solution.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.040
So maybe not.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.930
Let's see what we want to do.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.400
Yeah I just thought
that was pretty-- I

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.700
could remember the day I
thought of this equation.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.910
Integral of u minus derivative
of u equal delta(x).

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:02.030
I thought that's kind of
a cool looking equation.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.440
But I don't know that I've
ever solved it, before.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:12.410
So integral of u, actually
yeah, I look cheerful,

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:17.570
but-- So I'm finishing
the fourth edition

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.640
of the linear algebra book.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.550
Introduction to Linear Algebra.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.610
So I love writing.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.910
I've done all the
writing and now comes

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.530
the only horrible part, solving
all those stupid exercises.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:36.520
So that, you may think of me in
sunny Singapore or somewhere,

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.030
but what I'll be doing
is not on the beach.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:46.740
It's in an office somewhere,
doing Problem 1.1.1,

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.870
and two, three, it's not life.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.540
I mean, it's.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.400
But, OK.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.540
Anyway, that looks like
a pretty good equation.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.880
And certainly I'm
going to transform it.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.800
So I can see a little
question coming up.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.770
So am in the Fourier
integral world, yeah.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:15.630
So I should you use this
notation. u hat of k, right?

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:22.510
Over ik, is that the right
thing when I've integrated?

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.010
Yeah.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.900
That's made it smoother.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.840
That's dragging
the function down.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:34.480
And I guess the one point
that's a little tricky there

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.600
is always, are you
dividing by zero.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.440
Because zero is one
of the frequencies.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.240
And so I sort of need u hat
of zero to be zero for this.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.190
So it's looking slightly
dangerous at k=0,

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:53.880
but otherwise it's certainly
improving things by speeding up

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.100
the decay rate.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.920
And then this would be minus
ik u hat of k, as we just said.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.170
And this would be
the one, maybe it's

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.350
a one in the Fourier
integral world,

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.930
where the 2pi went
in a different point.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.680
So I think that's, yeah.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.220
So I would now just,
the usual thing

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.940
was the transfer function.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:21.630
1/(ik)-ik, so that's
my transfer function.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.640
That's multiplying u hat.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.000
Maybe I can simplify
that by putting it

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.620
all over ik, one minus ik.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:35.900
Is it plus k?

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.010
Does that look good, or does
that look bad? k squared?

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.840
Does that look better?

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:52.920
So I'm wondering, so over
here is k squared over ik,

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.830
is that the same
as the minus ik?

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:58.570
Yeah.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.390
Yeah, bring it up and the
minus i squared is one

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.650
and I've got k squared.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.560
Yeah, so this looks good.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.250
So that's then, dividing by it
gives me, I'm dividing the one.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.750
So u hat k is one over this.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.140
So it's the transfer function.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.550
One plus k squared.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:25.110
OK.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.500
I don't know whether
I had in mind

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.960
to go any further than this.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.350
Did you get this far, or what?

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.700
PROFESSOR STRANG: It said that?

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.500
Oh jeez.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.650
I bitterly regret
saying these things.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.440
Yeah, OK.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.760
I don't know u(x).

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.420
Did anybody have any luck?

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.940
You did.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.290
Did I say it with a derivative?

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.980
Oh one, over one plus
k squared, oh yeah.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.220
One over one plus k
squared, we know what to do.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.090
And then ik will
take its derivative.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.150
So what do we do if it's
one over one plus k squared?

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:15.240
That's the one where, that was
the guy which was the e^(-x),

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.400
right?

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.450
Oh, it's just one side.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.480
No, two sides, isn't it?

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.380
Two sides, yeah.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.550
Yeah, we just got a corner.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:26.890
Yeah, OK.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.620
That's looking good.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.700
And now maybe I need to
divide by two. a is one here

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.670
but there is a division by two.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.450
Yeah, that looks good.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:44.450
OK, and now I take--
This function,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.080
its transform has that.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.270
And now if I want
to multiply by ik

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.560
I have to take the derivative.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.400
So I believe with
your help here,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.460
that the derivative
of that is the same.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.880
Can I just take the derivative
while we're looking at it?

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.010
I mean e^x is the
most-- You know,

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.430
that was created to take
its derivative, right?

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.570
So its derivative is itself.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.780
The derivative of
this is a minus.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:22.530
So I think that maybe that's
the answer. e^x over two,

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.630
coming up to 1/2, I guess.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.840
And then-- Oh, well
the picture won't look,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.720
because of that minus sign.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.310
Yeah.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.860
Huh.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:39.720
Good, because that minus sign,
it's minus e^(-x) over two.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.500
So it starts at minus 1/2.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.570
So there's a jump of one.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.130
Or drop of one.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:51.120
Is that right, there should
be a drop of one in u hat?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.070
Probably.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.010
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.480
The integral will
be smooth at zero,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.470
where the delta
function's hitting us.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.460
I have a minus sign
and a derivative.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.250
But yeah, doesn't
that look good?

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:11.560
If the derivative has a delta,
the function has a jump.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.530
And with that minus
sign, and with one delta,

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.000
the jump should
be a drop of one.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.780
Which is that.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.480
Yeah.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.930
And the integral
minus the derivative

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.590
should be otherwise zero.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:29.510
So again this is not
unrelated to exam questions.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:33.370
I did all this stuff, and
I really should check,

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.330
did I get it right?

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.010
Does that solve the
differential equation?

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.386
I mean, you could say
of course it does if you

00:22:39.386 --> 00:22:40.510
took all these steps right.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.960
But it's wise to check.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.350
Plug it in.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.610
OK, it has the drop of one.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:51.660
So it deals correctly with the
delta because, the derivative

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.590
has a delta.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.170
And things match.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.360
And now what else
do I have to check?

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.890
I have to check out all
the other points, right?

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.500
I've just checked that yep,
this answer is good at the jump.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.710
The tricky point.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.120
But now what about
all the other points?

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.540
So where the delta is
zero, I should just

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:18.380
check that the integral of u,
so what is the integral of u?

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:24.720
Let me just check for the
points left of the origin.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.150
So I'm just going to
look at this part.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.620
Yeah, x negative.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.460
So its integral, what's the
integral of e^x over two?

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:42.680
I guess e^x over two, right?

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.990
Minus?

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.920
And what's the
derivative of e^x?

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.520
Oh, the derivative is also
e^x over two and I get zero,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.800
or x negative.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.940
As I want to.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.370
Because the delta is
zero in that left side.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.840
And similarly on the right side.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.730
It should be OK.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.590
And then the key point was
that the jump was right.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.620
Yeah, so thank you.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.340
That's good.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:06.940
Yes please.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.690
PROFESSOR STRANG: What, sorry?

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.820
Why did I take the derivative?

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.550
What will be the
derivative of this?

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.540
Yes, there is.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.140
That's right.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.270
What would be the
derivative of this?

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.800
Huh, yeah, good question.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.220
What's the derivative
of this answer.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:33.070
So it's that, on the left. and
then there's a delta function,

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.870
a minus delta, right,
because it's dropped down.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.080
And then the derivative
of that is e^(-x).

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.910
Yeah, so if I graph
the derivative, cool.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:50.750
I graph the derivative, it
looks like the function.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:56.750
It has a spike going down there.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.540
At the origin, and then the
derivative here is positive.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.040
Right?

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.030
This function's coming up.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.310
It's e^(-x) over two.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.730
It's positive, it's there.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.050
Yeah.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.050
Oh wow, that's a nice graph.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:17.620
So that's the derivative,
this is the graph of du/dx.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.040
Yeah, thanks.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.850
And similarly I could graph the
integral, the integral-- Well,

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.730
would you want to
see the integral?

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.590
Probably not.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.810
Maybe, yeah.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.020
The integral would probably
look pretty much just like that

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.320
but without the delta, yeah.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.860
Cool, isn't that nice?

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.040
It's artistic.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.820
That's the derivative,
and the integral

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.030
is the same thing
without the delta.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.230
And when you subtract,
you get the delta.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:57.890
OK, you sure you guys don't
want to come to Singapore

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.050
and help with these
problem solutions?

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.380
There's plenty for everybody.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.820
OK.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.760
Alright, so another question.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.310
Yeah.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.960
2005.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.835
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:11.835 --> 00:26:14.020
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, alright.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:14.860
Yeah, which one?

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.501
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:19.501 --> 00:26:22.000
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, I'll just
read out the whole question.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.040
Yeah.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:32.870
So this is 2005, Problem 3.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.970
OK it's a half-hat function.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:41.340
This is Fourier integral,
because it's on the whole line.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:46.150
And it's half a hat for--
Between zero and one,

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.950
the function is coming down.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:53.150
And then otherwise it's zero.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.390
So its graph, done.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:56.560
Graph its derivative.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.260
OK, let's graph the
derivative of that function.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.250
Derivative is certainly
zero along there.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.040
Then the derivative
is minus one here.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.200
And then the derivative is zero.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:16.720
So the derivative looks
to me like it's that, OK.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.160
So yeah, that function--
Is that right?

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:21.660
No.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.430
It's not right.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:25.640
There's a delta.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.150
That was the tricky
part of the problem.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:32.270
Right, there's a delta
in the derivative,

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.220
right here because of that jump.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.211
There's a delta.

00:27:37.211 --> 00:27:37.710
OK.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.210
Good.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.920
Now, is that better?

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.480
That's good.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.550
OK.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.120
What's its transform?

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:52.870
The transform of
this derivative.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.120
What's the Fourier transform?

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.510
Well, I guess we got two parts.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.660
So this is my function u'(x).

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.620
The derivative.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:04.530
Now, what's u' transform?

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.460
So it should be a
function of k, now.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.960
Alright, what do you think?

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.240
So it's the sum of two things.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.260
That delta, which Fourier
transforms to one.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:23.940
And this guy down below
between zero and one,

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.110
which was like the
one we did today,

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.300
we've got the integral
from zero to one.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.120
Now it happens to be a
minus one e^(-ikx) dx.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:44.140
And that, of course, we can do.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.110
OK Oh, there's solutions here.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:55.710
PROFESSOR STRANG: Yeah.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.930
So OK, so I think
we're doing alright.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:03.720
This expression is familiar.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:09.500
It's 1-e^(-ik) over the ik.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.840
Is that right?

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.700
We have a minus.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.600
Is the minus, yeah, I
think the minus looks good.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:23.610
And yeah, at least, that's
here and it's probably

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.520
got the minus signs correct.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.790
So why was it?

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:32.390
I plugged in x=1, and
that's why I got an e^(-ik).

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:35.430
And then I plugged in x=0 and
that's where that one came

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.150
from.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:42.850
OK, so, but your question
was about-- That was it?

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:43.410
Oh, I see.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.840
OK.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.910
Right, and then the next part
asked about the transform

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.830
of the original guy.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.720
The transform of
the original guy.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:30:00.280
Now, what would be the
transform of the original guy?

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:11.620
The original u.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:17.310
Right, OK, yeah.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.060
The reason I'm
sort of stuttering

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.760
is that if I'm
going to integrate--

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.240
I mean, what are you
going to tell me?

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.330
What's a quick way to find the
transform of the original u

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.060
now?

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.870
Divide by ik.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.820
Divide by ik.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.670
And then I'm all ready to do
that except I'm worried that

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.300
k=0.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.730
But it should come
out alright, now.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:47.900
So I have to hope that this
thing comes out to be zero

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.080
at k=0.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.950
Can you see that it does?

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.880
What is, yeah?

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.210
This is a good point.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:03.490
What does u hat
at zero represent?

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:05.620
Have you thought about that?

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.120
If I look at the Fourier
transform, which I've got here.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.530
So let me write
what I've got here.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:17.170
I've got here that Fourier
transform of this function.

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.690
And if I take the Fourier
transform of any function,

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.580
and I look at zero frequency.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.820
What am I seeing?

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.800
The average, right.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.240
I'm saying the average.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.734
What's the average
value of that function?

00:31:32.734 --> 00:31:33.900
We never thought about that.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.120
But that's fun.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.650
What's the average of this guy?

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.960
If I integrate over
the whole line.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.560
Do I get zero?

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.690
Yes.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:48.170
Because I get the integral of
the delta part gives me a one.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.480
But the integral of this box
part gives me a minus one.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.630
So the integral, so this
does equal zero at k=0,

00:31:55.630 --> 00:32:00.840
and I can safely do
that division and get,

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:07.800
so now u hat of k is this
expression divided by ik.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.090
So it's one minus this thing.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:12.600
I'm just copying.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.990
Minus ik, over ik, all
that divided by ik.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.460
And I can, of course,
maneuver that some more

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.750
to make it look better.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.750
OK, these are good
questions, because it's

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:31.680
giving me a few functions
to do the standard rules.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:39.010
Shifting, integrating,
differentiating.

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.550
Oh, here's a Christmas present.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.790
What does that mean?

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:47.740
Is the convolution of
this function with itself

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:52.100
the whole hat?

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.960
Why is that a Christmas present?

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.510
Is the convolution,
the convolution

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.430
of that with itself.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:05.070
So first point, we don't want
to compute a convolution.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.180
You may have
noticed, you have not

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.450
computed convolutions
of things like this.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.000
It's not a lot of fun.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.410
Because you have
that integral to do.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.630
And you'd have to
separate out the parts

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.760
where it's this and the
part where it's this

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.010
and the parts where it's that.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.350
It's not nice.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:27.860
Much better to multiply
in the transform domain.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.850
Much better.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:33.710
OK, so if I multiply in
the transform domain,

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:40.420
I don't think I get the
Fourier transform of the hat.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.670
Of the whole hat.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.230
But can you give me
a convincing argument

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:50.880
for why-- This is, here
I'm in the transform domain

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.770
and I'm going to
convolve with itself,

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:59.970
so I'm just going to square it.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:05.500
With the decay rate, what's
the decay rate as it is now?

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:09.120
The decay rate is, yes.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.290
The decay rate is a good key.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.050
So what is the decay
rate right now?

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:15.690
Here's a function with a jump.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.250
So I know that even though
has a slightly messy

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.730
looking transform, I
know the decay rate.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.570
It's what, with a jump is 1/k.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.690
OK, so this must
be, and I sort of

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.630
do see a k down here,
so that's sensible.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:35.770
OK, now, if I convolve, then
I multiply in this domain.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:38.590
So that would give me the
k squared, as you said.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:43.380
So could that be the
transform of the whole hat?

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:50.060
Does the whole hat
have a-- ooh, could be.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.310
I'm pretty sure the answer's no.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.740
Yeah, no way.

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.290
Yeah, I think that
that's the best answer.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:03.050
I've lost the reason.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.560
Because I'm getting the
k squared decay rate.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.590
If I convolve
something with itself,

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:13.160
that would give me a k
squared, and the decay rate

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.070
for the transform of
the hat is a k squared.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.840
But they wouldn't
be the same, yeah.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.580
OK, yeah, I won't.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.240
Yes, please.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:29.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.990
PROFESSOR STRANG: Right.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.350
It's just convention.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:36.160
The difference was that that was
the Fourier integral problem.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.920
Where we put, you
might have noticed

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:45.970
that the 2pi goes on the other--
And this was the Fourier series

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:46.470
problem.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.870
That was its only difference.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.270
So it's just a convention.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.800
And maybe other people would
choose a different convention.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.940
So that is a slight
wiggle in the presentation

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:03.770
that the 2pi in the
Fourier integral section

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:09.830
got moved to the transform
in the other direction.

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:12.450
Yeah, good.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:13.160
Yes, thanks.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.920
PROFESSOR STRANG: Oh, OK.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.310
I'm really just going by this
rule that if there is a jump

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.280
in the function,
and nothing worse,

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.520
then the decay rate is
1/k, and if there's a jump

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.170
in the derivative, as
there would be here --

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.400
so that has a jump in slope --
then the decay rate is one over

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.960
k squared and so on.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.490
But those are the main cases.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:50.000
Yeah, so I'm not using
anything deep there.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.010
And by the way, I realize
here that one MATLAB problem

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:58.710
that I didn't assign this
semester but it's quite fun,

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:03.120
is to actually see
the Gibbs phenomenon.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:09.240
We know the terms in the
Fourier series, with a jump.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:16.590
And if you computed--
Make it the periodic case,

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:20.020
if you've computed the
terms in the Fourier series

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:24.140
they would stay
near here and then

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.320
I'd see the famous
Gibbs stuff here.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.470
So that-- You know,
it's quite pleasant

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:37.370
to see the printout of
the Gibbs phenomenon.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.950
Not getting any
shorter, just moving

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.810
closer to the jump as you
increase the number of terms.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:48.920
Yeah, it's quite interesting.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.510
But couldn't do everything.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:51.760
Yeah, ready for more.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.150
Any questions?

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.230
Well, these are good.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.130
Yes, thanks.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.591
PROFESSOR STRANG: With
cyclic convolutions.

00:38:00.591 --> 00:38:13.670
OK, what could I do with
cyclic convolutions?

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:17.440
Let's see.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.770
What should I do with
cyclic convolutions?

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:30.240
I better make a little space.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.880
Let me make a little
space and think.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:43.460
Anybody got a suggested problem
for a cyclic convolution?

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:47.450
I mean, one type of
problem would certainly

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:59.140
be if I gave you a
cyclic convolution

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:05.030
and asked for-- I mean, the
direct way would be to say OK,

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:10.430
what's the cyclic convolution
of (1, 4, 2) cyclically

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.070
with (2, 1, 3) or something.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.280
But you could-- That's
just a calculation,

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.050
so you would get that.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.170
I won't discuss that further.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:28.240
Now suppose I ask it with
the unknown, the thing

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.000
that I don't know here?

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.440
So let me do that.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:40.790
Shall I say three,
yeah. (3, 1, 1).

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:48.320
Cyclically convolved with
some unknown (x_0, x_1, x_2)

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.140
equals some
right-hand side, what

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.010
should we take for the
right-hand side? (1, 1, 1),

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.250
for example?

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:05.350
OK, I'll erase the top one.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:14.350
OK, how would you go with that?

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.470
So that's three by
three, three unknowns.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.620
It's linear, so somehow
I could write that

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.960
as three equations
in three unknowns.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:28.430
The question is how do I
get some insight into this.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:30.390
And when I'm seeing
a convolution, what's

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:34.690
my immediate thought?

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:36.370
Transform.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.010
That's what this
month is all about.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:42.710
November.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.010
So I'll take the
DFT of everything.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:51.240
So what's the discrete Fourier
transform of (1, 1, 1)?

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.160
Up there is going
to be the transform.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.830
So let me call it x_0
hat, x_1 hat, x_2 hat.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.160
Just to emphasize.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:07.800
So N is three here,
in this problem.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:12.530
Or maybe c_0, c_1,
c_2 you might prefer.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:13.830
Whatever.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:16.150
And now this is going
to be a multiplication,

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:20.620
so in MATLAB notation
will be a dot star, right?

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.660
And so now I have to--
These are the known ones,

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.100
so what's the discrete Fourier
transform of (1, 1, 1),

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:31.270
the cyclic convolution of that?

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.330
It's (1, 0, 0) is it?

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:35.510
Or it's (3, 0, 0)?

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:42.710
Is it three-- I guess when
I asked that question,

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.760
you're open to two answers.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:51.510
You could either be going from
x space to frequency space

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.760
or frequency to the other.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.080
Because I haven't told
you what space we're in.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.870
OK, let's go with that one.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:07.830
How did you get to there?

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:10.770
You multiplied by the three
by three Fourier matrix,

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.410
is that what you did?

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:15.160
Alright, so now can
you do that here?

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.180
So separately I have to
do a little multiplication

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.240
of the three by
three Fourier matrix.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.780
One, one-- Sorry,
let me get it right.

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:27.160
So I'm going to transform this.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.890
Make a little space here.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:29.800
Transform that.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.370
So it's 1, 1, 1,
1, 1 and this is

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.190
w, w squared, w squared
and w to the fourth,

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.230
which is the same as w.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:44.760
OK, and now I want to
multiply that by (3, 1, 1).

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.780
And get the answer there.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.500
OK, so what do I have?

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.050
Five.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.470
And what is that other one?

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.100
Oh, boy.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:59.490
What is three plus
w plus w squared?

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.160
Anybody know that one?

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:07.360
Well, I do know what one
plus w plus w squared is.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.560
It is zero.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.570
Why is one plus w
plus w squared zero?

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:15.740
So I claim that if I have
three plus-- I think the answer

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.210
there is two.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:20.540
And here I think I've also
got three, w, w squared,

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:24.060
I think if it was a one
the answer would be a zero.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.810
But it's a three, so I
still have two there.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.400
I think that's probably right.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.410
Can I just remind you why?

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:38.760
There's one, there's w,
and there's w squared

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.060
and they add to zero.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.930
Yeah, yeah.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:47.020
For many reasons.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:51.540
That's a very, very,
handy property.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.450
That the sum of the
nth roots of one

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.710
add to zero, OK, so
now where I am I?

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:04.030
So I got (5, 2, 2).

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:05.690
So I've transformed.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.980
Now what do I do next?

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.290
I divide.

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:18.070
So this is telling me that this
is three separate equations.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:23.910
There's three, 2x_1 hat is zero.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:24.700
Right?

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.110
No, x_2 hat.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:28.740
And 2x_2 hat.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:31.090
Sorry, one was right.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:35.120
And 2x_2 hat is zero.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:40.510
I'm just doing
the multiplication

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:41.780
as I'm supposed to.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:46.380
In the other space it's at each,
for each component separately.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:52.890
So now I know x_0 hat is
3/5, and the others are zero.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.380
So now I know what
these numbers are.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:01.270
Oh, yeah. (3/5, 0, 0).

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:08.200
And now what?

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.360
I mean, that statement's
clearly true, right?

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.320
Point star means five
times this gives me three.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.700
Two times zero gives me zero,
two times zero gives zero.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.590
So I'm golden, but
I'm not finished.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:26.510
So that's not x,
that's its transform.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:29.780
So what do I have to do?

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:30.930
Go back.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:36.460
OK, so now can you
tell me what this is?

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:40.810
Up to a factor of 1/N,
or N, which we may

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:45.340
have to figure out separately.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:50.970
So apart from this possibly
appearing, and probably

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.460
appearing, give me
an idea of what's

00:45:55.460 --> 00:46:01.710
the inverse transform of
that? (3/5, 3/5, 3/5), good.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:06.400
3/5, all three times.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:16.140
OK, and now I can check
to see if it's right.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:21.820
And again, I have not attempted
to get the 1/N's right,

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.420
I've just waited to the end.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.510
So now I'll just
do this convolution

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:28.150
and see if I really
do get (1, 1, 1).

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.990
So can we do that convolution?

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:36.540
What's the typical,
say, this guy.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.310
Where does that come
from in the convolution?

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:45.460
It comes from this, times what?

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.570
This.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.280
That's the constant, right?

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.700
And that's the constant.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.570
Contributes to the constant.

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:55.050
And what other products
contribute to the constant?

00:46:55.050 --> 00:47:00.860
So we're really seeing--
Thanks you for this question.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:13.450
So this one
multiplies which one?

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:16.790
The answer is, this one
multiplies this guy.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.620
You may say don't worry me about
it because they're the same.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.600
But it's nice to know.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.800
So this one multiplies this one.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.860
And this guy
multiplies this guy.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.720
And we'll remember
in a minute why.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.210
And then you add them up,
that's what convolution is.

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:38.100
So I'm getting 9/5+3/5+3/5
is 15/5, so that's three.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:43.470
So what's your conclusion here?

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.010
I should divide by three, right?

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:46.780
So I should divide by three.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.730
So that's easy to do.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:49.660
Those will all be one.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.130
Yeah, OK.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.350
So that's the right
answer, right?

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:59.620
And then I check
that it's right.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:04.380
So let me just close by
remembering why was it--

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:08.790
So I'm doing just a
forward convolution here.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.610
Solving the equation
was a deconvolution,

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:12.830
figuring out that x.

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:15.950
But now that I've got it
and I'm just checking,

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:17.580
that's just do it
forward and see

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.130
if you got the right answer.

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:24.220
And so we're just
remembering what

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:30.520
it means to do a convolution.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.500
So you remember the
point about convolutions.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:41.010
That if I'm convolving (a,
b, c) cyclically with (d, e,

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:45.450
f), that's a constant term.

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:48.720
Just tell me again, now, what's
the constant terms in this?

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:55.080
It's ad plus b times what?

00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:01.830
This is the first term
in the convolution.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:06.420
You remember that, the day
we brought convolutions

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.840
into the course?

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:13.100
What does b multiply? f, why f.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:21.140
Because b is the coefficient of
w, if I'm taking polynomials,

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:24.920
this is a plus bw
plus c w squared,

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.740
and this corresponds to d
plus ew plus f w squared.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.060
And I'm looking
for the constant.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.440
So I get an a times a
d gives me a constant.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:42.230
bw times what? times
f w squared gives me

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:46.240
the w cubed, which is
the one, so that bf here

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.860
and then there's a ce.

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:53.910
Because c w squared
multiplying ew

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:57.650
gives me the w cubed,
the one which folds in.

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:01.670
Yeah, OK, so anyway.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:04.460
That's a quick reminder
of cyclic convolutions.

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:07.590
That was a good
question to ask, yeah.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:12.440
You know, I fully realize this,
especially this third topic,

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.460
lots of things like this.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.870
Straightforward if
you have lots of time,

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:20.390
but we had to keep moving.

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:25.950
So remembering what
cyclic convolution was

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:29.240
is a good chance to do it.
