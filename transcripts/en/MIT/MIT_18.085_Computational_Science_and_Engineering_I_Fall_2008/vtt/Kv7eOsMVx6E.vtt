00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.020
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK,
thank you for coming today.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.120
The day before Thanksgiving.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.890
Day before my
birthday, actually.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.680
So it's a special day.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.350
Everybody gets an
A for showing up.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.660
Even you.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.950
So, let's see.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.950
Last time, I wrote down these
formulas for the Fourier

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.530
integral transform.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.870
And I thought I'd
just write them again

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.120
so you kind of photograph
them and remember them.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.580
They're easy to remember.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.460
As always, you
take the function,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.190
you multiply by e^(-ikx),
and you integrate.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.290
To get the amount-- So k
is my frequency variable.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.240
It could well have been
omega or some other variable.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.020
I stayed with k because it
was k in the Fourier series.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.840
So that's the calculation
which as always, I mean,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.350
these are integrals
that we may be

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.030
able to do if the function is
especially nice, or we may not.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.820
But that's the formula.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.580
And then to reconstruct
the function,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.220
we combine all they e^(ikx)'s
in that amount to get f(x) back.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.140
OK, nice formula.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.160
So I did one example last
time, and now could I just

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
double it up?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.580
This is also in
the textbook and so

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.970
this is now going to
be an even function.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.140
Last time the example I
did was zero up to x=0.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.570
This time I'll
make it symmetric,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.170
make the function even.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.740
And then I have two
pieces in the integral.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.580
And if you remember
what it was, you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.620
remember that this, I'll
just remind you what we did.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.630
We wrote that it's e^(-(a+ik)x).

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.300
That was clear.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.630
And then when we integrated we
got that same function divided

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.000
by -(a+ik).

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.660
And then we put in the limits.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.480
And the answer was, let me maybe
write the answer down here.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.110
Was just at x equal
infinity the limit

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.780
was zero because this
thing is tailing off.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.760
At x=0 this is one.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.700
It comes in with a minus
because that's the lower limit.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:04.330
So it was 1/(a+ik)
for the first half.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.550
And we were not
surprised to see this 1/k

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.800
because the first
half all by itself

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.140
has that jump, from zero to one.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.330
So we see that jump
reflected in slow decay.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.990
Alright, but now
I'm making it even.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.730
What are you going to guess for
the rate of decay of f hat of k

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.790
for this function?

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.290
This function no
longer has a jump.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.380
But it does have - I don't know
were we saying ramp, or corner?

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.640
This is not a smooth point here,
because the derivative going up

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.470
is plus a, so I'll just
put a circle right,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.320
the derivative is a*e^(ax),
and at x=0 that would be plus

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.710
a going up.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.580
And here the derivative
is -a*e^(-ax).

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.480
Put in x=0, and the derivative
coming down is minus x.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.160
So there's a jump
in the derivative.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.670
So what, just before
we see it, what

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:23.070
will you expect for the rate
of decay of the transform?

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.410
One over k to what power, now?

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.190
So it didn't have a
jump, a jump was 1/k.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.090
This has a jump
in the derivative,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.510
so we're expecting one
over k squared. k squared,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.810
it'll be one order smoother.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.770
OK, you can easily
see that happen.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:54.080
Because this part, well
this is just e^((a-ik)x),

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.070
which I'm going to integrate
to get this thing over a-ik.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.150
And I'm going to plug in the
limits minus infinity and zero.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.590
And at minus infinity
I'll get nothing,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.080
this e^(ax) at minus
infinity will be zero.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.460
Where the function starts.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.780
Way down at zero.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.950
So and at x=0, this is a one.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.580
So I just get 1/(a+ik).

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.580
Over a minus, thank you.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.290
Right, over a minus.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.800
And somehow it
can't be an accident

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.640
that this is the complex
conjugate of that somehow.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.980
That's not a surprise.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:46.150
OK, so let's put those
together into a single fraction

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.880
and see what we have.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.030
So the denominator
of that fraction

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.020
will be this times this.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.530
And that's the most
basic multiplication

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.430
of complex numbers.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.490
That one times its
conjugate gives me what?

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.440
It gives me an a squared.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.090
And what else?

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.530
A plus k squared
because i times minus i

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.900
is plus k squared,
and no imaginary part.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.650
There's a plus i k
a and a minus i k a,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.640
all we're seeing here
is the sum of squares.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.550
The usual z times z bar.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.470
And in the numerator, let's see.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.170
When I put it over
this-- So this

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.600
was putting it over
this common denominator,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.520
so I should have an a-ik
going up on top there.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.750
And an a+ik going
up on top here.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.250
Right?

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.670
Those are my two fractions.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.090
That over this,
and that over this.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.900
And now that numerator
simplifies, oh look it's great.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.160
I'm getting a real answer.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.270
And because the minus
ik and the plus ik

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.330
cancel, and it's just the 2a.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.380
And probably no
surprise that somehow

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.610
that that's the jump in slope.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.440
That must have something
to do with that 2a.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:27.460
So we got a real even, Fourier--
f hat from my real even f.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.830
And it decays like k squared.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.950
OK, so that's
another good example.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.580
A very useful example.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.080
Right.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.480
I could add other examples.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:48.970
One quite, before I use
that in application,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.510
let's do just a
few more examples.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.780
Suppose f(x) is
the delta function.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.590
What's f hat of k?

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:07.120
Can you just plug in
f(x)=delta(x) here?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.770
Do that integration, and what
does f hat of k come out to be?

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.660
One.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.480
Because if it's a delta
function there, at x,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.650
at x=0 the spike is at x=0,
so I plug in x=0, I get one.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.040
So we're kind of,
we'd be surprised

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.850
if it wasn't a constant, right?

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.370
A delta function
in physical space

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.850
goes in-- has all
frequencies in equal amounts.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.930
And it's a constant
in frequency space.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.360
Then there's one more that
takes a little trick to do,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.730
but it's a very neat one.
f(x) is e to the minus

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.780
x squared over two.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.180
Do you recognize that as
an important function,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.120
e to the minus x
squared or it usually

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.510
has that e to the minus
x squared over two

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.390
or sometimes an e to the
minus x squared over two sigma

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.320
squared, a rescaling?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:15.400
But this would be the
bell-shaped curve.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.570
The bell-shaped curve.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.890
It decays very quickly.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.730
The variance, because
that's a two and not

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.950
a two sigma squared, the
standard deviation is one here.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.300
The variance is one.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.990
So it's a bell shaped
curve that has about 2/3

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.640
of its area between
minus one and one.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:43.090
This is the all important
function for probability.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.340
The normal distribution, the
Gaussian, both of those words

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.300
are used, it's the most
important probability

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.940
distribution.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.010
I need a one over
square root of 2pi

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.610
to make the total
probability be one.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.060
But let me just leave it there.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.570
That's a very, very
important function.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.500
It's also going to be
important in the heat equation.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.760
In math finance, shows
up all over the place.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.920
And its integral would not be
easy to do from zero to one.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.820
The integral of that
function, from zero to one,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.700
we have tables of it.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.370
To the nth place.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:33.810
But so there's no simple,
elementary function

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.670
whose derivative is this.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.760
That x squared is what's
making the integral tricky.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.480
So from zero to one, we
just have to give it a name.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.120
So, error function.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.530
This would be E-R-F,
error function,

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.210
the integral of that thing
correctly normalized.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:57.640
I'm just saying, important,
important function.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.030
And it turns out that integrals
from minus infinity to infinity

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.590
can be done.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.070
So, beautifully,
by some trickery,

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.500
we can find the
transform of this.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.240
We can find the
transform of this,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.470
we can do this integral from
minus infinity to infinity,

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.870
where we could not do
it from zero to one.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:22.970
So I'll just write down
the answer for this guy.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.980
Only because it's
such a key example.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.855
It's some constant that
involves 2pi times e

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:34.880
to the minus k squared over two.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.950
Boy, that's pretty amazing.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:44.320
Right, the Fourier integral
transform, f hat of k,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.640
has the same form
as the function.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.120
And of course this function
is infinitely smooth.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.020
So its transform
decays infinitely fast.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:04.160
Yeah, there's no problems
like one over k squared here,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:10.230
there are no bumps in
the bell shaped curve.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:15.230
So I won't push that
example except I'll use it.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.150
What else should I
say just to, like,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.490
emphasize that this is such
an important distribution

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.520
in probability?

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.270
Why is it important
in probability?

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.870
That's the question.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:32.230
Why does everybody assume,
if you can get away with it

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:39.720
and don't have any natural
alternative, everybody

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.240
assumes that noise,
whatever, is coming

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.470
with a normal distribution.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:52.600
So, in other words, with
a sigma squared in there.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.500
So a normal distribution,
that has mean

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.600
zero because it's absolutely
centered at the origin

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.860
and it has variance one, but
I could change the variance

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.060
and that would just
spread out or tighten

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.810
the bell-shaped curve.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.020
Why is the bell-shaped
curve so important?

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.495
That's certainly,
we're not going

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:17.910
to launch into
theory of probability

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.480
but it's the central
limit theorem.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.450
So let me just use those words.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.470
The central limit
theorem that says

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.310
that if I start with other
probability distributions,

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.800
like I'm flipping a coin.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.270
I flip a coin a million times.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:39.530
Then the mean, and let's say
zero for tails, one for heads.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.430
OK, so I flip, flip, flip.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.930
Well, the mean of
that, the expected mean

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.720
is what, half a million, right?

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.180
Half tails, half heads.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.720
So if I give zero for
tails, one for heads

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.230
and flip a million
times the mean

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.950
would be about half a million.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:04.410
And then, so let
me center the mean.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.360
I could have centered it by
taking minus one and one.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.660
That would have been smarter.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.380
Minus one and one.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.360
Minus one for
tails, one for heads

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.070
would have had a mean of zero.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.840
And then it would be
natural if I have a million

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.620
of these to divide by
a thousand, I think.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.450
Of course, the answer
won't be zero, right?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.350
If I do a million
flips it's not going

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:34.170
to come out exactly half a
million and half a million.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.030
I'm remembering.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:41.220
I used to have a long discussion
with a nice guy in college.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.100
He ran for Mayor of
Boston, actually.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.600
But he had the idea that
after a million flips,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:56.520
suppose there had been
more heads than tails.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:03.210
Then the next flip, he figured,
was more likely to be tails.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.770
I couldn't convince them that
this was not mathematically

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.520
the right thing to think about.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.730
And all I did was say
don't go to Las Vegas.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.790
I mean, if you're thinking
that way, save your money.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.950
So, anyway.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.940
But this is much studied.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.970
The variation, what
that curve looks like,

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.020
that's quite interesting.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.790
But my point is, that as the
number gets bigger and bigger

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.650
and we scale it properly,
the distribution

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:38.150
will approach the normal.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.710
All sorts of distributions.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.360
If I just repeat and repeat
experiments and scale it,

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.710
the central limit theorem
says you're always going

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.340
to the normal distribution.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.830
So that's highly important.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.680
OK, and it comes up
different places.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.130
And it's quite a neat function.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:02.080
OK, so that's some examples.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.230
Now, let me use, like every
topics that I introduce,

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.390
I want to find a use for.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.990
So now, can I start on this one?

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.061
Constant coefficient
differential equations.

00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:16.310
I'm going to write down a
differential equation, which

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.410
will look pretty
much like the ones we

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.520
started this course with.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.470
And I could, well,
let me write it down.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.920
Minus d second u dx
squared, we're used to that.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.350
Now let me put in
an a squared u.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.330
Which is a lower lower order
term, we could deal with that.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.070
Equals some f(x).

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.850
And now, because I want
to do Fourier integrals,

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.670
I'm thinking all x.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:51.670
We're on the whole line.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.580
Instead of the
interval (0,1) where

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.990
I might use Fourier
series and have

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.580
sine series or cosine series,
depending on the boundary

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.500
conditions.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.250
Here, the boundary condition
is just everything drops off

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.420
at infinity.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.730
And minus infinity.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:13.180
So all these functions,
we can do these integrals.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.140
OK, so there's a good question.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.230
What's the solution?

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:28.350
We could tackle it, but I want
to suggest to use Fourier.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.550
So it's not the only way,
but it's one way to see it.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.970
So now if I use, what do
I mean by using Fourier?

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.050
It means I'm going to take
the Fourier integral transform

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.030
of every term.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.080
So when I take the
Fourier transform

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.470
of the right-hand side, I'm
going to get f hat of k,

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.220
whatever.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.960
This is known, of course.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.360
This guy is given.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.820
That's the source term.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.210
And u is the unknown.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.430
OK, so I'm going
to take the Fourier

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:02.710
transform of every term, well
this is, a is a constant. a

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.370
had to be a constant,
or I couldn't do,

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.680
you know if a depended
on x this would

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:17.200
be some multiplication and
the transform would be a mess.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.630
Fourier applies when you've
got constant coefficients

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.520
and nice boundary conditions.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.750
And here our boundary
conditions are nice,

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.620
they just go to zero fast.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:34.730
OK, so the transform of this is,
that's a constant. u hat of k.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.960
And what's the
transform of that?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.320
So this is our chance
to use probably

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:49.070
the most important rule
for Fourier integrals.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.470
Maybe you'll tell me what it is.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.970
You should think what it is.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.380
If I take a derivative,
that's the rule.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.060
If I take a derivative
of the function,

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.720
what's happening in frequencies?

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.710
I could make that happen here.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.570
If I took the derivative, yeah.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.710
So maybe if I take
the derivative here,

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.490
so here it's just
remembering the rule.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:20.080
Suppose I take the
derivative of this equation.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.570
I get this integral,
and what would f' be?

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.850
What would f hat, sorry.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.170
If I take the x
derivative of this,

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.600
if I take the x derivative
of this equation,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.200
what happens on
the right-hand side

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.010
when I take the x derivative?

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.060
Down comes ik.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.280
Down comes ik.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.560
So when ik is coming
down, I won't even

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.540
finish that equation.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:49.060
And ik is coming down,
when I take the derivative.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.490
So the derivative, the
transform, is multiplied by ik,

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.760
higher frequencies
are emphasized now

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.890
because of that k factor.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.780
And now if I take two
derivatives, I bring ik twice.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.690
So that's i squared k
squared, the i squared

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.030
and the minus give me a plus.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:12.290
So that's just k
squared. u hat, of k.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.000
OK with that?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.730
And now, we get an
immediate formula

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:25.550
for u hat of k, the solution.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.550
Well, it's the solution but
it's in frequency space.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.040
If we wanted to know it
in x space, as we do,

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.090
we've got to transform back.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.620
But what do we get here?

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.590
It's just f hat of k.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.740
Divided by, this is just
multiplied by a squared plus k

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.590
squared.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:52.890
OK, so that's the answer.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.010
In frequency space.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.380
That was simple.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.080
And then if I wanted
it in x space,

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.700
I take the reverse transform.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:08.010
Notice that this is, hidden
here are the same three steps

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.720
that I emphasize all the
time about using eigenvectors

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.830
and eigenvalues.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.580
Do you remember
those three steps

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.490
for solving
differential equations?

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.970
Difference equations,
linear equations, whatever?

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.330
The three steps were,
find the coefficients,

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.010
expand everything
in eigenfunctions.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.190
I won't write, I'll talk.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.870
The three steps were
expand in eigenfunctions,

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.510
follow each eigenfunction
function separately,

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.140
that was the trivial step
with just a division,

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.750
like this division.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:48.500
And then use those coefficients
of the eigenfunctions,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.450
combine them all back
to get the answer.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:51.950
Right?

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.730
Step one: write it in the
right basis, step two:

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.510
easy in that basis.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:02.180
Step three: go back to
your physical space.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.540
We're doing exactly
the same thing here.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.840
These e^(ikx)'s are the
eigenfunctions of this thing.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.090
They're the eigenfunctions.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.120
And here the eigenvalue
of this stuff

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.850
is k squared plus a squared.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.110
And that's what we divided by.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.990
And then the final job
of going back from u hat

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:28.420
to u, by-- So write u there.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:33.640
Can I do, this f,
now it's really u

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:39.090
that I'm wanting to bring
back to physical space.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:44.530
So just for the sake
of your eyes seeing it,

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.970
let me put a u in.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:54.070
So that's the answer in a way.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.890
It's the answer, it's a
formula for the answer.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:03.220
It did depend on our being
able to do two integrals.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.640
The integral from f to f
hat may not have been easy,

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.500
and then the integral from u
hat back to u, this integral,

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.590
might not have been easy.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.290
So it's a formula.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.680
OK, now I want to go
with it a little longer.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.200
Because I want to show you how
the delta function pays off.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.040
So let me do the example where
f(x) is the delta function.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.210
So now we're really close
to where this course began.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.740
Differential equation
with a delta function.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.480
The only new thing is,
we're not on an interval,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.950
we're on the whole line.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.370
So I take transforms, so
what's the transform now

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:51.850
of this specific f(x) is?

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.570
One.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.220
We just saw.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.520
OK, so now we get a one there.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.710
Now we just divide by here.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:04.220
And we've got a one here.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.120
So we were able to go,
this was an integral

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.280
we could easily do, to get
from delta to delta hat, which

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.750
was just one.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:19.970
And fantastically, this is an
integral to go back to u(x),

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:27.090
to go back to u(x), that's
an integral we can do.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.920
Well, you may ask
how can we do it.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.730
How do I find the u(x)
that has this transform?

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:40.720
Well, I either use complex
variables to do integrals

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.060
like this, residue methods
that are in Chapter 5,

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.780
or I look in a table.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.890
Or I look at the
blackboard over there.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.700
I think that's the best way.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.451
Look at this blackboard.

00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:54.950
Right?

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.570
Because this is
the answer we got.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:03.300
We got that same answer apart
from a constant factor 2a.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.130
So this is our function.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.190
This is our solution,
u(x) is this.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.130
What am I going to call that?

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.570
Two-sided pulse?

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.350
I'll call that the
two-sided pulse?

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.870
Maybe I should give it a
name but I'll just write out

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.840
those words two-sided pulse.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.550
That's it, divided by 2a.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.080
So we've got the answer.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.900
Let me just make a
little more space here.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.380
This was one over a
squared plus k squared,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.980
and now having seen that
already, I just say yep,

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.150
that must be it.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:49.560
It's the two-sided pulse,
and I have to divide by 2a.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.140
Do you see that that's
the correct answer?

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.570
We can substitute that in the
equation and see that it works.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.960
I mean, so we have
solved the problem.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.000
We have solved the problem
when the right side was delta.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.970
Let's put it into the equation.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.970
So this is just
because we did this,

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.960
it's nice to do it again
after all this time.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.050
So I put it in the equation.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.850
This two-sided pulse over 2a.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.600
So what's my equation?

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.250
Well, this is zero
most of the time.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.710
So I believe that if I
plug in this function,

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.429
it will give me the zero.

00:26:29.429 --> 00:26:30.720
Do you want to just plug it in?

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.060
I believe that if I plug in
a^(-x), or a^x, either one,

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:41.090
can I just check that
u-- Try u=e^(-ax).

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:44.590
Put it in and just
see that I get zero.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:47.380
Because yeah, two
derivatives bring down

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.590
a squared with a minus.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.780
And there's a
squared with a plus.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.700
It works, right?

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:59.620
Two derivatives of this function
bring down minus a twice,

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.440
so that's a squared.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.160
So it's minus a
squared, plus a squared.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.750
Works.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:10.480
And then, of course, the
important point is x=0 where

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.760
the spike is.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:18.470
What happens at the
spike, going back

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.560
to the beginning of the course?

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.250
This term is going
to be unimportant

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.370
compared to this term.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:28.300
What do I see?

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:34.630
With -u'' equal a spike, what
was the solution to that?

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.690
u had a corner, right?

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.100
The slope of u, what
did the slope of u do?

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.630
It dropped by one,
was that right?

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.140
The slope of u dropped by one.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.570
We used to have corners
going up and down

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.540
and the difference between
the slopes was one.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:58.300
And here, the difference
between the slopes, ah, look.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:09.790
The slope has dropped by 2a,
and when we divided by the 2a,

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.700
it was just right.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:18.450
And now, when I divide by the
2a, this has a slope of 1/2.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.670
This has a slope of minus
1/2, the drop is one.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.190
And we're right.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.520
It solves the equation.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.460
Nobody doubted that.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.500
OK, so that's great.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.820
We have found the
solution to this equation,

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.050
when the right side is delta.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.420
Good.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.310
Now, can I ask you do
you remember the name?

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:48.710
There's a special name for the
solution when the right side is

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.110
a delta function.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.590
Whose name is
associated with that?

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.085
So that this
particular u, I'm going

00:28:56.085 --> 00:28:57.840
to give it another letter.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:03.320
It's the particular
u, the special u

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.410
when the right side is
delta, and whose name is

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.880
associated with that solution?

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.340
Green.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.180
It's the Green's function.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.000
Green's function.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.730
The famous Green's function.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:19.160
Green's function is just like
an inverse to the problem.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.570
This is like having an identity
on the right-hand side.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.450
It's like there it is.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.850
So let me just use G
for Green's function.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:31.220
So that's the Fourier transform
of the Green's function,

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.880
and this is the
Green's function.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.990
This is the Green's function.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:41.780
Now I can give it its
name, Green's function,

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:45.570
when I divide by the 2a.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:51.520
And now the slope is 1/2 going
up, and minus 1/2 coming down.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.600
And it's all right.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.630
OK, so we found the
Green's function.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:59.640
We found the fundamental
solution to the equation,

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.680
and this is it.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.720
It was straight lines, right?

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:12.430
It was straight lines in the
first weeks of the course.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.930
But now there's an
exponential drop-off

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.510
caused by this additional term.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:25.320
OK, good.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.650
So that's straightforward.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:31.330
Depending on our being
able to recognize or do

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:36.870
the transform back
to the x space.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.120
Now comes the question, what
about the original f(x)?

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.760
How can the Green's
function be used?

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:51.340
So you're seeing now, what
use is this Green's function?

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.630
With that right-hand side,
when the right-hand side

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.260
is something different?

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.690
When the right-hand side
is some different f(x)?

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:08.260
So let me go back to
an f(x) on the right.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:14.520
And then there's an f hat
of k, after the transform.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:21.190
How can I use the Green's
function for a general source?

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.810
The general source
term, a general load?

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:30.780
This is a fundamental idea.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.530
I would say fundamental.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:37.370
How do you use the
Green's function?

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.880
And remember, the
Green's function

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.840
is like telling you
the inverse matrix.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.420
So it can't be too hard.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.200
It's like solving a
linear system when

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:52.630
you know the inverse matrix.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.880
So that's the analogy,
but let's just focus

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:00.120
on the particular question.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.670
I think the
intuition, you should

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:07.030
have an intuition for how
the Green's function works.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:09.750
So the Green's function
was the solution when

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.320
the source term was a delta.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.310
And here's the intuition.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:19.190
It's rough, but it works.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:25.920
Any source term,
f(x), is in some way

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.220
a combination of delta.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.750
If f(x) is a
combination of deltas,

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:37.300
then our answer u(x)
is the same combination

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.230
of the Green's function, right?

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:43.940
If the right-hand side
is some combination

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:48.900
of this special delta, then
the solution will be the same.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.580
This is just linearity.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:55.900
Superposition, whatever short
or long word you like to use.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.550
So if I can make sense
of that statement,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:08.740
that f(x) is a combination
of deltas, then I'm in.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.780
Now, what do I mean by
a combination of deltas?

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:18.070
I mean, well, those deltas are
going to be shifted deltas.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.630
Obviously the single
delta, delta(x),

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.300
is a spike at the origin.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.790
That's only one point.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:30.770
I want to combine delta
of x and its shifts.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:34.230
So I'm going to have
to expect to be using

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.590
G(x) and its shifts, right?

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.390
OK so now I'll just
say this again.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:43.320
I'm thinking of f(x) as
a combination of delta

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.290
and its shifts, and
then the solution u

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:51.740
will be the same combination
of G(x) and its shifts.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.000
So now you just have to
tell me what combination.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.380
What combination of
delta and its shifts?

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.100
Maybe you'll allow me.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:09.640
Let me just do this
maybe on that board.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:15.820
I just can't help writing
down the discrete case.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.520
So, in the discrete
case, the delta vector

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.841
corresponds to something
like [1, 0, 0, 0].

00:34:22.841 --> 00:34:23.340
Right?

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.040
That was a typical
delta vector with a one

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.060
in the zeroth position.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:33.750
Then its shifts would be [0, 1,
 0, 0], that'd be a shift.

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:37.160
And another shift
would be [0,  0, 1, 0].

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:41.690
And another shift
would be [0,  0, 0, 1].

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:44.800
So now there is the delta
vector and its shifts.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.190
These four guys.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:50.610
OK, now suppose my f,
my right-hand side,

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:54.520
is [1, 2, 3, 7].

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:59.070
I want to write that as a
combination of those deltas.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.280
This would be in the case when
if I know the solution for each

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.330
of these guys, the Green's
function, the inverse matrix.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.600
Everybody sees if I know
the solution to those four,

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.260
I know the inverse matrix.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.240
Right?

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.880
Because if I can solve with
those four right-hand sides,

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.520
those four solutions are the
columns of the inverse matrix.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.050
Right?

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.970
You remember that
if I had a matrix A

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.040
and I was looking
for its inverse,

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:35.490
I solve A A inverse equal I.
And I is just these four guys.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:42.510
So A inverse is the solution
from these four guys.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.770
OK, now everybody's
going to tell me

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:51.130
what's the solution for this
right-hand side [1, 2, 3, 7]?

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:56.920
Suppose this guy has
solution, so A inverse,

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:02.410
the columns of A inverse
are this Green's function.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:05.820
This Green's function
with a shift.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:10.120
Maybe SG, Green's
function with a shift.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.130
Yeah, S squared G, Green's
function with a double shift.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.490
S cubed G. I'm just
cooking up, I never

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.760
used these letters before.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.600
But what's the answer?

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.680
Then u is what?

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.920
It's one times the
Green's function.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:34.830
And it's two times
the guy, right?

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.670
This f is just,
this f is just, is

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:42.440
one times the Green's function,
two times the shifted.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.130
Three times the double
shifted, and seven times

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.620
the triple shift.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.120
Right?

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:55.890
Just taking four minutes to
do something simple because

00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.050
over there, when I use
the continuous case

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:04.740
it'll look a little strange,
but here it's so easy.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.100
That'll involve integrals,
this involves a sum.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.030
So what is it?

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:14.020
I have G, twice the
shift of G. Three

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:19.170
times the double shift of G,
and seven times the triple shift

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.450
of G. Right?

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:29.880
By linearity, by superposition,
if this is my f, this is my u.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.690
Everybody's with me here, right?

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:35.380
That if I take a combination
of f's, the answer is

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.960
the corresponding
combination of G's.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.890
OK, good.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.700
I didn't mean that.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.630
That wasn't so great.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:53.930
That shouldn't
have been called, I

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.690
didn't mean to call those
the Green's functions.

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.070
I meant to call those
the deltas, right?

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.070
And the Green's functions
were the answers.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:05.040
So this a shifted delta, this
is a doubly shifted delta,

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.650
this is a triply
shifted delta, and now

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:14.380
this is one of the delta, two
of the shifted delta, three

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.370
of the doubly shifted delta.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:21.150
The f is a combination
of deltas and its shifts.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:23.490
The u is a combination
of Green's function,

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:25.470
and its shifts.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.650
Apologies for
making that mistake,

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:31.920
but maybe it's brought
us back to the point.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:39.220
So the point is, express
your function f, your source,

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.610
as a combination of deltas,
just exactly our plan.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:48.830
Then u is the same combination
of the G's with the same shift.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:52.260
Alright, now back here.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:58.440
How do I express
f(x), in what way is

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.260
f(x) a combination of deltas?

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:08.310
I mean, slow down just
to see that point.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:18.970
How much of delta, of the spike
at x=3, how much of delta(x-3),

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:24.630
so that's a spike
at three, right?

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:34.980
How much of that do you
think I need in f(x)? f of?

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.480
f(3).

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.800
Whatever f is at
that point, x=3,

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.500
that's the amount I need there.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.290
So this would be f(3).

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:49.330
So that that part
would sort of have

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:56.530
the right pep, the right
punch, at the point three.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:01.570
Now, three could be
any point, that's

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.220
any point along the line.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:07.020
Let me, I can't use x for
other points on the line

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.010
because I've got an
x in the formula.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.390
Let me use t.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:17.720
So this was t equal to three.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.470
Now I want to do
it at all points.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:24.380
I want to take f(2), and
f(pi), and f at everything

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.650
and put them together.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.600
And of course putting them
together in the continuous case

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.820
means not sum, as I did
there, but integrate.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:38.080
So I have to, now I'm going
to change three to a t,

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:49.450
because this is
the amount of f of,

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:55.850
so that's the amount, that's
the delta functions which spike

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:59.340
at t, multiplied by
f(t), and now how

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.780
do I get f(x) out of this?

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.950
I put them together. dt.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.190
I add up, this is
the combination

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.850
I've been talking about.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.070
So this is like any f.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:20.680
This is like a crazy
delta function identity.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.460
Actually, it's not
crazy, it's the identity

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.560
we've used our whole lives.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.380
Or at least our whole
18.085 lives, which

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.480
is all that matters, right?

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.910
OK, so I'm integrating
a delta function.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:39.650
And I want to see,
do I get that answer?

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.020
And you're going to say
absolutely, clearly you

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.280
get that answer.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.000
No.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.850
Everybody knows that if I
integrate something times

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:51.520
a delta function that I
plug in at the point t=x,

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:57.240
where that spike happens, I
put t=x, I get f(x), correct.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.900
So that's like any,
that's an identity

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.360
or whatever you would
like to call it.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.560
And now just tell
me the final answer.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.600
Let me put it on
the board above.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:14.170
Now, so this was,
this expressed my f(x)

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.200
as a combination of deltas.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.060
Just the way over here
I expressed [1, 2, 3, 7]

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.300
as a combination of deltas.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.100
Now, what's that u?

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.700
What's the function u?

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.730
The solution that
comes from f(x).

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:35.210
Just erase here so that
I can put all of them.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.150
The point of the
whole example now

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:50.110
is for you to tell
me what's u(x)?

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.110
Can you do it?

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.330
You see what u(x) is
going to come out?

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.420
It's going to come out nicely.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:01.480
I've written the right-hand side
f as a combination of deltas.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.580
I know the answer, for delta.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:12.610
It's G. What's the answer when
the delta is shifted along?

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:17.520
What's the Green's function
when the spike is moved along

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.940
to a point t?

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.050
Just, because this
constant-coefficient,

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:30.990
translation-invariant, LTI
problem is shift invariant,

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.200
the answer, when the
spike is moved along,

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.990
is just the answer
G moved along.

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.600
So here's my answer.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:47.200
All this, this is my input and
my output is the same integral,

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.610
this from minus infinity to
infinity, of -- where it was f,

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:58.450
now it's G. Well
no, what do I want?

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.210
Help me out here.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:06.130
No, f(t) is just the
amount of the delta,

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:08.120
but now what's the solution?

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.530
What do I write now?

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:13.600
G of?

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:24.270
x-t.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.040
That's it.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.680
You see why that works?

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.920
Because this was the
input, G's the output.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.970
The problem was shift invariant,
so if I shifted the input

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.990
I shifted the output.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:43.760
It was linear, so if I
add up a bunch of deltas,

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:53.360
the solution is add up a
bunch of G. That's the answer.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.440
Oh, I could just
say one thing more.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.730
But you've got it
if you see math.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.750
So that's the point, that if
you know the Green's function,

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.140
well yeah.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:11.660
Maybe from a practical point
of view, what have we done?

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:17.400
The original way we did
it involved our computing

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.760
two integrals.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.695
We had to, if we were
given an f(x), we

00:45:21.695 --> 00:45:23.970
had to find its
transform f hat of k,

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:28.600
that we weren't sure we could
do with pencil and paper.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:31.840
And then we got an answer
with an f hat of k up here

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.260
and then we had
to transform back.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.800
Step one and step
three, we had to do.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.980
Now this is better.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.210
This is like better,
because we were

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:52.800
able to get an explicit answer,
G, when this was a delta.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.977
You could say I've got
it down to one integral.

00:45:56.977 --> 00:45:58.310
Well, for whatever that's worth.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:01.160
I was going to say,
probably can't do that one

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.640
either depending what f(x) is.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:10.460
But that's a nice way to see
the answer, you have to admit.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.710
And it's because the
problem is shift-invariant

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.830
and I can write the
answer that way.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:22.350
OK, and now one more
thing about this.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:26.000
And I've written the word,
the key word, down here.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.980
Convolution.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:37.540
Do you see the nice way
to write that answer?

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:41.620
It's the convolution
of f with G.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.990
We didn't do integral
convolutions,

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:47.280
we just did the discrete
sums, but I mentioned

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.610
that in the integral case,
you have this same thing. t

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:56.610
and x-t adding up
to x, just the way

00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:00.930
we had k and n-k adding up to n.

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:03.900
In other words, this
is just notation.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:10.000
But I'm just going to write
the answer in a nice way.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.300
So after all that
lecture, the answer

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:20.820
to the differential equations
is in three symbols f star G.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.840
Where this just
simply means this.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:29.210
This is the continuous
convolution, not cyclic,

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:38.070
and there's the answer.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:41.870
I'll allow myself
one more thing.

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:46.650
Here we had a convolution
for the right-hand side.

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:48.870
We started with this,
this is a convolution.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:55.430
Now, what are the three
symbols that I write down?

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:59.390
For the shorthand
for this equation?

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.840
So this was to be
true for any f.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.800
And now can I write
down, how do I write?

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:14.970
f(x) is equal to, what
is this right-hand side?

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:19.950
It's f convolved with?

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:29.860
So any f is the same f
convolved with delta.

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.840
In convolution, delta is one.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:39.190
Because when I go
to the other space

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:44.710
and I get a multiplication,
it really is one, right?

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:46.220
In the other space.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:52.000
So in the other space, so
this convolution in x space

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.820
turns into multiplication
in frequency space.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:59.000
And it just tells me that
f hat is f hat times one.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.200
So that's the way to look
at it in physical space.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:11.620
And this is the way to
look at the solution.

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:16.860
So, one more thought and
I'll come back to that.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.700
So this G, the
Green's function, this

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:25.110
is what a CAT scan does,
what an X-ray telescope does.

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:27.460
What all sorts of
physical things do.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.330
Provided we can assume this
translation invariance,

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:34.970
which is never perfectly
true because the telescope is

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:35.910
finite.

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:40.960
But a telescope takes the
star, takes the light signal,

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.440
convolves it with the
telescope's own little Green's

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.860
function.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.940
It blurs it, it's the
point spread function.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.560
It's the blurring function,
G. The Green's function

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.190
on a telescope is
somehow, that's what's

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:57.670
you're convolving with.

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:03.920
And if you want to find that
star as a bright, single point.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.390
You've got to do deconvolution.

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:09.530
You've got to do a
division to get the G out.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:13.800
May I just say those words
and then it's Thanksgiving?

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:22.010
That a machine, a sensor which
is translation invariant,

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:27.000
or you could say close
enough to pretend it is,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.340
because nothing is going
to be perfectly translation

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:31.660
invariant all the
way out to infinity.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.950
But if it's near the star.

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:40.130
So I look at this point star
in the telescope I see a blur.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:46.880
That's because the telescope
has convolved the correct thing,

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:52.480
that I should have seen,
with G. It's blurred it

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.660
by its point spread function.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:57.330
So what if the
person, the factory

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.320
where the telescope was built
can test this whole thing

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.420
on points.

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.210
And it can find the
point spread function.

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:07.810
And if I knew G,
then I could undo it.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:10.310
And get a clear picture.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:16.970
So it's that step that won the
Nobel Prize for the CAT scan,

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:21.740
and I'm sure is winning
Nobel Prizes for astronomers.

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.650
OK, have a great Thanksgiving,
I'll see you Monday.

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:25.788
Good.
