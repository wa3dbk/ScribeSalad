00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:21.170
PROFESSOR STRANG: Well, OK.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.980
So I thought I would, as
last time, before Quiz 1

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.250
and now before Quiz 2,
I thought I would just

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.850
tell you what the topics
of the four problems are.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.350
Remember that trusses
are still to be reviewed,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.360
and of course the fun
was to find mechanisms,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.010
to find solutions to Au=0, in
the case when the truss was

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.770
unstable.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.080
So you can guess
that I'll probably

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.670
pick an unstable truss.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.800
And ask for mechanisms.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.070
Then maybe the key problem
for this third of the course

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.550
is finite elements.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.030
That idea, and
finite elements we've

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.910
really only done
in one dimension,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.780
so-- And particularly linear
hat function elements.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.640
So you see what's not
included there is like cubics.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.300
I mean, those are really
great finite elements,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.090
but maybe not so
great for an exam.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.480
So 1-D is enough;
linear elements

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.500
are enough to do on an exam.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.540
And then questions
three and four,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.600
so this one will be
weighted more heavily.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.030
Then questions three
and four are the topics

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.640
that we've been doing
the last week, two weeks.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.490
And I realize we
haven't had full time

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.960
to digest them, to work
a whole lot of exercises.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.130
So those will be, right
now they're too simple,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.130
my questions on those topics.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.990
Three and four, I'll try to make
them a little harder for you.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.220
But I might not succeed.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.140
So, anyway.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.130
There we go.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.090
So I just felt we can't talk
about a course in applied math

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.300
without dealing with these
topics in vector calculus

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.100
that lead to Laplace's equation.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.520
But my heart is
really in solving

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.970
Laplace's equation or Poisson's
equation by finite differences.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.310
That'll be today, or
by finite elements,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.370
that'll be Wednesday
and probably Friday.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.370
So this is like the core
of the computational side,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.390
but we had to do
this preparation.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.720
And then you know
that Peter kindly

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.400
changed his weekly review
session to Tuesday,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.850
I think it's Tuesday at noon;
you could look on the website.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.670
So Peter will be a Tuesday
review and then regular, that's

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.910
me, on Wednesday.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.430
And then the exam, I think,
is Wednesday evening.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.420
I think, yeah.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.800
Let me just do a review.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.840
Oh, Peter sent me a note about
a question on an old exam.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.680
I think it was 2005,
question three.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.170
I think it was 2005
question three.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.670
Peter said he didn't understand,
at all, the solution to 3c.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.860
Nor do I. I think
somehow, I think

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.720
there was a little confusion in
that, and the answer in there

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.970
is the answer to a
different question.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.890
Forget it.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.220
Having looked at
this one, a and b

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:14.760
are worth looking at in this
div, grad, potential, stream

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.690
function world that we're in.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.630
Those are typical
exercises in that area.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.370
Yes, question.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.670
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Oh, good question.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.170
Yes.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.200
Thanks for reminding me.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.160
So, solutions to the homework
that you're practicing with.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.150
If anybody has typed
up solutions or could,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.680
we'll post them right away.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.390
So I'll just hope for an
email from somebody who solved

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.480
some or all of those problems.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.630
And of course you'll
see me again Wednesday.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.740
But that's an
invitation for anybody

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.820
who worked through
those homeworks

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.410
that I'll never collect.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.190
The current homework.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.500
OK, thanks for that.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.940
Other questions about
the exam, and then you'll

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.130
have another chance
Wednesday to ask about that,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.030
so those are the topics.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.520
OK.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.350
And before I get to the
fast Poisson solvers

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.930
there's so much about
Laplace's equation to say

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.580
and I think it still
remains to write

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.010
Green's formula on the board.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.990
And that's part of the big
picture of Laplace's equation

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.350
is to see this.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.900
So we have double integrals
now, that's the difference.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.730
But we're still
integrating Au against w.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.430
So Au is the gradient
of u; w is w_1, w_2,

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.000
and this is now for
any u and any w,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.080
so I want the inner product.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.170
Of the gradient of u with any
w, so this is like the Auw part,

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.640
so the gradient of u, that
would be a du/dx times the w_1.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:24.680
And a du/dy times w_2.
dx dy, that would be.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.260
So inner products, if
I'm in two dimensions,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.150
inner products are
integrals, of course,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.870
if I'm dealing with functions.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.560
So this is like
the Au against w.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.240
Inner product.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.070
Au is those two pieces, w is
those, there's the dot product.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.450
And now the key idea behind
what Green's formula is about,

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:55.690
what we use it for in 1-D,
is integration by parts.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.460
So an integration
by parts is going

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.230
to produce a double
integral in which-- So I'm

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.480
just sort of thinking
through Green's formula.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.620
Of course, we could just say
OK, remember that formula.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.440
But you want to just see it
as an integration by parts.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.504
See how it evolved.

00:07:14.504 --> 00:07:15.420
And then we can think.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.560
So I plan to do
integration by parts,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.570
that x derivative will get
taken off of u and put onto w_1.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.410
So I'll have u*dw_1-- Oh,
there'll be a minus right,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:36.330
from the integration by part.
u will multiply minus dw_1/dx,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.090
so that was this guy
integrated by parts.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.640
Now this one
integrated by parts,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.500
a y derivative is coming
off of u and onto w_2.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:53.720
So that'll leave me with u times
dw_2/dy with the minus sign.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.370
That comes also from that
integration by parts.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.100
And then there's
the boundary term.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.100
So there's the term which--
Now the boundary of the region

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.870
is the curve around it instead
of just the two points.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.590
And what do we see in
the integration by parts?

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.090
Well, from the boundary
term we expect a u

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:21.200
and then the key point
is it's w dot n ds.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.340
It's the normal component
of of this vector w.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.850
Because we're looking, well,
that's just what it is.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.720
So that's Green's formula
written out in detail.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.400
And this is the
formula that tells us

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.460
that here, if this was
A, A being gradient,

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:50.680
on the left side I'm seeing
grad u in a product with w,

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.120
and over here I'm seeing
the inner product of u with,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.460
what's that?

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.290
If I look at minus, if I
have this quantity there

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.470
that's in parentheses,
what's its name?

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.420
It's the divergence.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:11.680
It's minus the divergence of w.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.620
Plus the boundary term.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:24.810
So this is why I allowed
myself this gradient transpose

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.160
equal minus divergence to see
that if A is the gradient then

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.660
A transpose will be
minus the divergence.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.900
And this shows how
that-- just sort of shows

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.890
you the integration by
parts that makes that true.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:51.600
So, you know there's so many
integral formulas in this world

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.700
of vector calculus.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.450
But this is like, one to know.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.400
And actually, if
you want to know,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.980
OK what about the details,
where did that come from?

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.800
This actually turns
out to be, and the text

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.110
will make it clear, is
the divergence theorem.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:14.490
The divergence theorem gives
us this, this, exactly this,

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:23.220
so the divergence theorem
applied to the vector field u

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.070
times w.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.790
It turns out if I apply the
divergence theorem to that,

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.870
then I get a whole lot of terms
from the divergence of that,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.610
and they are these.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.270
And then I get this
for the boundary.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.650
The flux out.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.540
OK, so.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.870
I just didn't want to leave the
subject without writing down

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.110
the central thing.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.530
What does this tell us, then?

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.240
I have a region.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:03.430
In that region I have Laplace's
equation or Poisson's equation.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.710
Say Poisson.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.700
On the boundary.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.230
Now, this is the final
thing to ask you about.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.470
What are suitable
boundary conditions

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.220
for this problem in 2-D?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.200
Right?

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.840
In 1-D, by now we know
boundary conditions.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.500
We know the main ones.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.730
There's fixed, where u is given.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.780
Or there's free where
the slope is given.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.270
Now, what do we do here?

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:46.190
So this is where we used to be
in 1-D. That's a straight line.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.890
Not perfectly straight
but anyway, straight line.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.930
So 1-D there are only
two boundary points.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.400
The normal vector goes
that way, and that way.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.510
This is the n in this formula.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.950
I think if I just wrote
ordinary integration

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.980
by parts it would
look just the same

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.620
and my boundary
reduces to two points.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.940
Here my boundary's the
whole curve around.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:21.210
So what corresponds to
fixed boundary conditions,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.720
and what corresponds to
free boundary conditions?

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.860
So I want the-- What
corresponds to fixed,

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.940
those are the ones that
named after Dirichlet.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.110
Other names?

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.710
Or the rest will
be free, those are

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.420
the ones named after
Neumann, and those

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:49.040
are what we call natural
boundary conditions.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.810
So I haven't-- Just ready
to finish this story here.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.400
What are the possibilities?

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.900
Well, in each we could have part
of the boundary could be fixed.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.620
Part could be free.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.250
So fixed would mean say
some other boundary,

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.790
let me call this part
of the boundary fixed.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.470
So the temperature,
for example is fixed

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.090
on this part of the boundary.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.790
So this would be like, and this
might be the whole boundary.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.250
It might be fixed
on the whole one,

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.860
but I'm now allowing
the possibility

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:33.780
that we have here a fixed part
and here we have a free part.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:39.290
In fluids, here we have
fixed corresponds to,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.860
like, there's some
obstacle there.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.260
Some wall.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:50.960
Free is where the fluid is
coming in or flowing out.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.190
So there it's a
velocity condition.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.900
OK, so fixed conditions, these
Dirichlet ones, will be like,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:05.910
tell me what u is, u is given.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.150
On this part.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.780
So on part of the
boundary, or possibly all,

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.120
I could be given u=u_0.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:21.560
It could be zero, as it often
was in 1-D. Often just took u

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.660
to be zero.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.290
Now, what I'm asking
maybe for the first time,

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.060
is what's the free
boundary conditions?

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:35.200
Do we prescribe w=0 on the
free part of the boundary?

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.880
Is w=0 the correct
free condition?

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.480
Or w=w_0?

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.230
If we wanted to allow
it to be non-zero.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:49.830
That would sound right, right?
u on one side, w on the other.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.120
But now we're in 2-D.
u is still a scalar.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.430
That's fine.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.580
But w is now a vector.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.840
So if I was to prescribe w
on this part of the boundary,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.550
I'm giving you two
conditions, not one.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.630
And that's not good.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.050
I can't give you more than
one boundary condition.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.380
And the clue is there.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.340
It's w dot n, it's
the outward flow.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.340
That you could prescribe.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:24.200
You can't say in advance what
the tangential flow should be.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:30.150
So the free conditions
would be like w dot n,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:35.810
which is of course,
since w is v,

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:42.210
we have Laplace's equation here
with c=1 in between w and v,

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:49.240
so this is the gradient
of u dot n, grad u dot n,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.450
and it's sometimes written, the
derivative of u in the normal

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:54.960
direction.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.880
And that we can
prescribe as some w_0.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:05.150
Oh, I don't like to say
w_0 because w_0 makes

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.490
it sound like a vector
would be allowed,

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.420
and that's the whole point here.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:15.640
We give one boundary condition;
we either give u or w dot n.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:26.660
So let me give it some
different name, like F.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.160
So.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.940
I'll just ask one more
question to bring this home.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:36.130
And then I'll get on to the fun
today of fast Poisson solvers.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:45.270
What was the deal on in 1-D
when we had free-free boundary

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.650
conditions?

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.720
What was the deal in one
dimension when we had

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.720
free-free boundary conditions?

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.700
Both conditions were
slope conditions. u'=0.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.270
What matrix did we get?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:05.480
What was different about that
matrix, the free-free case?

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.730
I'm always looking back
to 1-D because that's

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.410
the case we really understood.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:15.440
What was the the problem
with the free-free matrix?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.580
It was singular.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.400
What was its name?

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.640
Was K, was it?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:27.520
You remember the first day of
class, the unforgettable four

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.490
matrices?

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.150
So this was fixed-fixed,
fixed-fixed.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:41.000
This one was, you could tell
me better than I can remember.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.430
T was free-fixed.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.360
And that was still OK.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.510
By OK I mean it was
still invertible.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.660
What was B?

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.700
Free-free, that's
what I'm looking at.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.480
And the problem with
free-free-- And then this

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.290
was periodic, that's
Fourier stuff that's

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.390
the next part of the course.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:08.250
But the point is that this
free-free was singular.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.320
Right?

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.420
And it'll be the same here.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.910
If the whole boundary
is free, then I've

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.180
got a singular problem.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.920
If I've got a whole
boundary that's free,

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.790
yeah actually I'll
just put it here.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:34.000
Suppose I have Laplace's
equation, zero,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.280
and suppose I make
the whole all free.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:47.850
So grad u dot n is zero
on the whole boundary.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:55.510
So it's like solving Bu=0.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.360
And the point is that
that has solutions.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.320
You remember, what
was in the null space

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.020
of B, this free-free case?

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.240
Bu=0, for what vector?

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.490
Our favorite guilty vector.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.160
It was constants.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.280
Right, all ones.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.000
All constants.
u=1, all constants.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.450
Right, so that was the
free-free case in 1-D. Now,

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:28.560
I just want you to tell me
the same thing over here.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.040
That equation does not
have a unique solution.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.130
So it's a singular problem.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.490
Here's the equation,
something u equals zero,

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:44.990
but you can tell me solutions
to that pure Neumann problem.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.970
That are not zero.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:52.140
So this is a problem where
there's a null space.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.480
And what is the solution?

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.460
What's a solution to this?

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.470
To the Laplace's equation
in the inside and slope

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:09.390
zero all around the boundary.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.010
There's a simple
solution to that one,

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.020
which is just like this guy.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.240
And do you see what it is?
u equal constant, right.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.730
So u equal constant.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:30.430
So I'd like you to see the
whole picture connecting

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.330
with what we fully
understood in the 1-D case

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.090
for those matrices.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:43.330
We don't expect to be able to
have a pure Neumann problem.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.670
A totally free problem.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.190
Because these, it'll
be singular and we'll

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.970
have to do something special.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:56.830
So the point is that it
would be enough for me just

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.280
to fix that little bit.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.210
If I just fix that little bit
and prescribe u=u_0 on a little

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:07.830
bit, I could make
the rest of it free.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.740
But I can't make it all free.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.660
OK.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:21.680
So those are things which, just
to complete the big picture

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.400
of Laplace's equation.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.720
OK, now I'm going
to turn to solving.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.410
So now I want to solve Laplace's
equation and then we'll have,

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.390
because we have the
review sessions coming

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:42.630
on Tuesday and Wednesday of the
past, now we're looking future.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.600
Forward.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.700
Ready to look forward.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.370
Laplace's equation.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.170
On a square.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.460
On a square.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.090
OK.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.200
So let me draw this square.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.330
Laplace's equation or
Poisson's equation.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.560
In a square.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.900
OK, I'm going to make it
the boundary conditions--

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.230
So I'm going to have a mesh.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.790
This is going to be
finite differences.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.390
Finite differences will
do fine on a square.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:20.180
As soon as I draw
this curved region,

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.980
I better be thinking
about finite elements.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.850
So that's what, today is
the, like, square day.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:32.250
OK, so square day I could
think of finite differences.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:40.270
I just draw a mesh,
let's make it small.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.790
So this is all known.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:47.620
These are all known values,
let me just say u is given.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.420
On the boundary.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:54.230
I'll do the Dirichlet problem.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:59.600
So at all these mesh
points, I know u.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.660
And I want to find u inside.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.850
So I've got nine
unknowns, right?

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.690
Nine interior mesh points.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.230
Three times three three.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.230
So I've got nine unknowns,
I want nine equations

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.300
and I'm thinking here
about difference equations.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:23.690
So let me write my
equation -u_xx-u_yy=f.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:35.340
Poisson.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.430
What finite difference--
I want to turn this

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.710
into finite differences.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:47.320
That'll be my system
of nine equations.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.646
And the unknowns will
be the nine values of u,

00:23:50.646 --> 00:23:52.840
so these are unknown.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.440
Right?

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.080
Those are the unknown.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.990
OK, and I need equations.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:04.690
So let me take a typical
mesh point, like this one.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.690
I'm looking for the finite
difference approximation

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.590
to the Laplacian.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.880
If you give me Laplace's
equation and I say OK,

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.270
what's a good finite
difference approximation,

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.880
that I can then put in
the computer and solve.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.180
I'm ready to do it.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.650
So what should we
do for this one?

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.050
For that term?

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.480
What's the natural,
totally natural thing

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.800
to do to replace-- the
finite difference replacement

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.040
of minus u_xx?

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.490
Second differences.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.900
Second differences.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:43.150
And with the minus sign
there, second differences

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.450
around this point will
be a minus one of there,

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.490
two of those, a
minus one of those.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:56.540
That second difference in the
x direction is my replacement.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.900
My approximation.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.460
And what about in
the y direction?

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.600
Same thing.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.130
Second differences,
but now vertically.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.900
So now I have minus
one, two more,

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.080
that makes this guy a four.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.810
And this is minus one.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.280
And on the right hand
side, I'll take the value

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.330
of f at the center point.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:22.360
Do you see that molecule?

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.650
Let me highlight
the molecule there.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.770
Four in the center,
minus ones beside it.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:37.740
Our matrix, we're going
to produce a KU=f matrix,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.360
and what's the K going to be?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.400
It's K2D.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.940
Let's give a name.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.450
A new name.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:44.710
We've had K forever.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.500
Let's have K2D.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.220
And u is, so tell me now
again just so we got,

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.160
what size is K2D for
this particular problem?

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.250
What's the shape of it?

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:02.950
How many unknowns
have I got in u?

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.000
Nine.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.080
Nine unknowns.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:13.080
And notice, of course,
near the boundary,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.080
if this was the-- Well
let me take the first one.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.120
What does the very first
row of K look like?

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.880
If I number nodes like this.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.830
So this will be node number one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.370
seven, eight, nine.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:31.220
So number one is sort
of close to a boundary.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:36.410
So I have here a minus one,
a two, and this is gone.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:40.810
That's like a column
of our matrix removed.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.080
Like a grounded
node, or whatever.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.520
But then I have the
vertical one minus one, two,

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.070
making this into a four.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.320
And this guy will
also be removed.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.670
So I think if I look at
K2D, it's nine by nine.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:01.640
I don't plan to
write all 81 entries.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.040
But I could write the first row.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.150
The first row comes
from the first equation.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.520
So the first row has an
f_1 on the right hand

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.510
side, f at this point.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.070
And what do you see,
what's on the diagonal?

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.140
Of K2D?

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.790
Four.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:25.100
And what's the rest of the row?

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:30.200
Well there's the next point
and it has a minus one.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.050
And then this point is
not connected to that,

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:33.870
so it's a zero.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:37.340
I'd better leave room
for nine by nine here.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.510
Four, minus one, zero.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:45.480
And now what about number,
the rest of the row?

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.980
So there's four is the
center, minus one, zero.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.720
And now I come to
here, so what's

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.060
the next entry in my matrix?

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.310
Minus one.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:59.080
We're multiplying the
unknown, the fourth unknown.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.780
And what about the
rest of the row?

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.610
This guy is not connected
to five, six, seven, eight,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:06.110
or nine.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:11.040
So now I have zero,
zero, zero, zero, zero.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.250
OK.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.120
So that would be
a row, that would

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.390
be a row that's sort
of different because it

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.680
corresponds to a
mesh point that's

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.510
way over near the corner.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.260
How about the fifth row?

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.240
What would be the fifth row of
K2D corresponding to this guy

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.320
that's right in the middle?

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.140
What's on the diagonal,
what's the 5, 5 entry of K2D?

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:39.701
Four.

00:28:39.701 --> 00:28:40.200
Good.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.530
I'm going to have a
diagonal of fours.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.020
I'm going to have fours all
the way down the diagonal.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.290
Because every point
the molecule is

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:52.150
centered at gives me the four,
and I just have a minus one

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:53.460
for its neighbor.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.210
And this guy has
all four neighbors.

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:02.140
They're all alive and
well, so there's a guy,

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.940
this is the fifth row.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.300
There's somebody right
next door on the left.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.700
Somebody right next
door on the right.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:15.950
And then do the other
minus ones go after that?

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.000
This is the whole point.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.200
I want you to see how
this K2D matrix looks.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.600
Because it's the one, it's
the equation we have to solve.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.450
So we've got to know what
this matrix looks like.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.030
So what's the point here?

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.960
Four, it's got a neighbor there.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.090
This was unknown number five.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.920
It's fourth unknown
and the sixth unknown,

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.120
what are the numbers
of these unknowns?

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.110
Two and eight.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:48.440
So this guy is going to have a
minus one in the two position.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.920
And then zero.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.510
And this guy, it'll also have
a minus one, is that nine?

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.410
Yeah, do you see how it's going?

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:03.450
I have a diagonal, I have
five diagonals somehow.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.470
I have diagonal, the
neighbor on the left,

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.390
the neighbor on the right,
the neighbor underneath,

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.630
and the neighbor above.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:17.380
Across the street you could say.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.990
So our matrix, this
very important matrix,

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:24.270
more attention has
gone into how to solve

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:30.320
this equation for that matrix
than any other single specific

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.340
example in numerical analysis.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.700
It's just a model problem.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.190
And what do I notice
about this matrix?

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.780
So now you see it's
got five diagonals.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.740
But, and what's the big but?

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.000
The big but is that those
five diagonals don't run,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.290
it's not just a band
of five because you

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:02.370
don't get to the one
up above until you've

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:09.470
gone all the way-- You
see the bandwidth is big.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:16.080
If my matrix-- If this is one,
two up to n, and this is one,

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:22.050
two up to n, then how
many unknowns have I got?

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.600
Just think big now.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.500
We're in 2-D, think 2-D. How
many unknowns have I got?

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.870
N was three in the
picture, but now you're

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.760
kind of visualizing
a much finer grid.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.570
How many unknowns?

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.730
N squared unknowns, right?

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.470
One to N in each direction.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.620
So we've got the matrix
of size N squared.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.240
Way bigger, way bigger.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.780
I mean if N was ten, our
matrix is of size 100.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.840
And of course, that's
completely simple.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.770
The real question is when N
becomes 1,000 and our matrix

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.680
is of size a million.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.990
And those get solved every day.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.940
So, question is how.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.150
Actually this, for a
million by million matrix,

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:15.650
this fast Poisson solver that I
want to describe does it great.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:21.340
Actually, so you can deal with
a matrix of order a million

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.130
without turning a hair.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.670
OK now, but can we
understand that matrix?

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:29.580
So suppose N is 100.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.830
Just to have us--
What's the story?

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.100
This matrix, then.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.250
What's the size of that matrix?

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.160
Did I say 100?

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.500
Or 1,000, do you want
to think really big?

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.870
I guess I said 1,000.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.430
To get up to a million.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.390
OK, so N is 1,000,
so we have a 1,000

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.940
by 1,000, a million unknowns.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.550
My matrix is a
million by a million.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.510
Let me ask you this.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.840
Here's the question
that I want to ask you.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.770
What's the bandwidth?

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:09.900
How far from the main
diagonal out to the last-- out

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.020
to that minus one.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:18.920
In other words, this is really
the full band of the matrix.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.470
It's got a lot of
zeroes inside the band.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.270
A whole bunch.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:28.630
Maybe 990 something
zeroes in here.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:34.890
And in here, and how far
is it from here to here?

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.450
1,000, right?

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.080
It's 1,000.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.430
So the bandwidth is 1,000.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:46.700
And what if I do
ordinary, so now I

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.120
want to begin to think how
do I solve this equation?

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.110
How do I work with that matrix?

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.780
And you have an
idea of that matrix?

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.140
It's a beautiful
matrix to work with.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.980
It's very like
our K matrix; it's

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:07.730
just up to 2-D. In fact, it's
closely connected to our-- K2D

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.870
will be closely
connected to K and that's

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:13.850
what makes life possible here.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:21.250
But suppose I had to
solve this equation.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:25.600
Alright, so I give it to MATLAB
just as a system of equations.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.820
A million equations,
a million unknowns.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:32.580
So MATLAB takes a gulp
and then it tries, OK?

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.040
So ordinary elimination,
that's what backslash does.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.440
By the way this
matrix is symmetric,

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.500
and, you won't be surprised,
it's positive definite.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.540
Everything is nice
about that matrix.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.940
In fact more than I've said.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:56.400
OK, what happens if I do
elimination on that matrix?

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.950
How long does it
take, how fast is it?

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:03.750
Well, MATLAB will take
advantage, or any code,

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:10.610
will take advantage of
all these zeroes, right?

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:14.040
In other words, what do
I mean by take advantage?

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.670
And what do I mean
by elimination?

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:19.290
You remember I'm going to
subtract multiples of this row.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:24.370
There'll be a minus one
below it on this guy.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:29.590
This row that has some fours
and some minus ones, whatever.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:32.900
Elimination, I'm subtracting
a multiple of this row

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:37.470
from this row to get that
minus one to be a zero, right?

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.440
I'm eliminating this
entry in the matrix.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:47.580
This is ordinary LU, this
is ordinary LU of K2D.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.210
I'm sort of thinking
through LU of K2D.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.180
And what I'm going to
conclude is that there

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.040
ought to be a better way.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.560
It's such a special
matrix, and it's

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.490
going to be messed up by LU.

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:02.470
And what do I mean by messed up?

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:08.730
I mean that all these great
zeroes, 990-something zeroes

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:16.950
there and there, inside the
band, are going to fill in.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.670
That's the message,
if you want to talk

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.660
about solving large
linear systems,

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:27.560
the big issue is fill in.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.200
It's a sparse matrix.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.490
That's typical.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.650
We have a local operator
here, so we expect

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:36.080
a very local, sparse matrix.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.560
Large sparse matrices
is what we're doing now.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.860
And the problem is that--
Zeroes here will never

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.290
get touched because we
don't need any elimination,

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.630
they're already zero.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:54.680
But all this diagonal
of minus ones when we do

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.740
eliminations to make
those zero, then

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:03.920
some non-zeroes are going to
come in and fill in the zeroes.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.720
So the work, how much work
would elimination be, actually?

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:15.540
We could even think about that.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:19.910
Can I just give the result for
how much time would elimination

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:20.970
take?

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.540
Ordinary elimination.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:28.320
So I have N squared
rows to work on.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.420
N squared rows to work
on, and then the distance,

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.680
that distance was
what in terms of N?

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.330
The width there is?

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.990
N, right?

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.660
It was about 1,000.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:46.590
So I get N numbers here and
I have to work on N numbers

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:52.540
below.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.990
To clean up a column I'm working
with a vector of length N

00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:01.670
and I'm subtracting
it from N rows below.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:05.620
So cleaning up a column
takes me N squared operation.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:10.150
The total then is N^4.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:14.370
N^4, for elimination.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.170
And that's not acceptable.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:16.730
Right?

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:20.970
If N is 1,000, I'm up to 10^12.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:28.110
So elimination is not a good
way to solve-- Elimination,

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.830
in this ordering, ha.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.650
Yeah.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:36.520
So can I tell you two
ways, two better ways

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.590
to deal with this problem?

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:42.930
So two better ways to
deal with this problem.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:49.600
One is, and MATLAB have
a code that would do it,

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.930
one is to change from this
ordering one, two, three, four,

00:38:54.930 --> 00:39:00.020
five, six, seven, eight, nine,
change to a different ordering

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.360
that had less fill-in.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:09.550
So that's a substantial part
of scientific computing.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:15.340
Is to re-order the unknowns.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.687
To reduce the number of
wasted, fill-in things

00:39:20.687 --> 00:39:22.270
that you have to
fill in, and then you

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.080
have to eliminate out again.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.990
And I can get that N^4
down quite a bit that way.

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:34.090
OK, so that's a
topic of importance

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.470
in scientific computing.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.790
Is given a large linear system,
put the rows and columns

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.260
in a good order.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.330
OK, and that's something
you hope the machine can do.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:53.030
The machine will have a record
of where are the non-zeroes.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.400
And then so you run
the little, you really

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.080
run the program twice.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.690
You run it once without
using the numbers.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:04.220
Just the positions of
non-zeroes to get a good

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:08.310
ordering so that the
number of elimination steps

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:09.920
will be way down.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.500
And then you run it with the
numbers in that good order

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.340
to do the elimination.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:21.190
So that's a topic of,
one topic in this.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.440
But.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:31.310
Today's topic is using the
fact that this is a square.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.290
That this matrix
has a special form.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:38.150
That we can actually find its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.270
And that's what makes
a fast Poisson solver.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.020
So that's the topic
of the lecture

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.820
and the topic of the
next section in the book.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.430
And I will get
started on it now,

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.750
and then complete it Wednesday.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:58.060
So I want to take this
particular K2D for a square

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:05.120
and show a different way to
solve the equations that uses

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.880
the fast Fourier transform.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:14.550
When I see, when you see, a
regular mesh, regular numbers,

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:19.440
nothing varying,
constant diagonals,

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.480
think fast Fourier transform.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.600
The FFT has got
a chance when you

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.860
have matrices like this one.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:32.630
And this I want to
show you how it works.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.880
I want to show you
the underlying idea,

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.470
and then we'll see the
details of the fast Fourier

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:40.180
transform in the
Fourier section.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.540
So, of course, everybody
knows the third part

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.470
of this course, which
is coming up next week,

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:51.600
we'll be well into it,
is the Fourier part.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.200
OK.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.600
But I can give
you, because we've

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.000
seen the eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of K,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.670
I can do this now.

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:04.590
Ready for the smart idea?

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:07.250
The good way, and it
only works because this

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.370
is a square, because the
coefficients are constant,

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:14.460
because everything's
beautiful, here's the idea.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.620
OK.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:26.340
Central idea.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:31.370
The idea is, so I
have this matrix K2D

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:35.610
and I'm trying to solve a system
with that particular matrix.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:38.250
And the fantastic
thing about this matrix

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:43.810
is that I know what its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:44.470
are.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:47.070
So let's suppose we know them.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:55.040
So I know (K2D)y = lambda*y.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.140
y is an eigenvector,
and remember

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.430
it's got N squared components.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.420
Lambda's a number.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:07.710
And I've got a whole lot of
these, y_k, lambda_k, y_k.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:16.850
And I've got k going
from one up to N squared.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.340
Now I want to use them.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.330
I want to use them
to solve (K2D)u=f.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:33.820
Let me say, it's totally
amazing that I would,

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.400
in fact this is the only
important example I know

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.580
in scientific computing,
in which I would use

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.760
the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the matrix

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.020
to solve a linear system.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:49.020
You see, normally you think of
eigenvalue problems as like,

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.350
those are harder.

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:55.780
It's more difficult to solve
this problem than this one.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.700
Normally, right?

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.670
That's the way to
think about it.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:06.720
But for this special
matrix, we can figure out

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.690
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
by pencil and paper.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:14.640
So we know what these guys are.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:20.120
And that will give us a way
to solve a linear system.

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.800
So can I remember, this
is now central message.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:33.160
What are the three steps
that to use eigenvectors

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:39.130
and eigenvalues in
solving linear equations,

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:42.180
in solving differential
equations, in solving

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:46.080
difference equations, they're
always the same three steps.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.280
Can I remember what
those three steps are?

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:56.360
So step one, so I'm supposing
that I know these guys.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.900
First of all, that's amazing.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.680
To know them in advance.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.830
And the second amazing
thing is that they

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:04.490
have beautiful structure.

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:08.280
And those facts make it
possible to do something

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.140
you would never expect to do.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.320
Use eigenvalues for
a linear system.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.550
So here's the way to
do it, three steps.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:23.130
One, expand f as a combination
of the eigenvectors, c_1*y_1,

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:27.620
up to however many we've got.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.000
We've got N squared of them.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.670
Gosh, we're loaded
with eigenvectors.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:41.270
Do you remember, this a
column of size N squared.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.530
Our problem has size N squared.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.940
So it's big, a million.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:50.090
So I'm going to expand f
in terms of the million

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.660
eigenvectors.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.170
OK.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.530
So that tells me
the right hand side.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:01.250
Now, you remember step two in
this one, two, three process?

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:05.170
Step two is the easy
one, because I want

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:06.890
to get, what am I looking for?

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:10.690
I'm aiming for, of course,
the answer I'm aiming for

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:15.930
is K2D inverse f.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:16.430
Right?

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:17.930
That's what I'm shooting for.

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:22.150
That's my goal,
that's the solution.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:27.100
So here I've got f in
terms of the eigenvectors.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:32.950
Now I want to get, how do I get
u in terms of the eigenvectors?

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:39.740
Well, what's the eigenvalue for
the inverse, for K2D inverse?

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.050
Do you remember?

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:43.800
It's one over.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.530
It's one over the
eigenvalue, right?

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:53.090
If this is true, then this will
be true with lambda_k inverse.

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.390
It's simple and I
won't stop to do it,

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:57.660
but we could come back to it.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.630
So I know how to
get K2D inverse.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:03.340
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.860
I'm going to divide, so
here's the fast step.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:14.370
Divide c_k, each of
those c_k's, by lambda_k.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.730
What do I have now?

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:26.730
I've got c_1/lambda_1*y_1
plus c_(N squared),

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.700
the last guy divided by
its eigenvalue times its

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.960
eigenvector.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.460
And that's the answer.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.300
Right, that's the
correct answer.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:45.320
If this is the right hand side,
then this is the solution.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.640
Because why?

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.400
Because when I multiply
this solution by K2D

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.570
it multiplies every
eigenvector by the eigenvalue,

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:57.030
it cancels all the
lambdas, and I get f.

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:01.570
Do you see-- I can't raise
that board, I'm sorry.

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.820
Can you see it at the back?

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:08.310
Should I write it up here
again, because everything

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:09.960
hinges on that.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:16.620
The final, the answer
u, the K2D inverse f,

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.550
is the same combination
that gave f.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:26.290
But I divide by lambda_1,
c_2 y, the second eigenvector

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:28.750
over lambda_2 and so on.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:34.440
Because when I multiply by
K2D, multiplying each y,

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.570
each eigenvector will
bring out an eigenvalue,

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:41.800
it will cancel that and
I'll have the original f.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.040
So do you see that
those are the steps?

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.460
The steps are, you have to
do a-- you could say it's

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.130
a transform into eigenspace.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:55.140
I take my vector
in physical space,

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.690
it's got its N
squared component.

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:01.320
At physical points.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.780
I express it in eigenspace.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.970
By that I mean it's a
combination of the eigenvectors

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:09.980
and now the N squared
physical values

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:18.170
are N squared amplitudes, or
amounts of each eigenvector.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:21.850
So that was a, that's the
Fourier series idea, that's

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:26.260
the Fourier transform idea,
it just appears everywhere.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:30.200
Express the function
in the good basis.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.170
We're using these
good functions.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:35.430
In these good functions,
the answer is simple.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:38.440
I'm just dividing by lambda.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.660
Do you see that I'm just
dividing by lambda, where

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.430
if it was a
differential equation--

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:45.120
This is just what we did
for differential equations.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.060
What did I do for
differential equations?

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.640
Do you mind if I just ask you?

00:49:51.640 --> 00:50:01.460
If I was solving
dU/dt=(K2D)U. Starting from f,

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:06.730
start with U(0) as f.

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:10.250
I just want to draw the analogy.

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:12.110
How did we solve
these equations?

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:16.100
I expanded f in terms
of the eigenvector,

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.820
and then what was step two?

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.970
For the differential
equation, I didn't divide

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:26.840
by lambda_k, what did I do?

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.220
I multiplied by e^(lambda_k*t).

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.270
You see, it's the same trick.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:37.160
Just get it in eigenspace.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:41.360
In eigenspace it's like
one tiny problem at a time.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.850
You're just following
that normal mode,

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:47.170
and so here instead
of dividing by lambda,

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:49.840
I multiplied by e^(lambda*t).

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.930
And for powers of-- For
K2D to the 100th power,

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.550
I would multiply by
lambda to the hundredth.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:59.820
Here, I have K2D to
the minus first power.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:03.100
So I'm multiplying by
lambdas to the minus one.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:10.820
OK, and the key point is that
these c's can be found fast.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.400
And this summing up
can be done fast.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.740
Now that's what's
also very exceptional.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.980
And that's where
the FFT comes in.

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:26.300
The fast Fourier transform is a
fast way to get into eigenspace

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.130
and to get back.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:31.950
When eigenspace happens
to be frequency space.

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:35.810
You see that's the key.

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:40.750
In other words these y's and
lambdas that I said we knew,

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:48.130
these y's, the eigenvectors,
are pure sine vectors.

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:53.060
So that this is an expansion,
is a sine transform.

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:56.810
S-I-N-E. A pure sine transform.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:00.940
And that can be done fast,
and it can be inverted fast.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:05.630
So you see, what makes this
fast Poisson solver work,

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:09.150
is I have to know
eigenvectors and eigenvalues,

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:13.480
and they have to be fantastic
vectors like sine vectors.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:18.470
OK, so I'll give you more, the
final picture, the details,

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:21.308
Wednesday and then move
on to finite elements.
