00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.430
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK,
so this is the start --

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.780
I won't be able to do
it all in one day --

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:34.380
of what I think of as the number
one model in applied math,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.540
in discrete implied
math, I'll say.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.430
Let me review what
our four examples are.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.700
Just so you see the big picture.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.290
So the first example was
the springs and masses.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.360
That was beautiful.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.750
It's simple.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.850
The masses are all in a
line, and the matrix K,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.840
the free-fixed and
fixed-fixed and free-free

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.480
come out closely related
to our K, T, B matrices.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.120
So that was the
natural place to start,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.290
and actually we
also got a chance

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.390
to do the most important
equation in time.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.750
Ku''-- Sorry, Mu''+Ku=0.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.330
So that was a key example.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.740
Then least squares.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.930
Very important, I'm
already getting questions

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.430
from the class about problems
that come up in your work,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.120
least square problems.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:46.840
Maybe I'll just mention that
the professional numerical guys

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.050
don't always go
to A transpose A.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.740
If it's a badly
conditioned problem,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.470
and that conditioning is
a topic that was in 1.7

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.860
and we'll eventually
come back to, if it's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.190
a badly conditioned problem,
matrix A then-- A transpose

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.090
A kind of makes it worse.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.844
So there's another way to
orthogonalize in advance.

00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:10.760
And if you're working
with orthogonal vectors,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.870
or orthonormal vectors,
numerical calculations

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.090
are as safe as they can be.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.520
Yeah.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.080
Wall Street is more
like A transpose A.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.930
And the orthonormal
is the safe way.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.270
Alright, this is
today's lecture.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.870
You'll see the matrix a
for a graph, for a network.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.310
It's simple to construct, and
it just shows up everywhere.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.930
Because networks are everywhere.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.720
And, just, looking
ahead, trusses

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.250
are there partly because
they're the most fun.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.790
You'll enjoy trusses.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.520
I mean, it's kind
of fun to figure out

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.920
is the truss going
to collapse or not.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.450
It's good.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.450
And actually, what's the
linear algebra in there?

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.740
The collapsing or not will
depend on solutions to Au=0.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.220
Let me just recall
the equation Au=0.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.310
If A is our key matrix
in each example,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.700
it's different in each example.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.050
And we sort of hope that
Au=0 doesn't have solutions,

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.780
or that it has
solutions we know.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.270
Because if Au=0 has solutions
that's the case where A

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.170
transpose A is not invertible
and we have to do something.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.630
Very useful to review.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.280
What were the solutions to
Au=0, in the case of springs?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.070
Well, there were some
in the free-free case.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.130
The all ones vector
was the solution u,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.740
or all constant
was the solution u

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.040
in the free-free case and that's
why we couldn't invert it.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.230
But the fixed-free
or the fixed-fixed,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.410
when we have one
support or two supports,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.640
that removed the
all ones solution.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.020
Good.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.680
Least squares, we assume
there weren't any.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.740
We assumed-- Because we
wanted to work directly

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.690
with A transpose A,
the normal equations,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.910
so we assumed that the
columns of A were independent.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.010
We assumed that there were no
non-zero solutions to Au=0.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.600
Because if there
were, that would

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.920
have made A
transpose A singular,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.650
and we would have had to
do something different.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.100
Here, this'll be a
lot like this one.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.370
Today, once you see A, you'll
spot the solutions to Au=0.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.530
This is A for a network.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.770
And the solution is going to
be that same guy, all ones.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.840
And that only tells us again
that we have to ground a node,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.350
I may use an electrical term.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.710
Grounding a node is like
fixing a displacement.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.420
Once you've fixed one
of those, say at zero,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.430
whatever, but zero's
the natural choice.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.040
Once you've said one of the
potentials, one of the voltages

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.670
is zero, then you
know all the rest.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.700
You can find all the
rest from our equations.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.650
So this is like this in
having this all ones solution.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.980
And as you'll see
with trusses, that

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.500
could, depending on the
truss, have more solutions.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.340
And if there are
more solutions that's

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.170
when the truss collapses.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.670
So the trusses need more
than just a single support

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.800
to hold up a whole truss.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.590
OK.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.330
So that's the Au=0.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.220
Now we're ready for
the lecture itself.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.290
Graphs and networks.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.850
OK, let me start
with, what's a graph.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.190
A graph is a bunch
of nodes and some

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.390
or all of the
edges between them.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.840
Let me take just a particular
example of a graph.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.570
And this of course
you spot in the book.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.070
Oh and everybody
recognized that,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.050
and it's probably now corrected,
that in the homework where

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.560
it said 3.4 it meant
2.4, of course.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.080
And this is Section 2.4 now.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.920
Let me draw a different graph.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.080
Maybe it'll have four
nodes, at those four edges,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.300
let me put in a fifth edge.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.000
OK, that's a graph.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.970
It's not a complete
graph because I

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.930
didn't include that extra edge.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.100
It's not a tree because
there are some loops here.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.750
So complete graphs
are one extreme where

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.350
all the edges are in.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.860
A tree is the other
extreme, where you

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.610
have a minimum number of edges.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.560
It would only take
probably three edges.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.860
So just while we're
looking at it,

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.490
there are a bunch
of possible trees

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.540
that would be sort
of inside this graph.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.220
Sub-graphs of this graph, if
I knock out those two edges

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.670
I have a tree, going out.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.120
Or a tree could be like this.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.720
Or a tree could be like this.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:48.830
Anyway, five edges is in this
graph, six in a complete graph,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.640
it would be three
edges in a tree.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.270
OK, and the number
of edges is always m.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.040
So five edges.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.160
And the number of nodes
is always n, for nodes.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.720
So A will be five by four.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.030
OK.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:15.020
And it's called, so we get a
special name in this world,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.490
it's called the incidence
matrix of the graph.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.820
The incidence matrix.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.290
Or, of course,
these things come up

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.380
so often they have
other names, too.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.120
But incidence matrix is
a pretty general name.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.960
OK, I have to number
the nodes just

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.610
so we can create the matrix
A. One, two, three, four.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.180
And I have to number the edges.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.860
If I don't number them, I
don't know which is which.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:48.250
So let me call this edge
one, from one to two,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.320
and I'll draw an
arrow on the edges.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.890
So from one to
two, maybe this'll

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.020
be edge two, from one to three.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.590
This'll be edge three.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.670
Oh no, let me put edge three
there, would be a natural one,

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.640
say from two to three.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.330
And how about edge four
there, from two to four.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.070
And edge five going
from three to four.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:18.450
OK, so now I have numbered,
I've identified the nodes,

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.640
and I've identified the edges.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.390
And there were five
edges and four nodes.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.590
Usually m is bigger than n.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.590
We're in this--
Except for trees,

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:34.720
m will be at least
as large as n.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.630
And I've put arrows
on, so you could

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.370
say it's a directed graph.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.280
Because I've given a direction.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.020
You'll see that the directions,
those arrow directions, which

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:51.180
are just to tell me which way
current should count as plus,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.490
if it's with the arrow, or which
way it should count as minus

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.970
if it's against the arrow.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.600
Of course, current
could go either way.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.970
It's just, now I have a
convention of which is plus

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.230
and which is minus.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.745
OK, so now let me tell
you the incidence matrix.

00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:10.700
So everybody can
get it right away,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.950
how do you create
this incidence matrix?

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.270
A five by four.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.710
So it's going to have five
rows, one for every edge.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.670
So what's the row for edge one?

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.320
And it's got four columns,
one for every node.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.710
So these are the nodes.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.370
Nodes one, two, three, four.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.750
So there's a column for every
node and a row for every edge.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.900
OK, edge one.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.720
This is just going to tell me
everything about the graph.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.330
So exactly what's in that
picture will be in this matrix.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.650
If I've erased one,
I could reproduce it

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.170
by knowing the other one.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.350
OK, edge one goes from
node one to node two.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.270
So it leaves node one,
I'll put a minus one there.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.530
In the first column.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:05.660
And a plus one in
the second column.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.680
Edge one doesn't touch
nodes three and four.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.670
So there you go,
that's edge one.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.690
Let me do edge two
and then you'll

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.080
be able to fill in the rest.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.850
So edge two goes from one to
three, minus one, and a one.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:27.170
Edge three goes from two to
three, I'll just keep going.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.980
Minus one and a one.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:35.660
Edge four goes from two to four.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:43.370
And edge five goes
from three to four.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.910
OK.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.060
Simple, right?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.910
Got it.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.510
That matrix has got all
the information that's

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:56.700
in my picture, and the matrix--
But the point about matrices

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.360
is, they do something.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.740
They multiply a vector
u to produce something.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.890
They have a meaning beyond
just a record of the picture.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.460
So A is a great thing.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.300
In fact, what does it do?

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.430
Let's see.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.050
So that's the matrix
A that we work with.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.930
Oh, first tell me about Au=0.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.500
Because we brought up
that subject already.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.460
Are those four
columns independent?

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.010
I've got four columns,
they're sitting

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.540
in five-dimensional space,
there's plenty of room

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.100
there for four
independent vectors.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.530
Are these four columns
independent vectors?

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.400
No.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.420
No, they're not.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.780
Because what combination
of them produces the zero

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.100
vector? [1, 1, 1, 1].

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.010
If I take that column plus
that, plus that, plus that,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:54.160
I'm multiplying by-- So, A,
I'll just put that up here

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.920
and then I won't have
to write it again.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:05.430
A times [1, 1, 1, 1],
is five zeroes.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:10.670
So that u, that
particular u, of all ones,

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:17.260
is, I would say, in the
null space of the matrix.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.970
The null space is all
the solutions at Au=0.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.830
In other words, so
these four columns,

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.690
tell me about the
geometry again.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:31.300
These four columns, if I take
all their combinations, yeah.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.320
Think about this.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.020
If I take all four
combinations, all combinations,

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.910
any amount of this
column, this column,

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.780
this column, that
fourth column, those

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.430
are all vectors in
five-dimensional space.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.270
Now, this isn't
essential but it's good.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.770
Do you have an idea
of what you'd get?

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.140
What would you get if you took,
so this, think of four vectors,

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.890
pointing along, take
all their combinations,

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.180
that kind of fills in.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.540
Whatever fill in may mean.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.030
And what does it fill in?

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.320
What do I get?

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.620
What's your image?

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.700
Frankly, I don't know.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.990
I can't visualize
five-dimensional space.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.840
That well.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.060
But still, we can use words.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.290
What do you think?

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.480
You get a something subspace.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.180
You got a something,
you get something flat.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.110
I don't know if you do.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.520
It's pretty flat, somehow.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.200
Like I'm just asking you to
jump up from a case we know.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.780
Where we had columns in
three-dimensional space

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.830
and we took a combination
and they gave us a plane.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.830
Right, when they were dependent?

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.970
Now, how would you
visualize the combinations

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.250
in five-dimensional space?

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.780
Just for the heck of it?

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.250
It's some kind of a
subspace, I would say.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.600
And what's its dimension, maybe
that's what I want to ask you.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.640
What's the dimension?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.770
Do I get, like, a
four-dimensional subspace

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.950
of five-dimensional space
when I take the combinations

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.800
of these particular four guys?

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.680
Yes or no?

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.880
Do I get a
four-dimensional subspace,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.730
whatever that may mean?

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.870
No.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.680
Right answer, I don't.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.210
I don't.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.900
Somehow the dimension of that
subspace, whatever I get,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.990
isn't four because
this fourth guy is not

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.060
contributing anything new.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.270
The fourth one is a
combination of the first three.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.620
So I get a
three-dimensional subspace.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.340
The rank of this
matrix is three.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.960
If you allow me to
introduce that key word,

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:52.360
rank is the number of
independent columns.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:58.240
It tells you how big
the matrix really is.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.140
You know, if the
matrix, if I pile

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:05.290
on a whole lot of zero
columns, or a lot of zero rows,

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.490
the matrix looks bigger.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.050
But of course it
isn't truly bigger.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.930
The heart of the matrix,
the core of the matrix

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.170
is somehow just three.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:20.690
And actually, I tell you
now and we'll see it happen,

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.090
can I tell you the key
result in the first half

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.960
of linear algebra?

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.160
It's this.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.100
That if I have three independent
columns, and by the way

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.170
any three are independent,
it's just all four

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.790
together are dependent.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.690
This has three
independent columns,

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.090
then the great fact is, it
has three independent rows.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.880
That's kind of fantastic.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:51.040
Since it's such a beautiful
and remarkable and basic fact,

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.100
look at the rows.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.070
That what linear
algebra is all about.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.920
Looking at a matrix by
columns, and then by rows,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.090
and seeing what are
the connections.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.770
And the connection
is, the key connection

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:09.750
is, that these five rows,
now what space are they in?

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.840
What what space
are these rows in?

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.300
Four-dimensional space.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.280
They only have four components.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:24.220
So I had four columns in
5-D, I have five rows in 4-D.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.720
But now, are those
five rows independent?

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.780
Let me just ask that question.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.060
Are those five
independent rows, are

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.370
they pointing in
different directions,

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.690
or could any combination
give the zero vector in 4-D,

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.950
looking at those five rows?

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.500
What do you say, wait a minute.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.760
Five vectors, in
four-dimensional space?

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.190
Dependent, of course.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.690
Right.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.870
So they're dependent.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.240
There couldn't be five
independent vectors in 4-D.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:00.050
But are there four in
this particular case?

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.850
And here's the great
fact, no, there are three.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:08.190
If there are three independent
columns and no more,

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.270
then there are three
independent rows and no more.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.200
And we'll get to see which
rows are independent.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.140
And which are not.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.290
That's a question
about A transpose,

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.340
and we haven't got
to A transpose yet.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.650
OK, are you OK with
that incidence matrix?

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:36.640
Because this is like the
central matrix of our subject.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.310
We can figure out A transpose
A, that's kind of fun.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.860
If I do A transpose
A then you'll

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:49.210
see the core computations
of this neat section.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.990
So if I do A transpose A, so I'm
going to bring in A transpose

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.570
and you know that I'm not just
bringing it in from nowhere,

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.740
that networks--
the balance law is

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.890
going to involve A transpose.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.930
So let's just anticipate.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.390
What do you think A
transpose A looks like?

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.730
Now, how am I going
to do this for you?

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.280
May I write-- May I
erase this for a moment,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.780
and try to squeeze
in A transpose here?

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:25.570
So that you can multiply it
by sight and see the answer,

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.150
and then you'll see the pattern.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.370
That's the great
thing about math.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.660
You do a few
examples, and you hope

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.860
that a pattern reveals itself.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.500
So let me show A transpose.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.950
So now I'm going to take that
column and make it a row.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.530
I'm going to take that
column and make it a row,

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.770
it's going to be a little
squeezed but we can do it.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:56.510
Take that column,
[0, 1, 1, 0,  -1].

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:01.060
And the last column,
[0, 0, 0,  1, 1].

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.300
OK.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.130
So I just wrote
A transpose here.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:10.040
And now could you help
me with A transpose A.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.350
Which is the key matrix
in the graph here.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.040
What size will it be?

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.160
Everybody knows it's
going to be square,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.010
it's going to be symmetric,
and just tell me the size.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:23.940
Four by four.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.170
Right, we have a four by
five times a five by four,

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.110
we're expecting this
to be four by four.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.840
And what's the first entry?

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.120
Two.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.770
Right, take row one,
dot it with column one.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:44.070
I get two ones and then a bunch
of zeroes, so I just get a two.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.030
What's the next entry?

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:50.140
Take row one against column two,
can you do that in your head?

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:56.890
Row one, column two, the top one
is going to hit on a minus one,

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.790
and I think that's
all there is, right?

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.840
Then this one hits a zero
and those three zeroes, so.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.810
And then what about
the next guy here?

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.830
A minus one.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.170
And the last guy?

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.940
A zero.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.310
So that's row one
of A transpose A.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:24.000
Can I just look at that
for a moment before I fill

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.750
in the rest?

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:30.490
And then, when you fill in the
rest it'll confirm the idea.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.950
Why do I have a zero there?

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:38.040
Why did a zero appear
in the 1, 4 position?

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.260
If I look back at
the graph, what

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.390
is it about nodes one and four
that told me ahead of time?

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:49.060
You're going to get a zero
in that A transpose A.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.580
Everybody see what
nodes one and four are?

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.460
Yeah, say it again.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.540
Not connected.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.360
No edge.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.980
Here there was an edge
from node one to two.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.070
Here is an edge from
node one to three.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.330
Those both produce
the minus ones.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:11.300
And on the diagonal came
the two to balance it.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.900
What does that two represent?

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.000
That two represents
the number of edges

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.600
that do go into node one.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.450
See, that row is
all about node one.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.520
So there are two edges into
it, and then an edge out,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.310
and an edge out, and the
edge out and the no edge.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.410
OK.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.990
So, now I know it's going
to be a symmetric matrix,

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.040
so I could speed up
and fill those in.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.590
What's the next entry here?

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.670
What's the guy on this diagonal?

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:45.500
So that's row two
against column two,

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.770
so I have a one
there, a one there,

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.300
a one there, that makes a three.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.510
Why a three?

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.970
Because there are,
yeah, you got it.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:04.460
There are three edges
into node number two.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.770
Three edges into
node number two,

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:10.070
and now I'm going to have some
minus ones off the diagonal

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.900
for those edges.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:16.050
So what are these
entries going to be here?

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.890
They're both minus ones.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.320
Edge two is connected to
all three other nodes.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.100
So I'm going to see a minus
one and a minus one there,

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.530
and it's going to be symmetric.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:32.770
And I'm nearly there.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.860
Of course, I'm
describing a pattern

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:40.040
that you're just
seeing unfold, but I'm

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.430
doing it that way so
that you'll feel hey,

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.180
I can write down A
transpose A, or check it

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:50.620
quite quickly, without
doing this complete matrix

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.620
multiplication.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.510
So what number goes there?

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.530
That's to do with
node three, and I

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:59.090
see node three connected
to all three other nodes,

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.000
and so what do you expect there?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.310
Minus one there, and
a minus one there,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.190
and what do you expect here?

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.600
Two.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:13.500
And so now I have my matrix.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.490
The A transpose A matrix.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.660
And that's square
and it's symmetric.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.150
Now I ask you, is it
positive definite?

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.980
Or is it only semi-definite?

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.090
Right, we know that A transpose
A is always positive definite

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.720
in the best case.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.030
But only positive
semi-definite if it's singular,

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.790
if there's some vector
in its null space,

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.390
if a transpose a times
some vector gives zero.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:42.540
If some combination
of those columns

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.360
gives me the zero column.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.110
Which is it?

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:52.510
Have I got a singular matrix
or an invertible matrix here?

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.070
Singular.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.650
Why singular?

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.750
Because a had some
solutions to Au=0.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:06.020
So if Au equaled zero, then
I could multiply both sides

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.710
by A transpose, that same
u, A transpose times zero

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:14.480
will still be zero, it might
be a different size zero,

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.140
but it'll be zero.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.750
And what's the u, then?

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.740
It's the all ones vector.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:27.360
What am I saying about the
columns of A transpose A?

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.050
They're dependent.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.480
They add up-- Because
it's the [1, 1, 1, 1]

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.240
vector that's guilty,
every row adds to zero.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.480
Every row adds to zero.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.360
Let me just say for a moment,
introduce two notation

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:50.040
for the diagonal matrix.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.640
D, that's the diagonal matrix,
two, three, three, two.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.220
And then I'll put
in a minus sign,

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:02.780
and this is and I'll
call it W. So you

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:07.270
can pick out what D and W are,
but let me do it for sure.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:11.880
So D, the degree matrix.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.750
See, this is this is like fun
because I'm not doing anything

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.250
yet.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.440
I'm just giving names here.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.380
Two, three, three, two.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.340
The degree of a node,
the degree means

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.100
how many edges go from it.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.290
How many edges touch it.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:32.890
And W is also a
great matrix, it's

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:42.920
called the adjacency matrix.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.440
It's also beautiful.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.800
Now it'll have plus ones
because I wanted minus W,

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:55.310
so it has, these nodes are
not adjacent to themselves

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.090
but it's got this
one and this one

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:01.400
and this one this one and
that one, and that's a zero.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:06.000
So there are five,
the adjacency matrix

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.510
tells me which nodes are
connected to which other nodes.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.890
And of course the connections
are going both ways.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.350
So I see five ones
from five edges.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:21.610
And I see five more
ones below the diagonal,

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:27.050
because the edges are
connecting both ways.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.760
Ones connected to three, and
three is connected to one.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.540
One is not connected to
four, and four is not

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.740
connected to one.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.270
One is not connected to itself.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.440
By an edge.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.970
If we allowed, like, little
self loops, then a one

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.500
could appear on the diagram.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.830
But we don't.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.360
OK, so that's D and W.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.840
Here are the key matrices.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.930
This is actually, I venture to
say that any afternoon at MIT

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:59.980
there's a seminar that
involves these matrices.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.770
One name for this is
the graph Laplacian,

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.490
from Laplace's equation.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:11.170
And we'll see pretty soon
where that name's coming from.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:12.370
But it's there.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:19.920
And should I think, I think I
should, just about networks.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.710
Like where, does the
networks come from?

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.700
I think we've got
networks all around us.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.820
Right?

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:33.040
Electrical networks are the
simplest, maybe in some ways

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.000
the simplest to visualize.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:54.970
So that's the example,
that's the language I'll use.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.640
Now, I get a network,
I use the word network

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.380
when there's a c_1,
c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.550
Those extra numbers.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.690
I've got the A,
and now the network

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:11.670
comes from the C part,
that diagonal matrix.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:17.360
And if I'm talking electricity,
these could be resistors.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.670
Instead of springs,
they're resistors.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:27.160
So it's the conductance
in those five resistors,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.250
are c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, and c_5.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.130
So I'm ready for that.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.560
Ready for the C matrix,
because we got the A matrix.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:44.160
And we've got A transpose
A, but the applications

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.060
throw in the C matrix also.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.930
What are other
applications, I was

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:54.510
saying, like this one is the
one, I'll use the word current,

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:59.080
for flow in the edges, or
I'll use the word flow.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.890
A network of oil, or
natural gas, or water pipes

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:09.090
would be just that, and
then the electrical-- People

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:16.090
study the-- Professor
Verghese in Course 6 studies

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.210
the electric grid.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:21.690
The US electric
grid, or the western,

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.470
often the western half
of the US electric grid.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.350
So that's got a
whole lot of things.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.650
Pumping stations.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:30.490
You see it?

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.350
Actually, the world
wide web, the internet,

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:39.210
is a giant network that people
would love to understand.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.270
And the phone company
would love to understand

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.140
those networks of phone calls.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:48.090
I mean, those are really, that's
what, giant businesses are

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:55.360
are dependent on understanding
and maintaining networks.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.540
OK, so I'm going
to use resistors.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.110
Of course, I'm staying linear.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:04.260
And I'm staying steady state.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.680
So by staying linear there
aren't any transistors

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.620
in this net.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.750
By staying steady state,
there aren't any capacitors

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.750
or inductors.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:16.050
Those guys would
be linear elements,

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:20.510
but they would be coming in
a time-dependent problem.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.250
A u_(tt) problem.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:29.350
And I'm just staying now with
Ku=f, I'm trying to create K.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.790
The stiffness matrix, which
maybe here we might call

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.910
the conductance matrix.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.810
OK, so ready for
the picture now?

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.790
That these come into?

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.060
You know what the
picture looks like, it's

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:50.600
going to have the
usual four, we'll

00:31:50.600 --> 00:32:00.290
start with these potentials u at
the nodes, potentials at nodes,

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:05.380
so those will be
u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:10.850
Voltages, if I'm
really speaking,

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:18.350
those units would be volts,
and now comes the matrix A.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.130
And now I get, what
do I get from A?

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.040
What do I get from A?

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.640
Key question.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.480
If I multiply A times u, and
you know that's coming, right?

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:35.160
If I multiply A times u, so
I'll erase A transpose now,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.920
because we've got that.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.940
So there's A, and now I'll
make space to multiply by u,

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.710
alright?

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:49.650
So now I want to look at Au.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:53.750
So A multiplies a
bunch of potentials,

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.520
a bunch of voltages.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.630
And let's just do
this multiplication

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.970
and see what it produces.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:02.490
This is the great
thing about matrices,

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.380
they produce something.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:10.800
OK, what's the first
component of Au?

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.400
Of course, Au is going
to be five by five.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.090
It's going to be
associated with edges.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.560
Right, u's associated
with nodes, Au with edges.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.850
Just, the pattern is so nice.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:26.680
Alright, what's the
first component?

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.730
Just do that multiplication
and what do you get?

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:30.230
u_2-u_1.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.840
What do you get in
the second component?

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.100
Do that multiplication
and you get u_3-u_1.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.660
The third one will be u_3-u_2.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.550
The fourth one would be
u_4-u_2, and the fifth one

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.040
will be u_4-u_3.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:03.490
Just like our first
difference matrices.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:12.660
But this one deals with, I mean,
our first difference matrices

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:17.140
were exactly like this when
the graph was all in a line.

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:21.490
The big step now is that
the graph is not in a line,

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:24.420
not even necessarily in a plane.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:29.960
Could be in, it's a bunch
of points, and edges.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.290
Actually, the position of those
points, we don't have to know

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.760
are they in a plane.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.720
I think of them as
nodes and edges.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:44.340
OK, what's the
natural name for Au?

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.980
I would call those potential
differences, right?

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.462
Voltage differences.

00:34:48.462 --> 00:34:50.170
So that's what we see
here and those will

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:55.430
be e. e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5.

00:34:55.430 --> 00:35:00.120
will be potential or
voltage differences.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.350
Voltage drops, you might say.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.390
Potential differences,
voltage drops.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:10.810
Oh well, now.

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:16.710
When I say voltage drops, that's
because, as we noted before,

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:21.440
the current goes from a
higher to a lower potential.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.200
It goes in the
direction of the drop.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:31.570
And I think that what we
need now is minus Au, for e.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:35.940
So I think we need a minus
sign and it's quite common

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:36.910
to have the minus sign.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:40.490
We saw it already
with least squares.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:48.390
And let me say
also, so this is e.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:53.060
I'll abbreviate those five e's
I just wrote down, five of them.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.490
So you would remember
there are five.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:57.180
We're talking
about the currents.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.970
We're talking about,
this is the e in E=IR.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:06.310
The electromotive--
The voltage drop.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:08.680
That makes some current go.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:13.290
Now, also, just as
with least squares,

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.330
so it was great that
we saw it before,

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:18.960
there could be a
source term here.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:24.750
So I'm completing the picture
here, allowing the source term.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.670
And we'll come back to what
does that mean, physically.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:32.280
But at that point could
enter b, and b is really

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.730
standing for batteries.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:40.100
I work hard to make the
language match the initials.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.210
These letters.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:45.590
OK, now what?

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:51.080
That step just involved
A, nothing physical.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:57.500
Now comes the step that
involves C, so w will be Ce.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.430
And these will be the
currents on the edges.

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:08.730
And that's the law,
then, with a matrix C,

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:14.670
of course C is our
old friend c_1 to c_5.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:17.800
And tell me first the name.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.720
Whose law is this?

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.580
That the current is proportional
to the voltage drop?

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.520
Ohm.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.070
So this is Ohm's law.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.380
Instead of Hooke's
law, it's Ohm's law.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.690
And I've written it with
conductances, not resistances.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:42.250
So resistances are 1 over-- R,
the usual R in E=IR, would be--

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:46.810
I'm more looking at it
as I, current, equals Ce,

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.140
instead of E=IR.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:55.320
So I'm flipping the, the, the
resistance, or the impedance

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.830
to give the conductance.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:04.920
OK, and now finally
can you tell me

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.380
what the last step
is going to be?

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:15.540
If life is good, well you might
wonder whether life is good,

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:21.300
reading the papers, but
it's still good here.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.210
OK, what matrix shows up there?

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.170
Everybody knows it.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.960
A transpose.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.750
So the final equation,
the balance equation,

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:35.480
will be, let me write it so
I don't catch it up here.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.690
Will be A transpose
w equals whatever.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.090
Will be the balance equation.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.115
The current balance,
it's the balance

00:38:44.115 --> 00:38:48.890
of currents, balance of charge,
whatever you like to say.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:51.740
At each node, it's the
balance at the nodes.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.210
Because when we're
up on this line,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.620
we're in the node picture.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.920
We have four
equations here, right?

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.770
We're talking
about at each node.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:05.200
Here we're talking
about on each edge.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.670
There it's so critical.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.910
These two variables.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:14.230
Which we're seeing physically
as node variables and edge

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.040
variables.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.920
That pair of variables
just shows up everywhere.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:28.420
In displacements and stresses,
it's fundamental in elasticity.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:35.360
And oh, there are just
so many in optimization,

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.160
it's everywhere.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.340
And a big part of this course
is to see it everywhere.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:46.770
OK, why don't I, just so
you see the main picture.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:51.140
We're going to have the A
transpose C A matrix that I'm

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.000
going to maybe call K again.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.910
And now of course there
could be current sources.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:04.110
Just the way there could be
forces that we had to balance.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:08.540
There could be, not
always but there could be,

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.470
current sources from outside.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.410
External current sources.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:15.230
So these are external
voltage sources.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.480
These are external
current sources.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:22.810
So in a way, we now have
combined our first two

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:28.650
examples, our springs and
masses only had forces external.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:33.280
Our least squares problem
had an external b.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.380
Measurements.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.930
This picture is the whole deal.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.420
It's got b and f, and
actually I could put in

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:46.050
even a little more.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:55.940
Sources like, well, we already
kind of caught on to the fact

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:59.720
that we'd better ground the
node or A transpose C A,

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.530
as it stands, A transpose C A
as it stands will be singular.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.670
You know, it's the matrix,
there's A transpose A

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.130
and the C in the middle
isn't going to help any.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.790
That's singular.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:17.720
If we wanted to be able
to compute voltages,

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.774
we've got to set one of them.

00:41:19.774 --> 00:41:21.190
It's like setting
one temperature,

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:24.990
it's like deciding
where is absolute zero.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:29.740
Let's put absolute
zero down here. u_4=0.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.260
Grounded the node.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.900
OK, so we've fixed a potential.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.350
So here's a boundary
condition coming in u_4=0.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:46.040
That's another source
term, another thing coming,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.880
you could say sort of from
outside the A transpose C

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.660
A. We could fix
another voltage at,

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:58.270
I mean, I'm thinking now
about what's the picture.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:04.430
What's the whole problem?

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:09.300
So the problem could have
batteries, in the edges.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.170
It could have current
sources into the nodes.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:19.340
It could fix u_1 at
some voltage like ten.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.690
Our problem could fix--
We must fix one of them.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:28.420
Otherwise our matrix
isn't-- is singular.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.250
But once we've
set up the matrix,

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.580
and when we fix
u_4=0 by the way,

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.510
what happens to our matrix?

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.430
Let me take u_4=0, so
this is a key step here.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:43.500
When I set u_4=0,
I now know u_4.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.620
It's not an unknown any more.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:52.440
So I've removed u_4
from the problem.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.730
And then it'll be also
removed from A transpose A.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.450
So this, is you could
say, like a reduced A,

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:03.410
or a grounded matrix A.
It's now five by three.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.490
And A transpose
A, what shape will

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:08.720
the a transpose a matrix be?

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.760
It'll be three by three, right?

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.520
I now have five by
three, three by five.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.640
Multiplying five by three
gives me three by three.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.150
This column is gone,
and that row is gone.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.370
Because the row came from
A transpose and the column

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:27.360
came from A, and we've
just thrown them away.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.570
By grounding that node.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:37.510
Now give me the key fact about
that A transpose A matrix?

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.320
What do you see there?

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:44.010
Now, you see a reduced,
a grounded A transpose A.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:46.720
What kind of a
matrix have I got?

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.740
Positive definite.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.240
Good.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.870
Positive definite.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:54.410
It's now not singular
any more, its determinant

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.540
is some positive number.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.200
And everything is positive, its
eigenvalues are all positive,

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.510
everything's good
about that matrix.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:07.600
OK, and I guess what I
was starting to say here,

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:13.860
if I wanted to fix, this
would be a natural problem.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.870
Fix the top voltage at one, say.

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:22.040
Fix u_1=1 and see how
much current flows.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.170
That would be a
natural question.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:28.100
What's the system resistance
between the top node

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:33.180
and the bottom, if I'm given--
Or the system conductance.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:40.530
If I'm given a c_1, a c_2,
a c_3 a c_4 and a c_5,

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.740
I could say I could fix
that voltage at one,

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.340
I could fix this at zero.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.030
Maybe one of the
homework problems

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.410
asks you for
something like this.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:52.430
And then you find
all the currents.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.900
And the voltages, you
solve the problem.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.820
And you know what
the currents are.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.860
You know the total current
that leaves node one,

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:07.880
enters node four when the
voltages drop by one between,

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.410
right?

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:11.490
So current can flow down
here, cross over here,

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.720
down here whatever.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.040
Somehow all these
five numbers are

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:21.760
going to play a part in
that system resistance.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.640
So that would be an
interesting number to know.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.820
Out of those five
numbers, somehow five c's,

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.997
there's a system resistance
between that node

00:45:31.997 --> 00:45:32.580
and that node.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.100
And we can find it by
setting this to be one,

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.090
this to be zero, having the
reduced matrix-- Oh, well

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:40.150
what will happen?

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:43.640
How many unknowns will I have?

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.780
Just do this mental experiment.

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:51.180
Suppose I introduce u_1
to be one, for example.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.270
This is just one type
of possible problem.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:46:03.320
If I take u_1 to be one,
what happens to my matrix A?

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:07.850
It loses its first column, too.
u_1 is not unknown any more.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:12.300
u_1 will not be unknown.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.445
And that value one
is somehow going

00:46:15.445 --> 00:46:17.990
to move to the
right-hand side, right?

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.200
People have asked
me after class, well

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:24.200
what happens if a boundary
condition isn't zero?

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.990
Suppose we have
this fixed springs

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:32.090
and we pull this spring down
to make its displacement 12.

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:34.410
Well, somehow that 12
is going to show up

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.460
on the right side
of the equation.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.390
It's a source, it's
an external term.

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:43.040
OK, so if we had
u_1 equals whatever,

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.990
this u_1 would disappear.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:47.350
I would only have a
two by two problem.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.380
Because I would
only have two, I now

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.400
have only two
unknown u's, right?

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.550
So that's where
sources can come.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:47:01.920
And can I just complete the
picture of the source stuff?

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:08.450
We could fix, we could.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.590
Look, here's what
I'm going to say.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.210
External stuff.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.630
Sources can come into here.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.450
They can come into here.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:19.730
They can come into here,
so of course everybody

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.010
says why shouldn't
they come in here?

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:23.930
And the answer is we
could send them here.

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:33.470
So we could fix, we
could fix some w's.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:36.040
Of course, you understand
we can't do everything.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:41.720
I mean, there's a limit to how
much we can put on the system.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.530
We want to have
some unknowns left.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.770
Some matrix still, but anyway.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:50.790
I like this picture
now, it's more complete.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:57.470
That you now see the node
variables and node equations,

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:00.220
the edge variables, e and w.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.830
The currents.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:06.380
These guys are the
big ones. w and u

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:10.700
are what I think of as
the crucial unknowns.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.480
e is sort of on the
way. f is the source.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.300
But now we have the
possibility of sources

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.680
at all four positions.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.340
OK, let's see.

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:31.270
If I wrote out, If I
looked at A transpose C A,

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.560
would you like to tell me, yeah.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.460
Have we got?

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.460
No, we don't.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.940
I was going to say, what's a
typical row of A transpose C A,

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.480
can I just say it in words?

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.980
It'll be too quick
to really catch.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.630
So without the C,
this is what we had.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.970
So what do you think
that two becomes

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:56.400
if there's an A transpose C A,
if there's a C in the middle.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.970
Have you got the pattern yet?

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:02.400
That two was there
because of two edges.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.350
Edges one and two,
it happened to be.

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:10.980
So instead of the two,
I'm going to see c_1+c_2.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:11.480
Right.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.320
When those were
ones, I got the two.

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.630
So this will be c_1+c_2,
this'll be a minus c_1,

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.300
and that'll be a minus
c_2, when we do it out.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.920
And you could do it
out for yourself.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.380
Just tell me what
would show up there.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:31.510
In A transpose C A, so I'm
talking now about A transpose C

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:37.520
A. So instead of one plus
one plus one, what do I have?

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.480
What am I going to have, and you
really want to multiply it out,

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.500
because it's so nice
to see it happen.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.570
What do I have?

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:50.410
I'm looking at node two, I'm
seeing three edges out of it.

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:56.740
And instead of one, one,
one, I'll have c_1+c_3+c_4.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:00.110
c_1+c_3+c_4 will
be sitting here.

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:02.870
And minus c_1 will be here,
and minus c_3 will be here,

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:06.150
and minus c_4 will be there.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:08.110
The pattern's just nice.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:14.230
So if you can read this
part of the section,

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:19.330
I'll have more to say
Friday about the A transpose

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.760
w, the balance.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.160
That critical point
we didn't do yet.

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.150
But the main thing,
you've got it.
