00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.550
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK,
it's Laplace again today.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.020
Laplace's equation.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.710
And trying to describe--
That's a big area that's

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.370
a lot of people have
worked on for centuries.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.900
And for the early
centuries, there

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.070
were always analysis methods.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.460
And that's what we got
started on last time.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.490
And we'll do a bit more.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.470
There's no way we
could do everything

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.030
that people have worked
on years and years,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.830
trying to find
ideas about solving.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.970
But we can get the idea.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.390
And this part, then,
is in the section

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.210
called Laplace's equation.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.050
And the exam Wednesday
would include

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.070
some of these constructions.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.070
So this is what we
did last time, we

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.440
identified a whole family of
solutions to Laplace's equation

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.590
as polynomials in x and y.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.120
Of increasing degree n, and
then when we wrote them in polar

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.880
form they were fantastic.
r^n*cos(n*theta)

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.360
and r^n*sin(n*theta).

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.350
So my idea is just, we've
got them, now let's use them.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.900
So how to use these solutions?

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.380
Because we can take
combinations of them,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.590
we can create series
of sines and cosines.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.750
So I'll do that first.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.340
Series.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.660
And then Green's function,
that's the name you remember,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.240
we've seen it before.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.180
That's the solution when the
right side is a delta function.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.600
When we have Poisson's
equation with a delta there.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.930
So that an important one.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:17.790
And then well, a big part
of two-dimensional and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.930
three-dimensional problems
is that the region itself,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.600
not just the equation
but the region itself,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.160
can be all over the place.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.660
We'll solve when
the region is nice,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.470
like a circle or a
square, and then there

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.360
is a way to, in principle,
to get other regions.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.630
To change from a crazy region
to a circle or a square,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.470
and then solve it there.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.240
So that's called
conformal mapping.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.410
And I can't let the whole
course go without saying

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.920
a word or two about that.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.680
But somehow among
numerical methods,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.880
it's conformal mapping--
There are packages

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.400
that do conformal mapping.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.020
But they're not the
central way to solve

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.720
these equations numerically.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.630
Finite differences,
finite elements are.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.430
And that's what's
coming next week.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:27.010
So this is the future; this
is the present, right there.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.270
So, can I just start
with an example or two?

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.680
Like, how would you solve
Laplace's equation in a circle?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.640
So, in a circle.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.370
This is the idea here.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.390
I have Laplace's equation.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.620
OK, so I've got a
whole lot of solutions.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.300
And I've even got chalk
to write them down.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.050
OK, so here's my circle,
might as well make it

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.550
the unit circle.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.390
Radius one.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.530
And inside here is Laplace.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.630
u_xx+u_yy=0.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.140
No sources inside.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.190
So we have to have
sources from somewhere,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.640
and they will come
from the boundary.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.590
So on the boundary,
we keep-- Let

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.490
me think of u as temperature.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.820
So I set the temperature
on the boundary. u

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.620
equals some u_0,
some known function.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.980
This is given.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.680
This is the boundary condition.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.780
This is the given
boundary condition.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.950
And it's a function of-- I'm
going to use polar coordinates.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.690
Polar coordinates are
natural for a circle.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:52.830
So this is at r=1, so maybe
I should say on the boundary,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.490
which is r=1, and going around
the angle theta, is given.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.270
This is u_0(theta).

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.090
That's my given
boundary condition.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.850
This problem is named
after Dirichlet,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.800
because it's like giving
fixed conditions and not

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.720
Neumann conditions.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.800
OK, so I'm just looking
for a combination.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.440
For a function that
solves Laplace's equation

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.050
inside the circle, and
takes on some values

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.790
around the boundary.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.710
And of course the
boundary values

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.030
might be plus one on the top
and minus one on the bottom.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.180
Or the boundary condition
might vary around,

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.390
it might, variable
then come around.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.970
But notice that this
is a periodic function.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.170
This is 2pi-periodic, because
the problem's the same.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.020
If I increase theta by 2pi I've
come back to the same point.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.030
So it's got to have that value.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:12.180
OK, so well let me give you
a couple of examples first.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.120
Suppose u_0, suppose this
function-- Example 1, easy.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.580
Suppose u_0 is sin(3theta).

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.030
So that means I've
got a region here,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.300
I'm prescribing its
temperature on the boundary.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.370
And I want to say what
does it look like inside?

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.090
And I'm prescribing right
now the sin(3theta),

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.310
so there theta is zero, so it's
zero, the boundary condition's

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.610
zero there, climbs to one, back
to zero, down to minus one.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.940
back to zero.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.170
Three times, and again comes
back to zero again there.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.550
So, I'm looking for a solution
to Laplace's equation --

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.110
and I've got a
pretty good list --

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.990
that will match
u_0 when r is one.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.440
So that's the
boundary, r is one.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.690
So you can tell me what it is.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.450
So you can solve this
problem, right away.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:26.550
The answer is u of r and theta
is, what function will--?

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.750
Remember I've got
my eye on that list.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.610
You too, right?

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.680
I'm just trying to get
one that when r is one

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.190
it will match sin(3theta).

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.570
What's the good guy?

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.760
It'll be on that list.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.120
Which of those,
by itself, here I

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:53.480
don't need a series because I've
got such a neat u_0 function.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.250
I'll get it right
with one answer,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.090
and what is that answer?

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.200
I look there.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:09.870
I say what do I do, so that at
r=1, I'll match sin(3theta).

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.740
I'll use r cubed sin(3theta).

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.210
So the good winner will
be r cubed sin(3theta).

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.670
That solves Laplace's equation.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.850
We checked it out, it's the
imaginary part of x+iy cubed.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.160
We could write it in x
and y coordinates if we

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.180
wanted but we don't want to.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.750
And it matches when r is
one, it gives us sin(3theta).

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:42.560
That's it.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.210
And of course I
could take any one.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.740
Now suppose I'm trying
to match something that's

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.510
not as simple as sin(3theta).

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.740
In that case, I may
have to use all of them.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.730
I mean, it's very, very
fluky that one term

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.920
is going to do it.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.430
Usually, so my main
examples would be

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.090
I'll have to match all of them.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.770
So what do I do?

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:19.360
At r=1, so my general solution
is a combination of these guys

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.270
I worked so hard to get.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.970
The solution is of this form.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.310
It's some a_0, the constant.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:33.080
And then a_1*r*cos(theta),
and b_1*r*sin(theta).

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.540
And a_2 r squared cos(2theta).

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.160
And so on.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.120
I'm just taking
any combination of,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.970
I'm using the a's
as the coefficients

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.670
for the cosine guys.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.510
And the b's, b_1, b_2, b_3
would be the coefficients

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.510
for the sine one.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.020
OK, that's my general solution.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.130
That solves Laplace's equation.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.500
Every term did, so
every combination will.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.520
Now, set r=1.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.050
To match that r=1--
and match the boundary.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:24.000
And match u_0(theta), the
required temperature around

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.850
the-- on the boundary.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.230
The boundary being
where r is one.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.010
So this is set r=1.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:40.570
So then u_0(theta), this given
thing, has to match this,

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.930
when r is one.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:51.200
So it's a_0 plus a_1, now what
do I write here? r is one,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.210
so it's just cos(theta).

00:10:54.790 --> 00:11:00.540
Now, b_1, r is one, so
I just have sin(theta).

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:06.690
And I have an a_2*cos(2theta),
and a b_2*sin(2theta),

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:12.890
and so on.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.330
Here, just let me
put it together now.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:21.630
I'm given any
temperature distribution

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.600
around the boundary.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.900
It's in equilibrium,
the temperature,

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:34.050
where if the temperature's
high near that point

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.870
and low over here
the temperature

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.120
inside will gradually
go from that high point,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.120
dot dot dot dot,
to the lower one.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.170
By matching on the boundary.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.750
And this is the match
on the boundary.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:12:02.410
Now, this is really a lead in
to the last part of this course.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:07.120
So whose name is associated
with a series like that?

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.450
Fourier.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.760
You recognize that as what's
called a Fourier series.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.240
So the idea is, I'm given
these boundary values.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.070
I find their expansion
in sines and cosines,

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.570
and that's what
we'll do in November.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.140
And then I've got it.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.150
Then I know the a's and the b's.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:37.340
And then basically I just put in
the r's. r and r squareds and r

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.690
cubeds and so on.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:43.950
So then I've got
the answer inside.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.510
In principle it's so easy.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.410
So, why is it easy, though?

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.600
First, it's easy because it's
a circle we're working in.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.750
If I was in an ellipse or
a strange shape, forget it.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.270
I mean, so this
is quite special.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:09.750
And secondly, it's easy because
these functions are so nice.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.080
Fourier works with the
best functions ever.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.000
These sines and cosines.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.310
So I'll find a way to
find those coefficients,

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.460
the a's and the b's.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.710
Even though there
are lots of them,

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.580
I'll be able to pick
them off one at the time,

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.540
the a's and b's.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.610
Once I know the a's and
b's, I know the answer.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.860
So do you see this is
in principle a great way

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.880
to solve it?

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.660
In fact, it's the way
we used over here,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:47.440
when my u_0 was sin(3theta),
then the only term in its

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.710
Fourier series
was 1*sin(3theta).

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:55.910
And then the solution was
1 r cubed sin(3theta).

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.370
So you can learn
things from this.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.280
For example, oh,
what can you learn?

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.830
One thing I noticed,
an important feature

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:15.800
of Laplace's equation is that
this solution inside the circle

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:22.110
gets very smooth.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.700
The boundary conditions could
be like a delta function.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.530
I could say that
on the boundary,

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.440
the temperature is zero
everywhere except at that

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.110
point it spikes.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.630
So I could take u_0--

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.050
So example 2, and I
won't do it in full,

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:46.670
would be u_0 on the boundary
equal a delta function.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.510
A spike at that one point.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:55.150
So all the heat is coming from
the source at that one point.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.330
Like I've got a
fire going there.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.750
Keeping the rest of
the boundary frozen,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.630
the heat's kind of
going to come inside.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.750
So then how would I proceed?

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:16.660
Well, if I have this boundary
value as a delta function,

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.780
I look for its Fourier
series, and it's

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.820
a very important,
beautiful, Fourier

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.350
series for a delta function.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.940
Would you want to know it?

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.690
I mean, we'll know
it well in November.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.420
Would you want to
know it in October?

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.980
This is Halloween, I
guess, so delta-- I'll

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.330
tell you what it is.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.060
Since you insist.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:50.170
delta(theta) I think will--
I think there's a 1/(2pi)

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.980
or something.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.010
Ah, shoot.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.470
We'll get it exactly right.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:06.090
It's something like 1 and 2
cos(theta) and 2cos(2theta),

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.270
I'm not sure about the 2pi.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:14.740
2cos(2theta), and
2cos(3theta), and so on.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.340
We'll know it well
when we get there.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.584
What I notice about this delta
function-- Of course you're

00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:24.250
going to expect the
delta function being

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.840
somehow a little bit strange.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.190
At theta=0, what does
that series add up to?

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.160
Just so you begin to get
a hang of Fourier series.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.860
At theta=0, what does
that series look like?

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.510
Well, all these
cosine thetas are?

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.350
One.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:50.460
So this series at
theta=0 is 1+2+2+2+2...

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.900
It's infinite.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.860
And that's what we want.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.080
The delta function is
infinite at theta=0.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.330
And it's periodic, of course,
so that if I go around

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:07.060
to theta=2pi I'll come
back to zero again.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.180
At theta=pi, you could
sort of see, well, yeah,

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.770
theta=pi is a sort
of interesting point.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.000
At theta is pi,
what's the cosine?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.040
Is negative one, right?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.530
But then the cos(2pi)
will be plus one.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:28.540
So at theta=pi, I think I'm
getting a one minus a two plus

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.160
a two, minus a two, plus a two.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.650
You see, it's doing its best to
cancel itself out and give me

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:41.260
the zero that I want, the
theta=pi over on the left side

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.450
of the circle.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:49.150
Anyway, so that's
an extreme example.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.150
But now, what's the
temperature inside?

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.540
Can you just follow
the same rule?

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.380
What will be the
temperature inside?

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.610
If that's the delta
function, if that's

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.510
the right series, whatever,
it might be a 4pi,

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:10.210
I'm not sure, for that.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.420
Now, you can tell me
what's the solution, what's

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.720
the temperature distribution
inside a circle when

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:26.040
one point on the boundary has a
heat source, a delta function.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.310
What do I do?

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.420
How do I match
this with this guy?

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.060
I just put in the r's, right?

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.860
If this is what it's supposed
to match when r is one,

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:44.840
then when r is-- So maybe
I'll put it under here.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:53.710
So the u(r,theta),
from the delta guy,

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.800
is just put in the r's.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:06.960
1+2r*cos(theta), and 2 r
squared cos(2theta), and so on.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:17.230
OK, and eventually 2 r to the
100th cos(100theta), and more.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:24.970
OK, I write this out, you could
say why did he write this down?

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.510
I wanted to make this point
that the important feature

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.430
of the solution to
Laplace's equation

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:37.290
is how smooth it gets when
you go inside the region.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.670
And why is that?

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:45.970
Because at r=1/2, this term
is practically gone, right?

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:50.930
If I go halfway into the circle,
this term is practically gone.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.040
1/2 to the hundredth power.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.090
And if I go to the center of the
circle, it's completely gone.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.110
In fact, what's the value
at the center of the circle?

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:07.580
What's the temperature
at the center?

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.600
1/2pi.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.470
This is the only term
that's remaining.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:19.940
And it's the average,
around the circle.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.830
That makes physical
sense, I guess.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.030
Since the whole thing's
completely isotropic,

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:35.330
we've got a perfect
circle, the value

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.690
at the center of
the circle is always

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.750
the average going around.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.880
The constant term in the
Fourier series, this guy.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.790
We'll get to know
that one very well.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.480
That's the average.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.100
You're just seeing a little bit
of Fourier series early, here.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:02.230
But my point is that you
could have high oscillation

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.770
around the boundary,
that damps out

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.480
because of these powers of r.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:13.300
And inside the circle it's
only the low order terms

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:22.090
that begin to take over.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.360
This is the kind of
trick you have, or not

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.660
trick but the kind
of method that you

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:34.750
can use for solving Laplace's
equation by an infinite series.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.220
Of course, a person
who wants a number

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.440
can complain that,
wait a minute,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.640
how do I use that
infinite series?

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.860
Well, of course, if you
wanted to know the temperature

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.120
at a particular point
you'd have to plug in

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.700
that value of r,
that value of theta,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.770
add up the terms until you
hope that they become so

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.450
small that you can ignore them.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.810
So infinite series is
one form of a solution.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:12.510
And somehow these are examples--
I should use the words

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.910
separation of variables.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:20.830
Separation of variables
is the golden idea

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.800
in this analysis stuff.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.910
Separation of variables means
I got the r part separated

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.760
from the theta part.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.800
And that worked great,
worked well for a circle.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.230
Let's see, maybe for a square I
could try to separate x from y.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:46.800
Maybe there's a homework
problem, a solution that

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.130
separates x from y, I think
is something like-- So this

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.910
would be another family.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:23:00.810
Good for squares, something
like sin(kx) sinh times,

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:08.070
so this separation is something
in x times something in y.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.670
Again I'm just
mentioning things.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.390
I think that that solves
Laplace's equation

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.710
because if I take
two x derivatives,

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:22.560
that'll bring down k squared,
but it'll flip the sign, right?

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.820
These two derivatives of
the sine will be a minus.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:30.380
And if I take-- I
need a ky there.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:35.240
And if I took two derivatives
of this hyperbolic sine,

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.570
you remember that's the
e^(ky) and the e^(-ky).

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.650
The two derivatives
of that will bring out

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.800
a k squared with a plus sign.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.390
So two x derivatives bring
out the minus k squared,

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.260
two y derivatives bring
out a plus k squared

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.440
and together that solves
Laplace's equation.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.680
We'll check that in
our homework problem.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.410
So there would be an
example, good for a square.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:13.950
So, there's hope to do an exact
solution in a special region.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:19.700
Now, what's this
Green's function idea?

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:26.480
OK, that's now this
is another thing.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:35.770
So last time we appreciated
that this combination x+iy was

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.650
magic.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:42.880
The idea was that we could
take any function of x+iy,

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.390
and it solves
Laplace's equation.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:52.420
Can we just see, sort of
very crudely why that is?

00:24:52.420 --> 00:25:00.310
We saw the pattern, we
saw x+iy to the nth.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.520
Sort of, we went as far as
n=3, checked it all out.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.120
But now, really if I want to
be able to-- why does that

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:13.820
solve Laplace's
equation for any n?

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.970
Should I just plug that
into Laplace's equation?

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:24.740
What happens if I take the two
x derivatives of this thing?

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.070
So this going to be a
typical function of x+iy,

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.710
typically nice one.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.080
If I take two x
derivatives, I want

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.520
to plug it in and
see that it really

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.920
does solve Laplace's equation.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.730
So two x derivatives of
that will give me what?

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.050
The first x derivative
will bring down an n

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.420
times this thing to the n-1.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.890
And then the next x derivative
will bring down an n-1 times

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.490
this thing to the n-2.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.550
So that'll be the u_xx.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:05.240
And what about u_yy?

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.580
This is my u.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:14.260
I'm sort of just checking
that yes, this-- See again,

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.440
see if it still works Friday
what worked Wednesday.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.260
That this x+iy is magic and
functions of it like powers,

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.230
exponentials,
logarithms, whatever,

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.530
all solve Laplace's equation.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:33.270
OK, so we did u_xx,
and we got-- easy.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.820
Now, what happens with u_yy?

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.860
Do you see the point?

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.140
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Sorry opposite sign.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.710
And why does the sign
come out opposite?

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:46.260
Because of that guy.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.300
Yeah, it's the
chain rule, right?

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.900
The derivative of
this with respect to y

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.250
will give me an n times this
thing to one lower power.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.430
Times the derivative
of what's inside.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.470
And the derivative of
what's inside is an i.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.730
And then the second
derivative will bring down

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:10.720
an n-1, this guy will be down
to n-2, another i will come out

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.140
and-- Just what you want, right?

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.170
Because the i squared is
minus one, those cancel.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:21.070
When those are equal
opposite signs.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:29.490
And we get u_xx+u_yy equaling 0.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.140
So that works.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.490
And, actually, the same idea
would work for any function

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:36.000
of x+iy.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.150
The two x derivatives
just give f''.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:46.520
Two y derivatives will give f''
but the chain rule will bring

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.560
out i both times
and we've got it.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:28:00.640
OK, I think we just need
another couple of examples.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.000
And this of course could
be in polar coordinates,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.650
f of re^(i*theta).

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.220
That's just, everybody
recognizes re^(i*theta) is

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.760
the same as x+iy?

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.610
Better just be sure
we've got that. x is

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:23.160
some point here in the complex
plane. iy takes us up to here.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.080
So there's x+iy.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.090
That's x+iy there,
but it's also--

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.370
So let me put those in better.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:37.120
So there's x and there's y.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.230
Everybody knows
this picture, right?

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.260
This x and this y, now if I
want to go to polar coordinates,

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.770
that angle is theta,
this x is r*cos(theta),

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:55.320
this y is r*sin(theta), and
this guy is re^(i*theta).

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:55.910
re^(i*theta).

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.640
r*cos(theta) plus i*r*sin(theta)
is the same as re^i*theta.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.830
That's utterly fundamental.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:12.750
Everybody's responsible
for that picture

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:18.140
of putting the complex numbers
into their beautiful polar

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:18.640
form.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:25.950
That's what made our r to the
nth cos(n*theta) all so simple.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:30.230
Now, what was I aiming to do?

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.160
Give a particular f.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.750
Now I want to give a
particular function f, or maybe

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.620
a couple of choices.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.100
A couple of functions f, and
see that their real parts

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:50.090
and their imaginary parts
solve Laplace's equation.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:30:00.460
Let me take first a one
that works completely.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.520
Take the real part and
the imaginary part--

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.380
Let me take e^(x+iy).

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:15.240
It's a function of x+iy,
extremely nice function

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:20.210
of x+iy, and we can figure out
its real and imaginary parts,

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:25.130
and we get two solutions
to Laplace's equation.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:31.320
The good way is to write this
thing as e^x times e^(iy).

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:39.140
And again we'll write it as
e^x times cos(y)+i*sin(y).

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.750
So now I can see
that the real part--

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.100
I can see what the
real part is, and I can

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.830
see what the imaginary part is.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.060
The real part will
be, that's real.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:54.930
And that's real. so this
will so give me e^x*cos(y).

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:59.120
And the imaginary part
will be e^x*sin(y).

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.080
You see it.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:08.080
And those will solve
Laplace's equation.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.970
Can I give a name to this
whole field of analysis?

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:20.430
This e^z is an analytic -- I
should just use that word --

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:25.110
an analytic function.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.830
And these guys, the real
and imaginary parts,

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:34.700
are two harmonic functions.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.550
Maybe it's not so important
to know the word harmonic

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.360
function.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.670
But analytic function,
yeah, I would

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:44.860
say that's an important word.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.070
Actually, what does it mean?

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:52.480
It's a function of z.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:57.900
So we're in the
complex plane here now.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:04.570
It's a function of z, e^z, and
it can be written as a power

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:09.930
series, of course, one plus
z plus 1 over 2 factorial z

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.210
squared and all those guys.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.080
So it has a power series.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.450
That makes it a combination
of our special ones.

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:25.700
The great thing about that
series is it converges.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.470
So an analytic function,
an analytic function

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:34.290
is the sum of a power
series that converges.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.540
And this one does.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.340
So there's an example.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.530
Yeah, so the whole theory
of analytic functions

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:44.710
is actually, that's
Chapter 5 of the textbook.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:53.490
And we won't get beyond this
point, I think, in one semester

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:57.280
with analytic functions.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.000
So what am I saying, though?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.020
I'm saying that the theory
of analytic functions

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.300
is closely tied to
Laplace's equation.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.090
Because the real and
the imaginary parts

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:13.110
give me this pair u and s that
satisfy, they each satisfy

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.870
Laplace's equation.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:19.510
And they're connected by the
Cauchy-Riemann equations.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:25.280
Boy, it's a lot of mathematics
coming real fast here.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.130
Now I'd like to take
one more example.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:33.600
Instead of the exponential,
can we take the logarithm.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.820
I want to take the log of x+iy,
and I want you to split it

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.120
into its real and
imaginary parts,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.180
and get the u and the
s that go with that.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.810
So this was like
the nicest possible.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:52.780
We got a series of, e^z
is good for every z,

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.540
the series converges, fantastic.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.990
It's an analytic
function everywhere.

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.440
Best possible.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.380
Now we go to one that's not
best possible but nevertheless

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.340
highly valuable.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.620
OK, so e^z, I've done.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:17.590
Let me erase e^z, take log z.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:23.760
OK, so now I'm not
doing e^z any more.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.425
And I want to find
the logarithm, OK.

00:34:28.425 --> 00:34:30.050
So, what's the deal
with the logarithm?

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.550
Real and imaginary parts.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:42.450
Now I'm going to
take the log of x+iy.

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:50.570
That is a function of x+iy,
except at one point it has

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.910
a problem, right?

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:57.970
There's a point where this
is not going to be analytic,

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:06.130
and there's going to be a
special point in the flow which

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.840
is singular somehow.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:13.090
But away from that point, we
have a nice-looking function,

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:17.480
the logarithm of x+iy, and
now I'd like to get its real

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.040
and imaginary parts.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.050
I'd like to know
the u and the s.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:23.900
But nobody in their
right mind wants

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.690
to take the logarithm
of a sum, right?

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:32.350
That's a very foolish thing to
try to do, the log of a sum.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.590
What's the good way to
get somewhere with this?

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:39.140
Real and imaginary part.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:44.560
I can take the log of a product.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.000
So the polar is
way better again.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.230
I want to write this as
a log of r e to the-- I

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.180
want to write it that way.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:36:00.870
And now what's the
log of a product?

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.310
The sum of the two pieces.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:13.060
So I have log r, and the log
of e^(i*theta), which is?

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.230
Which is i*theta.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:17.690
Boy, look, this is fantastic.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.330
Fantastic except at zero.

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:27.160
I mean, it's fantastic but
it's got a big problem at zero.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.890
But it's an extremely
important example.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.840
So what's the real part?

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.530
It's sitting there.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.140
This is my u.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:42.220
This is my u(r,theta), my
u(x,y), whatever you want,

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.820
is the log of r.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:51.570
The log of the square root
of x squared plus y squared.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:56.970
I claim that again by this
magic combination, this log,

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.680
this-- r is the square root
of x squared plus y squared.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.520
I claim if you substitute
that into Laplace's equation

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.300
you get zero.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.940
It works.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:12.510
And what's the
imaginary part, the s?

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:18.340
The twin is the imaginary
part, which is theta.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:23.170
Oh, what is theta in x,
if I wanted it in x and y?

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.860
What would theta be?

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.930
It's the arctan,
it's the angle whose

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:36.070
tangent is something. y/x,
so if I really want it

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:42.100
in rectangular xy stuff, it's
the angle whose tangent is y/x.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.520
And again, if you
remember in calculus

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.860
how to take derivatives
of this thing

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.140
and you plug it into Laplace's
equation you get zero.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.190
It works.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.220
So that's a great
solution except where?

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.610
At zero.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.520
Except at zero.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:11.310
And this doesn't tell us
what's happening at zero.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.280
It's an excellent solution.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.230
What's the picture?

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:24.610
So by Wednesday's
exam I'm not expecting

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:30.070
you to be an expert on the
theory of analytic functions.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:35.370
I don't expect you to know
any conformal mappings.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:43.040
By Wednesday, God, that's-- But,
I do expect you to have these

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.680
pictures in mind.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.465
So when I draw those
axes, what picture is it

00:38:48.465 --> 00:38:50.950
that I'm planning on?

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:52.920
I'm planning on the
equipotentials u

00:38:52.920 --> 00:39:02.460
equal constant, and the,
who are the other guys?

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.900
The streamlines.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.050
The places where the
stream functions-- So here

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:10.460
is the potential function.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:14.980
So what are the
equipotential curves?

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.950
For that guy?

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.570
Circles.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:22.200
This is a constant
when r is a constant,

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:28.980
so the equipotential
functions would be circles.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.730
I don't want to draw that
circle with radius zero, though.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:34.950
I'm nervous about that one.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.000
But all the others are great.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.430
And what are the
streamlines, now?

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:47.140
The streamlines are, well,
what will the streamlines be?

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:51.620
If I've drawn one family, you
can tell me the other family.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.140
The streamlines will be?

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.170
Radial lines.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:59.860
Because they're going to
be perpendicular to this.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:06.680
And so what do I get, this is
the stream function, theta.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.290
So what's a streamline?

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:10.740
The stream function
should be a constant.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.140
Theta's a constant.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.980
That means I'm
going out on rays.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:20.930
Those are all streamlines.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.570
Again, everything fantastic.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.720
If you look in a
little region here

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.690
you see just a beautiful
picture of equipotentials

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:35.560
and streamlines crossing
them at right angles.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.300
Everything great.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:43.270
Just that point is
obviously a problem.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:51.660
Now, and I'm suspecting
that there's a source here.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:41:00.000
I think this flow, which
is given by these guys,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.400
comes from some kind of a
delta function right there.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:12.260
And the flow goes outwards.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:16.510
So I know u, I know v is
the gradient of u, right?

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.560
I could take the x
and y derivatives,

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.700
I'd know the velocity.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.270
I know the stream function,
the divergence would be zero.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:32.200
Everything great,
except at the origin.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.430
I think we've got some
action at the origin.

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:43.460
Because, here's
the way to test it.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:49.100
I want to see what's
happening at the origin.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.150
And I'm going to use
the divergence theorem.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.680
Yeah.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.179
Yeah.

00:41:53.179 --> 00:41:55.160
I'm going to use the
divergence theorem.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:00.780
So the divergence theorem says--
What is the divergence theorem?

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:09.610
So this is the key thing that
connects double integrals.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:14.230
Let me take a circle
of radius R. So

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:19.350
that's the circle of radius
R. R could be big, or little.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:22.330
So I integrate
over the circle of

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:30.890
radius R. So what's the
deal? v is the same as w.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.850
What does the divergence
theorem tell me?

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:36.860
It tells me that if I
integrate, what do I integrate,

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:43.210
the divergence of w?
dx/dy, or r*dr*d theta.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:52.760
Then I get the flux.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.450
So this is a key identity.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:59.600
Fundamentally, more than
just the key identity,

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.320
it's central here.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:07.650
The total flow out of
the region must make it

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.000
through the boundary.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.460
So I integrate this
boundary, and this boundary

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.180
is a circle of radius
R, and what do I

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:19.390
integrate along that circle?

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:23.670
What's the other side of
the divergence theorem?

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:30.280
w dot n. w dot n,
around the boundary.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:37.730
And remember, I have
this nice-- my curve here

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.450
is this nice circle.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.600
So I'm going to integrate
around that circle.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:52.130
First of all, what is n?

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:56.990
By definition, n is the
normal that points outward,

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:58.250
straight out.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:02.520
So it's actually
going out that way.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.540
At every point it's
pointing straight out.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:09.130
And ds-- Yeah, I think
we can figure out exactly

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:18.420
what that right-hand side is.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:23.090
How do I get that
right-hand side?

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:29.670
I'm looking for w, and
then I have to integrate.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:35.580
OK, here is my u.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:42.790
My u is log r.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:45.520
So what's the gradient of log r?

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.690
It points outwards.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.430
And how large is the derivative?

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:55.600
So the derivative of
this log r is 1/r.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:03.400
I think that this comes down
to, this is the integral.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.010
Around the circle.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:14.930
I think that this thing is 1/R.
I went pretty quickly there,

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:17.960
so I'll ask you to
look in the book

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.360
because this is such an
important example it's

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.150
done there in more detail.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:30.080
So I'm claiming that
the derivative is 1/R,

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.780
and that it points directly out.

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.930
So the gradient points out.

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:40.700
The normal points out, so that
I just get exactly 1/R. Now,

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.470
what is ds?

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.840
For integrating
around the circle

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:54.410
what's a little tiny
piece of arc on a circle?

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:56.260
Of radius R?

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.050
R d theta.

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.830
Good man.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:03.120
R d theta.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:09.150
Now that's an integral
I can do, right?

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.200
And what do I get?

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.630
2 pi.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:19.730
R cancels R, I'm integrating d
theta around from zero to 2pi.

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:20.620
The answer is 2pi.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.530
So what do I learn from that?

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:35.700
I learn that somehow this source
in the inside has strength 2pi.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:42.120
What's sitting in there is
2pi times a delta function.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.910
This is the solution
to Laplace's equation

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.770
except at that source
term, so I really

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:53.710
should say Poisson's equation.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:56.250
This has turned out
to be the solution

00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:03.580
to Poisson with a delta,
or with 2pi times a delta.

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:08.990
We have just solved
this important equation.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.690
Poisson's equation
with a point source.

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:16.160
And, of course, that's
important because when

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.900
you can solve with
a point source,

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:22.650
you can put together
all sorts of sources.

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:24.790
And this is called
the Green's function.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:26.800
The Green's function
is the solution

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.540
when the source is a delta.

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:33.740
So if I divide by
2pi, now I've got it.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.920
I divide this by 2pi and
there is the Green's function.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:43.070
I have to put that
in bold letters.

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:48.220
Green's function.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:52.130
It's the solution
to the equation when

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.530
the source is a
delta and the answer

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:59.870
is u is the log of r over 2pi.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:06.460
So that's the Green's
function in 2-D. Physicists,

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.320
you know, they live and die
with these Green's function.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.510
Live, let's say, with
Green's function.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:18.700
And they would want to know
the Green's function in 3-D.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.590
So the Green's function
in three dimensions

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:23.400
also turns out beautifully.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:28.110
This is in, they would
say, in free space.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:32.170
This is the Green's function
when there's no other charges.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.940
Nothing is happening, except for
the charge right at the center.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:44.510
And if I'm in two dimensions the
Green's function is this log r.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:49.360
So it grows more slowly.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.550
It behaves like log r.

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:56.670
And in 3-D I think the
answer is 1/(4pi*r).

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:02.260
It's just amazing that
those Green's functions,

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:09.730
when the right side is a
delta, have such nice formulas.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:16.280
OK, let me take one moment here.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:22.080
I'll tell you what
conformal mapping is about.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.300
But what's your take-home
from this lecture?

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:32.530
Your take-home is two
methods that we can really

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:35.530
use to get a formula
for the answer.

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:43.400
One method was for Laplace's
equation in a circle.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.840
Get the boundary conditions in
a series of sines and cosines,

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.420
and then just put in
the r's that we need.

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:56.000
That's a simple, simple method.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.520
Provided we can get started
with the Fourier series.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:05.480
The second method is,
look at functions of x+iy,

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.270
and try to pick one that
matches your problem.

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:14.830
And if your problem has a
point source, at the origin,

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.300
we found the one.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.350
So the literature
for hundreds of years

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:24.730
is aimed at solving
other problems.

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:27.350
If the point source is
somewhere else, what happens?

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:28.980
That's not hard.

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:32.440
If it's not a point source
but some other kind of source,

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:37.770
or if the region
is not a circle.

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:42.110
Can I say in one final
sentence just what to do,

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:46.820
this conformal mapping
idea, when the region is not

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.010
a circle.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:54.380
Well, I can say it in one
word, make it a circle.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.860
I mean, that's what Riemann
said, you could do it.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:02.410
You could think of a
function, so Riemann said that

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:05.820
there's always some
function of x+iy,

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:10.210
let me call this Riemann's
function capital F of x, y.

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:13.770
So this is now the idea
of conformal mapping.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.700
Change variables.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.640
Conformal mapping is
a change of variables.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.530
He picked some function and
let its real part be X and let

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:29.670
its imaginary part
be Y. Capital Y. OK,

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:33.110
this is totally ridiculous
to put conformal mapping

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:34.970
in 30 seconds.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:42.070
But, never mind,
let's just do it.

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:44.490
The book describes
conformal mappings

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:49.360
and classical applied
math courses do much more

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.290
with conformal mapping.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:54.180
But the truth is,
computationally

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:59.130
they're not anything like
as much used as these.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:00.460
So what's the idea?

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:05.400
The idea is to find a
neat function of x+iy,

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:11.620
so that your crazy
boundary becomes a circle.

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:15.110
In the capital X,
capital Y variables.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:19.030
So you're mapping
the region, ellipse,

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:23.310
whatever it looks like,
by changing from little x,

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:27.540
little y, where it was an
ellipse, to capital X, capital

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.350
Y, where it's a circle.

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:30.960
And the point is
Laplace's equation

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.740
stays Laplace's equation.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:37.490
That change of variables does
not mess up Laplace's equation.

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:40.710
So that then you've
got it in a circle.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:44.010
You solve it in a
circle, for these guys.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.060
And then you go back.

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:51.210
In a word, you're able to solve
Laplace's equation in this

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:57.880
crazy region because you
never leave the magic x+iy.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.360
You find a combination with
that magic x+iy that makes

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.310
your region into a circle.

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:10.710
In the circle we now know how
to use capital X plus i capital

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:15.110
Y. You're staying with
that magic combination

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:18.090
and getting the region
to be what you like.

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:21.540
So people know a lot of
these conformal mappings.

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:24.810
A famous one is
the Joukowski one,

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:31.160
that takes something that
looks very like an airfoil,

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.910
and you can get a
circle out of it.

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:37.890
So I'll put down
Joukowski's name.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:48.950
So that's one that I trust
Course 16 still finds valuable.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:55.780
It's a transformation
that takes certain shapes

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.390
and they include shapes
that look like airfoils,

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:00.240
and produce circles.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:07.740
OK, so sorry about such a
quick presentation of such a

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.080
basic subject.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:15.120
Conformal mapping, not on any
exam, that'd be impossible.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.250
It's really this stuff that
you're number one responsible

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:20.293
for.
