00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.750
PROFESSOR STRANG: Starting
with a differential equation.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.820
So key point here
in this lecture

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.850
is how do you start with
a differential equation

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:38.540
and end up with a discrete
problem that you can solve?

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.820
But simple
differential equation.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.590
It's got a second derivative and
I put a minus sign for a reason

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.810
that you will see.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.760
Second derivatives are
essentially negative

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.710
definite things so that
minus sign is to really

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.720
make it positive definite.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.120
And notice we have
boundary conditions.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.990
At one end the solution is zero,
at the other end it's zero.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.850
So this is fixed-fixed.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.260
And it's a boundary
value problem.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.390
That's different from an
initial value problem.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.340
We have x space, not time.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.440
So we're not starting
from some thing

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.080
and oscillating or growing
or decaying in time.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.270
We have a fixed thing.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.470
Think of an elastic bar.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.580
An elastic bar
fixed at both ends,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.020
maybe hanging by its own weight.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.880
So that load f(x) could
represent the weight.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.900
Maybe the good place
to sit is over there,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.200
there are tables
just, how about that?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.130
It's more comfortable.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.470
So we can solve that equation.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.700
Especially when I
change f(x) to be one.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.890
As I plan to do.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.345
So I'm going to
change, I'm going

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:01.200
to make it-- it's a
uniform bar because there's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.530
no variable coefficient in
there and let me make it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.090
a uniform load, just one.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.520
So it actually shows you
that, I mentioned differential

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.960
equations and we'll certainly
get onto Laplace's equation,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.100
but essentially our differential
equations will not--

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.420
this isn't a course in
how to solve ODEs or PDEs.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.270
Especially not ODEs.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.940
It's a course in how
to compute solutions.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.650
So the key idea will be to
replace the differential

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.980
equation by a
difference equation.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.350
So there's the
difference equation.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.040
And I have to talk about that.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.500
That's the sort of key
point, that-- up here you

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.570
see what I would call
a second difference.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.270
Actually with a minus sign.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.950
And on the right-hand side
you see the load, still f(x).

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.950
Can I move to this board
to explain differences?

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.970
Because this is
like, key step is

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.720
given the differential
equation replace it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.860
by difference equation.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.900
And the interesting point
is you have many choices.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.450
There's one
differential equation

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.120
but even for a first
derivative, so this,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.150
if you remember from
calculus, how did you

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.210
start with the derivative?

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.900
You started by something
before going to the limit.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.970
h or delta x goes to zero in
the end to get the derivative.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.680
But this was a
finite difference.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.690
You moved a finite amount.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.210
And this is the one you always
see in calculus courses.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.140
u(x+h) - u(x), just how
much did that step go.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.320
You divide by the
delta x, the h,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.400
and that's approximately
the derivative, u'(x).

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.070
Let me just continue
with these others.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.170
I don't remember if calculus
mentions a backward difference.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.150
But you won't be surprised that
another possibility, equally

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.400
good more or less, would
be to take the point

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.170
and the point before, take the
difference, divide by delta x.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.890
So again all these
approximate u'.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.000
And now here's one that
actually is really important.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.910
A center difference.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.260
It's the average of
the forward and back.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.440
If I take that plus that,
the u(x)'s cancel and I'm

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.850
left with, I'm centering it.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.820
This idea of centering
is a good thing actually.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.930
And of course I have to divide
by 2h because this step is now

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.660
2h, two delta x's.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.890
So that again is
going to represent u'.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.910
But so we have a choice if
we have a first derivative.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.210
And actually that's a big issue.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.790
You know, one might
be called upwind,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.490
one might be called downwind,
one may be called centered.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.120
It comes up constantly in aero,
in mechanical engineering,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.660
everywhere.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.870
You have these choices to make.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.830
Especially for the
first difference.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.590
We don't have, I didn't
allow a first derivative

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.410
in that equation because I
wanted to keep it symmetric

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.540
and first derivatives,
first differences

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.750
tend to be anti-symmetric.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.310
So if we want to get
our good matrix K,

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.670
and I better remember
to divide by h squared,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.500
because the K just has those
that I introduced last time

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.730
and will repeat, the K just
has the numbers -1, 2, -1.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:11.380
Now, first point before we leave
these guys what's up with them?

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.960
How do we decide
which one is better?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.110
There's something called
the order of accuracy.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.590
How close is the difference
to the derivative?

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.880
And the answer is the
error is of size h.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.390
So I would call that
first order accurate.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.020
And I can repeat here
but the text does it,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.580
how you recognize what-- This
is the sort of local error,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.050
truncation error, whatever,
you've chopped off

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.900
the exact answer and
just did differences.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.310
This one is also order h.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.200
And in fact, the h
terms, the leading error,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.480
which is going to
multiply the h,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.530
has opposite sign in
these two and that's

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.230
the reason centered
differences are great.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.380
Because when you average
them your center things--

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.850
this is correct to
order h squared.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.760
And I may come back and find
out why that h squared term is.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.711
Maybe I'll do that.

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:26.210
Yeah.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.400
Why don't I just?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.270
Second differences
are so important.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.270
Why don't we just see.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.980
And centered differences.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.690
So let me see.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.270
How do you figure u(x+h)?

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:48.900
This is a chance to remember
something called Taylor series.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.630
But that was in calculus.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.140
If you forgot it,
you're a normal person.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.550
So but what does it say?

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.000
That's the whole point
of calculus, in a way.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
That if I move a little
bit, I start from the point

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.770
x and then there's
a little correction

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.990
and that's given
by the derivative

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.000
and then there's a
further correction

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.630
if I want to go
further and that's

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.160
given by half of h squared,
you see the second order

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.270
correction, times the
second derivative.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.500
And then, of course, more.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.430
But that's all you
ever have to remember.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.620
It's pretty rare.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:35.110
Second order accuracy
is often the goal

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.150
in scientific computing.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.420
First order accuracy is,
like, the lowest level.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.920
You start there, you write a
code, you test it and so on.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.140
But if you want production,
if you want accuracy,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.200
get to second order if possible.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.580
Now, what about this u(x-h)?

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.700
Well, that's a step
backwards, so that's u(x),

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.210
now the step is -h, but
then when I square that step

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:08.030
I'm back to +h^2
u''(x) and so on.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.550
Ooh!

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.130
Am I going to find
even more accuracy?

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.790
I could tell you what
the next term is.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:25.480
Plus h^3 upon 6, that's
3*2*1, u triple-prime.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.380
And this would be, since
this step is -h now,

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.750
it would be -h^3 / 6 u'''.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.340
So what happens when I take
the difference of these two?

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.810
Remember now that centered
differences subtract this

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.050
from this.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:51.170
So now that u(x+h)
- u(x-h) is zero,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:58.370
2hu' subtracting that from
that is zero, two of these,

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.390
so I guess that we really
have an h^3 / 3 u'''.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.730
And now when I divide by the 2h,
can I just divide by 2h here?

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.450
Oh yeah, it's coming
out right, divide by 2h,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.950
divide this by 2h, that'll
make it an h squared over six.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.440
I've done what looks
like a messy computation.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.800
I'm a little sad to start a
good lecture, important lecture

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.140
by such grungy stuff.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.510
But it makes the key point.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.420
That the centered difference
gives the correct derivative

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.860
with an error of order h^2.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.620
Where the error for
the first differences,

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.500
the h would have been there.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.180
And we can test it.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.430
Actually we'll test it.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.290
Okay for that?

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.420
This is first differences.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.580
And that's a big
question: what do you

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.510
replace the first derivative
by if there is one?

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.270
And you've got
these three choices.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.420
And usually this
is the best choice.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.990
Now to second derivatives.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:17.270
Because our equation
has got u'' in it.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.040
So what's a second derivative?

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.000
It's the derivative
of the derivative.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.980
So what's the second difference?

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.080
It's the difference,
first difference

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.150
of the first difference.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.380
So the second difference,
the natural second difference

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.360
would be-- so now
let me use this space

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.510
for second differences.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.300
Second differences.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.270
I could take the
forward difference

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.680
of the backward difference.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.090
Or I could take the
backward difference

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.620
of the forward difference.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.780
Or you may say why don't I
take the centered difference

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.110
of the centered difference.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:02.940
All those, in some sense
it's delta squared,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.720
but which to take?

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:13.070
Well actually those are the
same and that's the good choice,

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.520
that's the 1, -2, 1 choice.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.560
So let me show you that.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.270
Let me say what's
the matter with that.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:25.730
Because now having said how
great centered differences are,

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.930
first differences, why
don't I just repeat them

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.040
for second differences?

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.520
Well the trouble is, let me say
in a word without even writing,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.320
well I could even write a
little, the center difference,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.510
suppose I'm at a
typical mesh point here.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.360
The center difference
is going to take

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.220
that value minus that value.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.020
But then if I take the
center difference of that

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.380
I'm going to be out here.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.150
I'm going to take this value,
this value, and this value.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.130
I'll get something correct.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.800
Its accuracy will be
second order, good.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.050
But it stretches too far.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.320
We want compact
difference molecules.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:15.330
We don't want this one, minus
two of this, plus one of that.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:22.470
So this would give
us a 1, 0, -2 , 0, 1.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.420
I'm just saying this and then
I'll never come back to it

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.960
because I don't like
this one, these guys

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:36.020
give 1, -2, 1 without any gaps.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.550
And that's the right choice.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.700
And that's the choice made here.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.800
So I'm not thinking you
can see it in your head,

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.850
that the difference
of the difference--

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.200
But well, you almost can.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.430
If I take this, yeah.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.360
Can you sort of see this
without my writing it?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.880
If I take the forward
difference and then

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:06.480
I subtract the forward
difference to the left,

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.450
do you see that
I'll have minus two.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.890
So there is what I started with.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:19.640
I subtract u(x) - U(x-h) and I
get two -u(x)'s This is what I

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.170
get.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.870
Now I'm calling that u_i.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.840
I better make completely
clear about the minus sign.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.030
The forward difference or
the backward difference,

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:41.230
what this leads is 1, -2, 1.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.080
That's the second difference.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.900
Very important to remember, the
second difference of a function

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.110
is the function, the value
ahead, minus two of the center,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.330
plus one of the left.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.610
It's centered obviously,
symmetric, right?

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.630
Second differences
are symmetric.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.300
And because I want
a minus sign I

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.000
want minus the second
difference and that's

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.090
why you see here -1, 2, -1.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.070
Because I wanted
positive two there.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:18.880
Are you okay?

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:26.740
This is the natural
replacement for -u''.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.885
And I claim that this
second difference

00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:34.220
is like the second
derivative, of course.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.600
And why don't we just
check some examples

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.030
to see how like the
second derivative it is.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.780
So I'm going to take
the second difference

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:47.560
of some easy functions.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.100
It's very important that
these come out so well.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.580
So I'm going to take
the second difference.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.840
I'm going to write it
as sort of a matrix.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.880
So this is like the
second difference.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.610
Yeah, because this is good.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.690
I'm inside the region, here.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.590
I'm not worried about
the boundaries now.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.700
Let me just think
of myself as inside.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.930
So I have second
differences and suppose

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:18.280
I'm applying it to a
vector of all ones.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.440
What answer should I get?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:28.910
So if I think of calculus, it's
the second derivative of one,

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.610
of the constant function.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.500
So what answer am
I going to get?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.050
Zero.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.320
And do I get zero?

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.140
Of course.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.640
I get zero.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.890
Right?

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.840
All these second
differences are zero.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.500
Because I'm not worrying
about the boundary yet.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.510
So that's like, check one.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.460
It passed that simple test.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:57.010
Now let me move up from
constant to linear.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.710
And so on.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.570
So let me apply
second differences

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.440
to a vector that's
growing linearly.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.520
What answer do I
expect to get for that?

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.210
So remember I'm doing
second differences,

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.020
like second
derivatives, or minus

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.880
second derivatives, actually.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.640
So what do second derivatives
do to a linear function?

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.250
If I take a straight
line I take the-- sorry,

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.170
second derivatives.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.470
If I take second derivatives
of a linear function I get?

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.510
Zero, right.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.630
So I would hope to get
zero again here and I do.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:35.650
Right?

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.150
-1+4-3=0.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.270
Minus one, sorry, let
me do it here, -2+6-4.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:48.000
And actually, that's consistent
with our little Taylor series

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.690
stuff.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.270
The function x should
come out right.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.180
Now what about-- now
comes the moment.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.140
What about x squared?

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.220
So I'm going to
put squares in now.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.080
Do I expect to get zeroes?

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.550
I don't think so.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.920
Because let me again
test it by thinking

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.390
about what second derivative.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:18.360
So now I'm sort of copying
second derivative of x squared,

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.470
which is?

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.350
Second derivative
of x squared is?

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.980
Two, right?

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.200
First derivative's 2x, second
derivative is just two.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.170
So it's a constant.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.170
And remember I put in a
minus sign so I'm wondering,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.520
do I get the answer minus two?

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.420
All the way down.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.020
-4+8-9.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.940
Whoops.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.540
What's that?

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.480
What do I get there?

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.640
What do I get from that second
difference of these squares?

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.640
-4+8-9 is?

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.140
Minus two, good.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.831
So can we keep going?

00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:05.330
-4+18-16.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.730
What's that?

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:15.200
-4+18-16, so I've got -20+18.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.330
I got minus two again.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.940
-9, 32, -25, it's right.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:32.670
The second differences
of the vector of squares,

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.290
you could say, is a constant
vector with the right number.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.515
And that's because
that second difference

00:19:39.515 --> 00:19:41.260
is second order accurate.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.400
It not only got constants
right and linears right,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.860
it got quadratics right.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.910
So that's, you're seeing
second differences.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:57.060
We'll soon see that second
differences are also

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.180
on the ball when you apply
them to other vectors.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:06.070
Like vectors of sines or vectors
of cosines or exponentials,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.150
they do well.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.890
So that's just a useful check
which will help us over here.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.220
Okay, can I come back to
the part of the lecture now?

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:23.060
Having prepared
the way for this.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.270
Well, let's start right off
by solving the differential

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.120
equation.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.650
So I'm bringing you back years
and years and years, right?

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.160
Solve that differential
equation with these two boundary

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.290
conditions.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.960
How would you do that
in a systematic way?

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.250
You could almost
guess after a while,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.950
but systematically
if I have a linear,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.300
I notice-- What do I
notice about this thing?

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.950
It's linear.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.410
So what am I expecting?

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.530
I'm expecting, like,
a particular solution

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:05.160
that gives the correct answer,
one, and some null space

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.280
solution or whatever
I want to call it,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.290
homogeneous solution
that gives zero

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.920
and has some arbitrary
constants in it.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.790
Give me a particular solution.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.100
So this is going
to be our answer.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.850
This'll be the general solution
to this differential equation.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.510
What functions have minus the
second derivative equal one,

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.870
that's all I'm asking.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.980
What are they?

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.400
So what is one of them?

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.510
One function that has its
second derivative is a constant

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.850
and that constant is minus one.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.410
So if I want the second
derivative to be a constant,

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.400
what am I looking at? x squared.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.190
I'm looking at x squared.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.510
And I just want to
figure out how many x

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.380
squareds to get a one.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.510
So some number of x squareds
and how many do I want?

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.940
-1/2, good.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.410
Good.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:01.970
-1/2.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.030
Because x squared
would give me two

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.860
but I want minus
one so I need -1/2.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.590
Okay that's the
particular solution.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:18.320
Now throw in all the solutions,
I can add in any solution

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.420
that has a zero
on the right side,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:29.130
so what functions have second
derivatives equals zero?

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.980
x is good.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.310
I'm looking for two because
it's a second derivative, second

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.510
order equation.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.100
What's the other guy?

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.480
Constant, good.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:43.590
So let me put the constant
first, C, say, and Dx.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.660
Two constants that I can
play with and what use

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.140
am I going to make of them?

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.710
I'm going to use those to
satisfy the two boundary

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.270
conditions.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.830
And it won't be difficult.
You could say plug

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.910
in the first boundary
condition, get

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.880
an equation for the
constants, plug in

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.950
the second, got
another equation,

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.620
we'll have two
boundary conditions,

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.790
two equations, two constants.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.050
Everything's going to come out.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:22.260
So if I plug in u(0)=0,
what do I learn?

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.710
C is zero, right?

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.720
If I plug in, is that right?

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.500
If I plug in zero, then
that's zero already,

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.190
this is zero already, so I
just learned that C is zero.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.720
So C is zero.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.320
So I'm down to one constant,
one unused boundary condition.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.550
Plug that in. u(1) = -1/2.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.630
What's D?

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:51.940
It's 1/2, right.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.290
D is 1/2.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:56.340
So can I close this up?

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.920
There's 1/2.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.380
Dx is 1/2.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.450
Now it just always
pays to look back.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.100
At x=0, that's obviously zero.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.720
At x=1 it's zero because those
are the same and I get zero.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.170
So -1/2 x squared plus 1/2 x.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:23.620
That's the kind of differential
equation and solution

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.070
that we're looking for.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.850
Not complicated nonlinear stuff.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:35.480
So now I'm ready to move
to the difference equation.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:41.350
So again, this is a major step.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:46.780
I'll draw a picture of
this from zero to one.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:51.000
And if I graph that I think
I get a parabola, right?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.550
A parabola that has
to go through here.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.940
So it's some parabola like that.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:01.540
That would be always good, to
draw a graph of the solution.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.790
Now, what do I get here?

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.260
Moving to the
difference equation.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:12.480
So that's the equation, and
notice its boundary conditions.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.540
Those boundary conditions
just copied this one

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:20.160
because I've chopped this up.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:26.920
I've got i = 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, and this is one,

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:31.530
the last point then is 6h.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.320
h is 1/6.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.450
What's going to be
the size of my matrix

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.600
and my vector and
my unknown u here?

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.390
How many unknowns
am I going to have?

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.344
Let's just get the
overall picture right.

00:25:46.344 --> 00:25:47.760
What are the
unknowns going to be?

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.593
They're going to be
u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, u_5.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.700
Those are unknown.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.360
Those will be some
values, I don't

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.980
know where, maybe something
like this because they'll

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.060
be sort of like that one.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:06.430
And this is not an unknown, u_6;
this is not an unknown, u_0;

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.350
those are the ones we know.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:14.390
So this is what the solution
to a difference equation

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.180
looks like.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.480
It gives you a discrete
set of unknowns.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.990
And then, of course
MATLAB or any code

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.020
could connect them
up by straight lines

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.410
and give you a function.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:33.630
But the heart of it
is these five values.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:38.890
Okay, good.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:44.400
And those five values
come from these equations.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.440
I'm introducing
this subscript stuff

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.960
but I won't need it all the time
because you'll see the picture.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:56.250
This equation applies for
i equal one up to five.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:01.280
Five inside points and then
you notice how when i is one,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.310
this needs u_0, but we know u_0.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:08.910
And when i is five, this
needs u_6, but we know u_6.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.300
So it's a closed
five by five system

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.220
and it will be our matrix.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.050
That -1, 2, -1 is what
sits on the matrix.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.490
When we close it with the
two boundary conditions

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.190
it chops off the
zero column, you

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.510
could say and chops
off the six column

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:37.650
and leaves us with a five
by five problem and yeah.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:44.300
I guess this is a step not
to jump past because it

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.370
takes a little practice.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.270
You see I've written
the same thing two ways.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.080
Let me write it a third way.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.270
Let me write it out clearly.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:59.210
So now here I'm going to
complete this matrix with a two

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:04.370
and a minus one and a two and
a minus one and now it's five

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.550
by five.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.480
And those might
be u, but I don't

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:18.650
know if they are, so let me put
in u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, and u_5.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.700
Oh and divide by h squared.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.160
I'll often forget that.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.740
So I'm asking you
to see something

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.530
that if you haven't, after
you get the hang of it

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.070
it's like, automatic.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.261
But I have to remember
it's not automatic.

00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:41.760
Things aren't
automatic until you've

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.150
done them a couple of times.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:53.430
So do you see that that is a
concrete statement of this?

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.720
This delta x squared
is the h squared.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.850
And do you see those
differences when

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.290
I do that multiplication that
they produce those differences?

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.300
And now, what's my
right-hand side?

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:12.720
Well I've changed the right-hand
side to one to make it easy.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.400
So this right-hand
side is all ones.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:25.660
And this is the problem
that MATLAB would solve

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.800
or whatever code.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.330
Find a difference code.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:34.900
I've got to a linear
system, five by five,

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.640
it's fortunately-- the
matrix is not singular,

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.020
there is a solution.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.400
How does MATLAB find it?

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.540
It does not find it by finding
the inverse of that matrix.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.320
Monday's lecture
will quickly review

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.720
how to solve five equations
and five unknowns.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.440
It's by elimination, I'll
tell you the key word.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.380
And that's what every code does.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.320
And sometimes you would
have to exchange rows,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.990
but not for a positive
definite matrix like that.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.260
It'll just go bzzz,
right through.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.990
When it's tridiagonal it'll go
like with the speed of light

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.010
and you'll get the answer.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.012
And those five answers will
be these five heights. u_1,

00:30:23.012 --> 00:30:23.970
u_2, u_3, u_4, and u_5.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.520
And we could figure it out.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.430
Actually I think section
1.2 gives the formula

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:41.260
for this particular model
problem for any size,

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.380
in particular for five by five.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:55.440
And there is something
wonderful for this special case.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.230
The five points fall right
on the correct parabola,

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.910
they're exactly right.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:06.310
So for this particular case when
the solution was a quadratic,

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.830
the exact solution was
a quadratic, a parabola,

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:14.540
it will turn out-- and
that quadratic matches

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.210
these boundary conditions,
it will turn out

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:25.410
that those points are
right on the money.

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.970
So that's, you
could call, is like,

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.510
super-convergence or something.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.680
I mean that won't
happen every time,

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:39.740
otherwise life would
be like, too easy.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:46.360
It's a good life, but it's
not that good as a rule.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:56.360
So they fall right
on that curve.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.820
And we can say what
those numbers are.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.790
Actually, we know what they are.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:03.860
Actually, I guess
I could find them.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:09.940
What are those numbers then?

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.300
And of course,
one over h squared

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.140
is-- What's one over h
squared, just to not forget?

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.870
One over h squared
there, h is what?

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.400
1/6.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.430
Squared, it's going to be a 36.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:30.040
So if I bring it up here,
bring the h squared up here,

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.570
it would be times a 36.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:37.680
Well let me leave it here, 36.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.050
And I'm just saying that these
numbers would come out right.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.970
Maybe I'll just
do the first one.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.570
What's the exact u_1, u_2?

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.370
u_1 and u_2 would be what?

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:51.160
The exact u_1, ooh!

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.920
Oh shoot, I've got
to figure it out.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.280
If I plug in x=1/6...

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:04.460
Do we want to do this?

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.980
Plug in x=1/6?

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.310
No, we don't.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.840
We don't.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.370
We've got something better
to do with our lives.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.740
But if we put that
number in, whatever

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:19.460
the heck it is, in this one, we
would find out came out right.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.580
The fact that it comes
out right is important.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:34.430
But I'd like to move on
to a similar problem.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.400
But this one is going
to be free-fixed.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:44.850
So if this problem was like
having an elastic bar hanging

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.340
under its own weight
and these would

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:53.390
be the displacements points on
the bar and fixed at the ends,

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.410
now I'm freeing up the top end.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:02.250
I'm not making u_0 zero anymore.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.410
I better maybe use a
different blackboard

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:12.010
because that's so important
that I don't want to erase it.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:20.850
So let me take the same problem,
uniform bar, uniform load,

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:27.400
but I'm going to fix
u(1), that's fixed,

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.160
but I'm going to free this end.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.450
And from a differential
equation point of view,

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:39.001
that means I'm going to set
the slope at zero to be zero.

00:34:39.001 --> 00:34:39.500
u'(0)=0.

00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:48.130
That's going to have
a different solution.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.000
Change the boundary conditions
is going to change the answer.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.470
Let's find the solution.

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:56.000
So here's another
differential equation.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.330
Same equation, different
boundary conditions,

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.680
so how do we go?

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.170
Well I had the general
solution over there.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:10.570
It still works, right? u(x)
is still -1/2 of x squared.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.690
The particular solution
that gives me the one.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:19.300
Plus the Cx plus D that
gives me zero and zero

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.120
for second derivatives
but gives me

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.220
the possibility to satisfy
the two boundary conditions.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.760
And now again, plug in
the boundary conditions

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:35.380
to find C and D.
Slope is 0 at 0.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.960
What does that tell me?

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.450
I have to plug that in.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.190
Here's my solution, I have
to take its derivative

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.620
and set x to zero.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.410
So its derivative
is a 2x or a minus x

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:53.560
or something which is zero.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:36:00.390
The derivative of that is C and
the derivative of that is zero.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.500
What am I learning from
that left, the free boundary

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.690
condition?

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.820
C is zero, right?

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.730
C is zero because
the slope here is C

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:12.980
and it's supposed to be zero.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.210
So C is zero.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.070
Now the other
boundary condition.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:21.880
Plug in x=1.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.840
I want to get the answer zero.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:32.090
The answer I do get is -1/2 at
x=1, plus D. So what is D then?

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:33.150
What's D?

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.740
Let me raise that.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.320
What do I learn about D?

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.680
It's 1/2.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.180
I need 1/2.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:57.980
So the answer is -1/2
of x squared plus 1/2.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:04.940
Not 1/2 x as it was
over there, but 1/2.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.250
And now let's graph it.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.350
Always pays to
graph these things

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:12.760
between x equals zero and one.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.690
What does this looks like?

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.550
It starts at 1/2, right?

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.730
At x=0.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.680
And it's a parabola, right?

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.610
It's a parabola.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.820
And I know it goes
through this point.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.970
What else do I know?

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.250
Slope starts at?

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.760
The slope starts at zero.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.470
The other, the
boundary condition,

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.800
the free condition
at the left-hand end,

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.530
so slope starts at zero, so the
parabola comes down like that.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.430
It's like half
a-- where that was

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:51.160
a symmetric bit of a parabola,
this is just half of it.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:56.670
The slope is zero.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.090
And so that's a graph of u(x) .

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:07.370
Now I'm ready to replace it
by a difference equation.

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.440
So what'll be the
difference equation?

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.780
It'll be the same
equation for the -u''.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.880
No change.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:25.620
So minus u_(i+1) minus 2u_i,
minus u_(i-1) over h squared

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:34.650
equals-- I'm taking f(x) to be
one, so let's stay with one.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:38.390
Okay, big moment.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.930
What boundary conditions?

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.560
What boundary conditions?

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.700
Well, this guy is pretty clear.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:51.760
That says u_(n+1) is zero.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.790
What do I do for zero slope?

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.480
What do I do for a zero slope?

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.200
Okay, let me suggest
one possibility.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:05.520
It's not the greatest, but one
possibility for zero slope is

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:11.800
(u_1-u_0)/h -- that's
the approximate slope --

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.660
should be zero.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:21.460
So that's my choice for the
left-hand boundary condition.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.820
It says u_1 is u_0 .

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.390
It says that u_1 is u_0 .

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:37.592
So now I've got
again five equations

00:39:37.592 --> 00:39:39.550
for five unknowns, u_1,
u_2, u_3, u_4, and u_5.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.640
I'll write down what they are.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.960
Well, you know what they are.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.910
So this thing
divided by h squared

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:57.970
is all ones, just like before.

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:05.210
And of course all these
rows are not changed.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:07.860
But the first row is changed
because we have a new boundary

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.880
condition at the left end.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.620
And it's this.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.130
So u_1, well u_0
isn't in the picture,

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:19.900
but previously what
happened to u_0, when

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.180
i is one, I'm in the
first equation here,

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.590
that's where I'm
looking. i is one.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.210
It had a u_0.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.190
Gone.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:34.800
In this case it's not gone.
u_0 comes back in, u_0 is u_1.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.600
That might-- Ooh!

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.090
Don't let me do this wrong.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:38.590
Ah!

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.350
Don't let me do it worse!

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.140
All right.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:43.780
There we go.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.280
Good.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.820
Okay.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:52.580
Please, last time I
videotaped lecture 10

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:56.310
had to fix up lecture 9,
because I don't go in.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.720
Professor Lewin in the
physics lectures, he cheats,

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.760
doesn't cheat, but he goes
into the lectures afterwards

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.340
and fixes them.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:10.920
But you get exactly
what it looks like.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.160
So now it's fixed, I hope.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.830
But don't let me screw up.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:22.320
So now, what's on this top row?

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.260
When i is one.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.710
I have minus u_2, that's fine.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:31.590
I have 2u_1 as before,
but now I have a minus

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:34.390
u_1 because u_0 and
u_1 are the same.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:37.100
So I just have a one in there.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:42.810
That's our matrix that we called
T. The top row is changed,

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.430
the top row is free.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.910
This is the equation T
times u divided by h squared

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:57.170
is the right-hand side, ones.
ones(5), I would call that.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.430
Properly I would
call it ones(5, 1),

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:04.410
because the MATLAB command
'ones' wants matrix

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:08.990
and it's a matrix with
five rows, one column.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:12.940
But it's T, that's
the important thing.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:20.970
And would you like to guess
what the solution looks like?

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:25.520
In particular, is it
again exactly right?

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.460
Is it right on the money?

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:35.790
Or if not, why not?

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.610
The computer will
tell us, of course.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.390
It will tell us whether we
get agreement with this.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:48.060
This is the exact solution here
and this is the exact parabola

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.720
starting with zero slope.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.430
So but I solved this problem.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:58.252
Oh, let me see, I didn't get
u_1, u_2 to u_5 in there.

00:42:58.252 --> 00:43:00.460
So it didn't look right.
u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, and u_5.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.390
And that's the right-hand side.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:08.250
Sorry about that.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:12.310
So that's T divided
by h squared.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:19.090
T, with that top row changed,
times U is the right-hand side.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:23.960
By the way, I
better just say what

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:30.990
was the reason that we came out
exactly right on this problem?

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:35.050
Would we come out exactly right
if it was some general load

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:36.910
f(x)?

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.120
No.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.240
Finite differences
can't do miracles.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.820
They have no way to know
what's happening to f(x)

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.760
between the mesh points, right?

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:52.860
If I took this to be f(x) and
took this at the five points,

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.770
at these five
points, this wouldn't

00:43:55.770 --> 00:44:00.590
know what f(x) is in between,
couldn't be exactly right.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:05.900
It's exactly right in
this lucky special case

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:11.070
because, of course,
it has the right ones.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:14.460
But also because, the
reason it's exactly right

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:19.670
is that second differences of
quadratics are exactly right.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:24.740
That's what we checked on this
board that's underneath there.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:29.420
Second differences of
squares came out perfectly.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.830
And that's why the second
differences of this guy

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:37.980
give the right
answer, so that guy

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.610
is the answer to both the
differential and the difference

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.960
equation.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.710
I had to say that word about
why was that exactly right.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.390
It was exactly right because
second differences of squares

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:50.720
are exactly right.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.770
Now, again, we have second
differences of squares.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:57.915
So you could say
exactly right or no?

00:44:57.915 --> 00:44:58.790
What are you betting?

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:03.260
How many think, yeah, it's going
to come out on the parabola?

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.450
Nobody.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.590
Right.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:10.110
Everybody thinks there's
something going to miss here.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:11.690
And why?

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.340
Why am I going to
miss something?

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.530
Yes?

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:20.490
It's a first-order approximation
at the left boundary.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.690
Exactly right, exactly right.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:26.890
It's a first-order
approximation to take this

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:29.600
and I'm not going
to get it right.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.140
That first-order approximation,
that error of size h

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:39.400
is going to penetrate
over the whole interval.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.430
It'll be biggest here.

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:43.250
Actually I think it turns
out, and the book has a graph,

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:47.960
I think it comes out
wrong by 1/2 h there.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.640
1/2 h, first order.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.770
And then it, of
course, it's discrete

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.070
and of course it's straight
across because that's

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.830
the boundary condition, right?

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:03.750
And then it starts down, it gets
sort of closer, closer, closer

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.280
and gets, of course,
that's right at the end.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.850
But there's an error.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:15.970
The difference between u, the
true u, and the computed u

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:22.680
is of order h.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:28.340
So you could say alright, if h
is small I can live with that.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:32.150
But as I said in
the end you really

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.650
want to get second order
accuracy if you can.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:36.380
And in a simple
problem like this

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.320
we should be able to do it.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:44.630
What I've done already
covers section 1.2

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.120
but then there's a
note, a worked example

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:56.820
at the end of 1.2 that tells you
how to upgrade to second order.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.860
And maybe we've got a moment
to see how would we do it.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.230
What would you suggest
that I do differently?

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:07.290
I'll get a different matrix.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.640
I'll get a different
discrete problem.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.860
But that'll be okay.

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.930
I can solve that just as well.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.910
And what shall I
replace that by?

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:19.480
because that was the
guilty party, as you said.

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.270
That was guilty.

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.400
That's only a first
order approximation

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:28.670
to zero slope at zero.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.510
A couple of ways we could go.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:33.920
This is a correct second
order approximation

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.070
at what mesh point?

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:44.060
That is a correct second order
approximation to u'=0, but not

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:48.470
at that point or at
that point where?

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:50.760
Halfway between.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.550
If I was looking
at a point halfway

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.970
between that, that
would be centered there,

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:56.580
that would be a
centered difference

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.640
and it would be good.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.350
But we're not looking there.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:02.280
So I'm looking here.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:06.980
So what do you suggest I do?

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.880
Well I've got to center it.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.900
Essentially I'm
going to use u_(-1).

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:17.420
I'm going to use u_(-1).

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:23.050
And let me just say
what the effect is.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:27.920
You remember we started with
the usual second difference

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.730
here, 2, -1, -1.

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:34.670
This is what got chopped
off for the fixed method.

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:37.990
It got brought back here
by our first order method.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:41.570
Our second order
method will-- You

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.900
see what's likely to happen?

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.300
That minus one is
going to show up where?

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.780
Over here.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.530
To center it around zero.

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:59.300
So that guy will make
this into a minus two.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:03.490
Now that matrix is still fine.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:07.520
It's not one of our
special matrices.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.050
When I say fine, it's
not beautiful is it?

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:17.640
It's got one, like,
flaw, it needs

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.470
what do you call it when
you have your face--

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:22.990
cosmetic surgery or something.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.350
It needs a small improvement.

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:27.960
So what's the matter with it?

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.770
It's not symmetric.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:33.060
It's not symmetric
and a person isn't

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:36.630
happy with a un-symmetric
problem, approximation

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.810
to a perfectly symmetric thing.

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.850
So I could just divide
that row by two.

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:46.020
If I divide that row by 2, which
you won't mind if I do that,

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:50.900
make that one, minus
one and makes this 1/2.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:55.020
I divided the first
equation by two.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:02.960
Look in the notes in
the text if you can.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.870
And the result is
now it's right on.

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:07.470
It's exactly on.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:12.140
Because again, the solution,
the true solution is squares.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:17.260
This is now second order and
we'll get it exactly right.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.790
And I say all this
for two reasons.

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:25.300
One is to emphasize again that
the boundary conditions are

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:30.090
critical and that they
penetrate into the region.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:32.880
The second reason
for my saying this

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:37.540
is looking forward
way into October.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:41.670
So let me just say the
finite element method, which

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:44.790
you may know a little about,
you may have heard about,

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:48.510
it's another-- this
was finite differences.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.510
Courses starting with
finite differences,

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:52.260
because that's the
most direct way.

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.330
You just go for it.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:57.460
You've got derivatives, you
replace them by differences.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:08.890
But another approach which turns
out to be great for big codes

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:12.170
and also turns out to
be great for making,

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:16.220
for keeping the properties of
the problem, the finite element

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:21.520
method, you'll see it, it's
weeks away, but when it comes,

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.780
notice, the finite element
method automatically

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.540
produces that first equation.

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:29.880
Automatically gets it right.

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:33.010
So that's pretty special.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:36.670
And so, the finite
element method just has,

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:39.160
it produces that
second order accuracy

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:48.330
that we didn't get automatically
for finite differences.

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:52.800
Okay, questions on today
or on the homework.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.760
So the homework is
really wide open.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.550
It's really just a
chance to start to see.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:03.650
I mean, the real homework
is read those two sections

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:09.310
of the book to capture what
these two lectures have done.

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:11.870
So Monday I'll see.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.380
We'll do elimination.

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:17.530
We'll solve these equations
quickly and then move on

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:21.600
to the inverse matrix.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.390
More understanding
of these problems.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:26.178
Thanks.
