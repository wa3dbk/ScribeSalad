00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.300
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK, so.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.320
These are our two topics.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.490
And, Thanksgiving is
coming up, of course.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.560
With convolutions, where are we?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.330
I'm probably starting
a little early.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.770
Oh, I am.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.790
Is that right?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.900
Yeah, OK.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.490
So, with convolutions,
I feel we've

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.360
got a whole lot of formulas.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.690
We practiced on some
specific examples,

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.720
but we didn't see
the reason for them.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.240
We didn't say the use of them.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.440
And I'm unwilling to
let a whole topic,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.380
important topic
like convolutions,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.800
go on with just formulas.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.300
So I want to talk about
signal processing.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.320
So that's a nice, perfect
application of convolutions.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.170
And you'll see it.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.180
You'll see the point,
and it's something

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120
that you're going
to end up doing.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.740
And it's quite a simple
idea, once you understand

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.900
convolutions you've got it.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.250
OK, but then I do want to go on
to the Fourier integral part.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.050
And basically, today I'll
just give the formulas.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.690
So you've got the
Fourier integral formulas

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.470
that take from a function
f, defined for all x now.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.940
It's on the whole line,
like some bell-shaped curve

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.780
or some exponential decaying.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.860
And then you get its transform,
I could call that c(k),

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.480
but a more familiar
notation is f hat of k.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.900
So that will be the Fourier
integral transform, or just

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.120
for short, Fourier
transform of f(x),

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.210
and it'll involve
all frequencies.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.320
So we are getting away from
the periodic case and integer

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.020
frequencies, to the whole
line case with a whole line

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.100
of frequencies.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.090
OK, so is that alright?

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.290
Finishing, I'll have more to
say about 4.4 convolutions,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.620
but I want to say this much.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.300
OK, let's move to an example.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.130
So here's a typical
block diagram.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.400
In comes the signal.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.580
Vector x, values x_k.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.420
Often, in engineering
and EE, people

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.050
tend to write that
x of k, these days.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.380
OK, so, as being easier to type.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.850
And sort of better.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.840
But I'll stay with
the subscript.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.110
So that signal comes in.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.210
And it goes through a filter.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.970
And I'm taking the simplest
filter I can think of,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.870
the one that just
averages the current value

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.210
with the previous value.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.140
And we want to see what's
the effect of doing that.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.210
So we want to see, we want
to understand the outputs,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.890
the y_k's, which are
just the current value

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.970
and the previous value averaged.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.230
We want to see that
as a convolution,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.220
and see what it's doing.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.010
OK, so that's the-- And
I guess that here, it's

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:54.650
a frequent convention in signal
processing to basically pretend

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.080
that the signal is
infinitely long.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.070
That there's no
start and no finish.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.960
Of course, in reality there
has to be a start and a finish.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.480
But if it's a long, you know
if it's a cd or something,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.250
and you're sampling it every--
thousands and thousands

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.860
of times.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.940
And the input signal is so
long and you're not really

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.880
caring about the very
start and the very end.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.920
It's simpler to just
pretend that you've

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.760
got numbers for all k.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:39.020
OK, then let's see what
kind of a filter this is.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.090
What does it do to the signal?

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.610
OK.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.520
Well, one way filters
are-- First of all,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.500
let's see it as a convolution.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.410
So I want to see that this
formula is a convolution,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.320
that the output y, that
output of all the averages y,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.220
is the convolution
of some filter, some,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.470
and I'll give it a proper
name, with the input.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.810
And notice that, again,
there's no circle around here.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.980
We're not doing the
cyclic case, we're just

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.730
pretending infinitely long.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.410
So OK, now I just want
to ask you what is the h,

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.970
I want to recognize
this as a filter.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.720
So that convolution, let's
remember the notation.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.070
And then we can
match this to that.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.460
So remember the notation
for that would be,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.520
for a convolution
is, I take a sum.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:56.430
Of all x-- Of h sub
l, x sub k-l, right?

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.930
That's what convolution is.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.080
This is our famous, and it would
be in principle the sum over l.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.100
Sum over l's.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:13.770
So the filter is defined by
these numbers h, these h's,

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.230
h_0, h_1, so on.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:26.980
Those numbers h multiply the
x's, where this familiar rule

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.440
to give the k-th output.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.370
OK, let's have no mystery here.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.250
What are the h's if
this is the output?

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.780
Well, I want to
match that with that.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:51.370
So here I see that this takes
x_k, multiplies by a half.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.600
So that tells me
that when l is zero,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.060
I'm getting h_0 times
x_k, so what's h_0?

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.140
So what's the h_0?

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.880
It's 1/2.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.390
That's what this
formula is saying.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.970
When l is zero,
so l is zero, take

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.110
h_0, 1/2, times x_k, ta-da.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.190
Now, what's the other h
that's showing up here?

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.750
This is a very,
very short filter.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.820
It's only going to have two
coefficients, h_0 and h what?

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.660
One.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.940
And what's the coefficient h_1?

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.170
What's the number h_1?

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.820
Now you've told me
everything about h

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.310
when you tell me that number.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.070
Everybody sees it.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.910
It's also 1/2, right?

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.320
Because I'm taking
1/2 of x_(k-1).

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:56.240
So when l is that one, we have
h, the h is 1/2, times x_(k-1).

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.660
Do you see that that simple
averaging, running average,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.830
you could call it.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.280
Running average, it's
the most, the first thing

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.220
you would think of to-- Why
would you do such a thing?

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.320
Why is filtering done?

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.070
This filter, this averaging
filter, would smooth the data.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.350
So the data comes
with noise, of course.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:27.780
And what you'd like, so noise
is high-frequency stuff.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.050
So what you want to do is like
damp those high frequencies

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.050
a little bit, because
much of it is not,

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.780
it hasn't got information in it.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:42.870
It's just noise, but you
want to keep the signal.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.950
So it's always this
signal-to-noise ratio.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.160
That's the key -- SNR.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.650
PSNR.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.030
That's the constant expression,
signal-to-noise ratio.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:09:00.200
And we're sort of expecting here
that the signal-to-noise ratio

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.430
is pretty good.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.290
High.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.410
Mostly signal.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.190
But there's some noise.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.500
This is a very simple,
extremely short, filter.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:16.350
So this vector h, it's
a proper convolution.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.880
You could say h has
infinitely many components.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.950
But they're all zero,
except for those two.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.290
Right, do you see it?

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.650
Another way, just at
the end of last time,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:33.670
I asked you to think of a matrix
that's doing the same thing.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.460
Why do I bring a matrix in?

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.490
Because anytime I
see something linear,

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.610
and that's incredibly
linear, right?

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.500
I think OK, there's
a matrix doing it.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:52.710
So these y's, like y_k, y_(k+1),
all the y's are coming out.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:10:01.560
The x's are going in, x_k,
x_(k+1), x_(k-1), bunch of x's.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.610
And there's a matrix
doing exactly that.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.480
And what does that matrix have?

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.440
Well, it has 1/2
on the diagonal.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.370
So that y_k will
have a 1/2 of x_k,

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.620
and what's the other
entry in that row?

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.910
I want 1/2 of x_k, and I
want 1/2 of x_(k-1), right?

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.020
So I just put 1/2 next to it.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.810
So there is the main
diagonal of the halves,

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.740
and there is the
sub-diagonal of the half.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.900
So it's just constant diagonal.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.660
Now, yeah, let me
tell you the word.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.860
When an engineer,
electrical engineer

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.720
looks at this, first thing,
or this, any of these.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:54.400
First letters he uses is
linear time-invariant LTI.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.510
So linear we understand, right?

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.430
What does this
time-invariant mean?

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.780
Time-invariant means that
you're not changing the filter

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.190
as the signal comes through.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.790
You're keeping a
half and a half.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.340
You're keeping the formula.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.740
The formula doesn't
depend on k, the numbers

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.030
are just 1/2 and 1/2.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.970
They're the same, so if I shift
the whole signal by a thousand,

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.450
the output shifts by
a thousand, right?

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.730
If I take the whole
signal and delay it,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:34.090
delay it by a thousand
time, clock times?

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:39.070
Then the same output will come
a thousand clock times delayed.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.970
So linear time-invariant.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.780
That would be-- I mean,
linear time-invariant

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.530
is just talking convolution.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.170
I mean, that's what it comes to
if we're in discrete problems.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.960
It's just that, for some h.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:03.090
Now, our h deserves like,
the other initials you see.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.680
OK, that was linear
time invariant.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.970
Now, the next
initials you'll see

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.960
will be F-I-R.
It's an FIR filter.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:19.630
So that's finite
impulse response.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.860
What's the impulse
response mean?

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.910
It means the h.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.820
The vector h is the
impulse response.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.520
The vector h is what you
get if I put an impulse in,

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.050
what comes out?

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.710
Just tell me, what happens here.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.990
Suppose an impulse,
by an impulse

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.680
I mean I stick a one in one
position and all zeroes.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.360
Our usual delta.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.870
Our impulse, our
spike, is just, suppose

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.870
the x's have a one
here, otherwise

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.900
all zero, what comes out?

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.600
Well, suppose there's
just x_0 is one.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.590
What is y?

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.630
Suppose the only
input is boom, you

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.170
know a bell sounds at time zero.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.750
What comes out from the filter?

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.070
Well, y_0 will be what?

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.160
If the input has
just a single x,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.080
and it's one, at that
time zero, so x_0 is one.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.600
Then y_0 will be?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:29.500
1/2, and what will be y_1?

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.640
Also 1/2, right?

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.500
Because y_1 will
take x_1, that's

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.020
already dropped back to zero.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.390
Plus x_0, that's the bell.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.270
It'll be 1/2.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.700
In other words,
the output is this.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.370
No big deal.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.210
The impulse responses
is exactly h.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.660
So you can say they've created
a long word for a small idea,

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.260
true.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:00.210
And the idea, the word finite
is the important number.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.980
Finite, meaning that
it's finite length,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:08.710
I only have a finite number of
h's, and in this case two h's.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:15.070
So that's-- Part of every
subject is just learning

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.150
the language.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:21.630
So LTI, it means you've
got a convolution.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:26.230
FIR means that the
convolution has finite length.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.930
OK, now for the question.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.390
What is this filter
doing to the signal?

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.730
It's certainly averaging.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.460
That's clear.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.810
But we want to be more precise.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.710
Well, let me take some examples.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:51.680
Suppose the input is all ones.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.280
All x_k are one.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.670
So a constant input.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.170
Natural thing to test.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:02.240
That's the constant input,
that's zero frequency.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.310
Zero frequency.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:12.050
What's the output?

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.370
From all ones going in.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.990
Wow, sorry to ask you
such a trivial question.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.190
You came in for
some good math here,

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.830
and I'm just taking 1/2 and 1/2.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:28.880
So the output is all
y's equal, right?

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.250
So, to me, that's
telling, just to introduce

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:37.040
an appropriate word, low
frequencies; in fact,

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.580
bottom frequency,
zero frequency,

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.010
is passed straight through.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.170
That's a lowpass filter.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:49.660
That's telling me I
have a lowpass filter.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.230
So that's an expression.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.490
That's so simple that you
might as well know those words.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:01.460
Lowpass means that the
lowest frequencies pass

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.810
through virtually unchanged.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.160
In this case, the very zero
frequency, the DC term,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.890
the constant term, passes
through completely unchanged.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.620
Now, what about another
input all-- Well,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.300
now I want high frequencies.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.380
Top frequencies.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:27.200
What's the most-- The
highest oscillation I can get

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:35.690
would be x equal, say, it starts
one, minus one, one, minus one,

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.380
so on.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.870
Both directions.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.210
Oscillating as fast as possible.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.990
I couldn't get a faster
frequency of oscillation

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.210
in a discrete signal
than up, down, up, down.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:53.810
What's the output for that?

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:58.430
So that's really oscillation.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.110
That's the fastest oscillation.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.430
What would be the
output from my averaging

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.590
filter for this input?

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.420
Zero.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.810
At every step, I'm averaging
this with the guy before

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.850
and they add to zero.

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.710
I'm averaging this with the
guy before, this with the guy--

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.310
Output is, y equals all zeroes.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:26.810
OK, so that confirms in my mind
that I have a lowpass filter.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.910
The high frequencies
are getting wiped out.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.110
OK, so that's two examples.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.820
Now, what about
frequencies in between?

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.280
Because ultimately
we want to see

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.220
what's happening to
frequencies in between.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.950
OK, so what's an
in-between frequency?

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:55.190
So in between, x_k could
be e^(ikn), let's say.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.860
e^(ik*omega).

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.010
e^(ik*omega).

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:09.160
Where this omega is somewhere
between minus pi and pi.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.270
OK, why do I say
minus pi and pi?

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.170
If the frequency-- So
that's the frequency.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.860
If omega is zero,
what's my signal?

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.040
All ones, right?

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.500
If omega is zero,
everything is my all ones.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.740
This is this case.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:32.240
So I now have a letter
for it, omega=0.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.640
What's this top frequency?

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.630
One, minus one, one,
minus one, what omega

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.010
will give me alternating signs?

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.200
Omega equal?

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.130
Pi, right?

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.690
Omega=pi.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:50.360
Because if this is pi, I have
e^(i*pi), which is minus one.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:19:01.560
So when omega=pi, my inputs are
e^(i*omega), to the k-th power.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.930
But this is minus one.
e^(i*pi), to the k-th power,

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.010
and that's minus one.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:12.270
So that's the top frequency.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.490
And also the bottom
frequency is pi.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:20.260
And the zero frequency
is the all ones.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:24.920
And this is what happens-- Ah.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.130
Now comes the point.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.470
What's the output if
this is the input?

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.870
What's the output when
this is the input?

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.380
We can easily figure that out.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.600
We can take that average.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:44.070
OK, so let me do that input.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:49.890
Input x_k is e^(ik*omega).

00:19:52.750 --> 00:20:01.290
And now what's the output?
y_k is the average of that.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.850
And the one before.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.250
Divided by two, right?

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:14.030
OK, now you're certainly
going to factor out,

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:18.070
anybody who sees this is going
to factor out e^(ik*omega),

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.810
right?

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.020
I mean that's
sitting there, that's

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.950
the whole point of
these exponentials

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.730
is they factor out
of all linear stuff.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:33.770
So if I factor that out, I get
a very, very important thing.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.380
I get, well, it's
over two, I get a one.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:43.670
And I get, what's this
term? e^(ik*omega) is here.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:48.300
So I only want e^(-i*omega).

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:54.870
OK, that is called the
frequency response.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.270
So that's telling
me the response

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.200
of-- what the filter
does to frequency omega.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.200
It multiplies the signal.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.590
If I have a signal that's
purely with frequency omega,

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.630
that signal is getting
multiplied by that response

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.390
factor.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:15.810
1+e^(i*omega).

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:21.240
When omega is zero,
what is this quantity?

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:27.510
So let me call this
cap H of omega.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.570
What is this factor,
if omega is zero?

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.930
Then H at omega=0 is?

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.040
One.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.560
That's telling me again
that at zero frequency

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.030
the output is the
same as the input.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.730
Multiplied by one.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:52.550
And at omega equal to pi, what
is this frequency response?

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.380
Zero, right.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.050
At omega=pi, this is
minus one so I get zero.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:02.340
And it's telling me again
that this is the response.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:08.370
And now it's also telling me
what the response factor is

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.770
for the frequencies in between.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:15.080
And everybody would draw a
graph of the darn thing, right?

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.880
So this was simple, let
me do its graph over here.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.090
So I'm going to graph H(omega).

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.560
Well, I've a little problem.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.920
H(omega)'s a complex number.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.200
I'll graph the
magnitude response.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.870
So here I'm going to do a
graph from minus pi to pi.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.930
This is the picture.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.790
This is the picture
people look at.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:46.350
This is the picture of
what the filter is doing.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.070
All the information about
the filter is in here.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.120
All the information is in there.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.690
So if I graph that, I know
what the filter's doing.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:01.090
So you said at omega=0,
I get a value of one.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.860
At omega=pi, I get
a value of zero.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.660
At omega equal minus pi,
I get a value of zero.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.900
And I think if you
figure out the magnitude,

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.480
it's just a cosine.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.980
It's just an arc of a cosine.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.400
OK, for that really,
really simple filter.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.740
So any engineer, any
signal processing person,

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.140
looks at this graph
of H(omega) and says

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.490
that is a very fuzzy filter.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:36.240
A good, an ideal filter,
an ideal lowpass filter,

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.140
would do something like this.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:45.750
An ideal filter would stay
at one up to some frequency,

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.000
say pi/2.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.460
And drop instantly to zero.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.200
There is a really good filter.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.950
I mean, people would pay
money for that filter.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.260
Because what happens
when you send a signal

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.300
through that ideal filter?

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.780
It completely wipes out
the top frequencies.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.910
Let's say, up after pi/2.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.700
And it completely saves
the in-between ones.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.820
So that's really a sharp filter.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.830
Actually, what people
would like to do

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.270
would be to have that
filter available.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:22.390
And then also to have a
perfect, ideal highpass filter.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.480
What would be an
ideal highpass filter?

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.350
Yeah, let's talk about
highpass filters just a moment.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:34.290
Because this is, you're seeing
the reality of what people do,

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:39.680
and how they-- and that little
easy bit of math they do.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.790
Do you want to suggest
a highpass filter,

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.780
let me come back to this?

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.980
And just change it a little?

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:53.970
So I plan to do not-- I'm now
going to do a different filter.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.080
That's going to be
a highpass filter.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.230
And what do I mean by that?

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:05.060
A highpass filter
will kill the x_k=1.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.220
I now want the output from--
This is now going to be,

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.060
I'm going to change.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.760
Can I just erase,
change a lot of things?

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.040
I'm now going to produce
a highpass filter.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.910
Sorry, pi.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.650
And what's the difference?

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:26.070
When all x's are one, the
output is going to be?

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.650
Zero.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.160
And when I have the
highest frequency,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.600
the output is going to be?

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.520
The input.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.170
And what am I-- And
then in between, I'll

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.000
do something in between.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.310
OK, what do you think
would be a highpass filter,

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:52.110
like the simplest highpass
filter we can think of?

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.370
Anybody think of it?

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:58.410
You're only getting, like, 15
seconds to think in this class.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.060
That's a small
drawback, 15 seconds.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:06.420
But, the highpass filter
that I think of first

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.250
is, take the difference.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:13.720
Take the difference.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.240
Put minus a halfs
on the sub-diagonal.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.800
This is the same, this
is also a convolution,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.770
but now what? h_0
is still a half.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.660
But now h_1 is?

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.220
Minus 1/2.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.000
We're still convolving.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.840
We're still
convolving, it's still

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.070
linear time-invariant, that
just means it's a convolution.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.660
It's still a finite
impulse response.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:46.170
But the response, the impulse
response is now 1/2 minus 1/2.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.430
So what happens if I,
in my picture over here,

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:55.560
if I send in any pure frequency,
I'm now doing minus 1/2 here.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.990
So I'll just keep the plus.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:02.000
But I'll also add in the minus.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.310
So now I'm looking at one
minus e^(-i*omega) over two.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.780
And again, let's plot a
few points for that guy.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.530
So what, at x, at
omega-- So this

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.640
is omega in this direction.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.000
And this is h in this direction.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.570
So at omega=0, what's
my highpass guy?

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:32.820
When I send in a zero frequency,
constant, I get what output?

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.800
Zeroes, because now-- I'll
call it a differencing filter.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:44.650
So I'll just, instead of
averaging I'm differencing.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.220
OK, so now for this
one, maybe I'll

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.770
put an x to indicate
I'm now doing,

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.460
I'll do x's for the high pass.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.650
So this now, the high pass
guy, kills the low frequency

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.530
and preserves the
high frequency.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:04.220
And you won't be
surprised to find

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.200
it's some cosine or
something that, well yeah,

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:15.200
it's got-- Sorry, that's
not much of a cosine.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:26.950
It's the mirror image
of the lowpass guy.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.120
And maybe the sum
of squares adds

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.990
to one or two or something.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.410
One, probably.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.810
The sum of squares
probably adds to one.

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:39.630
And they're kind of
complementary filters.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.540
But they're very poor.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:47.170
Very crude, I mean that's so
far from the ideal filter.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:52.490
So how would we create a
closer to ideal filter?

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:57.030
Well, we need more h's.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.930
With two h's, we're
doing the best we can,

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.120
with just h_0 and h_1.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.790
With a longer filter,
for which we're

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.170
going to have to pay
a little more to use,

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.860
but we'll get a lot more.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.810
We'll get something,
we could get

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:14.854
a filter that stays pretty close
to this, drops pretty fast.

00:29:14.854 --> 00:29:15.770
There's a whole world.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:22.400
Bell Labs had a little
team of filter experts.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.540
Creating, and now
MATLAB will create it

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.770
for you, the coefficients
h, that would give you

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.740
a response, a frequency
response, that'll

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.550
stay up toward, up close
to one as long as possible.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:41.150
And drop as fast as possible,
and bounce around there.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:45.110
So next week, if I come
back to that topic,

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:50.450
I can say a little more about
these really good filters.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.680
What was I trying to do today?

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:59.590
Trying to see how
convolution is used.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.100
And this is a use
you will really make.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.660
So now I just have, I
think, about two more things

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.740
to say about this example.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.850
Let's see, what are they?

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.110
Well, first, so
all the information

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.090
is in this H(omega).

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.360
Oh, yeah.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:24.860
This simple example gives us a
way to visualize convolution.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.380
And I think we need that.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.210
Right?

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.780
Because up to now, convolution
has been a formula.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.820
Right?

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.410
It's been this formula.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.220
That's the formula
for convolution,

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.080
and how do I visualize that?

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.250
Just think of, may I
try to visualize that?

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:50.250
Here I have, this
is the time line.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:57.530
The different k's. k equals
zero, one, two, minus one.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:03.820
And I have x_(-1),
x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.260
So that would be a little
bouncy up and down.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.710
And the averaging filter, let
me go back to the averaging one.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:17.940
The averaging filter would
smooth out the bumps.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:23.300
Because it would take the, it
would, like, average neighbors.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.700
And that's a smoothing process.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:32.000
As we see here, it's a process
that kills high frequencies.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.010
Now, what is this visualization
I want you to think of?

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:41.460
I want you to just think
of, like, a moving window.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.240
So here is the input.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.390
Now, I move a window along.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:51.970
And that window, so let's
say here's the window,

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:54.010
I should have another.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.300
So that's the window.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:00.380
When the window is there, it
takes the average of those two.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.960
That gives me the new output.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.490
Now, think of the window
as moving along here,

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.270
taking the average of these.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.980
Move the window along,
take the average of these.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.440
Move the window along.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:18.930
Do you see the sort of, this
is what a convolution is doing.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:28.740
This is a picture of my
formula, sum of h_k*x_(l-k).

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.780
So the window is the h's,
is the width of the h's,

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.590
and as that window moves along.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:39.490
I mean, you could
write, you could create,

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:44.460
design a little circuit
that would do exactly this.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.530
That would do the convolution.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:50.820
You just have to put
together some multipliers,

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.580
because you have these
h's, these, like, halves.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:59.220
And you have to put in an
adder, that'll add the pieces.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:07.670
And those are the essential
little electronic pieces

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:12.430
of an actual filter.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:13.760
Then you just move it along.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.220
So it needs a delay.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.710
That's about the
content of a filter.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:26.410
Is multipliers that will
multiply by the h's, so in come

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:32.730
the x, multiply by the
h's, do the addition,

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:37.680
and do a shift to get
onto the next one.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.630
You see how a filter works?

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.920
I think that image
of convolution

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.610
is a little bit vague, maybe?

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.840
This window moving along?

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.110
But it's quite meaningful.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:56.830
And then the final thing I'll
say about filters is this.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:03.320
That, what's the connection
between H(omega) and h(k)?

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.990
Or h sub k, let me
call it h sub k.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:11.780
What's the connection
between the numbers

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:18.770
in impulse response, just, which
were the h's, and the function,

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:24.140
which is the frequency response,
which tells me what happens

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.990
to a particular frequency?

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:27.940
Each frequency, e
to the-- You notice

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:31.750
how the frequency
that went in is

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:34.050
the frequency that comes out.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:37.610
It's just amplified
or diminished

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:41.080
by this H(omega) factor.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:47.300
So you see the h's are the
coefficients here of H(omega).

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.070
In other words,
H(omega) is the sum

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:56.460
of the h_k's, e to the--
e to the minus ik--

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.990
Here's the beautiful formula.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:05.810
That's obvious, right?

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:08.460
Here you're seeing the
formula in the simplest case,

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.170
with just an h_0 and an h_1.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:15.350
But of course, it would have
worked if I had several h's.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:19.190
So this H(omega), this
factor that comes out,

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.320
is just this guy.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:30.490
Now, if I look at
that, what am I saying?

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:36.450
I've seen things that
connect a function of omega

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:41.020
with a number of
filter coefficients.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:45.420
I saw that in Section
4.1, in Fourier series.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:50.140
This is the Fourier
series for that function.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.350
Right?

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.720
You might say, OK,
why that minus?

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.590
I say, it's there because the
electrical engineers put it

00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:59.210
there.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:00.870
They liked it.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:04.140
And the rest of the world
has to live with it.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.560
So, you notice I
don't concede on i.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.120
I refuse to write j.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.020
But they all would.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:17.820
I speak about they, but
probably some you would write j.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:22.740
So I'm hoping it's OK if I
write i. i is for imaginary.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.770
I don't see how you could say
the word imaginary starting

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:29.730
with a j.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.090
And what was the
matter with i, anyway?

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:33.600
Current.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.970
Well, current used to be i.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.560
I mean who, is it still?

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.080
Well, let's just accept it.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.512
OK, they can call the current
i, and the square root

00:36:44.512 --> 00:36:48.510
of minus one j,
but not in 18.085.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:52.390
So OK, here we are.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:57.010
So my point is just that
we have a Fourier series.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:01.600
Here we a 2pi periodic function.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.800
Here we have its
Fourier coefficients.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.830
The only difference is that we
started with the coefficients.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.900
And created the function.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:19.350
But otherwise, we're back to
Section 4.1, Fourier series.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.370
But that fact that we
started with the coefficients

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:26.680
and built the
function, sometimes you

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.910
could say, OK that
sounds a little

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:30.950
different from the
regular Fourier series,

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.480
where you go the other way.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.170
So people give it the
name discrete-time

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.510
Fourier transform.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.090
You might see those
letters sometime.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.250
The discrete-time
Fourier transform

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:47.200
goes from the coefficients
to the function.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.430
Where the standard Fourier
series starts with a function,

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:51.840
goes to the coefficients.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.780
But really, it doesn't matter.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.790
The point is, yeah.

00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:01.110
So you could say, maybe we
have now a fourth transform.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.830
Like the first transform
was Fourier series.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.780
The second one was the discrete.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.530
The third one is
the Fourier integral

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.590
that's coming in one minute.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.200
And the fourth is this one.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:19.350
But hey, it's just
the coefficients

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:24.550
and the function have
switched places, in the,

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:30.824
which one is the start and
which one is at the end.

00:38:30.824 --> 00:38:32.490
OK, let me pause a
minute because that's

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:36.450
everything I wanted to
say about simple filters.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:41.840
And you can see that this
is a very simple filter,

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.910
and could be improved.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.190
Better numbers
would give, I mean

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:48.530
what would be better numbers?

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:54.680
I suppose that 1/4, 1/2, 1/4
would probably be better.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.160
If I took those
numbers, I'm pretty

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:06.950
sure that this thing would be
closer to ideal by quite a bit.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:11.310
If I plotted-- So what do I
mean by, those are the h's.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:18.370
So I would take 1/4 plus
1/2 e^(-i*omega) plus 1/4

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.000
e^(-2i*omega).

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.680
This would be my
better H(omega).

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.990
This would be my frequency
response to a better averaging

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:32.090
filter, sort of this is like
averaged averaged, right?

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:35.630
If I do a half an average and
then I do the average again.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:40.780
In other words, if I just
send these signals y_k

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.060
through that same averaging
filter, so average

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.580
again to get a z_k, I think
probably the coefficients

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.260
would be 1/4, 1/2,
1/4, and it would

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.860
be, I've taken out more noise.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.880
Right?

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.600
Each time I did that averaging,
I damp the high frequencies,

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.380
so if I do it twice
I get more damping.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:07.610
But I lose signal, of course.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.640
I mean, presumably there's
some information in the signal

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.990
in these frequencies.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:15.470
And I'm reducing it.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.540
And if I average twice
I'm reducing it further.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:23.580
So a better one would be
to get a sharp cutoff.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:27.430
OK, that's filters.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:33.840
I guess what I hope is that we
have the idea of a convolution,

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.580
and now we see what
we can use it for.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.920
Right?

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.150
And there are many others.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.340
So we'll have another.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:44.860
We'll come back to convolutions
and de-convolution.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.380
Because if you
have a CT scanner,

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.180
that doing a little convolution.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.530
I mean, you're the input,
right, to the CT scanner?

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:57.230
You march in,
hoping for the best.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:02.630
OK, CT scanner convolves you
with their little filter.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:07.490
And then it does
a deconvolution,

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:15.570
to an approximate deconvolution,
to have a better image of you.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:19.450
OK, let's leave that.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:21.880
Can I change direction
and just write down

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:27.120
the formulas for the
Fourier integral transform?

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.430
And do one example?

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.980
OK.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.000
I don't know what you
think about a lecture that

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.870
stops and starts a new topic.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:46.450
Is it, maybe it's
tough on the listener?

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.980
Or maybe it's a break.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.630
I don't know.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.320
Let's look at it positively.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.450
Alright, break.

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:58.010
Alright.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:02.990
So let me remember the
Fourier series formulas.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.040
So I'm just going
to break, and now we

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.030
go to the integral transform.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:13.190
OK, so let me remember the
formula for the coefficients,

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:22.990
which was 1/(2pi), the integral
of f(x)e^(-ikx)dx, right?

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:26.840
And then when we added it
up to get f(x) back again,

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:34.900
we added up a sum of the
c_k's e^(ikx)'s, right?

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.260
That's 4.1.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.030
We know those formulas.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.710
And we notice again.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.020
Complex conjugate.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.460
One direction is the
conjugate compared

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.810
to the other direction.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:51.430
Now, all I plan to do is
write down the formula.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:55.250
And remember, I'm going
to use f hat of k,

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.370
instead of the coefficients.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:01.160
Because it's a function of k,
all k's and not just integers

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.020
are allowed.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.090
And then I'm going
to recover f(x).

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.090
OK, now this integral
went from minus pi

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:10.190
to pi, because
that was periodic.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.450
But now all the integrals are
going to go from minus infinity

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.020
to infinity.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.550
We've got every k, every x.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:21.230
So we take, what do
you expect here? f(x)?

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.720
e^(-ikx)?

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.380
dx?

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.600
Yes.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.560
Fine.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:32.690
Same thing, f(x) is there, but
now any k is allowed so I have

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.350
a function of all k's.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.910
And now I want to recover f(x).

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.470
So what do I do?

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:39.450
You can guess.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.590
I've got an integral now.

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.160
Not a sum.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.800
Because a sum was when I
had only integer numbers.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.680
Now, I've got f hat
of k, and would you

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:58.020
like to tell me what the
magic factor is, there

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.490
in the integral formula?

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:02.860
It's just what you hope.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:07.110
It's the e^(ik*omega).

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.670
d what?

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:14.610
Now this is where it's
easy to make a mistake. d,

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.130
I'm integrating here.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.750
I'm putting the whole,
reconstructing the function.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:23.360
I'm putting back the
harmonics with the amount,

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:28.330
f hat of k tells me how
much e^(ik*omega) there is

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:29.560
in the function.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:34.630
I put them all together,
so I integrate dk.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.440
I'm integrating over
the frequencies.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.390
This was the sum over k.

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.200
From minus infinity to infinity.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.020
Now this is an integral, because
we've got, it's all filled in.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:49.060
And it remains to
deal with this 2pi.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:54.130
And I see in the book
that the 2pi went there.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.180
I don't know why.

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.720
Anyway, there it is.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.250
So let's follow that convention.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.920
Put the 2pi here.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.110
So there's the formula.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.460
The pair of formulas,
the twin formulas.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.800
The transform, from f to
f hat, and the inverse

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.560
transform, from f hat back to f.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:22.730
And it's just like the one
you've seen for Fourier series.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:26.800
Well, I think the only
good way to remember

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.620
those is to put in a function
and find its transform.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:37.760
So my final thing for
today would be take

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.620
a particular function, f(x).

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:44.210
Here, let me take
ever f(x) to be,

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:52.560
here's one. f to be zero
here, and then a jump to one.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.890
And then an exponential decay.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.000
So e^(-ax).

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.130
OK, so that's the input.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:06.580
It's not odd, it's not even.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:12.290
So I expect sort of a complex f
hat of k, which I can compute.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.800
So f hat of k is what?

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.060
Now, let's just figure
out f hat of k and look

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.100
at the decay rate and
all the other good stuff.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.040
So what do I do?

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:27.060
I'm just doing this integral.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.380
For practice.

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.130
OK, so f is zero
in the first half.

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:34.630
So I really only integrate
zero to infinity.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:41.350
And in that region it's e^(-ax),
and I multiply by e^(-ikx),

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:46.360
and I integrate dx,
and what do I get?

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.890
I'll get, this is an
integral we can do,

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:58.370
and it's easy because
this is e^(-(a+ik)x).

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:02.730
You're always going to
see it that way, right?

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.120
That we're integrating.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.260
And then the integral
of an exponential

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:14.100
is the exponential divided by
the factor that will come down

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.350
when we take the derivative.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:19.770
So I think we just
have this, right?

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:20.770
Don't you think?

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.370
To integrate that
exponential, we just

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:26.550
get the exponential divided
by its little factor.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:29.320
And now we have to
stick in the limits.

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.950
And what do I get at the limits?

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:36.550
This is like, a fun part of
Fourier integral formulas.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.660
What do I get at the upper
limit, x equal infinity?

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:47.190
If x is very large,
what does this thing do?

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.740
Goes to zero.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.590
It's gone.

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:57.640
The e^(ikx) is oscillating
around, it's of size one.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.850
But the e^(-ax), so I needed
a to be positive here.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:07.130
That picture had to be
the right one. a positive.

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:10.390
Then at infinity, I get zero.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.800
So now I just plug
in this lower limit,

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.750
that comes with a minus sign.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:15.990
So what do I get?

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:19.560
The minus sign will
make this a+ik,

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.720
and what does it
thing equal at x=0?

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:27.350
One. e^0 is one.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:31.760
So there is the
Fourier transform.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.410
Of my one-sided exponential.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.600
Now, just a quick look at that
and then I'll do some more,

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:45.720
this example's Example
one in Section 4.5,

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.160
and we'll do more examples.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:53.170
But let's just look at that one.

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:58.650
I see a jump in the function.

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:05.770
What do I expect in the
decay rate of the transform?

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:12.740
So a jump in the function, I
expect a decay rate of 1/k.

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.120
Decay rate, right?

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.480
Just as for Fourier
coefficients, so

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.260
for the integral transform.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:23.290
So a decay rate in f hat.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:25.180
And it's here.

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:28.080
1/k in the denominator.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.590
Yeah.

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:34.400
So that's a a good example.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.630
You might say, wait a minute,
OK that's fine but what

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:40.510
about the second one?

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:47.000
Could I put in 1/(a+ik)
and get back the pulse?

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.470
The exponential pulse?

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:51.760
The answer is yes,
but maybe I don't

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.620
know how to do that integral.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.550
So I'm sort of fortunate
that these formulas

00:49:56.550 --> 00:50:00.860
are proved for any function
including this function.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:08.350
So this example
shows the decay rate.

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:12.020
The possibility sometimes
of doing one integral

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:15.230
but maybe the other integral
going the other direction

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:16.360
is not so easy.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.760
And that's normal.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.610
So that's, like, Fourier
transforms and inverse

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:26.460
transforms, we don't expect to
be able to do them all by hand.

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:32.160
I mean, I'll just say
that actually, anybody

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:37.040
who studies complex
variables and residues,

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.660
I don't know if you
know any of this,

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.580
heard these words about--
There are ways to integrate.

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:47.350
I could put 1/(a+ik) in here.

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:50.100
And, actually, and
do this integral

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.800
for minus infinity to infinity.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.290
By stuff that's in Chapter 5.

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:59.450
Can I just point ahead without
any plan to discuss it.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:05.370
That some integrals can
be done by x+iy tricks,

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:08.680
by using complex numbers.

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.450
But I won't do more.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:11.540
OK, thanks.

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:15.460
So that's the formulas.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.650
And that's one example.

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:21.030
Wednesday there will be more
examples and then no review

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.330
session Wednesday evening.
