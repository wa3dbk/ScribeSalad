00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:28.020
PROFESSOR STRANG: So today we
move to a topic I really like.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.260
It's the beginning
of the applications.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.210
So the particular
application that comes first

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.990
will be springs and masses,
a pretty classical problem.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.250
But what we're looking
for is how do we model it,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.520
what's the main
framework to look

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.850
at a whole series of problems.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.980
So this is number
one in the series

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.240
and it's the most
straightforward.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.940
Let me draw it with four
springs connecting three masses.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.080
And let me fix both ends.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.810
So this will be a
fixed-fixed picture.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.890
So the masses have some weight.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.980
The weight pulls
the springs down.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.270
When there was no weight
acting they were not stretched.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.530
The masses will
stretch the springs.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.950
And the question is
how much do those,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.060
we're looking for
the displacements.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.090
How much does mass one go down?

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.590
Mass two?

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.270
Mass three?

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.740
And of course, essentially
the displacement

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.080
here is zero and here is zero.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.820
I don't know if you can
imagine these masses have acted

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.960
so that the position before
gravity was turned on

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.240
was somewhere up here
and then it came here.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.170
So this moved down
by a distance u_1.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.530
Let's use u for
the displacements.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.100
So if I look at
this main picture

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.260
here I have displacements,
movements, u_1, u_2, u_3.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.120
Now what happens physically?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.710
Important in every
one of these examples

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.235
to see what's
happening physically.

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:41.400
Of course, this one
moved down by some u_2,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.340
this one moved down from its
total rest position to u_3.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.490
These are not oscillating.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.690
Next week they'll start
moving, time will enter.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.710
Here I'm just looking
for a steady state.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.950
They come to rest, they stretch.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.740
So what's your feeling of what's
going to happen here, somehow?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:14.580
The displacements look to me
like they'll all be positive.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.100
What's the key
equation going to be?

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.650
That when this moves down
it will stretch that spring.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.090
Hooke's Law will say there's a
force, the spring pulls back.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.330
The spring pulls
back with a force

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.440
proportional to the stretch.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.540
So u_1, u_2, and
u_3 are movements.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.860
Here is a key question.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.840
What's the stretching
in spring number two?

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.790
So this is spring one,
two, three and four.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.900
How much does spring number
two stretch? u_2-u_1.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.020
A difference is coming in there.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.230
So let me put that up here.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.620
So stretching or elongation,
I'll use two words,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.840
elongation I'll say
sometimes because that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.950
starts with a letter e.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.990
So these are the
elongations in the springs,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:22.120
in the four springs.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.230
It's the amount the
spring stretches.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.830
Or what's the opposite
of stretching?

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.750
Compression somehow.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.230
Looks to me like this
last spring, at least,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.170
is going to be compressed, and
I'm not sure about the others.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.250
So we've got four springs.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:52.500
And each one has a stretching
or compression, an elongation.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.730
And then there's a link then
that you already told me.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.120
That e_2 is, just
from the picture,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.000
e_2 is the difference
between u_2 and u_1.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.250
Because the lower mass
goes down by distance u_2,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.040
the upper mass by u_1 and spring
is stretched by the difference

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.560
u_2-u_1.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.570
So that's a first key fact.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.310
So that expresses somehow
a fact of geometry.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.840
Of sort of the way
things are connected.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.230
The material properties
of the springs

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.340
have not got into
the picture yet.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.500
But now Hooke's Law brings
them into the picture.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.250
By stretching a
spring that produces

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.980
a force that pulls back.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:54.880
So we get, can I say,
forces in the spring.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:04.030
And let me give those a
name w. w_1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:11.590
And then the link between
the stretching and the force

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.040
that it produces is--
So that's somehow

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.950
where the properties of
the material come in.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.370
So I have to say, what are
the properties of the springs?

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.430
So this will be
Hooke's Law, this step.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:38.190
Hooke's Law for this
particular application.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:46.870
And so I have to say these
springs have spring constants.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.020
So I haven't completed the
description of the problem

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.490
until I've told
you about springs

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.900
themselves and the masses.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.200
So the spring constants will
be c_1, c_2, c_3, and c_4.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.320
And now what does
Hooke's Law say?

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.410
Usually this physical law in
the middle we keep it linear.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:19.580
Of course, we all understand
that if these springs were

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.080
enormously stretched
the elastic property

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.510
could become non-linear.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.150
It could become plastic.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.820
The first law always
has somebody's name.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.280
Was the person to see
that in some range

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.530
of small displacements, so
I guess that's the answer.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.230
We're speaking here about
small displacements,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.910
small stretching up
to the point where

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.770
Hooke's Law continues to hold.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.560
And now what does
Hooke's Law say?

00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:00.100
It says that each
force in the spring

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:07.370
is proportional to the
stretching of the spring.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.570
You could say it's-- a diagonal
matrix is showing up here.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:19.380
The vector of w's, the vector
of forces in the spring is

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:24.560
a diagonal matrix C, which
just has these numbers

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:32.080
on the diagonal,
...c_4, times the e's.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.430
So of course I'm going to write
that in matrix notation as W

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:45.100
equals a matrix C times e.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.670
So there in the
middle is the physics.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.140
The material properties,
the constitutive law.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:59.950
C can stand for constants,
for constitutive law,

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.130
later for conductances.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.680
It's the place where
the material enters.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:14.860
And now how do we
complete this picture?

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:21.730
In the end we have to
bring in the masses.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:27.910
Gravity is the external force
that's making things happen.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:33.030
We need a force
term from outside

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.110
to move us away from zeroes.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:43.860
And that will be the
downward forces f_1, f_2,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.210
f_3 on the three masses.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.790
So I plan to complete this
picture with a force balance

00:09:53.790 --> 00:10:12.070
equation on the
masses, on each mass.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.360
When I use the word
framework there,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.320
this is what I
was talking about.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.840
I guess what I want
to say is I really

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:29.820
have found that this way
of describing, modeling

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.930
the problem is successful
for so many applications.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:43.310
You have somehow a geometry, a
step which'll involve a matrix

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:50.790
A. Then you have a physical
step which involves a matrix C.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.940
And then finally you
have a force balance.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:11:02.910
In a way this force
balance or its analog,

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.650
the analog would be
Kirchhoff's current law.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.990
We'll see that for networks.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.140
Flow in equals flow out.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.120
Force on one side equals
force on the other.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.800
If we're talking
about equilibrium

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.130
we can expect our model to
have an equation like that.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:25.560
And for me it really helps to
know when a new model comes in.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.310
Like somebody'll
come into my office

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:33.310
with a problem in
chemistry or biology.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:39.920
But if it fits in
this framework I'll

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:46.380
be looking for a balance
equation, a continuity

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:52.130
equation at the end.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.170
This part was easy and
it's these two parts

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.520
that I want to pin down.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.430
Well you told me
how to start here.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:07.340
So the elongation, so I want
to take this step again.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:14.310
I want to find the elongations
from some matrix that

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:20.240
multiplies the displacements.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.000
So I'm just
completing this step.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.010
And you told me what is the
stretching in spring two.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.250
Again, do you mind
just saying it again?

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.630
The stretching in that
second spring, the amount,

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:45.120
it's made longer by the action
of gravity was? u_2-u_1.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.850
u_2-u_1.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:55.210
So e_2 will be, a minus one here
for u_1, a plus one and a zero.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:04.090
That will be a typical row of
this matrix, the displacement

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.270
stretching matrix,
you could say.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.860
Now what about the
stretching in e_1?

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.190
What's the stretching in e_1?

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.200
Only u_1.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.870
Because essentially
it's u_1-u_0 but u_0

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.220
is set to zero by the support.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.970
So we only have u_1.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.130
Because that multiplication
just gives us-- So e_1 is u_1.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.210
e_2 is u_2-u_1.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.790
e_3 is what?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:43.790
The stretching in
the third spring.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.790
What is it? u_3-u_2.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.890
So I need a one for u_3
and a minus one for u_2.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.690
And the stretching
in the fourth spring?

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.660
What's the stretching
in the fourth spring?

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:07.980
I've sort of, and you have
too, mentally given a plus sign

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.690
when the spring is
extended and a minus

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.810
sign when it's compressed.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.280
Plus for tension,
minus for compression.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.900
So since I fixed that
one, u_4 was zero, so what

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.600
do I have in this last row?

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.900
Just minus u_3.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:36.640
I guess what I'm saying
here is that if we

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.290
get a systematic
approach to problems

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:46.130
then we know we're looking for
a matrix that connects these.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.140
We're looking for the material
constitutive law that does this

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.710
and now we're
looking for this one.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.570
We kind of know where we are.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.450
What to look for.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.190
And so this matrix is the
matrix I'm going to call A.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.010
So this is e=Au.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.980
Well one more step to go.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.400
And that will be the
force balance step.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.010
So now, what's the
equation for balance?

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.790
The external forces
are the masses.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.900
Well, I guess to
get the units right,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:34.160
it should be mass times g,
the gravitational constant.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:43.220
So let me put external
forces f_1, f_2, and f_3.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:51.390
The three masses will be
m_1*g, m_2*g, and m_3*g.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.350
So those are the
forces from outside.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.800
Now it's the balance
equation I'm after.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.570
So this is in this position.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.910
It's in equilibrium.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.970
And what does that tell us?

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.020
That tells us that the
total force on this mass,

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.300
so I'm going to
take each mass, it's

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.440
like a free body
force diagram here.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.770
I'm looking now at that mass.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.870
I'm saying what forces
are acting on it

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.380
and I'm making them balance.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.800
So what equation
will that give me?

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.010
So let me write that.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.290
This is now the force
balance equation.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:37.830
Force balance at each mass.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.280
How much force is pulling up?

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.320
What's the force pulling up on?

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.580
So this spring is
pulling upwards.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.750
And it's pulling
upwards by w_1, right?

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.160
Just getting these
letters right.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.090
The w's were the
internal resisting force,

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.930
reacting force in the
spring. w_1 is pulling up.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:09.570
What other forces are
acting? w_2 is pulling down.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:14.550
And also pulling down is?

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.760
Gravity, m_1*g.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:22.480
So the balance of forces there
says that w_1, the force up,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.980
is w_2, the force
down, and m_1*g.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.990
And similarly the
next one will have,

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.740
the next mass if I look just
at that I see a force up,

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.080
a force down and gravity down.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:45.990
So w_2 will be, well, that's
the pull up, will be w_3+m_2*g.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.410
And the third one, the
force up on the third one

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.600
will be the force
down on the third one.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.920
so I think those are
the equations of force

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.980
balance written one at a time.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:08.080
And now, of course I'm
going to write that--

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:14.990
So that's three
equations with four w's.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:20.010
So I want to write that
as, I want to bring the w's

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.640
all to the left-hand side.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.310
Can I do that?

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:29.910
Can I just bring those
over with minus signs?

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:34.710
And make these equal signs.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:41.620
So now we've got internal
force balancing external force.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.670
This vector of external
forces is the f's and this

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.620
is the internal forces.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.350
Now somewhere there we're
going to see a matrix.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.670
So I'm going to write this
equation as some matrix.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.750
Well, let's figure out
what that matrix is.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.180
So its shape is what?

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.470
I've got three equations, so I
need three rows in the matrix.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:09.060
I've got four w's so
I need four columns.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:14.790
So it's going to multiply
w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:21.940
to give these three masses,
can I call them f_1, f_2, f_3,

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.890
just to have a good letter.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.350
We're almost there.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.900
What's the matrix?

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:37.290
What's the matrix for this
final step, the force balance

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.540
equation?

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.700
I just read it off.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.810
w_1-w_2.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:47.280
I think I've got that.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.940
w_2-w_3.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.030
Tell me what the second
row of the matrix

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:56.390
looks like to give me w_2-w_3.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:01.250
zero, one for the
w_2, minus one.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.280
Good.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:13.260
And for the third, the
final row? [0, 0, 1, -1].

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.240
So that completes
the third piece.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.900
If I'd given you the problem
as I did, drawn the problem,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.270
described it, you
know that there's

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.450
going to be a connection
between the external forces

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.270
and the displacements.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.700
But what I'm trying
to say is a good way

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:39.650
to see the connection is to
see it in three simple steps.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.770
The simple step that gets
you from the displacements

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.730
to the springs.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.140
A second step
within the springs.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.310
A third step back
to the nodes, you

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.990
could say, back to the masses.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:59.430
And of course, the key question
is, what's that matrix?

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.940
And do you recognize it?

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.770
Do we need a new
name for that matrix?

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.230
The matrix in the third step?

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:13.470
So this third step is going
to be that some matrix times

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:19.070
w is f and what's that matrix?

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.290
What's the good name
for us to give it?

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.170
A transpose is the
best possible name.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.010
If we've given this
matrix the name

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:33.500
A, the stretching
displacement matrix,

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:38.650
the strain in elasticity,
this becomes the strains,

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.930
these become the stresses.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.720
But the beauty is,
just beautiful,

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.070
that the matrix in this law
is the transpose of this one.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.830
So it's A transpose.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:59.510
So that's the framework seen
now here for the first time.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.640
So the key point was that
A and A transpose both

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.060
appeared but with physical
material properties,

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.190
constitutive matrix in between.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:15.720
So if we put the pieces
together, then we're golden.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.380
And then, let's do an example
to see what actually happened.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:31.240
So the equations were
e=Aw-- e=Au, then w=Ce,

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.010
that's Hooke's Law,
and then A transpose--

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:40.020
or maybe I'll write
it as f=A transpose*w.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.530
That's the three steps.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:50.770
So in this problem the source
term showed up at that point.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:55.700
The source term came
from external forces.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.780
I've got three equations.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.570
Now I'm going to put
them together into one.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.560
I'll put them into one equation.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.510
So this w I'll just substitute.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:11.740
So it's A transpose
w is Ce, and e is Au.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.170
So I have A transpose C Au.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:20.790
So that's the ultimate.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.810
That's put the whole
structure together.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:27.850
That's the equation
you have to solve.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:35.780
This would be called
the stiffness matrix.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:42.930
And I use the letter
K for that one.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.800
So our equation is Ku=f.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:56.590
This is our final equation.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:03.140
Well, we didn't know w.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.520
There are two unknowns here.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.460
Two physical things
that you want to find.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.460
If you're designing a
bridge or a structure

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.640
you want to know
the displacements

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:21.720
and then you want to know
the internal forces w.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.690
It's really beautiful.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:28.860
The two unknowns of u
and w are somehow dual,

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:36.350
we can work with one, work
with the other, work with both.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.390
Oh let me just mention that
the finite element method will

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:46.590
fit this framework and somehow
this name stiffness matrix has

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.970
become famous for finite
elements in structures

00:24:50.970 --> 00:25:01.630
and then it's just exploded
to appear all over the place.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.273
I guess we should
look at A transpose

00:25:03.273 --> 00:25:09.710
C A. We can see
what it looks like.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:14.010
And also just from the
way it looks there.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.440
So I can write it
out explicitly.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.040
I think we want to.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.990
But at the same time
I can learn something

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:25.190
from just seeing how
it's put together.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.190
What can you tell me
about A transpose C A?

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.380
Let's get the shape first.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.400
Just to see the shape
of these things.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.510
The matrix A is what?

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.400
What's the shape of A?

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.960
It's over here.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.180
Four by three.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.880
Four by three.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:52.400
And the shape of C was,
three by three is it?

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.870
Where have I got, that C matrix
better be here somewhere.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.090
Oh, no, it's four by four.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.110
Four springs.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.440
Of course, it had to be four by
four to do that multiplication.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.310
There's the C matrix.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.320
Four by four, thanks.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.280
And the A transpose matrix?

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.200
Three by four, thanks.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.470
So the net result
is three by three.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.970
Good.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:20.220
So it's a square matrix.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.260
K is a square matrix.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:27.550
What else can you
tell me about it?

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.480
Now we're going to begin to use
some of the, sort of the matrix

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.120
preparation.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.430
These matrices are
kind of friends by now.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:42.081
This is a difference
matrix, somehow.

00:26:42.081 --> 00:26:42.580
Right?

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.430
The stretchings are
differences and displacements.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.230
That's its transpose.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:53.130
And then the C matrix,
which is the new thing, sort

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:59.570
of the new guy to appear
today, is diagonal.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.340
Well if I asked you now,
without writing out the matrix,

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.030
for one more
property, it's square,

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.300
what else could you
tell me about it?

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.810
Symmetric is going to be a very
good guess and let's see why.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.150
Why is it symmetric?

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.470
How do we show that that?

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.020
What do I do?

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.300
I take the transpose.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:32.530
If I take my K transpose, now
I write it as, what do I do?

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.890
It's a product of things.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.210
So when I transpose a product I
have the individual transposes

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.430
in the opposite order.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.900
So A, its transpose comes first.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.760
C, its transpose comes next.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.730
A transpose, its
transpose comes last.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:57.270
So that's just the rules
of matrix transposes.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.430
Now what?

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:02.670
Now I'm ready to use the
wonderful fact of what

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.800
we've got here.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.630
So what is C transpose?

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:14.080
So notice we wanted a
symmetric matrix in the middle

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.450
to be able to knock that T out.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.200
And what is A
transpose transpose?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.900
That's A. We've learned
that the thing is symmetric,

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:30.540
that if I transpose it
I get it back again.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.160
We're going to see
more about that.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:38.370
But let me do the
multiplication.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.840
So I'm going to
take that, oh, boy.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.100
How am I going to do that?

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.660
I want to multiply three
matrices to see what K actually

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.440
looks like here.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.330
One question first.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:29:01.200
Eventually the solution, the
short formula for the solution,

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.880
will be u equal K inverse f.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.860
Right?

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:11.780
So the answer will be u equal
K inverse f in matrix notation

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.210
but I'm looking for numbers.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:22.160
And then if I know u then I know
the stretching. e is A times K

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.190
inverse f.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:29.680
And w is, I'm just going down
the list, is C times A times

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.580
K inverse f.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.500
We've got everything.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.770
So that's the key.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.220
This is the key equation.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.470
That's the answer.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:44.080
Let me ask you about inverses.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.320
What about K inverse?

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.050
We took three steps.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:54.030
Now what if I just ask
you about inverses?

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.840
This is K inverse that
we would like to know.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:04.650
So again, for inverses
I'm going to start this

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:09.690
and I'm going to stop halfway
and you'll tell me why.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.800
If you give me a
product of matrices

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.080
and I don't think
particularly much

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.080
I'll take the inverse of that
times the inverse of that

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:25.280
times the inverse of that.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:31.490
And what's the matter with that?

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.360
You would say, why not
just undo each step?

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:45.620
Why not find the w's from
the f's and then the e's from

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:52.830
the w's by dividing and
then the u's from the e's?

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:56.510
Why don't we just go
backwards around the loop

00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:00.570
rather than what I'm
saying we have to do.

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:05.210
We eventually get this
step across with a matrix K

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:13.840
that does all three at once.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.710
Well sometimes we
might be able to,

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.810
but I don't think
we can in this time.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.280
What's the trouble
with A, that I

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.310
don't want to write A inverse?

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.290
Well I don't say singular.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.900
What do I say here?

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:37.020
Look at this matrix A here.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.650
It's not square.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.780
It's not square, that's right.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:46.700
So I'm not comfortable, I'm
not willing to write A inverse

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.070
when A is not a square matrix.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:55.700
And this distinction, is
the matrix A square or not,

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.630
is the first issue.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.090
It's just the picture.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.810
Let me show you an example
of where it would be square.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:02.590
May I?

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:07.060
Before I do this multiplication,
can I jump to a-- I'll

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:15.410
change the line of springs
in a way that'll change A.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.940
And let me show
you what happens.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:23.030
Suppose I take out that spring.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:27.800
So I've removed
the fourth spring.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.120
It's a line of springs now,
hanging from a support.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.040
It's a perfectly good problem.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.150
It's problem two, but
it's a different problem.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.040
And what's different now?

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:44.080
There is no fourth spring.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.990
If this was my problem,
what would be different?

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.190
There's no fourth spring.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:53.010
So that's gone.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.980
I just have three springs
stretching from three masses.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.740
Then the force
balance is the same.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.690
Everything looks the same
except there's no force,

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.680
there's no fourth spring,
so there's no force there,

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.330
that's gone.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.940
And of course,
how does C change?

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:22.090
So in my new picture now
I have, let me write now,

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:27.730
A transpose C A. A is
now three by three,

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.550
right, I've lost a row.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.810
A transpose is now
three by three,

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.700
I've lost a column, that
fourth spring is gone.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.270
And what is C?

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:43.370
Well of course there's
no guy here anymore.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:50.170
What I'm trying to say is for
this problem the matrices have

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:54.280
become square.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.890
This would be correct.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:00.280
So this is an especially
nice kind of problem.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.160
It's called statically
determinate.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:08.830
It means I can determine the
three w's from the three f's.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:09.850
I can go backwards.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.680
Everything is determined.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.430
The long word for
the fixed-fixed one,

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:19.830
our main example, is
statically indeterminate.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:24.020
I cannot determine four
w's from three forces.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.640
I can't determine what
these internal forces are

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:33.330
until I put the whole
loop into one matrix K.

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:36.480
So that's like a warning,
and at the same time,

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.690
an important separation.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:45.030
A few nice problems where you
don't have too many springs,

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.790
you don't have too
many bars in a truss.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:51.390
You just have like, the minimum
number to hold it together.

00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:55.350
Could be statically determinate
and square matrices.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:59.840
But here we're not square.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.580
Now I go back.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.120
So that would be fixed-free.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.620
Right?

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.940
That example that I just
described would be fixed-free

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.300
and we can kind of carry that
along because we know that what

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:19.570
happens is we lose
a row and a column

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:24.070
and a-- c_4 is just not
in the picture anymore.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:32.000
But now I want to go back to the
fixed-fixed one and finish it.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.590
So that's got a support
down there, too.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:41.710
Key question, what's
this matrix K?

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:47.830
This A transpose C A. We
know it's a square matrix,

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.920
we know it's a
symmetric matrix, but it

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.050
would be really nice to
know what does it look like.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.310
What does that matrix look like?

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.410
Can I do the multiplication?

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:03.170
So this is going to be K. So
it starts with a three by four.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:08.560
1, -1; 1, -1; 1 -1.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.020
Then it's got the four by
four, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.390
And then it's got the
transpose of that, which

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:22.290
is the 1, -1; 1, -1; 1, -1.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:32.380
With zeroes where I
didn't write anything.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:38.690
We've got three matrices
to multiply together.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.400
What's going to happen here?

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.260
Well, let's see.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.100
I guess, why don't I
multiply that by that?

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.120
Can I do that?

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.690
So that's like getting
two steps together.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.140
It's going to be
easy because of this.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.050
This is usually an easy matrix.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:57.570
Often diagonal.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.500
So when I do that
multiplication, so let me,

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:05.690
I'll just copy this guy.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:13.100
And now c_1 multiplies that
row, c_2 multiplies this row,

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:24.060
c_3 multiplies this row and
c_4 multiplies the last row.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.850
c_1 in that row,
c_2, c_3, and c_4.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.820
And now I'm ready to put
those together into K.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.080
So K will be three by three.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.670
What does it have?

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.270
It has c_1+c_2.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:44.730
And then next to that
is going to be this row

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.940
one against column
two, there'll be a zero

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.800
or they'll be a -c_2 here.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.060
And then when row one
goes against column three

00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:02.010
there's nothing.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.790
Why nothing?

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:10.540
When do I expect to see a
zero in the overall matrix?

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.110
What is it about?

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:16.390
So that zero is in
the position 1, 3.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:22.300
What is it about masses
one and three that

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.320
is putting that zero in there.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:30.470
We kind of expect to see that
zero even before we find it.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:32.780
If I look at the
picture, what do you

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.850
notice about masses
one and three that

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.420
is going to produce the zero?

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.200
They're not connected.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.400
They're not connected.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.620
If I had another spring,
which I could have,

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.050
connecting mass one to mass
three that would produce,

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:50.700
I'd have another.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.430
I'd be up to five.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.740
Instead of four, there'd
be a fifth spring.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.430
It would have its own constant.

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.300
It would show up.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.860
Absolutely could.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.180
Here we don't have it.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.490
Now let me keep going.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.170
I know from symmetry
that the second row

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:13.510
times this is going to be
zero, is going to be -c_2.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.270
Symmetric as I expected.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:21.450
What are you expecting on
the diagonal there? c_2+c_3.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.310
That's certainly
the right pattern.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.770
Zero, c_2+c_3.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.230
c_2+c_3.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:34.310
And what are you
expecting over here?

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.880
-c_3 is a good guess.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.500
It's seeing that pattern.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.010
Let's just see it happen.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.100
That second row
times this third guy

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:51.470
will give me zero, two rows, two
zeroes, and then a -c_3, good.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:55.200
And now we know the zeroes
going to show up here,

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.840
the -c_3 is going
to show up here.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.590
And what will show
up here? c_3+c_4.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.610
So we've got it.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:18.500
That's the matrix K that
controls this whole problem.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.570
Now we check.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:22.440
It's square, yes.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.680
It's symmetric, yes.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:31.550
And notice also it's the kind
of matrix we've seen already.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.960
In fact, it's exactly the
matrix we've seen already

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.550
Suppose all the c's are one.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:42.820
Suppose every c_1,
c_2, c_3, c_4 is one.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:51.650
Then what's the matrix capital
C in that standard case?

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:56.490
C will just be the identity
if these are all ones.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:00.460
And then I'm only left
with A transpose A.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:08.040
So let me take that
special case below it.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:15.020
Special if so this is if C is
I, what matrix do we have then?

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.960
Just to see that we have a
matrix that we know about.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.060
So I'm copying this now here in
the case when all the c's are

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:24.560
one.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.860
So if you put all those c's to
be one, what matrix do you get?

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.030
You get, yes.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:38.260
You get the special K.
Right, you get the special.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.440
So the work we did to understand
that special matrix pays off

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.350
here.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.130
Because we know how
that matrix works.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:56.560
And this matrix, well, it's got
four spring constants in it.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:03.400
But we can guess the
important facts about this one

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.780
from this one.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:11.210
So what are the important
questions about that matrix?

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.840
This is my matrix K now.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.570
What would be, we know it's
square, we know it's symmetric.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.900
What else do we
ask about a matrix?

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:25.240
Well, positive definite, that's
the perfect question, right.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.960
And built into
positive definiteness

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.360
would be a property that we
mentioned the very first day.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.850
Is it invertible?

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.640
What's your guess?

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.160
Is that matrix invertible?

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:44.780
Everybody's going to guess yes
because, if you guessed no,

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:50.050
where would you be, the
whole course would end.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:55.480
In fact, the world would
end because the problem

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.430
is correctly posed.

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:00.630
Those displacements are
determined by the forces

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.510
and that just says K is
an invertible matrix.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.820
So but how do we see that
it's invertible and, even

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.530
more, positive
definite, because that's

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.000
the property we now know.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.500
So why is that matrix
positive definite?

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.220
Do we want to
check determinants?

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.410
We could say, okay,
that guy's positive.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:29.150
We could evaluate this product
and find that it came out well.

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:33.140
Would you want to do that one?

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:38.000
We could probably do the
two by two determinant.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.470
Could you take that times
that and subtract that?

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:46.130
Let's just write it
above what we would get.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:50.300
Just to see it.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:54.610
That number times that
number would be a c_1*c_2

00:43:54.610 --> 00:44:02.130
and a c_1*c_3 and
a c_2*c_2 twice.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.840
And a c_2*c_3.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.180
And then I would
subtract off this guy.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:13.910
So it would knock
out that, right?

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:19.000
And it would leave something
that would be positive.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.340
All the spring constants
are positive here.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:27.030
We're talking normal materials.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:30.170
I guess, actually,
people are producing now

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:34.880
really amazing materials
with amazing properties.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:41.480
And the amazing property is
a material with a negative c.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:47.360
But that's like-- 18.085
does not allow such a thing.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.320
Right?

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.130
All these c's are positive.

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:56.050
And you might guess that the
whole determinant is positive.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.930
But now I'd like
you to tell me why.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:07.560
So now we can use our
growing familiarity

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:17.870
with matrices to say why is
this matrix positive definite.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:21.900
Is symmetric, of course.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:27.710
Positive definite.

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:30.900
Why?

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:36.460
So that's what the previous
lecture helped us to answer.

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.730
We've got these
various tests, but what

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.910
was the core idea of
positive definiteness?

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:46.720
The core idea was
positive energy.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.190
The core idea was I looked at
the energy x trans-- no, u,

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.830
sorry.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:56.260
Have to call it u
now. u transpose times

00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:00.770
that matrix times u.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:08.780
And there was a reason why that
matrix was, why this number,

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.150
it's going to be
a number, right?

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.220
This combination will
involve all four of these

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:19.470
c's, it'll involve three u's.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:22.470
I don't want to write
out that quantity.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:27.420
It would be, I'll have some
u_1 squareds and some u_1*u_2.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:31.500
I won't have any
u_1*u_3, because that 1,

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.150
3 entry is zero.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:36.670
But why was this positive?

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.230
Where do I put the parentheses.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:44.030
Where do I put the parentheses
to see that that's positive?

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:50.050
I put them around where?

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:52.340
Around that, good.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:57.940
And around this?

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.420
This is really, since we
now have a letter for Au,

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:09.040
this is really e
transpose Ce, right?

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:09.990
That's e.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.910
This is e, Au, and
this is its transpose.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:17.940
And now what?

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:21.860
So now we've narrowed
it down to C.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:26.050
Oh, we can actually
see why it's an energy.

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:28.240
Remember C is that
diagonal matrix.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.950
What will this be?

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:37.570
This is the row of stretchings,
the diagonal matrix of c's,

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.250
and the column of stretchings.

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:45.460
And now if I do that
multiplication, what do I get?

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.640
Do you see it?

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.610
Because the physics
is coming in.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:53.560
What do I get?

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.830
This will multiply that.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:58.930
So what's the first term
I should write here? e_1?

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.220
What will it be?

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.390
I only have diagonal.

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.470
In other words, I only
have perfect squares

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:08.420
when I look at this thing.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:16.700
I think I just have c_1*e_1
squared coming from that

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.380
diagonal.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.720
That c_1 there,
this e_1 here, this

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.950
e_1 there is going
to give me that c_1--

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:25.730
What else will I have?

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:30.450
c_2*e_2 squared, c_3*e_3
squared and c_4*e_4 squared.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:40.520
And do you remember about
springs and Hooke's Law

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.360
and energy?

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.820
What's the energy in a spring?

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:48.420
This is a stretched spring.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:55.440
So the energy in a stretched
spring, what I wanted to say,

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.610
this is the sum of four internal
energies in the four springs

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:05.210
but it properly should
have a factor 1/2.

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:10.050
There probably, to really
use the word energy properly,

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:13.410
it should be half of all
this, half of all this,

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:16.265
half of that's the energy
in the first spring,

00:49:16.265 --> 00:49:19.550
the energy in the second,
the energy in the third

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:24.760
and the energy in the fourth.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:30.910
But of course our matrix
point was, it's positive.

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:33.730
It's a sum of squares
multiplied now

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:40.000
by these positive numbers, these
elastic constants, c_1, two,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.300
three and four.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:53.290
So we know the main
facts about that matrix.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:56.180
We're really at the
point here of we've

00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:00.590
got some problem
formulated, we've

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:04.120
got the essential
facts about the matrix,

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:12.020
it's symmetric, positive
definite, certainly invertible.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:20.900
Then there'd be the step
of actually computing u

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.760
by solving the
stiffness equation.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:30.560
Say, for example, Professor
Bathe's big finite element

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.730
code, ADINA.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:37.390
What's the big
picture for ADINA,

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:39.540
for any big finite element code?

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.880
NASTRAN, ANSYS, whatever.

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.680
Abaqus.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.490
There are so many
really good ones.

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:50.610
And they've taken years and
years of work to create.

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:54.810
But if you look to see what
are the elements that go in,

00:50:54.810 --> 00:51:03.240
you choose the model, and
we'll see in the next chapter,

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.600
in October we'll see what
finite elements is about,

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.960
you have the
material properties,

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:15.660
you assemble the matrix K.

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:20.270
That's a key step, is
assembling this matrix K.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.750
And then the final step
is solve the system.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:24.810
Ku=f.

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.820
But it's assembling that matrix.

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.680
Now one thing
popped into my head.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:34.560
Do I have time to
mention it or not?

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.440
And there's no class
Monday I think, right?

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.040
Can I mention?

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:45.300
Can you hang on one
more second to mention

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:51.750
a really remarkable way to
do matrix multiplication.

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:54.250
You may say, we know
matrix multiplication.

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:55.120
We got it.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:55.620
Right?

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:58.010
We did it and we got
the right answer.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.500
Can I just show you another way.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:03.850
And you can like,
see if it works.

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.490
I did this
multiplication by like,

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.740
I'll say rows times columns.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.570
I took rows times columns.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:13.300
That's the usual way.

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:17.240
But finite elements and
other, often the right way

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.560
is the opposite.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:23.430
It's columns times rows.

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:26.290
And of course, this
guy's in here too.

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:33.260
You might say, okay, what do
I get from column one times

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:36.050
that number, times row one?

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:44.430
Can you do that
multiplication just mentally?

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:46.860
Multiply that
column by that row.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:51.100
First of all, what shape
will the answer have?

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.163
What shape will the answer
have if I multiply a three

00:52:54.163 --> 00:52:57.590
by one times a one by three.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:58.360
Three by three.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.450
It's a full matrix.

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:00.690
Columns times rows.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:05.320
And it's a totally legitimate
way to multiply matrices.

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:09.060
That column times
that row will be?

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.660
Well you can see
what will it be.

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:18.280
And then the c_1 is
going to come into it.

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.140
If I just did those
multiplications,

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.120
it would just be that.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:28.350
And then the c_1
puts that there.

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.760
What do I see there?

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:34.310
I see the element matrix.

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:36.910
Do you see that this
is the piece that

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:40.750
involved c_1 in the answer?

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.470
Well I guess you'll
see it better

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:48.750
when I do column two
times c_2 times row two.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.930
So I have to add that guy on.

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:54.160
And then I'll leave the other.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.860
What do I get if I do
that column, three by one,

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:03.610
times itself as a
row times the c_2.

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:06.070
I don't know if you see
what I'm going to get.

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:12.240
If you just do that, you'll
see a c_2 will appear here.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.470
And a -c_2 will appear there.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.600
And these will be zeroes.

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.830
So this was column
one times row one.

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:22.890
This is column
two times row two.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:24.950
And third and then the fourth.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:28.190
But do you see that
this part is telling me

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:30.520
all about the second spring?

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:34.450
This part is telling me, what
does the first spring, the c_1,

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:39.175
contribute to K. This part
tells me what does the c_2 part,

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:41.450
do you see the c_2 part in K?

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.580
There, there, minus
there and minus there.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:49.160
The third part from the column
row would be the c_3 part.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.110
And the fourth part
from the fourth spring

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:52.860
would be the c_4 part.

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:56.350
So that's a way you
won't have thought of.

00:54:56.350 --> 00:55:00.360
But it's the way ADINA
would assemble this matrix.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.290
It would not do
that multiplication.

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:05.390
It would do it this
way, columns times rows.

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:06.590
We'll see it again.

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:10.270
So, hope you have a great
weekend and a holiday Monday

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:12.813
that we all happy about.
