00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.820
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.370
I hope you didn't spend
time doing 6002 problem

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.460
sets while eating turkey.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.160
It's not recommended
for digestion.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.650
But I hope you're ready to go
back into diving into material.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.220
And since it's been a week
since we got together,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.430
let me remind you of
what we were doing.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.880
We were looking at the
issue of how to understand

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.160
experimental data.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.040
Data could come from
a physical experiment.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.450
We had the example of
measuring the spring

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.760
constant of a linear spring.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.550
Could come from biological data.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.420
Could come from social data.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.040
And what we looked
out was the idea

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.510
of how do we actually
fit models to that data

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.770
in order to understand them.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.580
So what I want to do is I want
to start with that high level

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.650
reminder of what we were after.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.459
I want to do about
a five minute recap

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.000
of what we were doing last time,
because it has been a while.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.416
And then we're
going to talk about

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.237
how do you actually
validate models

00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:28.820
that you're fitting to data to
understand are they really good

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.627
fits or not.

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:31.460
And if you remember.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.650
I know you spend all your
time thinking about 6002.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.660
You should remember I
left you with a puzzle,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.930
where I fit data to--

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.190
sorry, fit models
to some noisy data.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.050
And there was a question
of, did the model

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.052
really have an order 16 fit?

00:01:45.052 --> 00:01:46.510
Right, so what are
we trying to do?

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.040
Remember, our goal is to try
and model experimental data.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.850
And really what we want to do is
have a model that both explains

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.460
the phenomena
underlying what we see,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.590
gives us a sense of what
might be the underlying

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.950
physical mechanism, the
underlying social mechanism,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.920
and can let us make
predictions about the behavior

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.450
in new settings.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.970
In the case of my spring,
being able to predict

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.190
what will the displacement
be when I actually

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.950
put a different weight on it
than something I measured.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.180
Or if you want to think
from a design perspective,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.805
working the other
direction and saying,

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.970
I don't want my spring to
deflect more than this amount

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.530
under certain kinds of weights.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.515
So how do I use the
model to tell me

00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:27.640
what the spring constant
should be for the spring I

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.940
want in that case?

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.760
So we want to be able to predict
behavior in new settings.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.860
The last piece we know is
that, if the data was perfect,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.120
this is easy.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.056
But it ain't.

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.430
There's always
going to be noise.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.596
There's always going to be
experimental uncertainty.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.930
And so I really want to
account for that uncertainty

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.830
when I fit that model.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.560
And while sometimes I'll have
theories that will help--

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.020
Hooke says models of
springs are linear--

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.455
in some cases, I don't.

00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:57.830
And in those cases, I want to
actually try and figure out

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.350
what's the best model
to fit even when I don't

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.530
know what the theory tells me.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.760
OK, so quick recap, what
do we use to solve this?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.370
So we've got a set
of observed values.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.430
My spring case for different
displays for different masses

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.040
I measured the displacements.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160
Those displacements
are my observed values.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.420
And if I had a model
that would predict

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.520
what the displacement
should be, I

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.280
can measure how good the fit is
by looking at that expression

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.222
right there, the
sum of the squares

00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:29.180
of the differences between
the observed and the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.815
predicted data.

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:32.440
As I said, we could
use other measures.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.356
We could use a first
order and absolute value.

00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:36.430
The square is actually
really handy, because it

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.310
makes the solution space
very easy to deal with,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.060
which we'll get to in a second.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.954
So given observed
data, get a prediction.

00:03:42.954 --> 00:03:44.620
I can use the sum of
squared differences

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.560
to measure how good the fit is.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.110
And then the second
piece is I now

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.580
what to find what's the best
way to predict the data.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.840
What's the best curve
that fits the data.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.730
What's the best model for
protecting the values.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.230
And we suggest that
last time, we'll

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.940
focus on mathematical
expressions, polynomials.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.700
Professor Guttag is so excited
about polynomial expressions,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.170
he's throwing
laptops on the floor.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.450
Please don't do
that to your laptop.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.660
We're going to fit polynomials
to these expressions.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.019
And since the polynomials
have some coefficients,

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.060
the game is basically,
how do I find

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.709
the coefficients of
the polynomial that

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.050
minimize that expression.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.330
And that, we said, was an
example of linear regression.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.560
So let me just remind you
what linear regression says.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.680
Simple example,
case of the spring.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.630
I'm going to get a
degree 1 polynomial.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.620
So that is something of
the form y is ax plus b.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.730
a and b are the three variables,
the parameters I can change.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.220
And the idea is for every
x, in the case of my spring,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.082
for every mass, I'm
going to use that model

00:04:48.082 --> 00:04:49.540
to predict what's
the displacement,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.830
measure the
differences, and find

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.996
the thing that minimizes it.

00:04:51.996 --> 00:04:54.530
So I just want to
find values of a and b

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.930
that let me predict values
that minimize that expression.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.210
As I suggested, you
could solve this.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.680
You could write code to do it.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.900
It's a neat little
piece of code to write.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.330
But fortunately, PiLab
provides that for you.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.250
And I just want to give
you the visualization

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.291
of what we're doing here.

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:13.550
And then we're going
to look at examples.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.650
I'm going to try to
find the best line.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.806
It's represented by
two values, a and b.

00:05:18.806 --> 00:05:21.360
I could represent
all possible lines

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.242
in a space that has
one access with values

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:26.700
and the other access
with b values.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.720
Every point in that plane
defines a line for me.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.180
Now imagine a surface laid over
this two dimensional space,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.450
where the value or the
height of the surface

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.902
is the value of that objective
function at every point.

00:05:41.902 --> 00:05:43.360
Don't worry about
computing it all,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.347
but just imagine
I could do that.

00:05:45.347 --> 00:05:46.930
And by the way, one
of the nice things

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.720
about doing sum of squares
is that surface always

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.820
has a concave shape.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.800
And now the idea of
linear regression

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.190
is I'm going to start at
some point on that surface.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.560
And I'm just going
to walk downhill

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.620
until I get to the bottom.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.500
There will always be
one bottom, one point.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.830
And once I get to that
point, that a and b value

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.410
tell me the best line.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.700
So it's called linear
regression because I'm linearly

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.380
walking downhill on this space.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.160
Now I'm doing this for line
with two parameters a,b,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.247
because it's easy to visualize.

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:22.330
If you're a good mathematician
even if you're not,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.480
you can generalize this to think
about arbitrary dimensions.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.140
So a fourth order surface
in a five dimensional space,

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.619
for example, would solve
a cubic example of this.

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:35.160
That's the idea of
linear regression.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.409
That's what we're going to
use to actually figure out,

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.280
to find the best solution.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.100
So here was the example I used.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.200
I gave you a set of data.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.600
In about 3 slides,
I'm going to tell you

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.641
where the data came from.

00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:47.390
But I give you a set of data.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.850
We could fit the best
line to this using

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.580
that linear regression idea.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.020
And again, last piece
of reminder, I'm

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.094
going to use polyfit from PiLab.

00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:00.010
It just solves that
linear regression problem.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.830
And I give it a set of x values.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.320
I give a corresponding
set of y values,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.540
need to be the same
number in each case.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.800
And I give it a dimension.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.040
And in this case, one says,
find the best fitting line.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.630
It will produce
that and return it

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.870
as a tuple, which I'll store
under the name model 1.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.070
And I could plot it out.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.000
So just remind you, polyfit
will find the best fitting n

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.600
dimensional surface, n being
that last parameter there,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.970
and return it.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.660
In a second, we're going to
use polyval, which will say,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.980
given that model and
a set of x values,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.450
predict what the
y value should be.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.950
Apply them.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.380
OK, so I fit the line.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.930
What do you think?

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.370
Good fit?

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.710
Not so much, right?

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.235
Pretty ugly.

00:07:47.235 --> 00:07:48.610
I mean, you can
see it's probably

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.660
the best-- or not probably.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.890
It is the best fitting line.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.310
It sort of accounts for the
variation on either side of it.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.839
But it's not a very good fit.

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:58.380
So then the question
is, well why not

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.350
try fitting a
higher order model?

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.690
So I could fit a quadratic.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.540
That is a second order model.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.000
y equals ax squared
plus bx plus c.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.290
Run the same code.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.560
Block that out.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.450
And I get that.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.040
That's the linear model.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.700
There's the quadratic model.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.920
At least my [? i ?] our
looks a lot better, right?

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.230
It looks like it's following
that data reasonably well.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.300
OK, I can fit a linear model.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.160
I can fit a quadratic model.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.600
What about higher order models?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.599
What about a fourth order
model, an eighth order

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.490
model, a 644th order model?

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.865
How do I know which one
is going to be best?

00:08:39.865 --> 00:08:42.490
So for that, I'm going to remind
you of the last thing we used.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.950
And then we're going to start
talking about how to use it

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.830
further, which is if we
try fitting higher order

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.400
polynomials, do we
get a better fit?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.820
And to do that, we
need to measure what

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.777
it means for the data to fit.

00:08:56.777 --> 00:08:58.360
If I don't have any
other information.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.640
For example, if I don't
have a theory that tells me

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.365
this should be linear
in the case afoot,

00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:05.490
then the best way to do it
is to use what's called,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.300
the coefficient of
determination, r-squared.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.440
It's a scale independent
thing, which is good.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.840
By scale independent, I
mean if I take all the data

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.441
and stretch it out,
this will still

00:09:15.441 --> 00:09:17.440
give me back the same
value in terms of the fit.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.080
So it doesn't depend on
the size of the data.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.990
And what it does is it
basically tells me the

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.690
a value between
0 and 1, how well

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.760
does this model fit the data.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.640
So just to remind
you, in this case,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.720
the y's are the
measured values, the p's

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.770
are the predicted values.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.550
That's what my model is saying,
for each one of these cases.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.910
And mu down here is
the mean or the average

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.480
of the measured values.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.390
The way to think about this
is this top expression here.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.360
Well, that's exactly what I'm
trying to minimize, right?

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.630
So it's giving me an
estimate or a measure

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.050
of the error in the estimates
between what the model says

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.510
and what I actually measure.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.980
And the denominator down
here basically tells

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:08.440
me how much does the data
vary away from the mean value.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.510
Now here's the idea.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.560
If in fact, I can
get this to 0, I

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.310
can get a model that completely
accounts for all the variation

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.290
in the estimates, that's great.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.270
It says, the model
has fit perfectly.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.110
And that means this is 0 so
this r value or r squared value

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.060
is 1.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.650
On the other hand, if this
is equal to that, meaning

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.510
that all of the variation
in the estimates

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.880
accounts for none of the
variation in the data,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.130
then this is 1 and
this goes to 0.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.160
So the idea is that an r-squared
value is close to 1 is great.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.830
It says, the model is
a good fit to the data.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.780
r-squared value is getting
closer to 0, not so good.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:58.550
OK, so I ran this,
fitting models of order 2,

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.210
4, 8, and 16.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.180
Now you can see that model 2,
that's the green line here.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.940
That's the one
that we saw before.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.130
It's basically a
parabolic kind of arc.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.020
It kind of follows
the data pretty well.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.000
But if I look at those
r-squared values.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.270
Wow, look at that.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.290
Order 16 fit accounts
for all but 3%

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.280
of the variation in the data.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.870
It's a great fit.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.606
And you can see.

00:11:26.606 --> 00:11:27.730
You can see how it follows.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.670
It actually goes through
most, but not quite all,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.480
of the data points.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.530
So it's following
them pretty well.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.390
OK, so if that's the
case, the order 16 fit

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.460
is really the best fit.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.615
Should we just use it?

00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:45.740
And I left you last time
with that quote that says,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.570
from your parents, right,
your mother telling you,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.070
just because you
can do something

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.720
doesn't mean you
should do something.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.900
I'll leave it at that.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.940
Same thing applies here.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.930
Why are we building the model?

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.820
Remember, I said two reasons.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.990
One is to be able to
explain the phenomena.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.290
And the second one is to be
able to make predictions.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.190
So I want to be able to
explain the phenomena

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.010
in the case of a spring,
with things like it's linear

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.740
and then that gives me a
sense of a linear relationship

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.210
between compression and force.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.690
In this case, a
16th order model,

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:28.190
what kind of physical process
has an order 16 variation?

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.240
Sounds a little painful.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.510
So maybe not a great
insight into the process.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:38.000
But the second reason is I
want to be able to predict

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.574
future behavior of this system.

00:12:40.574 --> 00:12:42.740
In the case of this spring,
I put a different weight

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.781
on than I've done before.

00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:47.720
I want to predict what the
displacement is going to be.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.180
I've done a set of trials for
an FDA approval of a drug.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.138
Now I want to predict
the effect of a treatment

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:53.150
on a new patient.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.984
How do I use the model
to help me with that?

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.650
One that maybe not
so good, currently, I

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.547
want to predict the
outcome of an election.

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:01.880
Maybe those models need to
be fixed from, at least, what

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.335
happened the last time around.

00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:05.210
But I need to be able
to make the prediction.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.240
So another way of saying it
is, a good model both explains

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.730
the phenomena and let's
me make the predictions.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.840
OK, so let's go back,
then, to our example.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.210
And before I do it, let me tell
you where that data came from.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.180
I actually built that data
by looking at another kind

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.400
of physical phenomenon.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.441
And it was a lot of them.

00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:28.370
Things that follow
a parabolic arc.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.440
So for example, comets.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.050
Any particle under the influence
of a uniform gravitational

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.590
field follows a
parabolic arc, which

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.000
i why Halley's comet gets
really close for a while,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.190
and then goes away off
into the solar system,

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.450
and comes back around.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.500
My favorite example--

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.520
I'm biased on this.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.620
And I know you all know
which team I root for.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.200
But there is Tom Brady throwing
a pass against the Pittsburgh

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.200
Steelers.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.820
Center of mass of the past
follows a nice parabolic arc.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.430
Even in design, you
see parabolic arcs

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:58.330
in lots of places.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.890
They have nice
properties in terms

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.590
of disbursement of
loads and forces,

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.510
which is why architects
like to use them.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.667
So here's how I
generated the data.

00:14:08.667 --> 00:14:09.750
I wrote a little function.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.541
Actually, I didn't.

00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:12.500
Professor Guttag did,
but I borrowed it.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.606
It took in three
parameters, a, b, and c.

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:20.190
ax squared plus bx plus c.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.947
I gave it a set of x values.

00:14:21.947 --> 00:14:24.030
Those are the independent
measurements, the things

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.220
along the horizontal axis.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.780
And notice what I did.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:34.000
I generated values given an a,
b, and c, for that equation.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.020
And then I added in some noise.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.890
So random.guass takes a mean
and a standard deviation,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.340
and it generates noise
following that bell shaped curve

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.260
that goes in the distribution.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.440
So the 0 says it's 0 mean,
meaning there's no bias.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.380
It's going to be equally likely
to be above or below the value,

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.910
positive or negative.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.380
But 35 is a pretty good
standard deviation.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.960
This is putting a lot
of noise into the data.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.802
And then I just added
that into y values.

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:03.260
The rest of this,
you can see, it's

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.020
simply going to write it into a
file, a set of x and y values.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.500
But this will generate, given
a value for a, b, and c,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.810
data from a parabolic arc
with noise added to it.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.670
And in this case, I took
it as y equals 3x squared.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.530
And then c and c are 0.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.937
And that's how I generated it.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.230
What I want to do, I want to
see how well this model actually

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.170
predicts behavior.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.570
So one of the ways
I could do it,

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.570
to say, all right, the question
I want to ask is, whoa,

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.110
if I generated the data
from a degree 2 polynomial

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.820
quadratic, why in the world is
the 16th order polynomial the,

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.660
"best fit?"

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.450
So let's test it out.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.837
I'm going to give 3-- sorry, 4.

00:15:49.837 --> 00:15:50.420
I can't count.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:56.030
4 different degrees, order 2,
order 4, order 8, order 16.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.870
And I've generated two
different datasets,

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.850
using exactly that code.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:02.705
I just ran it twice.

00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:04.580
It's going to have
slightly different values,

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.913
because the noise is going
to be different in each case.

00:16:06.913 --> 00:16:08.720
But they're both
coming from that a,

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.050
y equals 3x squared equation.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.560
And the code here
basically says,

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.140
I'm going to take
those two data sets

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.590
and basically, get the x
and y values out, and then

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.420
fit models.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.610
So I'll remind
you, genFits takes

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.270
in a collection of x
and y values and a list

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.090
or a tuple of degrees,
and for each degree,

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.720
finds, using Polyfit,
the best model.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.350
So models one will be 4 models
for order 2, 4, 8, and 16.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.990
And similarly, down here, I'm
going to do the same thing,

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.470
but using the second data set.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.130
And I'm going to fit,
again, a set of models.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.390
And then I'll remind you, test
fits, which you saw last time.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.340
I know it's a while
ago, basically takes

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:57.710
a set of models, a corresponding
set of degrees, x and y values,

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.950
and says, for each model
in that degree, measure

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.790
how well that model
meets the fit, using

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:06.839
that r-squared value.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:10.760
So testFits is going to get us
back a set of r-squared values.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.089
All right, with that in
mind, I've got the code here.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:15.630
Let's run it.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.200
And here we go.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.720
I'm going to run that code.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.560
Ha, I get two fits.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.109
Looks good.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.150
Let's look at the values.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.070
So there's the first data set.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.110
All right, the green line
still is doing not a bad job.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.930
The purple line, boy, is
fitting it really well.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.860
And again, notice
here's the best fit.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.850
That's amazing.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.900
That is accounting
for all but 0.4%

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.430
of the variation in the data.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.860
Great fit.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.880
Order 16.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.020
Came from an order 2 thing.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.120
All right, what about
the second data set?

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.290
Oh, grumph.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:08.600
It also says order 16
fit is the best fit.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.430
Not quite as good.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.080
It accounts for all but
about 2% of the variation.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.720
Again, the green line,
the red line, do OK.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.850
But in this case,
again, that purple line

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:18.790
is still the best fit.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.110
So I've still got this puzzle.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:25.490
But I didn't quite test
what I wanted, right?

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:29.670
I said I want to see how well
it predicts new behavior.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.760
Here what I did was I took
two datasets, fit the model,

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.670
and I got two different
fits, one for each dataset.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.040
They both fit well for order 16.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.670
But they're not quite right.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.370
OK, so best fitting
model is still order 16

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.970
but we know it came from
an order 2 polynomial.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.190
So how could I will
get a handle on seeing

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.390
how good this model is?

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:56.820
Well, what we're seeing here
is coming from training error.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.910
Or another way of saying
it is, what we're measuring

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.580
is how well does
the model perform

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.040
on the data from
which it was learned?

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.260
How well do I fit the
model to the training data?

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.997
I want a small training error.

00:19:11.997 --> 00:19:14.330
And if you think about it,
go back to the first example,

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.930
when I fit a line to this
data, it did not do well.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.440
It was not a good model.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.344
When I fit a quadratic,
it was pretty decent.

00:19:21.344 --> 00:19:23.260
And then I got better
and better as I went on.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.970
So I certainly need at least
a small training error.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.800
But it's, to use the
mathematical terms,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.630
a necessary, but not sufficient
condition to get a great model.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.550
I need a small training
error, but I really

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.790
want to make sure that the model
is capturing what I'd like.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.210
And so for that, I want
to see how well does

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.830
it do on other gen
data, generated

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.020
from the same
process, whether it's

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.680
weights on springs, different
comets besides Haley's comet,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.180
different voters
than those surveyed

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.596
when we tried to
figure out what's

00:19:52.596 --> 00:19:54.790
going to happen in an election.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.350
And I'm set up to
do that, by using

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:03.340
a really important tool called,
validation or cross-validation.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.140
We set the stage, and then
we're going to do the example.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.727
I'm going to get a set of data.

00:20:07.727 --> 00:20:09.310
I want to fit a model
to it, actually,

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.810
different models,
different degrees,

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.730
different kinds of models.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.710
To see how well
they work, I want

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.760
to see how well they predict
behavior under other data

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.670
than that from which
I did the training.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.840
So I could do that right here.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.720
I could generate the
models from one data set,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.670
but test them on the other.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.220
And so in fact, I
had one data set.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.530
I build a set of models
for the first data set.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.140
I compared how well it
did on that data set.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.750
But I could now apply it
to the second dataset.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.930
How well does that
account for that data set?

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.320
And similarly, take the models
I built for the second data set,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.630
and see how well they
predict the points

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.920
from the first dataset.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.360
What do I expect?

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.130
Certainly, expect
that the testing error

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.320
is likely to be larger
than the training error,

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.420
because I train on
one set of data.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.300
And that means this
ought to be a better way

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.390
to think about, how well
does this model generalize?

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.700
How well does it
predict other behavior,

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.230
besides what I started with.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.730
So here's the code
I'm going to use.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.660
It's pretty straightforward.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.951
All I want to draw your
attention to here is, remember,

00:21:15.951 --> 00:21:19.510
models one I built by fitting
models of degree 2, 4, 8,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.260
and 16 to the first data set.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.590
And I'm going to apply those
models to the second dataset,

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.350
x vals 2 and y vals 2.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.450
Similarly, I'm going to
take the models built

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:36.370
for the second data set, and
test them on the first dataset

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.510
to see how well they fit.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.130
I know you're
eagerly anticipating,

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.470
as I've been setting
this up for a whole week.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.237
All right, let's look at
what happens when I do this.

00:21:46.237 --> 00:21:47.070
I'm going to run it.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.570
And then we'll look
at the examples.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.640
If I go back over to
Python and this code

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.610
was distributed earlier, if you
want to play with it yourself.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.010
Should be the right
place to do it.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.345
I am going to run that code.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.830
Now I get something
a little different.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:15.650
In fact, if I go
look at it, here

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:20.955
is model one applied
to data set 2.

00:22:20.955 --> 00:22:23.080
And we can both eyeball it
and look at the numbers.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.220
Eyeballing it, there's that
green line, still generally

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.506
following the form
of this pretty well.

00:22:30.506 --> 00:22:31.630
What about the purple line?

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.020
The order 16 degree.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.170
Remember, that's the
purple line from model 1,

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.360
from training set 1.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.260
Wow, this misses a bunch
of points, pretty badly.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.850
And in fact, look at
the r-squared values.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.550
Order 2 and order
4, pretty good fit,

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.130
accounts for all but
about 14, 13% of the data.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:58.500
Look what happened to the
degree 16, degrees 16 fit.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.357
Way down at last.

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:00.640
0.7.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.570
Last time around it was 0.997.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.660
What about the other direction?

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.540
Taking the model built
and the second data

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.610
set, testing it on
the first data set.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:17.300
Again, notice a nice
fit for degree 2 and 4,

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.280
not so good for degree 16.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.760
And just to give you a sense
of this, I'm going to go back.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:28.630
There is the model one case.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.180
There is the model
in the other case.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.610
You can see the model that
accounts for variation in one

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.776
doesn't account for the
variation in the other, when

00:23:34.776 --> 00:23:37.980
I look at order 16 fit.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.950
OK, so what this says
is something important.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:43.790
Now I can see.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.130
In fact, if I look back
at this, if I were just

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.190
looking at the coefficient
of determination,

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.940
this says, in order to
predict other behavior,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.190
I'm better off with an order
2 or maybe order 4 polynomial.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.166
Those r-squared values
are both the same.

00:23:59.166 --> 00:24:01.040
I happen to know it's
order 2, because that's

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:01.998
where I generated from.

00:24:01.998 --> 00:24:06.462
But that's a whole lot
better than order 16.

00:24:06.462 --> 00:24:08.920
And what you're seeing here is
an example of something that

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.920
happens a lot in statistics.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.820
And in fact, I would suggest is
often misused in fitting data

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.310
to statistical samples.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.190
It's called overfitting.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.070
And what it means
is I've let there

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.740
be too many degrees of
freedom in my model, too

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.910
many free parameters.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.760
And what it's fitting isn't
just the underlying process.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.767
It's also fitting to the noise.

00:24:32.767 --> 00:24:35.350
The message I want you to take
out of this part of the lecture

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.040
is, if we only fit the
model to training data,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.320
and we look at how
well it does, we

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.660
could get what looks
like a great fit,

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.650
but we may actually have come
up with far too complex a model.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.230
Order 16 instead of order 2.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.300
And the only way you
are likely to detect

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:57.180
that is to train on one test
set and test on a different.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.890
And if you do that, it's likely
to expose whether, in fact, I

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.810
have done a good job
of fitting or whether I

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.325
have overfit to the data.

00:25:04.325 --> 00:25:06.450
There are lots of horror
stories in the literature,

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.783
especially from early days
of machine learning of people

00:25:08.783 --> 00:25:10.910
overfitting to data and
coming up with models

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.700
that they thought wonderfully
predicted an effect,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.850
and then when it ran on new
data really hit the big one.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.409
All right, so this
is something you

00:25:19.409 --> 00:25:20.700
want to try and stay away from.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.760
And the best way to do
it is to do validation.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.740
You can see it here, right?

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.660
The upper left is my
training data, dataset one.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.610
There's the set of models.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.400
This is now taking
that and applying it

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.820
to a different dataset
from the same process.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.850
And notice for the
degree to polynomial,

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:44.580
the coefficient of
determination, 0.86, now 0.87.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.970
The fact that it's slightly
higher is just accidental.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.670
But it's really
about the same level.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.230
It's doing the same kind of
drop on the training data

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.360
and on the test data.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.910
On the other hand, degree 16,
coefficient of determination

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:05.450
is a wonderful 0.96 here and
a pretty awful 9 down there.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.660
And that's a sign that
we're not in good shape,

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.000
when in fact our
coefficient of determination

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.720
drops significantly when
we try and handle new data.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:22.280
OK, so why do we
get a better fit

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.840
on the training data with
a higher order model,

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.780
but then do less well when we're
actually handling new data?

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.440
Or another way of saying it
is, if I started out with,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.740
in the case of that with
that data, a linear model

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.370
it didn't fit well, and then
I got to a quadratic model,

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.920
why didn't that quadratic
model still say [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.950
Why was it the case that, as I
added more degrees of freedom,

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.040
I did better.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.410
Or another way of asking it
is, can I actually get a worse

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:55.399
fit to training data as I
increase the model complexity?

00:26:55.399 --> 00:26:57.190
And I see at least one
negative head shake.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.580
Thank you.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:58.121
You're right.

00:26:58.121 --> 00:26:59.050
I cannot.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.610
Let's look at why.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.539
If I add in some
higher order terms,

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:04.830
and they actually don't matter.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:09.200
If I got perfect data, the
coefficient will just be 0.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.050
The fit will basically say,
this term doesn't matter.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:12.890
Ignore it.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.620
And that'll work
in perfect data.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.250
But if the data is noisy,
what the model is going to do

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.237
is actually start
fitting the noise.

00:27:22.237 --> 00:27:24.320
And while it may lead to
a better r-squared value,

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.180
it's not really a better fit.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.770
Right, let me show you
an example of that.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.790
I'm going to fit a quadratic
to a straight line.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:33.510
Easy thing to do.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.660
But I want to show you the
effect of overfitting or adding

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.049
in those extra terms.

00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:39.590
So let me say it a
little bit better.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.539
I'm going to start off
with this 3, sorry, 3.

00:27:41.539 --> 00:27:42.580
I'm doing it again today.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.970
4 simple values, 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.640
The y values are the
same as x values.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.264
So this is 0,0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3 3.

00:27:50.264 --> 00:27:51.430
They're all lying on a line.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.510
But I'm going to fit.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.160
I'm going to plot them out.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.040
And then I'm going
to fit a quadratic.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.504
y if it equals ax squared
plus bx plus c to this.

00:28:02.504 --> 00:28:03.920
Now I know it's a
line, but I want

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.780
to see what happens
if I fit a quadratic.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.510
So I'm going to use polyfit
to fit my quadratic.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.430
I'm going to print out
some data about it.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.610
And then I'm going to
use Polyval to estimate

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.950
what those values should be.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.150
Plot them out.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:22.510
And then compute r squared
value, and see what happens.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.654
All right, OK, and let
me set this up better.

00:28:24.654 --> 00:28:25.320
What am I doing?

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.653
I want to just fit it to a line.

00:28:26.653 --> 00:28:29.250
I know it's a line, but I'm
going to fit a quadratic to it.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.860
And what I'd expect is, even
though there's an extra term

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.300
there, it shouldn't matter.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:40.040
So if I go to Python,
and I run this,

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:46.130
I run exactly that
example, look at that.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.560
a equals 0, b is 1, c equals 0.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.087
Look at the r-squared value.

00:28:51.087 --> 00:28:52.420
I'll pull that together for you.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.220
It says, in this perfect
case, there's what I get.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.770
The blue line is drawn
through the actual values.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.290
The dotted red line is drawn
through the predicted values.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.340
They exactly line up.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.020
And in fact, the
solution implied

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.020
says, the higher order
term coefficient 0,

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.830
it doesn't matter.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.750
So what it found was y equals x.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.329
I know you're totally impressed
I could find a straight line.

00:29:19.329 --> 00:29:20.620
But notice what happened there.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.480
I dropped or that
system said, you

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.340
don't need the
higher order term.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.200
Wonderful r-squared value.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.810
OK, let's see how
well it predicts.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.540
Let's add in one more
point, out at 20.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.040
So this is 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.700
That's 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.140
I'm going to add 20 in there, so
it's 0, 0 , 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 20,

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.550
20.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.490
Again, I can estimate
using the same model.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.900
So I'm not
recomputing the model,

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.390
the model I predicted from using
those first set of four points.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.270
I can get the
estimated y values,

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.310
plot those out, and you again,
compute the r-squared value

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.720
here.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.260
And even adding that point
in, there's the line.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.840
And guess what.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.860
Perfectly predicts it.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.574
No big surprise.

00:30:04.574 --> 00:30:06.240
So it says, in the
case of perfect data,

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.420
adding the higher order terms
isn't going to cause a problem.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.340
The system will say
coefficients are 0.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.910
That's all I need.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.210
All right, now, let's go back
and add in just a tiny bit

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.220
of noise right there.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.910
0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, and 3, 3.1.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.420
So I've got a slight deviation
in the y value there.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.590
Again, I can plot them.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.980
I'm going to fit a
quadratic to them.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.980
I'm going to print out
some information about it

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.680
and then get the
estimated values using

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.020
that new model to see
what it should look like.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.020
I'm not going to run it.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.570
I'm going to show
you the result.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.370
I get a really good
r-squared value.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.850
And there's the equation
it comes up with.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.270
Not so bad, right?

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.600
It's almost y equal to x.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.430
But because of that
little bit of noise

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.239
there, there's a small
second order term

00:30:58.239 --> 00:31:00.030
here and a little
constant term down there.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.050
The y squared value
is really pretty good.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.610
And if you really squint
and look carefully at this,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.970
you'll actually see
there's a little bit

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.660
of a deviation between
the red and the blue line.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.610
It undershoots-- sorry,
overshoots there,

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:17.430
undershoots here, but
it's really pretty close.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.770
All right, so am I just
whistling in the dark here?

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:21.760
What's the difference?

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.770
Well, now let's add
in that extra point.

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.110
And what happens?

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.890
So again, I'm now taking the
same set of points 0, 0, 1, 1,

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.870
2, 2, 3, and 3.1.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.730
I'm going to do 20, 20.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.407
Using the model I captured
from fitting to that first set,

00:31:38.407 --> 00:31:39.740
I want to see what happens here.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:43.870
Crap.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:44.369
I'm sorry.

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:45.280
Shouldn't say that.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.210
Darn.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.911
Pick up some other word.

00:31:49.911 --> 00:31:51.160
Shouldn't surprise you, right?

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.840
A small variation here is
now causing a really large

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.990
variation up there.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:02.310
And this is why the ideal case
overfitting is not a problem,

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.500
because the coefficients
get zeroed out.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.260
But even a little bit of
noise can cause a problem.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.110
Now I'll grant you, we
set this up deliberately

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.430
to show a big effect here.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:16.260
But a 3% error in one data
point is causing a huge problem

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.684
when I get further
out on this curve.

00:32:18.684 --> 00:32:20.600
And by the way, there
is the r-squared values.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.190
It's 0.7.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:25.800
It doesn't do a
particularly good job

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.830
OK, so how would I fix this?

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.610
Well, what if I had
simply done a first degree

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.810
fit, same situation.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.840
Let's say fit a line
to this rather than

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.080
fitting a quadratic.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.630
Remember, my
question was, what's

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.577
the harm of fitting a higher
order model if the coefficients

00:32:42.577 --> 00:32:43.410
would be zeroed out?

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:45.180
We've seen they
won't be zeroed out.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.460
But if I were just
to have fit a line

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.150
to this, exactly the same
experiment, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2,

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:55.450
2, 3, and 3.1, 20 and 20.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:33:00.270
Now you can see it still does
a really good job of fitting.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:04.410
The r-squared value is 0.9988.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.770
So again, fitting the right
level of model, the noise

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.850
doesn't cause nearly
as much of a problem.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.730
And so just to pull that
together, basically it says,

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.660
the predictive ability
of the first order model

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.990
is much better than
the second order model.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.740
And that's why, in
this case, I would want

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.210
to use that first order model.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:26.560
So take home message.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.420
And then we're going
to amplify this.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.390
If I pick an overly
complex model,

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.450
I have the danger of overfitting
to the training data,

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:38.420
overfitting meaning that I'm
not only fitting the underlying

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.850
process, I'm fitting the noise.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:42.830
I get an order 16
model is the best

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.950
fit when it's in fact, in order
2 model that was generating it.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.350
That increases the
risk that it's not

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.792
going to do well with the
data, not what I'd like.

00:33:51.792 --> 00:33:53.250
I want to be able
to predict what's

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:56.020
going to go on well here.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:56.960
On the other hand.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.130
So that would say, boy,
just stick with the simplest

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.820
possible model.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.700
But there's a trade off here.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.350
And we already saw
that when I tried

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.780
to fit a line to a data that
was basically quadratic.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.739
I didn't get a good fit.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:10.860
So I'd want to find the balance.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.850
An insufficiently complex model
won't explain the data well.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:19.179
An overly complex model will
overfit the training data.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:20.909
So I'd like to find
the place where

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.310
the model is as
simple as possible,

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.681
but still explains the data.

00:34:25.681 --> 00:34:28.139
And I can't resist the quote
from Einstein that captures it

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:30.870
pretty well, "everything
should be made as simple

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.690
as possible, but not simpler."

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:35.280
In the case of
where I started, it

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.670
should be fit to a quadratic,
because it's the right fit.

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.420
But don't fit more
than that, because it's

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.770
getting overly complex

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:47.822
Now how might we go about
finding the right model?

00:34:47.822 --> 00:34:50.280
We're not going to dwell on
this but here is a standard way

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.050
in which you might do it.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.684
Start with a low order model.

00:34:53.684 --> 00:34:54.600
Again, take that data.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.980
Fit a linear model to it.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.080
Look at not only
the r-squared value,

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.630
but see how well it
accounts for new data.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.160
Increase the order of the model.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.930
Repeat the process.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.730
And keep doing
that until you find

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.810
a point at which a model does
a good job both on the training

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.780
data and on predicting new data.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:16.280
An after it starts
to fall off, that

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.155
gives you a point where
you might say there's

00:35:18.155 --> 00:35:19.830
a good sized model.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.080
In the case of this data,
whether I would have stopped

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.413
at a quadratic or I might
have used a cubic or a quartic

00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:26.104
depends on the values.

00:35:26.104 --> 00:35:28.270
But I certainly wouldn't
have gone much beyond that.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.228
And this is one way, if
you don't have a theory

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:32.490
to drive you, to think
about, how do I actually fit

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:33.960
the model the way I would like.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.635
Let's go back to
where we started.

00:35:38.635 --> 00:35:40.260
We still have one
more big topic to do,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.801
and we still have
a few minutes left.

00:35:41.801 --> 00:35:45.870
But let's go back to where
we started Hooke's law.

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.730
There was the data from
measuring displacements

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.920
of a spring, as I
added different weights

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.290
to the bottom of the spring.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:54.940
And there's the linear fit.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.600
It's not bad.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.927
There's the quadratic fit.

00:35:58.927 --> 00:36:01.260
And it's certainly got a
better r-squared value, though.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.930
That could be just
fitting to the noise.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.370
But you actually
can see, I think,

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:08.340
that that green curve
probably does a better

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.450
job of fitting the data.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.120
Well, wait a minute.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.830
Even though the quadratic
fit is tighter here,

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:20.030
Hooke says, this is linear.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:21.959
So what's going on?

00:36:21.959 --> 00:36:23.500
Well, this is another
place where you

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.970
want to think about your model.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:28.066
And I'll remind you, in case
you don't remember your physics,

00:36:28.066 --> 00:36:30.011
unless we believe
that Hooke was wrong,

00:36:30.011 --> 00:36:31.260
this should tell us something.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.790
And in particular, Hooke's
law says, the model

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:38.750
holds until you reach the
elastic limit of the spring.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.090
You stretch a slinky too
far, it never springs back.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.250
You go beyond that
elastic limit.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.870
And that's probably what's
happening right up there.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.930
Through here, it's following
that linear relationship.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:53.630
Up at this point, I've
essentially broken the spring.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.730
The elastic limit
doesn't hold anymore.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.840
And so really, in this
case, I should probably

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.940
fit different models
to different segments.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.550
And there's a much better fit.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.620
Linear through the
first part and another

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:11.480
later line once I hit
that elastic limit.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.980
How might I find this?

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.520
Well, you could imagine a little
search process in which you try

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.970
and find where's the best
place along here to break

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.720
the data into two sets, fit
linear segments to both,

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.112
and get really good
fits for both examples.

00:37:27.112 --> 00:37:29.070
And I raise it because
that's the kind of thing

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.070
you've also seen before.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:32.580
You could imagine writing
code to do that search

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.530
to find that good fit.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.940
OK, that gives
you a sense, then,

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.070
of why you want to be
careful about overfitting,

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.070
why you want to not just
look at the coefficient

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.920
of determination, but see how
well does this predict behavior

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.980
on new data sets.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.850
Now suppose I don't have
a theory, like Hooke,

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.460
to guide me.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.340
Can I still figure out what's a
good model to fit to the data?

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.680
And the answer is, you bet.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.810
We're going to use
cross-validation to guide

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.760
the choice of the
model complexity.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.470
And I want to show
you two examples.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.000
If the data set's
small, we can use

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.700
what's called leave one
out cross-validation.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.600
I'll give you a definition
of that in a second.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.390
If the data sets
bigger than that,

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:20.210
we can use k-fold
cross-validation.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.980
I'll give you a
definition that a second.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.660
Or just what's called,
repeated random sampling.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.879
But we can use this same
idea of validating new data

00:38:27.879 --> 00:38:30.170
to try and figure out whether
the model is a good model

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.490
or not.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:33.920
Leave one out cross-validation.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.330
This is as written
in pseudocode,

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.480
but the idea is pretty simple.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.440
I'm given a dataset.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.580
It's not too large.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.710
The idea is to walk
through a number of trials,

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.130
number trials equal to
the size of the data set.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:51.170
And for each one, take the
data set or a copy of it,

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.640
and drop out one of the samples.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.305
So leave one out.

00:38:54.305 --> 00:38:55.930
Start off by leaving
out the first one,

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.280
then leaving out the
second one, and then

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.390
leaving out the third one.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:02.160
For each one of those training
sets, build the model.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.610
For example, by using
linear regression.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:10.340
And then test that model on that
data point that you left out.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.087
So leave out the first
one, build a model

00:39:12.087 --> 00:39:13.670
on all of the other
ones, and then see

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:15.461
how well that model
predicts the first one.

00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:17.150
Leave out the second
one, build a model

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:18.350
using all of them
but the second one,

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.016
see how well it
predicts the second one.

00:39:20.016 --> 00:39:21.946
And just average
the result. Works

00:39:21.946 --> 00:39:23.570
when you don't have
a really large data

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:25.100
set, because it
won't take too long.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:30.150
But it's a nice way of
actually testing validation.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.130
If the data set's
a lot bigger, you

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.420
can still use the same idea.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.990
You can use what's
called, k-fold.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:40.730
Divide the data set up
into k equal sized chunks.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:41.700
Leave one of them out.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.880
Use the rest to build the model.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.770
And then use that
model to predict

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.300
that first chunk you left out.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.640
Leave out the second
chunk, and keep doing it.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.320
Same idea, but now
with groups of things

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.270
rather than just leaving
those single data points.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:57.790
All right, the other way
you can deal with it,

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.070
which has a nice
effect to it, is

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.700
to use what's called,
repeated random sampling.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.710
OK, start out with
some data set.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.210
And what I'm going
to do here is I'm

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.001
going to run through
some number of trials.

00:40:09.001 --> 00:40:10.090
I'm going to call that, k.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:13.480
But I'm also going to pick
some number of random samples

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.650
from the data set.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.410
Usually, I think,
and as I recall,

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:20.470
it is somewhere between
reserving 20% to 50%

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.250
of the samples.

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:25.630
But the idea is again, walk
over all of those k trials.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:29.290
And in each one, pick
out at random n elements

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.820
for the test set.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.920
Use the remainder
is the training set.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.990
Build the model on
the training set.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:38.180
And then apply that
model to the test set.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.730
So rather than doing
k-fold, where I select k,

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.080
in turn, and keep them.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.450
This is just randomly selecting
which ones to pull out.

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.960
So I'm going to show
you one last example.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.400
Let's look at that idea of,
I don't have a model here.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.400
I want to use this idea
of cross-validation

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.390
to try and figure out what's
the best possible model.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.250
And for this, I'm going to
use a different data set.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.230
The data set here
is I want to model

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.810
or the task here is
I want to try model

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.510
how the mean daily high
temperature in the US

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:14.060
has varied over about a 55
year period, from '61 to 2015.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.280
Got a set of data.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.540
It's mean-- sorry, the daily
high for every day of the year

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.839
through that entire period.

00:41:19.839 --> 00:41:21.380
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.249
to compute the means for
each year and plot them out.

00:41:24.249 --> 00:41:26.290
And then I'm going to try
and fit models to them.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.430
And in particular,
I'm going to take

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:30.590
a set of different
dimensionalities,

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.477
linear, quadratic, cubic,
quartic And in each case,

00:41:34.477 --> 00:41:36.060
I'm going to run
through a trial where

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.142
I train on one half of the
data, test on the other.

00:41:39.142 --> 00:41:41.100
There again, is that idea
of seeing how well it

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.480
predicts other data.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.110
Record the coefficient
of determination.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.370
And do that and
get out an average,

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:50.670
and report what I get as the
mean for each of those values

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:53.810
across each dimensionality.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.630
OK, here we go.

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.212
Set a code that's
pretty easy to see.

00:41:57.212 --> 00:41:59.170
Hopefully, you can just
look at it and grok it.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.660
We start off with
a boring class,

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.086
which Professor guttag suggests
refers to this lecture.

00:42:04.086 --> 00:42:04.710
But it doesn't.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:07.126
This may be a boring lecture,
but it's not a boring class.

00:42:07.126 --> 00:42:08.580
This is a great class.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.800
And boy, those jokes are
really awful, aren't they?

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.910
But here we go.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:15.810
Simple class that
builds temperature data.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:19.800
This reads in some information,
splits it up, and basically,

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.280
records the high for the day and
the year in which I got that.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.020
So for each day, I've got a
high temperature for that day.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.540
I'm going to give you back the
high temperature and the year

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.456
in which it was recorded,
because I don't care

00:42:30.456 --> 00:42:32.590
whether it was in
January or June.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:35.480
A little function
that opens up a file.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.260
We've actually given you a file,
if you want to go look at it.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.380
And simply walk through
the file reading it in

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:45.200
and returning a big list
of all those data objects.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.140
OK, then what I
want to do is I want

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.545
to get the mean high
temperature for each year.

00:42:52.545 --> 00:42:54.920
Given that data, I'm going to
set up a dictionary called,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.545
years.

00:42:55.545 --> 00:42:57.920
I'm just going to run through
a loop through all the data

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.280
points, where in the
dictionary, under that year.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.430
So there a data point.

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:04.910
I use the method get
year to get out the year.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:09.350
At that point, I add in the
high temperature corresponding

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:11.110
to that data point.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:13.090
And I'm using that nice
little try except loop.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.881
I'll do that, unless
I haven't had anything

00:43:14.881 --> 00:43:17.510
yet for this year, in
which case this'll fail.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.260
And I'll simply store the
first one in as a list.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.510
So after I've run through
this loop in the dictionary,

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.759
under the year, I have a
list of the high temperatures

00:43:24.759 --> 00:43:27.201
for each day associated with it.

00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:27.700
Excuse me.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.970
And then I can just
compute the average, that

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.100
is for each year in the years.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.150
I get that value.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.912
I add them up.

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:35.620
I get the length.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.369
I divide them out.

00:43:36.369 --> 00:43:39.229
And I store that in as the
average high temperature

00:43:39.229 --> 00:43:39.770
for the year.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.000
Now I can plot it.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.310
Get the data, get
out the information

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.460
by computing those yearly
means, run through a little loop

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.460
that basically, in the x values,
puts in the year, in the y

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.180
values, puts in the
high temperature.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.250
And I can do a plot.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:02.830
And if I do that, I get that.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.700
I'll let you run this yourself.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.245
Now this is a little bit
deceptive, because of the scale

00:44:09.245 --> 00:44:09.870
I've used here.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.150
But nonetheless, it
shows, in the US,

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.581
over a 55 year period,
the mean high day--

00:44:15.581 --> 00:44:16.080
I'm sorry.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.320
The mean daily high has
gone from about 15.5

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.740
degrees Celsius up
to about 17 and 1/2.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.150
So what's changed?

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.390
Now the question is,
how could I model this?

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.280
Could I actually
get a model that

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.100
would give me a sense
of how this is changing?

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.250
And that's why I'm going
to use cross-validation.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:41.510
I'm going to run through a
number of trials, 10 trials.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.790
I'm going to try and fit
four different models,

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:47.730
linear, quadratic,
cubic, quartic.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.822
And for each of
these dimensions,

00:44:49.822 --> 00:44:51.780
I'm going to get out a
set of r-squared values.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:56.850
So I'm just going to initialize
that dictionary. an empty list.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:59.490
Now here is how I'm
going to do this.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:00.554
Got a list of x-values.

00:45:00.554 --> 00:45:01.220
Those are years.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.360
Got a list of y values.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.280
Those are average
highs, daily highs.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.730
I'm going to create a
list of random samples.

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.840
So if you haven't seen this
before, random.sample says,

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.880
given this iterator,
which you can think

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.910
of as the collection
from 0 up to n minus 1,

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:23.620
it's going to select this many
or half of them, in this case,

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.810
of those numbers at random.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:30.310
So if I give it 0 up to 9,
and I say, pick five of them,

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.970
it will, at random, give me
back 5 of those 10 numbers,

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.110
with no duplicates.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:38.270
Ah, that's nice.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:39.710
Because now notice
what I can do.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.440
I'm going to set up a training--

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.320
sorry, an x and y values
for a training set, x

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.670
and y values for the test set.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:47.586
And I'm just going to
run through a loop here,

00:45:47.586 --> 00:45:51.490
where if this index
is in that list,

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.600
I'll stick it in
the training set.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.290
Otherwise, I'll stick
it in the test set.

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.380
And then I just return them.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.140
So this is a really nice
way of, at random, just

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:08.520
splitting the data set into a
test set and a training set.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.180
And then finally, I can run
over the number of trials

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.500
I want to deal with.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.330
In each case, get a
different training

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.460
and test set, at random.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.640
And then, for each
dimension, do the fit.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.550
There's polyfit on the training
x and training y values

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:24.720
in that dimension.

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.670
Gives you back a model.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.370
I could just check to see how
well the training set gets,

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.250
but I really want to look
at, given that model,

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:37.120
how well does polyval
predict the test set, right?

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.640
The model will say, here's
what I expect is the values.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.710
I'm going to compare
that to the actual values

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.740
that I saw from
the training set,

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:48.341
computing that r squared
value and adding it in.

00:46:48.341 --> 00:46:49.840
And then the last
of this just says,

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.718
I'll run this through
a set of examples.

00:46:53.718 --> 00:46:56.880
OK, here's what
happens if I do that.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.992
I'm not going to run it,
although the code will run it.

00:46:59.992 --> 00:47:01.700
Let me, again, remind
you what I'm doing.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.190
I got a big set
of data I'm going

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.650
to pick out at
random, subsets of it,

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:09.380
build the model on one part,
test it on the other part.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:16.640
And if I run it, I get a linear
fit, quadratic fit, cubic fit,

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.240
and a quartic fit.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.092
And here's the standard
deviation of those samples.

00:47:21.092 --> 00:47:22.550
Remember, I've got
multiple trials.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.050
I've got 10 trials,
in this case.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.270
So this gives me the
average over those trials.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.150
And this tells me
how much they vary.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:32.850
What can I conclude from this?

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.950
Well, I would argue that
the linear fit's probably

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.570
the winner here.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:37.530
Goes back to Einstein.

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:41.550
I want the simplest possible
model that accounts for it.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.700
And you can see it's got the
highest r-squared value, which

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.800
is already a good sign.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.650
It's got the smallest
deviation across the trials,

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:52.170
which says it's probably
a pretty good fit.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.410
And it's the simplest model.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:58.250
So linear sounds like
a pretty good fit.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:01.910
Now, why should we run multiple
data sets to test this?

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:04.940
I ran 10 trials of each
one of these dimensions.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.280
Why bother with it?

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.440
Well, notice that
those deviations--

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.547
I'll go back to it here--

00:48:11.547 --> 00:48:12.380
they're pretty good.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.860
They're about an
order of magnitude

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.350
less than the actual mean,
which says they're pretty tight,

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:20.032
but they're still
reasonable size.

00:48:20.032 --> 00:48:22.240
And that suggests that,
while there's good agreement,

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.130
the deviations are
large enough that you

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:28.330
could see a range of
variation across the trials.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.617
So in fact, if I had
just run one trial,

00:48:31.617 --> 00:48:32.700
I could have been screwed.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.771
Sorry, oh-- sorry, pick your
favorite [INAUDIBLE] here.

00:48:35.771 --> 00:48:37.270
[? Hose ?] is a
Canadian expression,

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:39.180
in case you haven't seen it.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.300
Here are the r-squared
values for each trial

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.004
of the linear fit.

00:48:44.004 --> 00:48:45.920
And you can see the mean
comes up pretty well.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.140
But notice, if I'd
only run one trial

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:52.470
and I happened to get
that one, oh, darn.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.300
That's a really low
r-squared value.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.430
And we might have
decided, in this case,

00:48:56.430 --> 00:49:00.730
a different conclusion, that the
linear fit was not a good fit.

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:04.230
So this is a way of saying,
even in a random sampling, run

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:06.630
multiple trials,
because it lets you

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:09.480
get statistics on those
trials, as well as statistics

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.700
within each trial.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.450
So with any trial, I'm
doing a whole bunch

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.904
of different random samples
on measuring those values.

00:49:14.904 --> 00:49:16.320
And then, across
those trials, I'm

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.744
seeing what the deviation is.

00:49:18.744 --> 00:49:20.410
I'm going to hope my
machine comes back,

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:24.030
because what I want to do
is then pull this together.

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:25.090
What have we done?

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.340
Something you're going to use.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.550
We've seen how you can
use linear regression

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:33.800
to fit a curve to data,
2D, 3D, 6D, however big

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.330
the data set is.

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:37.790
It gives us a mapping from
the independent values

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:39.440
to the dependent values.

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.560
And that can then be
used to predict values

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.390
associated with the
independent values

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:46.340
that we haven't seen yet.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.070
That leads, naturally,
to both a way

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:52.430
to measure, which is r
squared, but especially

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:55.700
to see that we want to look
at how well does that model

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.300
actually predict new data,
because that lets us select

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:03.470
the simplest model we can
that accounts for the data,

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:06.140
but predicts new data
in an effective way.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.610
And that complexity
can either be

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:11.510
based on theory, in the case of
Hooke, or in more likely cases,

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.180
by doing cross-validation
to try and figure out

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.640
which one is the
simplest model that

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.510
still does a good
job of predicting out

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:21.980
of data behavior.
