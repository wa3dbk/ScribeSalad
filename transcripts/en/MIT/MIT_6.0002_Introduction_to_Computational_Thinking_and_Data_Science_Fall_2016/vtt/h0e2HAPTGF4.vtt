00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:31.640
ERIC GRIMSON: OK.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.480
Welcome back.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.040
You know, it's that
time a term when

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.950
we're all kind of doing this.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.980
So let me see if I can get a few
smiles by simply noting to you

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.717
that two weeks from
today is the last class.

00:00:45.717 --> 00:00:48.050
Should be worth at least a
little bit of a smile, right?

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.500
Professor Guttag is smiling.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.030
He likes that idea.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.830
You're almost there.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.670
What are we doing for the
last couple of lectures?

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.452
We're talking about
linear regression.

00:00:58.452 --> 00:00:59.910
And I just want to
remind you, this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.690
was the idea of I have
some experimental data.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.360
Case of a spring where I put
different weights on measure

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.620
displacements.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.640
And regression was giving
us a way of deducing a model

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.495
to fit that data.

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:14.947
And In some cases it was easy.

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:17.280
We knew, for example, it was
going to be a linear model.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.320
We found the best line
that would fit that data.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.110
In some cases, we said
we could use validation

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.960
to actually let us explore
to find the best model that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.580
would fit it, whether a
linear, a quadratic, a cubic,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.500
some higher order thing.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.340
So we'll be using that to
deduce something about a model.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.800
That's a nice segue into
the topic for the next three

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.680
lectures, the last big
topic of the class,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.897
which is machine learning.

00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:46.480
And I'm going to argue, you can
debate whether that's actually

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.510
an example of learning.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.135
But it has many of
the elements that we

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:52.700
want to talk about when we
talk about machine learning.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.210
So as always, there's
a reading assignment.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.500
Chapter 22 of the book gives
you a good start on this,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.160
and it will follow
up with other pieces.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.072
And I want to start
by basically outlining

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:04.030
what we're going to do.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.404
And I'm going to
begin by saying,

00:02:05.404 --> 00:02:09.130
as I'm sure you're aware,
this is a huge topic.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.760
I've listed just five
subjects in course six

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.770
that all focus on
machine learning.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.900
And that doesn't
include other subjects

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.030
where learning is
a central part.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.360
So natural language processing,
computational biology,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.390
computer vision
robotics all rely today,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.070
heavily on machine learning.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.050
And you'll see those in
those subjects as well.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.560
So we're not going to
compress five subjects

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.490
into three lectures.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.920
But what we are going to do
is give you the introduction.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.580
We're going to start by talking
about the basic concepts

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.810
of machine learning.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.780
The idea of having examples, and
how do you talk about features

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.610
representing those
examples, how do

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.650
you measure distances
between them,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.080
and use the notion
of distance to try

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.210
and group similar
things together as a way

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.450
of doing machine learning.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.330
And we're going to
look, as a consequence,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.530
of two different standard
ways of doing learning.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.555
One, we call
classification methods.

00:03:01.555 --> 00:03:02.930
Example we're
going to see, there

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.110
is something called
"k nearest neighbor"

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.390
and the second class,
called clustering methods.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.750
Classification works
well when I have what

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.090
we would call labeled data.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.070
I know labels on my
examples, and I'm

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.200
going to use that to
try and define classes

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.510
that I can learn, and
clustering working well,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.930
when I don't have labeled data.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.138
And we'll see what that
means in a couple of minutes.

00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:27.500
But we're going to give
you an early view of this.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.360
Unless Professor Guttag
changes his mind,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.760
we're probably not going to
show you the current really

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.500
sophisticated machine
learning methods

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.870
like convolutional neural
nets or deep learning,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.040
things you'll read
about in the news.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.720
But you're going to
get a sense of what's

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.640
behind those, by looking
at what we do when we

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.890
talk about learning algorithms.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.640
Before I do it, I want
to point out to you

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.200
just how prevalent this is.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.870
And I'm going to admit
with my gray hair,

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.530
I started working in AI in
1975 when machine learning was

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.030
a pretty simple thing to do.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.470
And it's been
fascinating to watch

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.150
over 40 years, the change.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.550
And if you think about it, just
think about where you see it.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.730
AlphaGo, machine learning based
system from Google that beat

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.040
a world-class level Go player.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.980
Chess has already been conquered
by computers for a while.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.020
Go now belongs to computers.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.930
Best Go players in the
world are computers.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.519
I'm sure many of
you use Netflix.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.660
Any recommendation
system, Netflix,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.770
Amazon, pick your favorite, uses
a machine learning algorithm

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.481
to suggest things for you.

00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.730
And in fact, you've probably
seen it on Google, right?

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.560
The ads that pop
up on Google are

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.690
coming from a machine
learning algorithm that's

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.220
looking at your preferences.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.900
Scary thought.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.980
Drug discovery, character
recognition-- the post office

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.975
does character recognition of
handwritten characters using

00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:44.350
a machine learning algorithm
and a computer vision system

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.330
behind it.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.190
You probably don't
know this company.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.260
It's actually an MIT
spin-off called Two Sigma,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.060
it's a hedge fund in New York.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.970
They heavily use AI and
machine learning techniques.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.947
And two years ago, their
fund returned a 56% return.

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:03.280
I wish I'd invested in the fund.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.850
I don't have the kinds
of millions you need,

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.370
but that's an impressive return.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.546
56% return on your
money in one year.

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:11.170
Last year they didn't
do quite as well,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.140
but they do extremely well using
machine learning techniques.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.550
Siri.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.680
Another great MIT
company called Mobileye

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.110
that does computer vision
systems with a heavy machine

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.080
learning component that is
used in assistive driving

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.450
and will be used in
completely autonomous driving.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.520
It will do things like
kick in your brakes

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.067
if you're closing too fast
on the car in front of you,

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:33.650
which is going to
be really bad for me

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.600
because I drive
like a Bostonian.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.030
And it would be
kicking in constantly.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.530
Face recognition.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.530
Facebook uses this,
many other systems

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.070
do to both detect
and recognize faces.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.720
IBM Watson-- cancer diagnosis.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.390
These are all just
examples of machine

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.820
learning being used everywhere.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.870
And it really is.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.720
I've only picked nine.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.280
So what is it?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.140
I'm going to make an
obnoxious statement.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.695
You're now used to that.

00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:05.070
I'm going to claim
that you could

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.420
argue that almost every computer
program learns something.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.640
But the level of learning
really varies a lot.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.150
So if you think back to
the first lecture in 60001,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.630
we showed you Newton's method
for computing square roots.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.910
And you could argue,
you'd have to stretch it,

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.280
but you could argue
that that method learns

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.260
something about how to
compute square roots.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.986
In fact, you could generalize
it to roots of any order power.

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:31.110
But it really didn't learn.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.440
I really had to program it.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.960
All right.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.500
Think about last week when we
talked about linear regression.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.810
Now it starts to feel
a little bit more

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.040
like a learning algorithm.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.998
Because what did we do?

00:06:41.998 --> 00:06:44.550
We gave you a set
of data points,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.200
mass displacement data points.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.650
And then we showed you how
the computer could essentially

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.290
fit a curve to that data point.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.100
And it was, in some sense,
learning a model for that data

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.960
that it could then use
to predict behavior.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.425
In other situations.

00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:01.800
And that's getting
closer to what

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.510
we would like when we
think about a machine

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.301
learning algorithm.

00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:10.460
We'd like to have program that
can learn from experience,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.280
something that it can then
use to deduce new facts.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.980
Now it's been a problem in
AI for a very long time.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.080
And I love this quote.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.530
It's from a gentleman
named Art Samuel.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.794
1959 is the quote
in which he says,

00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:26.210
his definition of
machine learning

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.130
is the field of study
that gives computers

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.391
the ability to learn without
being explicitly programmed.

00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:33.890
And I think many
people would argue,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.080
he wrote the first such program.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.710
It learned from experience.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.292
In his case, it played checkers.

00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:42.250
Kind of shows you how
the field has progressed.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.610
But we started with checkers,
we got to chess, we now do Go.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:46.570
But it played checkers.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.240
It beat national level
players, most importantly,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.570
it learned to
improve its methods

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.630
by watching how it did in games
and then inferring something

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.492
to change what it thought
about as it did that.

00:07:58.492 --> 00:07:59.950
Samuel did a bunch
of other things.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.940
I just highlighted one.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.170
You may see in a
follow on course,

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.295
he invented what's called
Alpha-Beta Pruning, which

00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:06.896
is a really useful
technique for doing search.

00:08:06.896 --> 00:08:10.390
But the idea is, how can
we have the computer learn

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.444
without being
explicitly programmed?

00:08:13.444 --> 00:08:14.860
And one way to
think about this is

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.440
to think about the difference
between how we would normally

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.870
program and what we would
like from a machine learning

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.692
algorithm.

00:08:21.692 --> 00:08:23.650
Normal programming, I
know you're not convinced

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.441
there's such a thing
as normal programming,

00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:27.820
but if you think of
traditional programming,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.100
what's the process?

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.610
I write a program that
I input to the computer

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.340
so that it can then
take data and produce

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.409
some appropriate output.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.750
And the square root finder
really sits there, right?

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.480
I wrote code for using Newton
method to find a square root,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.000
and then it gave me the
process of given any number,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.250
I'll give you the square root.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.780
But if you think about
what we did last time,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.863
it was a little different.

00:08:53.863 --> 00:08:56.900
And in fact, in a machine
learning approach,

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.600
the idea is that I'm going
to give the computer output.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.920
I'm going to give it examples of
what I want the program to do,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.380
labels on data,
characterizations

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.380
of different classes of things.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.860
And what I want
the computer to do

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.580
is, given that characterization
of output and data,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.500
I wanted that machine
learning algorithm

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.480
to actually produce
for me a program,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.330
a program that I can
then use to infer

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.370
new information about things.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.442
And that creates, if you
like, a really nice loop

00:09:29.442 --> 00:09:31.400
where I can have the
machine learning algorithm

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.190
learn the program
which I can then use

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.190
to solve some other problem.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.260
That would be really
great if we could do it.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.340
And as I suggested, that
curve-fitting algorithm

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.870
is a simple version of that.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.690
It learned a model for the
data, which I could then

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.820
use to label any other
instances of the data

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.670
or predict what I would see in
terms of spring displacement

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.100
as I changed the masses.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.850
So that's the kind of idea
we're going to explore.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.050
If we want to learn
things, we could also

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.200
ask, so how do you learn?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.537
And how should a computer learn?

00:10:02.537 --> 00:10:05.120
Well, for you as a human, there
are a couple of possibilities.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.140
This is the boring one.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.900
This is the old style
way of doing it, right?

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.910
Memorize facts.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.630
Memorize as many facts as you
can and hope that we ask you

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.190
on the final exam
instances of those facts,

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.100
as opposed to some other
facts you haven't memorized.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.580
This is, if you think way
back to the first lecture,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.840
an example of declarative
knowledge, statements of truth.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.370
Memorize as many as you can.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.620
Have Wikipedia in
your back pocket.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.280
Better way to learn is to
be able to infer, to deduce

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.980
new information from old.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.630
And if you think
about this, this

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.870
gets closer to what we
called imperative knowledge--

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.370
ways to deduce new things.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.100
Now, in the first
cases, we built

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.510
that in when we wrote that
program to do square roots.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.430
But what we'd like in
a learning algorithm

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.760
is to have much more like
that generalization idea.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.880
We're interested in
extending our capabilities

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.840
to write programs that can
infer useful information

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.030
from implicit
patterns in the data.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.310
So not something
explicitly built

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.100
like that comparison of
weights and displacements,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.350
but actually implicit
patterns in the data,

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.740
and have the algorithm figure
out what those patterns are,

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.780
and use those to
generate a program you

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.170
can use to infer new
data about objects,

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.300
about string
displacements, whatever

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.401
it is you're trying to do.

00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:27.900
OK.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.200
So the idea then,
the basic paradigm

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.480
that we're going
to see, is we're

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.090
going to give the
system some training

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.130
data, some observations.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.300
We did that last time with
just the spring displacements.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.044
We're going to then
try and have a way

00:11:43.044 --> 00:11:44.960
to figure out, how do
we write code, how do we

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.510
write a program, a system
that will infer something

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.290
about the process that
generated the data?

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.269
And then from
that, we want to be

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:55.310
able to use that to make
predictions about things

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.860
we haven't seen before.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.610
So again, I want to
drive home this point.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:04.830
If you think about it, the
spring example fit that model.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.340
I gave you a set of
data, spatial deviations

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.720
relative to mass displacements.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.040
For different masses, how
far did the spring move?

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.550
I then inferred something
about the underlying process.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.660
In the first case, I
said I know it's linear,

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.480
but let me figure out what
the actual linear equation is.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.150
What's the spring constant
associated with it?

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.820
And based on that result,
I got a piece of code

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.120
I could use to predict
new displacements.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.860
So it's got all of those
elements, training data,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.190
an inference engine,
and then the ability

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.140
to use that to make
new predictions.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.330
But that's a very simple
kind of learning setting.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.920
So the more common
one is one I'm

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.450
going to use as
an example, which

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.210
is, when I give you
a set of examples,

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.360
those examples have some
data associated with them,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.330
some features and some labels.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.980
For each example,
I might say this

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.960
is a particular kind of thing.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.102
This other one is
another kind of thing.

00:12:58.102 --> 00:12:59.560
And what I want to
do is figure out

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.930
how to do inference on
labeling new things.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.524
So it's not just, what's the
displacement of the mass,

00:13:04.524 --> 00:13:05.440
it's actually a label.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.540
And I'm going to use one
of my favorite examples.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.970
I'm a big New
England Patriots fan,

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.507
if you're not, my apologies.

00:13:11.507 --> 00:13:13.090
But I'm going to use
football players.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.040
So I'm going to show
you in a second,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.830
I'm going to give you a set of
examples of football players.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.222
The label is the
position they play.

00:13:20.222 --> 00:13:22.180
And the data, well, it
could be lots of things.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.920
We're going to use
height and weight.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.660
But what we want
to do is then see

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.080
how would we come up with
a way of characterizing

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.170
the implicit pattern of how
does weight and height predict

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.630
the kind of position
this player could play.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.290
And then come up
with an algorithm

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.515
that will predict the
position of new players.

00:13:38.515 --> 00:13:39.940
We'll do the draft
for next year.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.670
Where do we want them to play?

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.500
That's the paradigm.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.910
Set of observations, potentially
labeled, potentially not.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.520
Think about how do we do
inference to find a model.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.000
And then how do we use that
model to make predictions.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.429
What we're going
to see, and we're

00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:57.970
going to see multiple
examples today,

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.500
is that that
learning can be done

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.870
in one of two very broad ways.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.460
The first one is called
supervised learning.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.140
And in that case,
for every new example

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.850
I give you as part
of the training data,

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.470
I have a label on it.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.554
I know the kind of thing it is.

00:14:13.554 --> 00:14:15.220
And what I'm going
to do is look for how

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.400
do I find a rule that would
predict the label associated

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.610
with unseen input based
on those examples.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.010
It's supervised because I
know what the labeling is.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.750
Second kind, if
this is supervised,

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.820
the obvious other one
is called unsupervised.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.210
In that case, I'm just going to
give you a bunch of examples.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.550
But I don't know the labels
associated with them.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.140
I'm going to just
try and find what

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.020
are the natural ways
to group those examples

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.680
together into different models.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.090
And in some cases, I may know
how many models are there.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.923
In some cases, I may
want to just say what's

00:14:45.923 --> 00:14:48.770
the best grouping I can find.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.760
OK.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.929
What I'm going to do today
is not a lot of code.

00:14:52.929 --> 00:14:55.470
I was expecting cheers for that,
John, but I didn't get them.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.240
Not a lot of code.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.250
What I'm going to do
is show you basically,

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.060
the intuitions behind
doing this learning.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.560
And I"m going to start with my
New England Patriots example.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.880
So here are some data points
about current Patriots players.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.120
And I've got two
kinds of positions.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.240
I've got receivers,
and I have linemen.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.090
And each one is just labeled by
the name, the height in inches,

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.650
and the weight in pounds.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.700
OK?

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.590
Five of each.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.370
If I plot those on a
two dimensional plot,

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.260
this is what I get.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:26.860
OK?

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.320
No big deal.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.490
What am I trying to do?

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.370
I'm trying to learn, are
their characteristics

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.220
that distinguish the two
classes from one another?

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.200
And in the unlabeled
case, all I have

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.240
are just a set of examples.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.220
So what I want to
do is decide what

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.240
makes two players similar
with the goal of seeing,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.260
can I separate this
distribution into two or more

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.430
natural groups.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.120
Similar is a distance measure.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.118
It says how do I take
two examples with values

00:15:56.118 --> 00:15:57.493
or features
associated, and we're

00:15:57.493 --> 00:15:59.500
going to decide how
far apart are they?

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.770
And in the unlabeled case, the
simple way to do it is to say,

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.216
if I know that there are
at least k groups there--

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.090
in this case, I'm going
to tell you there are

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.800
two different groups there--

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.830
how could I decide how
best to cluster things

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.470
together so that all the
examples in one group

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.410
are close to each other, all
the examples in the other group

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.190
are close to each other, and
they're reasonably far apart.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.780
There are many ways to do it.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.260
I'm going to show you one.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.920
It's a very standard way, and
it works, basically, as follows.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.340
If all I know is that
there are two groups there,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.080
I'm going to start
by just picking

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.497
two examples as my exemplars.

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:38.330
Pick them at random.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.410
Actually at random is not great.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.820
I don't want to pick too
closely to each other.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.528
I'm going to try and
pick them far apart.

00:16:42.528 --> 00:16:44.920
But I pick two examples
as my exemplars.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.540
And for all the other
examples in the training data,

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.862
I say which one
is it closest to.

00:16:50.862 --> 00:16:52.820
What I'm going to try
and do is create clusters

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.590
with the property
that the distances

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.860
between all of the examples
of that cluster are small.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.932
The average distance is small.

00:16:59.932 --> 00:17:01.390
And see if I can
find clusters that

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.250
gets the average distance
for both clusters

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.380
as small as possible.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.099
This algorithm works by
picking two examples,

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.290
clustering all the other
examples by simply saying

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:15.480
put it in the group to which
it's closest to that example.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.369
Once I've got
those clusters, I'm

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.160
going to find the median
element of that group.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.060
Not mean, but median, what's
the one closest to the center?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.057
And treat those as exemplars
and repeat the process.

00:17:28.057 --> 00:17:30.015
And I'll just do it either
some number of times

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:33.570
or until I don't get any
change in the process.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.490
So it's clustering
based on distance.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.734
And we'll come back to
distance in a second.

00:17:38.734 --> 00:17:40.650
So here's what would
have my football players.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.770
If I just did this
based on weight,

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.400
there's the natural
dividing line.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.865
And it kind of makes sense.

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:47.500
All right?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.194
These three are
obviously clustered,

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.610
and again, it's
just on this axis.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.990
They're all down here.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.580
These seven are at
a different place.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.530
There's a natural
dividing line there.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:01.790
If I were to do it based
on height, not as clean.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.410
This is what my
algorithm came up

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.360
with as the best
dividing line here,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.140
meaning that these four,
again, just based on this axis

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.550
are close together.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.170
These six are close together.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.900
But it's not nearly as clean.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.650
And that's part of the
issue we'll look at

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.350
is how do I find
the best clusters.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.440
If I use both
height and weight, I

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.570
get that, which was actually
kind of nice, right?

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.780
Those three cluster together.
they're near each other,

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.910
in terms of just
distance in the plane.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.830
Those seven are near each other.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.550
There's a nice, natural
dividing line through here.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:40.240
And in fact, that
gives me a classifier.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.360
This line is the
equidistant line

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.460
between the centers
of those two clusters.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.650
Meaning, any point
along this line

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.750
is the same distance to
the center of that group

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.570
as it is to that group.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.620
And so any new example,
if it's above the line,

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.080
I would say gets that label,
if it's below the line,

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.211
gets that label.

00:18:58.211 --> 00:18:59.710
In a second, we'll
come back to look

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.168
at how do we measure
the distances,

00:19:01.168 --> 00:19:02.830
but the idea here
is pretty simple.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.530
I want to find groupings
near each other

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.110
and far apart from
the other group.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.890
Now suppose I actually knew
the labels on these players.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.980
These are the receivers.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.060
Those are the linemen.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.880
And for those of you
who are football fans,

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.710
you can figure it out, right?

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:24.918
Those are the two tight ends.

00:19:24.918 --> 00:19:26.127
They are much bigger.

00:19:26.127 --> 00:19:28.460
I think that's Bennett and
that's Gronk if you're really

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.306
a big Patriots fan.

00:19:29.306 --> 00:19:31.430
But those are tight ends,
those are wide receivers,

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.096
and it's going to
come back in a second,

00:19:33.096 --> 00:19:34.400
but there are the labels.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.830
Now what I want to do is say,
if I could take advantage

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.280
of knowing the labels, how
would I divide these groups up?

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.770
And that's kind of easy to see.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.870
Basic idea, in this
case, is if I've

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.640
got labeled groups
in that feature

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.080
space, what I want to do is
find a subsurface that naturally

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.220
divides that space.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.810
Now subsurface is a fancy word.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.460
It says, in the
two-dimensional case,

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.280
I want to know
what's the best line,

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.070
if I can find a single line,
that separates all the examples

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.820
with one label from all the
examples of the second label.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.560
We'll see that, if the
examples are well separated,

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.890
this is easy to
do, and it's great.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.600
But in some cases,
it's going to be

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.790
more complicated because
some of the examples

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.872
may be very close
to one another.

00:20:15.872 --> 00:20:17.330
And that's going
to raise a problem

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.040
that you saw last lecture.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.900
I want to avoid overfitting.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.510
I don't want to create a
really complicated surface

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.870
to separate things.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.560
And so we may have to
tolerate a few incorrectly

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.716
labeled things, if
we can't pull it out.

00:20:30.716 --> 00:20:32.590
And as you already
figured out, in this case,

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.020
with the labeled data,
there's the best fitting line

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.460
right there.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.090
Anybody over 280 pounds is
going to be a great lineman.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:45.250
Anybody under 280 pounds is
more likely to be a receiver.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:45.789
OK.

00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:47.830
So I've got two different
ways of trying to think

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.913
about doing this labeling.

00:20:48.913 --> 00:20:52.160
I'm going to come back to
both of them in a second.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.490
Now suppose I add
in some new data.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.879
I want to label new instances.

00:20:57.879 --> 00:21:00.170
Now these are actually players
of a different position.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.230
These are running backs.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.530
But I say, all I know about
is receivers and linemen.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.510
I get these two new data points.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.610
I'd like to know, are
they more likely to be

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.430
a receiver or a linemen?

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.130
And there's the data
for these two gentlemen.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.640
So if I go back to
now plotting them,

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.210
oh you notice one of the issues.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.110
So there are my linemen, the
red ones are my receivers,

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.860
the two black dots are
the two running backs.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.500
And notice right here.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.550
It's going to be really
hard to separate those two

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.707
examples from one another.

00:21:32.707 --> 00:21:34.040
They are so close to each other.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.706
And that's going to
be one of the things

00:21:35.706 --> 00:21:37.040
we have to trade off.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.240
But if I think about using
what I learned as a classifier

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.030
with unlabeled data, there
were my two clusters.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.420
Now you see, oh, I've got
an interesting example.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.690
This new example I would
say is clearly more

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.240
like a receiver than a lineman.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.660
But that one there, unclear.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.180
Almost exactly lies
along that dividing line

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.310
between those two clusters.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.860
And I would either say, I
want to rethink the clustering

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.610
or I want to say, you know what?

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.270
As I know, maybe there
aren't two clusters here.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.560
Maybe there are three.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.270
And I want to classify
them a little differently.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.570
So I'll come back to that.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.540
On the other hand, if I
had used the labeled data,

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.340
there was my dividing line.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.960
This is really easy.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.150
Both of those new
examples are clearly

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:25.320
below the dividing line.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.240
They are clearly
examples that I would

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.910
categorize as being
more like receivers

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.380
than they are like linemen.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.880
And I know it's a
football example.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.130
If you don't like football,
pick another example.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.080
But you get the
sense of why I can

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.500
use the data in a labeled
case and the unlabeled case

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.772
to come up with different
ways of building the clusters.

00:22:45.772 --> 00:22:47.480
So what we're going
to do over the next 2

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.190
and 1/2 lectures is
look at how can we

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.550
write code to learn that way
of separating things out?

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.059
We're going to learn models
based on unlabeled data.

00:22:57.059 --> 00:22:59.350
That's the case where I don't
know what the labels are,

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.890
by simply trying to find ways
to cluster things together

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.830
nearby, and then use the
clusters to assign labels

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.020
to new data.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.820
And we're going to learn models
by looking at labeled data

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.510
and seeing how do we best come
up with a way of separating

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.230
with a line or a plane or a
collection of lines, examples

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.320
from one group, from
examples of the other group.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.464
With the acknowledgment that
we want to avoid overfitting,

00:23:23.464 --> 00:23:25.630
we don't want to create a
really complicated system.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.127
And as a consequence,
we're going

00:23:27.127 --> 00:23:28.960
to have to make some
trade-offs between what

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.200
we call false positives
and false negatives.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.780
But the resulting classifier
can then label any new data

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.730
by just deciding where
you are with respect

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:37.730
to that separating line.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.020
So here's what you're going
to see over the next 2

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.930
and 1/2 lectures.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:49.510
Every machine learning method
has five essential components.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.310
We need to decide what's
the training data,

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.370
and how are we going to evaluate
the success of that system.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.900
We've already seen
some examples of that.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.600
We need to decide
how are we going

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.560
to represent each instance
that we're giving it.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.190
I happened to choose height and
weight for football players.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.200
But I might have been better
off to pick average speed

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.210
or, I don't know, arm
length, something else.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.670
How do I figure out what
are the right features.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.820
And associated with that,
how do I measure distances

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.320
between those features?

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.096
How do I decide what's
close and what's not close?

00:24:20.096 --> 00:24:22.720
Maybe it should be different, in
terms of weight versus height,

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.290
for example.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.734
I need to make that decision.

00:24:24.734 --> 00:24:26.150
And those are the
two things we're

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.030
going to show you examples of
today, how to go through that.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.530
Starting next week,
Professor Guttag

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.430
is going to show you how you
take those and actually start

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.260
building more detailed versions
of measuring clustering,

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.560
measuring similarities to find
an objective function that you

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.830
want to minimize to decide what
is the best cluster to use.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.230
And then what is the best
optimization method you want

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.350
to use to learn that model.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.080
So let's start talking
about features.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.960
I've got a set of
examples, labeled or not.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.450
I need to decide what is it
about those examples that's

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.660
useful to use when I
want to decide what's

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.350
close to another thing or not.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.470
And one of the problems
is, if it was really easy,

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.600
it would be really easy.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.510
Features don't always
capture what you want.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.490
I'm going to belabor
that football analogy,

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.050
but why did I pick
height and weight.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.307
Because it was easy to find.

00:25:18.307 --> 00:25:20.640
You know, if you work for the
New England Patriots, what

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.900
is the thing that you really
look for when you're asking,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:23.660
what's the right feature?

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.660
It's probably some other
combination of things.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.810
So you, as a designer,
have to say what

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.952
are the features I want to use.

00:25:29.952 --> 00:25:31.410
That quote, by the
way, is from one

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.618
of the great statisticians
of the 20th century, which

00:25:33.618 --> 00:25:35.640
I think captures it well.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.630
So feature engineering,
as you, as a programmer,

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.030
comes down to deciding
both what are the features

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.480
I want to measure in that vector
that I'm going to put together,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.340
and how do I decide
relative ways to weight it?

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:55.520
So John, and Ana, and I
could have made our job

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.900
this term really easy
if we had sat down

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.900
at the beginning of the
term and said, you know,

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.270
we've taught this
course many times.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.686
We've got data
from, I don't know,

00:26:02.686 --> 00:26:05.650
John, thousands of students,
probably over this time.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.640
Let's just build a
little learning algorithm

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.127
that takes a set of data and
predicts your final grade.

00:26:11.127 --> 00:26:12.710
You don't have to
come to class, don't

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.670
have to go through
all the problems,

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.440
because we'll just
predict your final grade.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.356
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:26:16.356 --> 00:26:18.950
Make our job a little easier,
and you may or may not

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.930
like that idea.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.204
But I could think about
predicting that grade?

00:26:23.204 --> 00:26:24.620
Now why am I telling
this example.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.620
I was trying to see if I
could get a few smiles.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.750
I saw a couple of them there.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.780
But think about the features.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.961
What I measure?

00:26:31.961 --> 00:26:34.210
Actually, I'll put this on
John because it's his idea.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.930
What would he measure?

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:41.090
Well, GPA is probably not a
bad predictor of performance.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.650
You do well in other
classes, you're

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.140
likely to do well in this class.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.000
I'm going to use this
one very carefully.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.840
Prior programming experience
is at least a predictor,

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.549
but it is not a
perfect predictor.

00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:55.340
Those of you who haven't
programmed before,

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.320
in this class, you can still
do really well in this class.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.695
But it's an indication that
you've seen other programming

00:26:59.695 --> 00:27:01.580
languages.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.250
On the other hand, I don't
believe in astrology.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.890
So I don't think the month
in which you're born,

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.470
the astrological sign
under which you were born

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.500
has probably anything to do
with how well you'd program.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.304
I doubt that eye color
has anything to do

00:27:14.304 --> 00:27:15.470
with how well you'd program.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.178
You get the idea.

00:27:16.178 --> 00:27:19.730
Some features
matter, others don't.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.030
Now I could just throw all
the features in and hope that

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.610
the machine learning algorithm
sorts out those it wants

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.920
to keep from those it doesn't.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.560
But I remind you of that
idea of overfitting.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.570
If I do that,
there is the danger

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.900
that it will find some
correlation between birth

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.200
month, eye color, and GPA.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.030
And that's going to
lead to a conclusion

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.162
that we really don't like.

00:27:43.162 --> 00:27:44.620
By the way, in case
you're worried,

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.060
I can assure you
that Stu Schmill

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.860
in the dean of
admissions department

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.437
does not use machine
learning to pick you.

00:27:50.437 --> 00:27:52.270
He actually looks at a
whole bunch of things

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.180
because it's not easy to
replace him with a machine--

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.765
yet.

00:27:56.765 --> 00:27:57.370
All right.

00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:00.014
So what this says is
we need to think about

00:28:00.014 --> 00:28:01.180
how do we pick the features.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.638
And mostly, what
we're trying to do

00:28:02.638 --> 00:28:05.830
is to maximize something called
the signal to noise ratio.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.670
Maximize those features that
carry the most information,

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:12.580
and remove the ones that don't.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.410
So I want to show
you an example of how

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.530
you might think about this.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.965
I want to label reptiles.

00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:22.860
I want to come up with a
way of labeling animals as,

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.067
are they a reptile or not.

00:28:25.067 --> 00:28:26.400
And I give you a single example.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.560
With a single example,
you can't really do much.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.760
But from this example, I know
that a cobra, it lays eggs,

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.130
it has scales, it's
poisonous, it's cold blooded,

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.200
it has no legs,
and it's a reptile.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.834
So I could say my model
of a reptile is well,

00:28:39.834 --> 00:28:40.500
I'm not certain.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.990
I don't have enough data yet.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.330
But if I give you
a second example,

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.070
and it also happens
to be egg-laying,

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.740
have scales, poisonous,
cold blooded, no legs.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.720
There is my model, right?

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.959
Perfectly reasonable
model, whether I design it

00:28:53.959 --> 00:28:55.500
or a machine learning
algorithm would

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.210
do it says, if all of these are
true, label it as a reptile.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.110
OK?

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.366
And now I give you
a boa constrictor.

00:29:05.366 --> 00:29:07.260
Ah.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.790
It's a reptile.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.120
But it doesn't fit the model.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.760
And in particular,
it's not egg-laying,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.907
and it's not poisonous.

00:29:16.907 --> 00:29:18.240
So I've got to refine the model.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.990
Or the algorithm has
got to refine the model.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:21.960
And this, I want to remind you,
is looking at the features.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.910
So I started out
with five features.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.870
This doesn't fit.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.730
So probably what I
should do is reduce it.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:29.970
I'm going to look at scales.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.386
I'm going to look
at cold blooded.

00:29:31.386 --> 00:29:32.790
I'm going to look at legs.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.411
That captures all
three examples.

00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:36.660
Again, if you think about
this in terms of clustering,

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.621
all three of them
would fit with that.

00:29:39.621 --> 00:29:40.120
OK.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.680
Now I give you another example--

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.070
chicken.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.535
I don't think it's a reptile.

00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:48.600
In fact, I'm pretty
sure it's not a reptile.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.350
And it nicely still
fits this model, right?

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.310
Because, while it has scales,
which you may or not realize,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.500
it's not cold blooded,
and it has legs.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.380
So it is a negative example
that reinforces the model.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.644
Sounds good.

00:30:04.644 --> 00:30:07.740
And now I'll give
you an alligator.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.720
It's a reptile.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.460
And oh fudge, right?

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.370
It doesn't satisfy the model.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:19.170
Because while it does have
scales and it is cold blooded,

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.155
it has legs.

00:30:21.155 --> 00:30:22.530
I'm almost done
with the example.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:23.446
But you see the point.

00:30:23.446 --> 00:30:25.650
Again, I've got to think
about how do I refine this.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.500
And I could by
saying, all right.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.930
Let's make it a little more
complicated-- has scales,

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.787
cold blooded, 0 or four legs--

00:30:32.787 --> 00:30:34.120
I'm going to say it's a reptile.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.860
I'll give you the dart frog.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.780
Not a reptile,
it's an amphibian.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.000
And that's nice because
it still satisfies this.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.730
So it's an example outside
of the cluster that

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:50.211
says no scales,
not cold blooded,

00:30:50.211 --> 00:30:51.460
but happens to have four legs.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.251
It's not a reptile.

00:30:52.251 --> 00:30:53.780
That's good.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.112
And then I give you--

00:30:55.112 --> 00:30:56.570
I have to give you
a python, right?

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.931
I mean, there has to
be a python in here.

00:30:58.931 --> 00:30:59.430
Oh come on.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.130
At least grown at
me when I say that.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.990
There has to be a python here.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.470
And I give you
that and a salmon.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.620
And now I am in trouble.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:14.810
Because look at scales, look
at cold blooded, look at legs.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.610
I can't separate them.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.230
On those features,
there's no way

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.510
to come up with a way
that will correctly

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:24.576
say that the python is a
reptile and the salmon is not.

00:31:24.576 --> 00:31:28.370
And so there's no easy
way to add in that rule.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.560
And probably my best
thing is to simply go back

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.490
to just two features,
scales and cold blooded.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:35.960
And basically say,
if something has

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.786
scales and it's cold blooded,
I'm going to call it a reptile.

00:31:38.786 --> 00:31:40.160
If it doesn't have
both of those,

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.170
I'm going to say
it's not a reptile.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.009
It won't be perfect.

00:31:44.009 --> 00:31:45.800
It's going to incorrectly
label the salmon.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.310
But I've made a design
choice here that's important.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:54.230
And the design choice is that
I will have no false negatives.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.730
What that means is
there's not going

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.240
to be any instance of something
that's not a reptile that I'm

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.380
going to call a reptile.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.114
I may have some false positives.

00:32:04.114 --> 00:32:05.280
So I did that the wrong way.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.720
A false negative
says, everything

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.020
that's not a reptile I'm going
to categorize that direction.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.760
I may have some false
positives, in that,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.920
I may have a few things
that I will incorrectly

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.690
label as a reptile.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.700
And in particular,
salmon is going

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.620
to be an instance of that.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.099
This trade off of false
positives and false negatives

00:32:22.099 --> 00:32:24.390
is something that we worry
about, as we think about it.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.690
Because there's no perfect
way, in many cases,

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.391
to separate out the data.

00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:30.640
And if you think back to my
example of the New England

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.876
Patriots, that running back
and that wide receiver were

00:32:33.876 --> 00:32:35.500
so close together in
height and weight,

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.256
there was no way I'm going to
be able to separate them apart.

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.880
And I just have to
be willing to decide

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.320
how many false positives
or false negatives

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.370
do I want to tolerate.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:49.980
Once I've figured out what
features to use, which is good,

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.210
then I have to decide
about distance.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.960
How do I compare
two feature vectors?

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.960
I'm going to say vector
because there could

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.640
be multiple dimensions to it.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.260
How do I decide how
to compare them?

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.350
Because I want to use the
distances to figure out either

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.960
how to group things together
or how to find a dividing line

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.940
that separates things apart.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.470
So one of the things I have
to decide is which features.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.970
I also have to
decide the distance.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.710
And finally, I
may want to decide

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:16.660
how to weigh relative importance
of different dimensions

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.990
in the feature vector.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.400
Some may be more valuable than
others in making that decision.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.570
And I want to show you
an example of that.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.909
So let's go back to my animals.

00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:29.950
I started off with a
feature vector that actually

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:31.390
had five dimensions to it.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:36.305
It was egg-laying, cold
blooded, has scales,

00:33:36.305 --> 00:33:39.700
I forget what the other one
was, and number of legs.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.560
So one of the ways I
could think about this

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:46.180
is saying I've got four binary
features and one integer

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.910
feature associated
with each animal.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:52.000
And one way to learn to separate
out reptiles from non reptiles

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.591
is to measure the distance
between pairs of examples

00:33:56.591 --> 00:33:58.840
and use that distance to
decide what's near each other

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.664
and what's not.

00:33:59.664 --> 00:34:01.330
And as we've said
before, it will either

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.210
be used to cluster things or to
find a classifier surface that

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.620
separates them.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.070
So here's a simple way to do it.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.470
For each of these examples,
I'm going to just let true

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:13.060
be 1, false be 0.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.310
So the first four
are either 0s or 1s.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.709
And the last one is
the number of legs.

00:34:17.709 --> 00:34:19.000
And now I could say, all right.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.540
How do I measure
distances between animals

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.884
or anything else, but these
kinds of feature vectors?

00:34:25.884 --> 00:34:27.300
Here, we're going
to use something

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.750
called the Minkowski Metric
or the Minkowski difference.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.080
Given two vectors
and a power, p,

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.300
we basically take
the absolute value

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.429
of the difference between
each of the components

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:43.969
of the vector, raise it to
the p-th power, take the sum,

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:46.840
and take the p-th route of that.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.460
So let's do the two
obvious examples.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.699
If p is equal to 1, I just
measure the absolute distance

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:56.469
between each component, add
them up, and that's my distance.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.715
It's called the
Manhattan metric.

00:34:58.715 --> 00:35:00.840
The one you've seen more,
the one we saw last time,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.900
if p is equal to 2, this is
Euclidean distance, right?

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.990
It's the sum of the
squares of the differences

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.050
of the components.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.149
Take the square root.

00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:09.690
Take the square root
because it makes

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.420
it have certain
properties of a distance.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.540
That's the Euclidean distance.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:20.240
So now if I want to measure
difference between these two,

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.750
here's the question.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:27.780
Is this circle closer to the
star or closer to the cross?

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.310
Unfortunately, I put
the answer up here.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.260
But it differs, depending
on the metric I use.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:33.760
Right?

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.000
Euclidean distance, well,
that's square root of 2 times 2,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.692
so it's about 2.8.

00:35:38.692 --> 00:35:39.400
And that's three.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.580
So in terms of just standard
distance in the plane,

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:46.680
we would say that these two
are closer than those two are.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.430
Manhattan distance,
why is it called that?

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:52.040
Because you can only walk along
the avenues and the streets.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.500
Manhattan distance
would basically

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.500
say this is one, two,
three, four units away.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.170
This is one, two,
three units away.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:02.020
And under Manhattan
distance, this is closer,

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.847
this pairing is closer
than that pairing is.

00:36:05.847 --> 00:36:07.430
Now you're used to
thinking Euclidean.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.220
We're going to use that.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.595
But this is going
to be important

00:36:09.595 --> 00:36:12.080
when we think about how
are we comparing distances

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.360
between these different pieces.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.912
So typically, we'll
use Euclidean.

00:36:16.912 --> 00:36:19.120
We're going to see Manhattan
actually has some value.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.960
So if I go back to my three
examples-- boy, that's

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.960
a gross slide, isn't it?

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.790
But there we go--

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.570
rattlesnake, boa
constrictor, and dart frog.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:26.870
There is the representation.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.457
I can ask, what's the
distance between them?

00:36:29.457 --> 00:36:31.790
In the handout for today,
we've given you a little piece

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:32.914
of code that would do that.

00:36:32.914 --> 00:36:36.050
And if I actually run
through it, I get,

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.510
actually, a nice
little result. Here

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:43.199
are the distances between those
vectors using Euclidean metric.

00:36:43.199 --> 00:36:44.490
I'm going to come back to them.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.350
But you can see the
two snakes, nicely, are

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:50.030
reasonably close to each other.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:54.220
Whereas, the dart frog is a
fair distance away from that.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.910
Nice, right?

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.740
That's a nice separation
that says there's

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.480
a difference between these two.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.220
OK.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.160
Now I throw in the alligator.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.810
Sounds like a Dungeons
&amp; Dragons game.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:09.480
I throw in the alligator, and I
want to do the same comparison.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.720
And I don't get nearly as nice
a result. Because now it says,

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.320
as before, the two snakes
are close to each other.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.700
But it says that the dart
frog and the alligator

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.640
are much closer, under
this measurement,

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.185
than either of them
is to the other.

00:37:27.185 --> 00:37:30.220
And to remind you, right,
the alligator and the two

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.250
snakes I would like to be close
to one another and a distance

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.640
away from the frog.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.470
Because I'm trying to
classify reptiles versus not.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:41.015
So what happened here?

00:37:41.015 --> 00:37:43.140
Well, this is a place where
the feature engineering

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.640
is going to be important.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.820
Because in fact, the alligator
differs from the frog

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.120
in three features.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:55.300
And only in two features from,
say, the boa constrictor.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.590
But one of those features
is the number of legs.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.650
And there, while
on the binary axes,

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.540
the difference is
between a 0 and 1,

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.620
here it can be between 0 and 4.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.100
So that is weighing the distance
a lot more than we would like.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.520
The legs dimension is
too large, if you like.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.416
How would I fix this?

00:38:15.416 --> 00:38:18.020
This is actually, I would
argue, a natural place

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.690
to use Manhattan distance.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:22.520
Why should I think
that the difference

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.160
in the number of legs or the
number of legs difference

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.400
is more important than
whether it has scales or not?

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.620
Why should I think that
measuring that distance

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.300
Euclidean-wise makes sense?

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.590
They are really completely
different measurements.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.090
And in fact, I'm
not going to do it,

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.880
but if I ran Manhattan
metric on this,

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.160
it would get the alligator
much closer to the snakes,

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:48.160
exactly because it differs only
in two features, not three.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.900
The other way I
could fix it would

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.510
be to say I'm letting too
much weight be associated

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.430
with the difference
in the number of legs.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.800
So let's just make
it a binary feature.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.310
Either it doesn't have
legs or it does have legs.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:03.040
Run the same classification.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.450
And now you see the
snakes and the alligator

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.510
are all close to each other.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:13.290
Whereas the dart frog, not
as far away as it was before,

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.480
but there's a pretty natural
separation, especially

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.450
using that number between them.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.180
What's my point?

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.610
Choice of features matters.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.710
Throwing too many
features in may, in fact,

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.450
give us some overfitting.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.300
And in particular,
deciding the weights

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.090
that I want on those
features has a real impact.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.830
And you, as a designer
or a programmer,

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:37.340
have a lot of influence in how
you think about using those.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.930
So feature engineering
really matters.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.610
How you pick the
features, what you use

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.580
is going to be important.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:44.880
OK.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.740
The last piece of
this then is we're

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.370
going to look at some examples
where we give you data, got

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.180
features associated with them.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.180
We're going to, in some
cases have them labeled,

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.120
in other cases not.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.970
And we know how now to
think about how do we

00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:59.261
measure distances between them.

00:39:59.261 --> 00:40:00.425
John.

00:40:00.425 --> 00:40:02.050
JOHN GUTTAG: You
probably didn't intend

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.460
to say weights of features.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.780
You intended to say
how they're scaled.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:04.990
ERIC GRIMSON: Sorry.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:06.530
The scales and not
the-- thank you, John.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:07.029
No, I did.

00:40:07.029 --> 00:40:07.850
I take that back.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:09.600
I did not mean to say
weights of features.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.650
I meant to say the
scale of the dimension

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:12.900
is going to be important here.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.210
Thank you, for the
amplification and correction.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:16.210
You're absolutely right.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.082
JOHN GUTTAG: Weights, we
use in a different way,

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:19.020
as we'll see next time.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:19.590
ERIC GRIMSON: And
we're going to see

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.450
next time why we're going to
use weights in different ways.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:22.404
So rephrase it.

00:40:22.404 --> 00:40:23.570
Block that out of your mind.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.070
We're going to talk about
scales and the scale on the axes

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.536
as being important here.

00:40:27.536 --> 00:40:29.160
And we already said
we're going to look

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.740
at two different
kinds of learning,

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.920
labeled and unlabeled,
clustering and classifying.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.530
And I want to just
finish up by showing you

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.940
two examples of that.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.310
How we would think about
them algorithmically,

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:44.004
and we'll look at them
in more detail next time.

00:40:44.004 --> 00:40:45.420
As we look at it,
I want to remind

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.530
you the things that are
going to be important to you.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:50.930
How do I measure distance
between examples?

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.060
What's the right
way to design that?

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:57.060
What is the right set of
features to use in that vector?

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:01.520
And then, what constraints do
I want to put on the model?

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.020
In the case of
unlabelled data, how

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.424
do I decide how many
clusters I want to have?

00:41:06.424 --> 00:41:08.840
Because I can give you a really
easy way to do clustering.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.110
If I give you 100 examples,
I say build 100 clusters.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.250
Every example is
its own cluster.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.470
Distance is really good.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.110
It's really close to itself,
but it does a lousy job

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.240
of labeling things on it.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.656
So I have to think
about, how do I

00:41:20.656 --> 00:41:23.526
decide how many clusters,
what's the complexity

00:41:23.526 --> 00:41:24.650
of that separating service?

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.710
How do I basically avoid
the overfitting problem,

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.840
which I don't want to have?

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.850
So just to remind
you, we've already

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:36.240
seen a little version of
this, the clustering method.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.276
This is a standard way to
do it, simply repeating what

00:41:39.276 --> 00:41:40.400
we had on an earlier slide.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.420
If I want to cluster
it into groups,

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.410
I start by saying how many
clusters am I looking for?

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.590
Pick an example I take as
my early representation.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.640
For every other example
in the training data,

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.210
put it to the closest cluster.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:57.080
Once I've got those, find the
median, repeat the process.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:01.820
And that led to that separation.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.930
Now once I've got it,
I like to validate it.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:05.780
And in fact, I should
have said this better.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.980
Those two clusters came without
looking at the two black dots.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.630
Once I put the
black dots in, I'd

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.510
like to validate, how well
does this really work?

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.780
And that example there is
really not very encouraging.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.590
It's too close.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.020
So that's a natural place to
say, OK, what if I did this

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:25.360
with three clusters?

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.970
That's what I get.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.240
I like the that.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:29.860
All right?

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.460
That has a really
nice cluster up here.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.630
The fact that the algorithm
didn't know the labeling

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:36.213
is irrelevant.

00:42:36.213 --> 00:42:37.720
There's a nice grouping of five.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.710
There's a nice grouping of four.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:42.620
And there's a nice grouping
of three in between.

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.980
And in fact, if I looked
at the average distance

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.200
between examples in
each of these clusters,

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.440
it is much tighter
than in that example.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:56.550
And so that leads to, then,
the question of should I

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:57.642
look for four clusters?

00:42:57.642 --> 00:42:58.350
Question, please.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:01.020
AUDIENCE: Is that overlap
between the two clusters

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:01.690
not an issue?

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:02.440
ERIC GRIMSON: Yes.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.600
The question is, is the overlap
between the two clusters

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.099
a problem?

00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:05.824
No.

00:43:05.824 --> 00:43:07.240
I just drew it
here so I could let

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.010
you see where those pieces are.

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:13.090
But in fact, if you like,
the center is there.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.550
Those three points are
all closer to that center

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:16.780
than they are to that center.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.260
So the fact that they
overlap is a good question.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.020
It's just the way I
happened to draw them.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.490
I should really
draw these, not as

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:25.104
circles, but as some little
bit more convoluted surface.

00:43:25.104 --> 00:43:26.050
OK?

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:28.900
Having done three, I could
say should I look for four?

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.919
Well, those points down
there, as I've already said,

00:43:31.919 --> 00:43:33.460
are an example where
it's going to be

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.750
hard to separate them out.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:35.920
And I don't want to overfit.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.720
Because the only way
to separate those out

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.900
is going to be to come up with
a really convoluted cluster,

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.950
which I don't like.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:43.580
All right?

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.480
Let me finish with showing
you one other example

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.650
from the other direction.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:52.010
Which is, suppose I give
you labeled examples.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:54.200
So again, the goal
is I've got features

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.470
associated with each example.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.470
They're going to have
multiple dimensions on it.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.450
But I also know the label
associated with them.

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.880
And I want to learn
what is the best

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.760
way to come up with a rule that
will let me take new examples

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.301
and assign them to
the right group.

00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:08.910
A number of ways to do this.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:12.020
You can simply say I'm looking
for the simplest surface that

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.927
will separate those examples.

00:44:13.927 --> 00:44:16.010
In my football case that
were in the plane, what's

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.660
the best line that
separates them,

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.610
which turns out to be easy.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:21.725
I might look for a more
complicated surface.

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:23.600
And we're going to see
an example in a second

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.261
where maybe it's a
sequence of line segments

00:44:26.261 --> 00:44:27.260
that separates them out.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.920
Because there's not just one
line that does the separation.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.790
As before, I want to be careful.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.370
If I make it too
complicated, I may

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:38.054
get a really good separator,
but I overfit to the data.

00:44:38.054 --> 00:44:39.470
And you're going
to see next time.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:40.520
I'm going to just
highlight it here.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.019
There's a third
way, which will lead

00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:43.910
to almost the same
kind of result

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.160
called k nearest neighbors.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.550
And the idea here is I've
got a set of labeled data.

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.100
And what I'm going to do
is, for every new example,

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:57.250
say find the k, say the five
closest labeled examples.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:58.600
And take a vote.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.870
If 3 out of 5 or 4 out of 5
or 5 out of 5 of those labels

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.605
are the same, I'm going to
say it's part of that group.

00:45:04.605 --> 00:45:05.980
And if I have less
than that, I'm

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.510
going to leave it
as unclassified.

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:09.259
And that's a nice way
of actually thinking

00:45:09.259 --> 00:45:10.870
about how to learn them.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:12.940
And let me just finish by
showing you an example.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.814
Now I won't use football
players on this one.

00:45:14.814 --> 00:45:17.380
I'll use a different example.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.020
I'm going to give
you some voting data.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.800
I think this is
actually simulated data.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.974
But these are a set of
voters in the United States

00:45:25.974 --> 00:45:26.890
with their preference.

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.136
They tend to vote Republican.

00:45:28.136 --> 00:45:29.260
They tend to vote Democrat.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.800
And the two categories are
their age and how far away

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.441
they live from Boston.

00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:36.440
Whether those are relevant
or not, I don't know,

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.064
but they are just two things I'm
going to use to classify them.

00:45:39.064 --> 00:45:41.750
And I'd like to say,
how would I fit a curve

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.110
to separate those two classes?

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.690
I'm going to keep
half the data to test.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.910
I'm going to use half
the data to train.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:52.590
So if this is my
training data, I

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:57.040
can say what's the best
line that separates these?

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.200
I don't know about best,
but here are two examples.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.880
This solid line has the
property that all the Democrats

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.620
are on one side.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.540
Everything on the other
side is a Republican,

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.000
but there are some Republicans
on this side of the line.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.310
I can't find a line that
completely separates these,

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:14.260
as I did with the
football players.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.659
But there is a decent
line to separate them.

00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:18.700
Here's another candidate.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:22.695
That dash line has the
property that on the right side

00:46:22.695 --> 00:46:24.820
you've got-- boy, I don't
think this is deliberate,

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.480
John, right-- but
on the right side,

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.195
you've got almost
all Republicans.

00:46:28.195 --> 00:46:30.730
It seems perfectly appropriate.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:34.000
One Democrat, but there's a
pretty good separation there.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.130
And on the left side,
you've got a mix of things.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:39.980
But most of the Democrats are
on the left side of that line.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:40.480
All right?

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.104
The fact that left
and right correlates

00:46:42.104 --> 00:46:44.470
with distance from Boston is
completely irrelevant here.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.620
But it has a nice punch to it.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.370
JOHN GUTTAG: Relevant,
but not accidental.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:49.745
ERIC GRIMSON: But
not accidental.

00:46:49.745 --> 00:46:50.570
Thank you.

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:51.070
All right.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:53.194
So now the question is,
how would I evaluate these?

00:46:53.194 --> 00:46:55.306
How do I decide
which one is better?

00:46:55.306 --> 00:46:56.680
And I'm simply
going to show you,

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.880
very quickly, some examples.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.747
First one is to look at what's
called the confusion matrix.

00:47:02.747 --> 00:47:03.580
What does that mean?

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.090
It says for this, one of
these classifiers for example,

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:07.760
the solid line.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.260
Here are the predictions,
based on the solid line

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.010
of whether they would
be more likely to be

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:13.540
Democrat or Republican.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.090
And here is the actual label.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:17.410
Same thing for the dashed line.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:21.280
And that diagonal is
important because those are

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.740
the correctly labeled results.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.540
Right?

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.460
It correctly, in
the solid line case,

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.400
gets all of the correct
labelings of the Democrats.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.080
It gets half of the
Republicans right.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.080
But it has some where
it's actually Republican,

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.700
but it labels it as a Democrat.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.580
That, we'd like to
be really large.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.070
And in fact, it leads
to a natural measure

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:44.880
called the accuracy.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.520
Which is, just to
go back to that,

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.650
we say that these
are true positives.

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:52.070
Meaning, I labeled it as being
an instance, and it really is.

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:53.330
These are true negatives.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:56.330
I label it as not being an
instance, and it really isn't.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.450
And then these are
the false positives.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:01.424
I labeled it as being an
instance and it's not,

00:48:01.424 --> 00:48:02.840
and these are the
false negatives.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.680
I labeled it as not being
an instance, and it is.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.620
And an easy way to measure it
is to look at the correct labels

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.290
over all of the labels.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:13.040
The true positives and
the true negatives,

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.820
the ones I got right.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:19.862
And in that case, both models
come up with a value of 0.7.

00:48:19.862 --> 00:48:20.820
So which one is better?

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:21.900
Well, I should validate that.

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.399
And I'm going to
do that in a second

00:48:23.399 --> 00:48:25.511
by looking at other data.

00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:27.260
We could also ask,
could we find something

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.660
with less training error?

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.310
This is only getting 70% right.

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:33.250
Not great.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.692
Well, here is a more
complicated model.

00:48:35.692 --> 00:48:37.150
And this is where
you start getting

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.140
worried about overfitting.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.598
Now what I've done,
is I've come up

00:48:39.598 --> 00:48:42.430
with a sequence of lines
that separate them.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.260
So everything above this
line, I'm going to say

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.080
is a Republican.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.910
Everything below this line,
I'm going to say is a Democrat.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:50.350
So I'm avoiding that one.

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:51.310
I'm avoiding that one.

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:54.340
I'm still capturing
many of the same things.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:59.140
And in this case, I get 12 true
positives, 13 true negatives,

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.001
and only 5 false positives.

00:49:02.001 --> 00:49:03.000
And that's kind of nice.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.790
You can see the 5.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.040
It's those five red
ones down there.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.360
It's accuracy is 0.833.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:15.596
And now, if I apply that to the
test data, I get an OK result.

00:49:15.596 --> 00:49:19.440
It has an accuracy of about 0.6.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.930
I could use this idea to try
and generalize to say could I

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:23.100
come up with a better model.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.860
And you're going to
see that next time.

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:28.050
There could be other ways
in which I measure this.

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:29.860
And I want to use this
as the last example.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:34.740
Another good measure we use is
called PPV, Positive Predictive

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:39.290
Value which is how many true
positives do I come up with out

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:42.580
of all the things I
labeled positively.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.630
And in this solid model,
in the dashed line,

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:48.120
I can get values about 0.57.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.500
The complex model on the
training data is better.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.960
And then the testing
data is even stronger.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.820
And finally, two other
examples are called

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.850
sensitivity and specificity.

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:01.490
Sensitivity basically
tells you what percentage

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:03.610
did I correctly find.

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:05.510
And specificity
said what percentage

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.700
did I correctly reject.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.290
And I show you this
because this is

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:12.240
where the trade-off comes in.

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.210
If sensitivity is how
many did I correctly

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:16.400
label out of those
that I both correctly

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:20.382
labeled and incorrectly
labeled as being negative,

00:50:20.382 --> 00:50:21.840
how many them did
I correctly label

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.980
as being the kind that I want?

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:27.310
I can make sensitivity 1.

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:30.090
Label everything is the
thing I'm looking for.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:30.710
Great.

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:32.140
Everything is correct.

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.740
But the specificity will be 0.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:39.020
Because I'll have a bunch of
things incorrectly labeled.

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:43.460
I could make the specificity
1, reject everything.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.410
Say nothing as an instance.

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:52.070
True negatives goes to 1, and
I'm in a great place there,

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:55.170
but my sensitivity goes to 0.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:56.130
I've got a trade-off.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:58.680
As I think about the machine
learning algorithm I'm using

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.164
and my choice of
that classifier,

00:51:01.164 --> 00:51:02.580
I'm going to see
a trade off where

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:07.260
I can increase specificity at
the cost of sensitivity or vice

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.310
versa.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:11.430
And you'll see a nice technique
called ROC or Receiver Operator

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.576
Curve that gives you a sense of
how you want to deal with that.

00:51:14.576 --> 00:51:16.200
And with that, we'll
see you next time.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.180
We'll take your
question off line

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.680
if you don't mind, because
I've run over time.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.763
But we'll see you next
time where Professor Guttag

00:51:20.763 --> 00:51:22.930
will show you examples of this.
