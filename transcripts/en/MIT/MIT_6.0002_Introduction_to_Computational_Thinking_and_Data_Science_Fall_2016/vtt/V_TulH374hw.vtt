00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.820
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.830
Over the last
couple of lectures,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.360
we've been looking at
optimization models.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.430
And the idea was how do I find
a way to optimize an objective

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.920
function-- it could be
minimize it or maximize it--

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.280
relative to a set
of constraints?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.120
And we saw, or
Professor Guttag showed

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.700
you, one of the ways
that naturally falls out

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.130
is by looking at
trees, decision trees,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.800
where you pass your way through
a tree trying to figure out

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.330
how to optimize that model.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.740
So today, we're going to
generalize those trees

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.710
into another whole broad
class of models called graph

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.220
theoretic or graph models.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370
And we're going to use
those to again look

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.050
at how do we can do optimization
on those kinds of models.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.660
Just to remind you,
there is a great piece

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.710
of information in the text.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.410
There's the reading for today.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.201
And these will, of
course, be in the slides

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:21.360
that you can download.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.220
So let's take a second
just to reset again

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.710
what are we trying to do?

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.580
Generally, we're trying to
build computational models.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.260
So what does that mean?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.750
The same way we could do
a physical experiment,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.360
or a social experiment,
or model, if you like,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.610
a physical system
and a social system,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.890
to both try and gather
data and analyze it

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.390
or to do predictions.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.850
We want to do the same
thing computationally.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.480
We'd like to be able
to build models in code

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.940
that we can then run to
predict effects, which we then

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.860
might test with an actual
physical experiment.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.620
And we've seen, for example,
how you could take just

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.100
the informal problem of choosing
what to eat and turning it

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.240
into an optimization
problem-- in this case,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.289
it was a version of something
we called a knapsack problem--

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.281
and how you could then use
that to find code to solve it.

00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:15.530
And you've already seen two
different general methods.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.613
You've seen greedy algorithms
that just try and do

00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:19.160
the best thing at each stage.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.860
And you saw dynamic programming
as an elegant solution

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.290
to finding better
ways to optimize this.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.320
We're going to now look at
broadening the class of models

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.390
to talk about graphs.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.330
So, obvious question
is, what's a graph?

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.910
And a graph has two
elements, two components.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.400
It has a set of nodes,
sometimes called vertices.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.920
Those nodes probably are
going to have some information

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.840
associated with them.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.710
It could be as simple
as it's a name.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.030
It could be more complicated.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.130
A node might represent
a student record--

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.090
the grades.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.100
And a graph might talk
about putting together

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.780
all of the grades for a class.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.840
Associated with that,
we can't just-- well,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.040
I should say, we
could just have nodes,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.123
but that's kind of boring.

00:03:01.123 --> 00:03:02.800
We want to know what
are the connections

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.720
between the elements
in my system?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.840
And so the second thing
we're going to have

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.990
is what we call edges,
sometimes called arcs.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.589
And an edge will
connect a pair of nodes.

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.630
We're going to see two
different ways in which we

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.440
could build graphs using edges.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.807
The first one, the
simple one, is an edge

00:03:22.807 --> 00:03:23.890
is going to be undirected.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.556
And actually, I should
show this to you.

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:27.640
So there is the
idea of just nodes.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.250
Those nodes, as I said,
might have information

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.570
in them, just labels or names.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.820
They might have other
information in them.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.000
When I want to connect
them up, the connections

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.999
could be undirected.

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.290
If you want to think of it
this way, it goes both ways.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.090
An edge connects
two nodes together,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.040
and that allows
sharing of information

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.947
between both of them.

00:03:46.947 --> 00:03:49.030
In some cases, we're going
to see that we actually

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.610
want to use what we call a
directed graph, sometimes

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.840
called a digraph, in
which case the edge has

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.810
a direction from a
source to a destination,

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.960
or sometimes from a
parent to a child.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.520
And in this case,
the information

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.672
can only flow from the
source to the child.

00:04:07.672 --> 00:04:09.130
Now in the case
I've drawn here, it

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.460
looks like there's only
ever a single directed edge

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.120
between nodes.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.520
I could, in fact, have
them going both directions,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.774
from source to destination and
a separate directed edge coming

00:04:18.774 --> 00:04:20.440
from the destination
back to the source.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.760
And we'll see some
examples of that.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.130
But I'm going to have edges.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.459
Final thing is, those edges
could just be connections.

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:30.500
But in some cases, we're
going to put information

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.260
on the edges, for
example, weights.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.870
The weight might
tell me how much

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.210
effort is it going to take
me to go from a source

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.404
to a destination.

00:04:41.404 --> 00:04:42.820
And one of the
things you're going

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.740
to see as I want to
think about how do I

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.530
pass through this graph,
finding a path from one

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.280
place to another, for example,
minimizing the cost associated

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.410
with passing through the edges?

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.810
Or how do I simply find
a connection between two

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.610
nodes in this graph?

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.440
So graphs, composed
of vertices or nodes,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.230
they're composed
of edges or arcs.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.110
So why might we want them?

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.370
Well, we're going to see--

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.869
and you can probably
already guess--

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:15.340
there are lots of really useful
relationships between entities.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.220
I might want to take
a European vacation.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.870
After November 8,
I might really want

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.000
to take a European vacation.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.490
So I'd like to know, what are
the possible ways by rail I

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.176
can get from Paris to London?

00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:29.300
Well, I could pull out the
schedule and look at it.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.410
But you could imagine, I hope,
thinking about this as a graph.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.910
The nodes would be cities.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.050
The links would be rail
links between them.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.050
And then, one of the
things I might like to know

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.091
is, first of all, can I
get from Paris to London?

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.770
And then secondly,
what's the fastest

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.900
way to do it or the
cheapest way to do it?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.510
So I'd like to explore that.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.960
Second example, as you can see
on the list, drug discovery,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.150
modeling of complex
molecule in terms

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.730
of the relationships between
the pieces inside of it and then

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.850
asking questions like,
what kind of energy

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.790
would it take to
convert this molecule

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.230
into a different molecule?

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.900
And how might I think about
that as a graph problem?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.640
Third and obvious one, ancestral
relationships, family trees.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.440
In most families,
almost all families,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.397
they really are
trees not graphs.

00:06:17.397 --> 00:06:18.980
Hopefully you don't
come from a family

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.630
that has strange loops in them.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.624
But family trees are--

00:06:23.624 --> 00:06:25.040
I know, I'm in
trouble here today.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.539
Aren't I?

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.590
Family trees-- stay with me--

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.710
are a great demonstration of
relationships because there

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.000
its directional edges.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.690
Right?

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.340
Parents have children.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.110
Those children have children.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.240
And like I say, it
comes in a natural way

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.110
of thinking about traversing
things in that tree.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.070
And in fact, trees are a
special case of a graph.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.140
You've already seen decision
trees in the last lecture.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.630
But basically, a special kind
of directed graph is a tree.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.980
And the property of
the tree is, as it

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.370
says there, any pair
of nodes are connected,

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.520
if they are connected,
by only a single path.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.420
There are no loops.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.250
There are no ways
to go from one node,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.590
find a set of things that
brings you back to that node.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.247
You can only have a single
path to those points.

00:07:11.247 --> 00:07:13.080
And Professor Guttag
used this, for example,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.130
to talk about solving
the knapsack problem.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.770
A decision trees is
a really nice way

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.110
of finding that solution.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.600
Now, I drew it this way.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.950
In computer science, we
mostly use Australian trees.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.810
They're upside down.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.054
The roots are at the top.

00:07:29.054 --> 00:07:30.720
The leaves are at the
bottom, because we

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.970
want to think about starting
at the beginning of the tree,

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.845
which is typically
something we call the root

00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:35.910
and traversing it.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.440
But however you
use it, trees are

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.450
going to be a useful
way of actually

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:44.230
thinking about representing
particular kinds of graphs.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.830
OK.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.457
So, when I talk in a second
about how to build graphs,

00:07:48.457 --> 00:07:50.290
well let's spend just
a second about saying,

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.650
so why are they useful?

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.730
And if you think
about it, the world

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.990
is full of lots of networks that
are based on relationships that

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.650
could be captured by a graph.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.900
We use them all the time.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.290
Some of you are using
them right now--

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.040
computer networks.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.700
You want to send an email
message from your machine

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.679
to your friend at Stanford.

00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:14.720
That's going to get routed
through a set of links

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.330
to get there.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.810
So the network set up by a
series of routers that pass it

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.530
along, sending something
requires an algorithm

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.999
that figures out the best way
to actually move that around.

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:26.540
There's a great
local company started

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.770
by an MIT professor
called Akamai

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.310
that thinks about how do
you move web content around

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:31.810
on the web?

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.049
Again, it's a nice
computer network problem.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:37.340
I've already talked about this.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.923
We're going to do
some other examples.

00:08:38.923 --> 00:08:41.980
Transportation networks--
here, if you think about it,

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.040
obvious thing is make
the nodes cities.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.730
Make the edges
roads between them.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.780
And now questions are,
can I get to San Jose,

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.809
if you like old songs?

00:08:50.809 --> 00:08:52.600
And what's the best
way to get to San Jose,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.460
even if you don't
like old songs?

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.270
A network problem--
how do I analyze it?

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.330
Financial networks--
moving money around--

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.950
easily modeled by a graph.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.980
Traditional networks--
sewer, water, electrical,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.392
anything that distributes
content, if you like,

00:09:12.392 --> 00:09:14.600
and the different kind of
content in this way around.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.700
You want to model that
in terms of how you think

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.590
about flows in those networks.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.810
How do I maximize distribution
of water in an appropriate way,

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.620
given I've got certain
capacities on different pipes,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.690
which would mean those
edges in the graph

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.550
would have different weights?

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.780
And you get the idea--

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.040
political networks, criminal
networks, social networks.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.040
One of the things we're
going to see with graphs

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.440
is that they can capture
interesting relationships.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.360
So here's an example.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.401
It's from that little web
site you can see there.

00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:45.220
You're welcome to go look at it.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.400
And this is a graph
analyzing The Wizard of Oz.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.810
And what's been done
here is the size

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.740
of the node reflects the number
of scenes in which a character

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.680
shares dialog.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.230
So you can see, obviously
Dorothy is the biggest node

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.030
there.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.010
The edges represent
shared dialog,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.090
so you can see who talks
to whom in this graph.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.016
And then, this group
has done another thing,

00:10:08.016 --> 00:10:09.140
which I'm going to mention.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.348
We're not going to solve
today, which is you can also

00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:12.500
do analysis on the graphs.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.920
And in fact, the color
here has done something

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.150
called a min-flow
or max-cut problem,

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.040
which is it's tried to identify
which clusters in the graph

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.570
tend to have a lot
of interactions

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.710
within that cluster but not
very many with other clusters.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.710
And you can kind of see.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.084
There's some nice things here,
right, if you can read it.

00:10:30.084 --> 00:10:32.210
This is all the
people in Kansas.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.070
This is Glenda and the
Munchkins in that part of Oz.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.260
There's another little cluster
over here that I can't read

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.990
and a little cluster over there.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.070
And then the big
cluster down here.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.850
But you can analyze the graph
to pull out pieces on it.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:50.050
You can also notice, by the way,
the book is probably misnamed.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.280
It's called The Wizard of Oz.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.410
But notice, there's
the wizard, who

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.450
actually doesn't have
a lot of interaction

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.800
with the other
people in this story.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.920
It's OK, literary choice.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.394
But the graph is
representing interactions.

00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:04.060
And I could imagine
searching that graph

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.684
to try and figure
out things about what

00:11:05.684 --> 00:11:09.060
goes on in The Wizard of Oz.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:09.730
OK.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:10.690
So why are they useful?

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.950
We're going to see that not only
do graphs capture relationships

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.376
in these connected
networks, but they're

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:18.500
going to support inference.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.860
They're going to be able
to reason about them.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.950
And I want to set that up.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.408
And then we'll actually look
at how might we build a graph.

00:11:24.408 --> 00:11:26.710
And so here are
some ways in which

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.910
I might want to do inference.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.710
Given a graph, I
might say, is there

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.400
a sequence of edges, of
links, between two elements?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.470
Is there a way to
get from A to B?

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:41.670
What are the sequence of edges
I would use to get there?

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.530
A more interesting
question is, can I

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.560
find the least expensive
path, also known

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.336
as the shortest path?

00:11:48.336 --> 00:11:50.120
If I want to get
from Paris to London,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.203
I might like to do it in
the least amount of time.

00:11:52.203 --> 00:11:56.580
What are the set of choices
I want to make to get there?

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.480
A third graph problem used a lot
is called the graph partition

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.070
problem.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.200
Everything I've shown so
far-- actually not quite.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.340
The first example
didn't have it.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.710
You might think of all the
nodes having some connection

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.550
to every other node.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.530
But that may not be true.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.030
There may actually
be graphs where

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.050
I've got a set of connected
elements and another component

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.290
with no connections
between them.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.040
Can I find those?

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.790
That's called the graph
partition problem.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.660
How do I separate the graph
out into connected sets

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.650
of elements?

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.150
And then the one
that we just showed

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.740
called the min-cut
max-flow problem, is

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.990
is there an efficient
way to separate out

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.660
the highly connected elements,
the things that interact

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.770
a lot, and separate out how many
of those kinds of subgraphs,

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.574
if you like, are there
inside of my graph?

00:12:42.574 --> 00:12:46.390
All right, let me show you
a motivation for graphs.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.530
And then we'll build them.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.320
I use graph theory everyday.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.132
I'm a math nut.

00:12:52.132 --> 00:12:53.840
It's OK, but I use
graph theory everyday.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.730
You may as well, if you commute.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.230
Because I use it
to figure out how

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.640
to get from my home in Lexington
down here to Cambridge.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.960
And I use a nice
little system called

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.850
Waze It's a great way
of doing this, which

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.840
does graph theory inside of it.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.290
So how do I get to my office?

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.820
Well, I'm going to model
the road system using

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.990
a directed graph, a digraph.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.880
Directed graph because
streets can be one way.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.990
And so I may only have a
single direction there.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.200
And the idea is, I'm
going to simply let

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.630
my nodes or my
vertices be points

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.130
where I have intersections.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.463
They're places where I can
make a choice or places where

00:13:29.463 --> 00:13:31.960
I have terminals, things
I'm going to end up in.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.990
The edges would just be the
connections between points,

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.700
the roads on which I can drive.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.920
Some Boston drivers have a
different kind of digraph

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.579
in which they don't care whether
that road is drivable or not.

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:43.370
They just go on it.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.703
You may have seen some of these.

00:13:44.703 --> 00:13:48.290
But I want to keep my graphs as
real roads that I can drive on.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.270
And I'm not going to go
against the "One Way" sign.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.730
Each edge will have a weight.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.410
Here I actually
have some choices.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.120
All right, the obvious one, the
one that Waze probably uses,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.810
is something like what's the
expected time between a source

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.246
and a destination node?

00:14:05.246 --> 00:14:07.620
How long do I expect it to
take me to get from this point

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.232
to that?

00:14:08.232 --> 00:14:09.690
And then, as you
can see, I'm going

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.160
to try and find overall what's
the best way to get around it.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.060
You could pick just distance.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.897
What's the distance
between the two?

00:14:17.897 --> 00:14:19.730
And while there there's
a relationship here,

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.930
it's not direct because it
will depend on traffic on it.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.210
Or you could take something
even funkier like what's

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.630
the average speed of
travel between the source

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.300
and destination node?

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.780
And once I've got
the graph, then I'm

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.600
going to solve an
optimization problem.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.150
What's the shortest weight
between my house and my office

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.015
that gets me into work?

00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:43.140
You can make a choice here.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.370
As I said, a commercial system
like Waze uses this one.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.960
My wife and I actually
have arguments

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.460
about commuting
because she's a firm

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.750
believer in the second one,
just shortest distance.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.620
I actually like the third
one because I get anxious

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.930
when I'm driving.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.090
And so as long as I feel like
I'm making progress, I like it.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.815
So even though I may be
serpentining all the way

00:15:05.815 --> 00:15:08.190
through the back roads of
Cambridge, if I'm driving fast,

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.440
I feel like I'm getting there.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.030
So I like optimizing this
bottom one down there.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.580
And if you see me on the road,
you'll know why I say that,

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.990
and then get out of the way.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.090
Thinking about navigation
through systems

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.798
actually gives us a
little bit of history

00:15:22.798 --> 00:15:26.340
because, in fact, the very first
reported use of graph theory

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.560
was exactly this problem.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.650
Early 1700s, it's called
the Bridges of Koenigsberg.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.754
Koenigsberg is a
city that has a set

00:15:33.754 --> 00:15:34.920
of islands and rivers in it.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.750
There are seven bridges that
connect up those islands.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.080
And the question that
was posed is, is it

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.340
possible to take a walk that
traverses each of the seven

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.680
bridges exactly once?

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.930
So could you take a walk
where you go over each bridge

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.850
exactly once?

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.440
I'm showing you
this because it lets

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.640
us think about how to in fact
capture things in a model.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.560
This problem was solved by
a great Swiss mathematician,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.270
Leonhard Euler.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.040
And here's what he said.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.380
Make each island a node.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.620
Each bridge is just
an undirected edge.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.590
And notice in doing
that, he's abstracted

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.740
away irrelevant details.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.390
You don't care what the
size of the island is.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.060
You don't care how
long the bridges are.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.977
You simply want to think about
what are the connections here?

00:16:23.977 --> 00:16:25.310
And then you can ask a question.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.590
In this graph, is it
possible to find a way

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.740
to walk through it so that
you go through each edge

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.320
exactly once?

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.000
And as Euler showed,
the answer is no.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.110
And if you're curious, go
look it up on Wikipedia.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.544
There's a nice, elegant
solution to why that's the case.

00:16:40.544 --> 00:16:41.960
But here's what
we're going to do.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.700
We're going to use
those graphs to think

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.394
about these kinds of problems.

00:16:46.394 --> 00:16:48.310
And in fact, the example
I'm going to show you

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.934
are going to be
shortest path problems.

00:16:49.934 --> 00:16:54.810
So with that, let's turn to
actually building a graph

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.670
and then thinking about
how we're going to use it.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.084
So we're going to start
by constructing graphs.

00:17:00.084 --> 00:17:01.500
And then what we're
going to do is

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.920
show how we can build
search algorithms

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.089
on top of those graphs.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.819
And I hope that that flicker
is going to go away here soon.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:09.930
Here we go.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.131
So to build a graph--

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:14.339
actually, I shouldn't have
put this slide up so fast.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.750
I've got lots of choices here.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.150
If I'm thinking about maps,
one way to build a graph

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.970
would really to just be
build something with latitude

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.069
and longitude on it.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.040
But as we've already seen, we'd
like to extract things away

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.420
from the graphs.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.440
And so a natural
choice is to say,

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.120
let's represent the nodes in
the graph just as objects.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.350
I'm going to use
classes for these.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.440
So here's my
definition of a node.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.310
It's pretty straightforward.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.940
I'm going to assume that
the only information for now

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.670
I store in a node is just a
name, which I'm going to assume

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.060
is a string.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.000
So I've got a class
definition for node.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.750
It inherits from the
base Python object class.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.040
I need ways to create
instances of nodes,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.740
so I've got an init function.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.950
And I'm simply going to
store inside each instance,

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.010
in other words, inside of
self, under the variable name,

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.010
whatever I passed in as
the name of that node.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.530
Of course, if I've got ways
to create things with a name,

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.709
I need to get them back out.

00:18:09.709 --> 00:18:11.500
So I've got a way of
selecting it back out.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.440
If I ask an instance of
a node, what's your name?

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.115
By calling getName it
will return that value.

00:18:17.115 --> 00:18:18.490
And to print things
out, I'm just

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:19.656
going to print out the name.

00:18:19.656 --> 00:18:21.576
This is pretty straightforward.

00:18:21.576 --> 00:18:24.280
And this, of course, lets
me now create as many nodes

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.230
as I would like.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.560
Edges?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.160
Well, an edge
connects up two nodes.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.670
So again, I can do a fairly
straightforward construction

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.100
of a class.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.520
Again, it's going to inherit
from the base Python object.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.710
To create an
instance of an edge,

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.020
I'm going to make an assumption,
an important one which

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.186
we're going to come back to.

00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:48.220
And the assumption is that the
arguments passed in, source

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.830
and destination, are nodes--

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.350
not names-- the
nodes themselves,

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.380
the actual instances
of the object class.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.210
And what will I do?

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:01.050
Inside of the edge, I'm going
to set internal variables.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.070
For each instance of the
edge, source and destination

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.270
are going to point
to those nodes,

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.361
to those objects that I
created out of the node class.

00:19:10.361 --> 00:19:11.860
Next two things are
straightforward.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.280
I can get those things back out.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.110
And then the final
piece is, if when

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.930
I want to print out
what an edge looks like,

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.240
I'm going to ask
that it print out

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.000
the name of the source,
and then an arrow,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.900
and then the name
of the destination.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.720
So notice what I do there.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.570
Given an instance of an
edge, I can print it.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:36.400
And it will get the source or
the node associated with source

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.512
inside this instance, get
for that the getName method,

00:19:41.512 --> 00:19:42.220
and then call it.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.041
Notice the open-close paren
there to actually call it.

00:19:45.041 --> 00:19:45.790
What does that do?

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.024
It says, inside the
edge I've got something

00:19:48.024 --> 00:19:48.940
that points to a node.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.690
I get that node.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.650
I take the method
associated with it.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:52.360
And I call it.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.580
That returns the string.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.560
And then I glue that
together with the arrow.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.300
I do the same thing
on the destination.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.240
And I just print it out.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.770
Pretty straightforward,
hopefully.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.867
OK, now I have to make a
decision about the graph.

00:20:06.867 --> 00:20:08.950
I'm going to start with
digraphs, directed graphs.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.919
And I need to think about how
I might represent the graph.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:12.710
I can create nodes.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.080
I can create edges, but I've
got to bring them all together.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.430
So I'll remind you, a
digraph is a directed graph.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.660
The edges pass in
only one direction.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.330
And here's one
way I could do it.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.880
Given all the sources
and all the destinations,

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.420
I could just create a big matrix
called an adjacency matrix.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.380
The rows would be
all the sources.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.110
The columns would be
all the destinations.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.180
And then in a particular
spot in the matrix,

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.750
if there is an edge between
a source and a destination,

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.310
I'd just put a one.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.380
Otherwise I'd put a zero.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.970
Note, by the way, because
it's a directed graph,

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.680
it's not symmetric.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.250
There might be a one between S
and D, but not between D and S,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.950
unless there are
edges both ways.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.050
This would be a
perfectly reasonable way

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:07.140
to represent a graph, but
not the most convenient one.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.270
I'd have to go into the
matrix to look things up.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.430
It may also not be
a very efficient way

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.781
of representing things.

00:21:12.781 --> 00:21:15.030
For example, if there are
very few edges in the graph,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.660
I could have a huge
matrix with mostly zeros.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.700
And that's not the most
effective way to do it.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.330
So I'm going to use
an alternative called

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.210
an adjacency list.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.480
And the idea here is, for
every node in the graph.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.390
I'm going to associate with
it a list of destinations.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.910
That is, for a node,
what are the places

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.840
I can reach with a single edge?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.110
OK, so let's see what that
does if we want to build it.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.610
And yes, there's a
lot of code here,

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.630
but it's pretty easy
to look through I hope.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.324
Here's the choice
I'm going to make.

00:21:51.324 --> 00:21:52.240
Again, what's a graph?

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.180
It's a set of nodes.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.700
It's a set of edges.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.680
I'm going to have a way of
putting nodes into the graph.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.970
And I'm going to choose to, when
I put a node into the graph,

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.406
to store it as a
key in a dictionary.

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:06.700
OK?

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.800
When I initialize
the graph, I'm just

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.710
going to set this
internal variable, edges,

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.280
to be an empty dictionary.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.960
And the second
part of it is, when

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.840
I add an edge to the
graph between two

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.020
nodes from a source
to a destination,

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.254
I'm going to take that point
in the dictionary associated

00:22:25.254 --> 00:22:25.920
with the source.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.305
It's a key.

00:22:27.305 --> 00:22:28.680
And associated
with it, I'm going

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.830
to just have a list of
the nodes I can reach

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.464
from edges from that source.

00:22:34.464 --> 00:22:35.630
So notice what happens here.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.850
If I want to add
a node, remember,

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.700
it's a node not an edge--

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.310
I'll first check to make
sure that it's not already

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.840
in the dictionary.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.700
That little loop is
basic, or that if is

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.847
saying, if it's in this set
of keys, it will return true.

00:22:49.847 --> 00:22:50.930
And I'm going to complain.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.964
I'm trying to copy a
node or duplicate a node.

00:22:53.964 --> 00:22:55.130
Otherwise, notice what I do.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:56.750
When I put a node
into the dictionary,

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.750
I go into that
dictionary, edges.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:04.050
I create an entry with
the key that is the node.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.940
And the value I put in there
is initially an empty list.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.690
I'm going to say one
more piece carefully.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.570
It's a node not a name.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.740
And that's OK in Python.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.280
It is literally the
key is the node itself.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.825
It's an object, which
is what I'd like.

00:23:18.825 --> 00:23:21.070
All right, what if I
want to add an edge?

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.590
Well, an edge is going
to go from a source

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.800
to a destination node.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.704
So, I'm going to get out from
the edge the source piece.

00:23:30.704 --> 00:23:32.120
I'm going to get
out from the edge

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.310
the destination piece by
calling those methods.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.340
Again, notice the open-close
paren, which takes the method

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.540
and actually calls it.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.720
Because remember, an edge
was an object itself.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.870
Given those, I'll check
to make sure that they

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.030
are both in the dictionary.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.094
That is, I've already
added them to the graph.

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:50.760
I can't make a
connection between things

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.749
that aren't in the graph.

00:23:52.749 --> 00:23:54.540
And then notice the
nice little thing I do.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.030
Presuming I have both of
them in the dictionary,

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:02.470
I take the dictionary, I index
into it with the source node.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.240
That gives me a key
into the dictionary.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.660
I pull out the entry at
that point, which is a list,

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.520
because I created them up here.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.930
And I add the destination node
with append into the list,

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.660
stick it back in.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.980
So this now captures what
I said I wanted to do.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.660
The nodes are represented
as keys in the dictionary.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.400
And the edges are
represented by destinations

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.622
as values in the list
associated with the key.

00:24:29.622 --> 00:24:31.330
So you can see, if I
want to see is there

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.825
an edge between a source
and a destination,

00:24:34.825 --> 00:24:36.700
I would look at our
source in the dictionary,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.780
and then check in
the list to see

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.946
if the destination is there.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.599
OK, the rest of
this then follows

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:44.640
pretty straightforwardly.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.090
If I want to get all the
children of a particular node,

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.021
I just go into the
dictionary, edges,

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:52.020
and look up the value
associated with that node.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.490
It gives me back the list.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.380
I've got all the
things I can reach

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.890
from that particular node.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.570
If I want to know if a
node is in the graph,

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:05.070
I just search over the
keys of the dictionary.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.452
They'll either
return true or false.

00:25:07.452 --> 00:25:09.712
If I want to get a
node by its name, which

00:25:09.712 --> 00:25:12.170
is going to be probably more
convenient than trying to keep

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.030
track of all the
nodes, well I could

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.399
pass in a name as a string.

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:16.190
And what will I do?

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.340
I'll just search over all
the keys in the dictionary,

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.190
using the getName method
associated with it--

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.440
there's the call-- then
checking to see if it's

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.550
the thing I'm looking for.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:31.990
And if it is, I'll return M.
I'll return the node itself.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.435
What about this thing here?

00:25:34.435 --> 00:25:35.857
It might bother
you a little bit.

00:25:35.857 --> 00:25:36.440
Wait a minute.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.800
That raise, isn't it always
going to throw an error?

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.510
No, because I'm going to
go through this loop first.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.690
And if I actually find
a node, that return

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.170
is going to pop me out of
the call and return the node.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.690
So I'll only ever get
to this if in fact I

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.440
couldn't find anything here.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.830
And so it's an appropriate
way to simply raise the error

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.110
to say, if I get to this
point, couldn't find

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.240
it, raise an error to
say the node's not there.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.740
The last piece looks
a little funky,

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.073
Although you may have seen this.

00:26:04.073 --> 00:26:06.900
I like to print out
information about a graph.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.000
And I made a choice, which
is, I'm going to print out

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.180
all of the links in the graph.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.480
So I'm going to set up a string
initially here that's empty.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.440
And then I'm going to loop over
every key in the dictionary,

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.225
every node in the graph.

00:26:22.225 --> 00:26:25.040
And for each one, I'm going to
look at all the destinations.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.040
So notice, I take
the dictionary,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.600
I look up the things
at that point.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.230
That's a list.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.570
I loop over that.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.900
And I'm just going
to add in to result,

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.710
the name of the source,
an arrow, and the name

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.299
of the destination followed
by a carriage return.

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:40.840
I'll show you an
example in a second.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.000
But I'm simply walking down the
graph, saying for each source,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.900
what can it reach?

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.370
I'll print them all out.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.051
And then I'll return everything
but the last element.

00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:51.050
I'm going to throw away
the last carriage return

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.170
because I don't really need it.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:54.930
So let me show you
an example here,

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.900
trusting that my Python has
come up the way I wanted it to.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.940
So I'm going to load that in,
ignore that for the moment.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.580
And I'm going to set g to--

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.980
I've got something we're going
to come back to in a second

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.910
that actually creates a graph.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:17.130
And if I print out
g, it prints out,

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.560
in this case, all of the links
from source to destination,

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.680
each one on a new line.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.170
OK.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.800
So I can create the graphs.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.070
That was digraphs.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.700
Suppose I actually
want to get a graph.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.100
Well, I'm going to make it
as a subclass of digraph.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.550
And in particular, the
only thing I'm going to do

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.379
is I'm going to shadow the
addEdge method of digraphs.

00:27:49.379 --> 00:27:51.420
So if you think about it,
it's so I make a graph.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.920
If I ask it to add
edges, it's going

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.407
to use this version of addEdge.

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:56.490
And what am I going to do?

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:01.750
I know in a graph, I could
have both directions work.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:06.510
So, given an edge that I
want to add into this graph,

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.510
I'll use the method
from the digraph class.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.760
And I'll add an edge going
from source to destination.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.270
And then I'll just create
an edge the other direction.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.560
Destination becomes source.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.330
Source becomes destination.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.360
And I'll add that
into the graph.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.150
Nice and easy,
straightforward to do.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.360
And this is kind of nice
because, in a graph,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.760
I don't have any directionality
associated with the edge.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.968
I can go in either direction.

00:28:33.968 --> 00:28:35.665
I just created
something like that.

00:28:35.665 --> 00:28:37.290
And you might say,
well, wait a minute.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.770
Why did I pick graph to
be a subclass of digraph?

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.480
Why not the other way around?

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.620
Reasonable question, and you
actually know the answer.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.540
You've seen this before.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.010
One of the things
I'd like to have

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:53.730
is the property that if the
client code works correctly

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.800
using an instance
of the bigger type,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.570
it should also
work correctly when

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.600
it is using an instance of the
subtype substituted in, which

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.280
is another way of
saying anything that

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.450
works for a digraph will
also work for a graph,

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.340
but not vice versa.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.840
And as a consequence,
it's easier

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.884
to make the graph a
subclass of digraph.

00:29:13.884 --> 00:29:15.550
Notice the other thing
that's nice here.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.800
One little piece of
code, just change

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.540
what it means to make an edge.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.520
Everything else still holds.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.980
And also notice-- you've seen
this before-- how we nicely

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.190
inherit the method
from the subclass

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.400
by explicitly calling it.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.080
It says, from the digraph class,
get out the addEdge method

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.850
and apply it.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.650
OK.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.330
So we can build graphs.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.800
We're going to do
that in a second.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.250
Let's turn now to thinking about
I'd like to search on a graph.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.880
And I'm going to start with
the classic graph optimization

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.930
problem.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.890
I'd like to find
the best path home.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:54.200
So, what's the shortest path
from one node to another?

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.220
And that shortest path
initially will just

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.170
be the shortest
sequence of steps.

00:30:02.829 --> 00:30:04.620
I hope I'm not having
a little attack here.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.680
You just saw that
screen blank out, right?

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.510
The shortest path of
steps with the property

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:14.070
that the source of the first
edge is the starting point.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.659
The destination of
the last edge is

00:30:15.659 --> 00:30:16.950
the thing I'm trying to get to.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.200
And for any edge
in between, if I

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.860
go in my first edge from
source to say node one,

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.820
the next edge has that
destination as its source.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.320
So there's simply a chain that
says can go from here to here

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.170
to here to here to get
all the way through.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.120
And I'd like to find what's
the shortest number of steps?

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.370
Edges like that that will get
me from source to destination.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.760
Ultimately, if those edges
have weights on them,

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.620
the optimization problem
I'd like to solve

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.860
is, what's the shortest
weighted path, the shortest

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.494
amount of work I have to
do to get to those places?

00:30:49.494 --> 00:30:50.910
And if we can solve
one, we'll see

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:54.340
that we can solve the other
one pretty straightforwardly.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.940
And we've already seen examples
of shortest path problems.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.060
Clearly, finding a
route navigation is one.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.820
Designing communication networks
is another great example

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.425
of a shortest path problem.

00:31:05.425 --> 00:31:07.300
You'd like your message
to get to your friend

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.297
as quickly as possible
and not go as many times

00:31:09.297 --> 00:31:10.880
around the world
before it gets there.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.690
So what's the shortest amount
of time or the fewest links

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.550
I have to use to get there?

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:20.960
Lots of nice biological problems
that also captured this piece.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.180
So here is an example.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.020
And we're going to
use this to look

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.610
at two different
kinds of algorithms

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.900
to solve this problem.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.810
This is a little navigation
problem from a set of cities.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.850
Think of it as flight paths.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.500
If you're from
Arizona, my apologies.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.350
But once you get to Phoenix,
you can't get out of there

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.090
unless you grow from
the ashes, I guess.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.297
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:40.297 --> 00:31:42.130
But you know, it's a
way of dealing with how

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:43.820
to get around in places.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.814
And to think about this,
here's the representation

00:31:46.814 --> 00:31:47.980
that we'd have in the graph.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.650
The adjacency graph
here-- or adjacency list

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.180
here is, from Boston, I
can get to Providence.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.940
I can get to New York.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.250
From Providence, I
can get to Boston.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.110
I can get to New York.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:02.170
From New York, I can
only get to Chicago.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.630
Chicago, I can go to
Denver or Phoenix.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:06.700
Denver, I can go to
Phoenix or New York.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.580
And from L.A., you can
only come back to Boston.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.012
And Phoenix has no
exits out of it.

00:32:12.012 --> 00:32:13.345
So there is that representation.

00:32:13.345 --> 00:32:14.678
I just want to let you see that.

00:32:14.678 --> 00:32:15.310
Right?

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.660
There are the keys
in the dictionary.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.880
They're all the nodes.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.640
And there, each
one of those lists

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.700
is a set of edges from the
source to the destination.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.440
OK.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.365
How would I build this?

00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:31.740
Well this is the
code I just ran.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.210
I just want to show it to you.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:37.290
I notice, by the way, in the
slides I distributed earlier,

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.700
the return g is missing there.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.670
If you want to correct it,
I'll repost it later on.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:43.530
I'm going to create a
little function that's

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.090
going to build a city graph.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.850
I'm going to pass in a type
of graph, which I will then

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:48.660
call to create it.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.180
So I could make
this as a digraph.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.550
I could make it as a graph.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.970
I'm going to start off
with it as a digraph.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:55.320
And then notice what I do here.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.530
I just run over a little
loop with a set of names,

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.160
creating a node with
that name and then

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.282
adding it into the graph.

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:06.780
All right, so node
is a class instance.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.370
It creates-- or a
class definition--

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.840
it creates an instance.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.100
And once I've got that, addNode
as a method on the graph.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.060
It will simply add it in.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.170
And then this set here, is
simply adding in the edges.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:19.920
And I can do that.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.300
I'm capturing what I had
on that previous slide.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.420
And on a given
name to getNode, it

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.710
will get out the actual node.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:29.830
And I use that coming
out of the graph g.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.870
I do the same thing
with the getNode

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.730
from graph g for Providence.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.770
And then I make an
edge out of that.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:39.940
And then I use the method from
the graph to add the edge.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.710
If this looks like
a lot of code,

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:42.877
yeah, it's a lot of words.

00:33:42.877 --> 00:33:44.210
But it's pretty straightforward.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.900
I'm literally creating
nodes with the names,

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.820
using the appropriate
methods, creating an edge,

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.967
adding it into the graph.

00:33:50.967 --> 00:33:53.300
And when I'm done, I'm just
going to return the graph g.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.170
OK.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.600
Now I want to find
the shortest path.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.030
I'm going to show you two
techniques for doing this.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:08.352
The first one is called
depth first search.

00:34:08.352 --> 00:34:10.560
It's similar to something
Professor Guttag showed you

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.400
when you sort of took the
left most depth first method

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.469
in terms of a search tree.

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:19.320
The one trick here is, because
I've got graphs not trees,

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.989
there are the
potential for loops.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:23.962
So I'm simply going to keep
track of what's in the path.

00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:25.920
And I'm never going to
go back to a node that's

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.753
already in the path.

00:34:26.753 --> 00:34:29.610
So I don't just run in circles
going from New York to Boston

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.880
to New York to
Boston constantly.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.150
All right.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.487
So, the second thing
I'm going to do here

00:34:36.487 --> 00:34:38.570
is I'm going to take
advantage of a problem you've

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:42.860
seen before, which is this is
literally a version of divide

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.977
and conquer.

00:34:43.977 --> 00:34:44.810
What does that mean?

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.060
If I want to find a
path from a source node

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.489
to destination
node, if I can find

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:52.670
a path to some intermediate
node from source intermediate,

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.790
and then I find a path from
intermediate to destination,

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:59.720
the combination is obviously
a path the entire way.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.120
So recursively, I can
just break this down

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.390
into simpler and simpler
versions of that search

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.430
problem.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.910
So here's the idea behind
depth first search.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.860
Start off with that source
node, that initial node.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.390
I'm going to look
at all the edges

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.260
that leave that
node in some order,

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.190
however order it was
put into the system.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.602
And I'm going to
follow the first edge.

00:35:21.602 --> 00:35:23.560
I'll check to see if I'm
at the right location.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.430
If I am, I'm done.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.300
If I'm not, I'm going to
follow the first edge out

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.840
of that node.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.700
So I'm actually creating
a little loop here.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.100
And I'm going to keep doing that
until I either find the goal

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.750
node or I run out of options.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:41.350
So let me show you an example.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.370
I've got a little search
tree here, a very simple one.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:45.580
Here's my source.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.481
There is my destination.

00:35:47.481 --> 00:35:49.480
In depth first, I'm going
to start at the source

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.290
and go down the first path.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.640
See if I'm at the right place.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.020
I'm not.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.730
So I'm going to take
the first path out

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.550
of here, which
might be that one.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:00.990
See if I'm in the right place.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.490
Actually, let me
not do it that way.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.280
Let me do it this way.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.850
Am I in the right place?

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:07.505
I'm not.

00:36:07.505 --> 00:36:09.330
So I'm going to take
the first path out

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:12.676
of this one, which
gets me there.

00:36:12.676 --> 00:36:14.050
I'm still not in
the right place,

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:17.907
so I'm going to take the
first path out of that one.

00:36:17.907 --> 00:36:19.740
And you can see why
it's called depth first.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.320
I'm going as deep, if you
like, in this graph as I can,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.840
from here, to there, to
there, to there, to there.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.884
At this stage, I'm stuck.

00:36:27.884 --> 00:36:29.300
There is no place
to go to, so I'm

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.037
going to go back to this node
and say, is there another edge?

00:36:33.037 --> 00:36:35.120
In this case there isn't,
so I'll go back to here.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.360
There's not another edge.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.580
Go back to here.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.050
There is another edge.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:42.710
So I'm going to
go this direction.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.950
And from here, I'll
look down there.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.147
OK, notice I'm now going depth
first down the next chain.

00:36:50.147 --> 00:36:51.230
There's nothing from here.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.920
I backtrack.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.045
There's nothing from there.

00:36:53.045 --> 00:36:54.110
I backtrack over to here.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.060
There's no additional
choices there,

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:01.030
so go all the way back to
here to follow that one.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.360
And then we'll go down this one
again, backtrack, backtrack,

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:09.950
and eventually I find the
thing I'm looking for.

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:15.060
Depth first-- following
my way down this path.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.920
So let's write the
code for-- yes ma'am?

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.753
AUDIENCE: Pardon me.

00:37:17.753 --> 00:37:19.680
Is the choice of
depth first node

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.707
we go down, is that random?

00:37:21.707 --> 00:37:23.540
PROFESSOR: The question
is, which node do I,

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.245
or which edge do I choose?

00:37:25.245 --> 00:37:27.430
It's however I stored
it in the system.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:30.136
So since it's a list, I'm
going to just make that choice.

00:37:30.136 --> 00:37:31.760
I could have other
ways of deciding it.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.210
But think of it as,
yeah, essentially random,

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.900
which one I would pick.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.740
OK, let's look at the code.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:40.520
Don't panic.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.170
It's not as bad as it looks.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:45.549
It actually just
captures that idea.

00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:47.090
Ignore for the moment
this down here.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.298
It's just going to set it up.

00:37:48.298 --> 00:37:50.780
Depth first search, I'm going
to give it a graph, a start

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:54.572
node, an end node, and a path
that got me to that start

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:56.030
node, which initially
is just going

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:59.690
to be an empty list,
something that tells me what's

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.327
the shortest path
I've found so far,

00:38:01.327 --> 00:38:02.660
which would be my best solution?

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.970
And then just a little flag
here if I want to print out

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.430
things along the way.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.540
What do I do?

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.480
I set up path to add
in the start node.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.020
So if path initially
is an empty list,

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.090
the first time around is
just, here's the node I'm at.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.689
I print out some stuff and
then I say, see if I'm done.

00:38:20.689 --> 00:38:21.980
I'm just going to stay at home.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.624
I'm not going to go anywhere.

00:38:23.624 --> 00:38:25.540
Unlikely to happen, but
you'll see recursively

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.340
why this is going to be nice.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.860
If I'm not done,
then notice the loop.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.960
I'm going to loop over all the
children of the start node.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.400
Those are the edges I can reach.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.470
Then those I can reach
with a single edge.

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:39.927
I pick the first one.

00:38:39.927 --> 00:38:41.760
And in answer to the
question, in this case,

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.968
it would be the order in
which I started in the list.

00:38:43.968 --> 00:38:45.570
I just pick that one up.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:49.350
I then say, let's make sure
it's not already in the path

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:51.480
because I want to avoid loops.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.610
And assuming it
isn't, and assuming

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:57.360
I don't yet have a solution,
or the best solution I have

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.700
is smaller than what
I've done so far,

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:05.310
oh, cool, just do
the same search.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.180
So notice, there's
that nice recursion.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.290
Right?

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.430
I'm going to explore.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.726
I just picked the first
option out of that first node.

00:39:12.726 --> 00:39:14.350
And the first thing
I do is try and see

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.060
if there's a path from that
node using the same thing.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.869
So it's literally like
I picked this one.

00:39:18.869 --> 00:39:20.410
I don't care about
those other edges.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:24.600
I'm going to try and
take this search down.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.130
When it comes back
with a solution,

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.810
as long as there
is a solution, I'll

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.430
say that's my best
solution so far.

00:39:33.557 --> 00:39:34.640
And then I go back around.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.410
Now this last little
piece here is just,

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.335
if in fact the node's
already in the path,

00:39:38.335 --> 00:39:39.710
I'm just going to
print something

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.418
that says don't keep
doing it because you

00:39:41.418 --> 00:39:43.400
don't need to keep going on.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.280
And I'm going to do that loop,
taking all the paths down

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.010
until it comes back.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:51.860
And only at that stage do
I go to the next portion

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.780
around this loop.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.820
The piece down here
just sets this up,

00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:01.800
calling it with an initial
empty list for path

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.130
and no solution for shortest.

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.060
So it's just a nice way of
putting a wrap around it that

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:09.430
gets things started up.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.352
This may look a little funky.

00:40:11.352 --> 00:40:13.700
It may look a
little bit twisted.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.302
So let's see if it actually
does what we'd expect it to.

00:40:17.302 --> 00:40:19.760
And to do that I'm just going
to be a little test function.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.551
I'm going to build that
city graph I'm just

00:40:21.551 --> 00:40:22.927
going to call "Shortest Path."

00:40:22.927 --> 00:40:24.010
I'm going to print it out.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.468
And I'd like to
see, is there a way

00:40:25.468 --> 00:40:28.160
to get from Boston to Chicago?

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:33.350
So let's go back over to
my Python and try that out.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:36.100
And I've got a call for that.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.470
Oh, and it prints out.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.814
I start off-- oh, so I
did it the wrong way.

00:40:39.814 --> 00:40:40.980
It's from Chicago to Boston.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.870
Yes, Chicago to Denver
to Phoenix, from Denver

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:48.530
to New York, it comes back and
says, I've already visited.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:52.255
Basically concludes I can't
get from Chicago to Boston.

00:40:52.255 --> 00:40:54.012
It's just printing
out each stage.

00:40:54.012 --> 00:40:55.720
Let's actually look
at that a little more

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.190
carefully to see
how it got there.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.110
So there's my example.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.630
There is the adjacency list.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.250
And here's what happens.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.180
I start off in Chicago.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.150
So that's my first node.

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:14.140
From Chicago, the first
edge goes to Denver.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.770
Denver is not what
I'm looking for.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.350
But since I am in
Denver, recursively I'm

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:19.400
going to call it again.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.220
So the first edge out
of there is to Phoenix.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.220
Again, sorry if you're
from Arizona and Phoenix.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.810
There's nowhere to go.

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.870
So I'm going to
have to backtrack.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.594
And that will take
me back up to Denver.

00:41:31.594 --> 00:41:32.760
And I look at the next edge.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.080
It takes me to New York.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.067
From New York I'd
like to go to Chicago.

00:41:37.067 --> 00:41:38.650
But oh, that's nice
because, remember,

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.620
that first check it says, is
Chicago already in the path?

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.610
It is.

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:45.520
I don't want to loop,
because otherwise I'm

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.330
simply going to go around
and around and around here.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.170
And it may be good for
frequent flyer miles,

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:53.630
but it's not a great way to get
to where you're trying to go.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.584
So I break out of it.

00:41:55.584 --> 00:41:57.000
And now, what else
do I have left?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.500
Chicago to Denver I've explored.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.850
I'll look at Chicago to Phoenix.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.308
From Phoenix there's
nowhere to go.

00:42:01.308 --> 00:42:02.570
I go back up to Chicago.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:04.200
There are no more paths.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.960
I'm done.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.080
OK.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.540
Now, it turns out
you can actually

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.630
get somewhere in this graph.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:11.850
So here's just another example.

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:13.266
I'm simply going
to show you, if I

00:42:13.266 --> 00:42:15.650
want to go from
Boston to Phoenix,

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:17.030
notice the set of stages.

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:18.920
And you can see, notice
how at each stage

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.090
it tends to be growing.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.089
That's that depth first.

00:42:21.089 --> 00:42:22.940
I'm exploring the edges.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.430
I find a path.

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:26.790
That's great.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:29.140
But is it the shortest path?

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.220
I don't know.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.190
So having found that path, I
try and take the next branch,

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:35.200
which finds a loop.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.860
And I keep moving through
this, finding paths

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.080
until I look at all
the possible paths

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.692
and I actually return
the shortest path.

00:42:45.692 --> 00:42:47.150
You can try running
the code on it.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.130
But what I want you to
see is, again, this idea

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.600
that I can explore it.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.420
But in fact, I'm going
to have to explore it

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.310
in a particular order.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.810
But there is depth first search.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.430
It will find a solution for me.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.360
Alternative, it's what's
called breadth first search.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.810
Sounds almost the same.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:08.810
Again, I'm going to start
off with initial load.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:10.434
I'm going to look at
all the edges that

00:43:10.434 --> 00:43:11.810
leave that node, in some order.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.210
I'm going to follow the
first edge as before

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.830
and see if I'm at
the right place.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:20.510
If I'm not, I'm going
to follow the next edge

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:22.730
and do the same thing.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.700
So whereas this went
down through the tree

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.440
as deeply as it could of
the graph, in breadth first,

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.030
I'm going to start off
taking that edge as before.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:32.172
I'm not done.

00:43:32.172 --> 00:43:33.880
I'm going to keep
track of that in case I

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.005
want to explore more of it.

00:43:35.005 --> 00:43:38.410
But I'm going to go back over
here and follow that edge.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:39.330
I'm not done.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.040
Again, I'll keep track of that,
but I'll come back up here

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.345
and explore that one.

00:43:43.345 --> 00:43:48.490
And oh, cool, I found a
solution in three steps.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.890
I've reached the destination.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:52.660
And notice, because
I'm exploring

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.990
all the paths of
length one before I

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.790
get to paths of length two.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:01.450
Once I find a solution,
I can stop because I

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:03.280
know it's the shortest path.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.200
Any other path through
here would be longer

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.720
than that particular solution.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.810
So the loop here is
a little different.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.200
I'm looking over all
the paths of length one.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.940
There are all the
paths of length two.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.648
And the one thing I'm
going to have to do

00:44:16.648 --> 00:44:19.292
is I'm going to have to keep
track of the remaining options

00:44:19.292 --> 00:44:21.000
here in case I have
to come down to them.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.958
Because if I didn't find
it at the first level,

00:44:22.958 --> 00:44:27.618
then I come down here and
look at things of length two.

00:44:27.618 --> 00:44:28.572
OK?

00:44:28.572 --> 00:44:31.610
So let's build that code.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:36.442
Breadth first search, or
BFS, again, a graph, a start,

00:44:36.442 --> 00:44:38.900
and an end node, something that
would just print things out

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.540
as I go along.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.720
My initial path is
just the start point.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.300
But now I've got to keep track
of what are the paths that I

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.670
have yet to explore?

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.170
And so for that,
I'm going to create

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:53.700
something called a queue.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:57.570
And a queue is going
to be a list of paths.

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.280
Remember, a path
is a list of nodes.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.960
A queue is going to
be a list of paths.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.580
So the initial queue is
just where I've started.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.150
And then, as long as I've got
something still to explore

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.610
and I haven't found
a solution, I'm

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.760
going to pop off the
queue the oldest element,

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.640
the thing at the beginning.

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.790
That's my temporary path.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:18.920
I'll print out some
information about it.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.320
And then I'll grab the
last element of that path.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.160
That's the last
point in that path.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.170
And I'll now explore.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:27.520
Is it the thing I'm looking for?

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.730
In which case I'm done.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.370
I'll return the path.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:35.470
Otherwise, for each node that
you can reach from that point,

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:39.410
create a new path by adding
that on the end of this path

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:43.062
and add it into the queue
at the end of the queue.

00:45:43.062 --> 00:45:44.520
So I'm going to
keep looping around

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.470
here until I either
find a solution here,

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:48.890
which I'll return.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:52.220
And if I get through all of
it, I'm going to return none.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.710
And right there, there
is that nice thing where

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.530
once I find a solution, I
know it's the shortest thing,

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.820
I can stop.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.245
OK, let's look at
an example of this.

00:46:03.245 --> 00:46:05.120
So I'm going to go back
over to Python, where

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.320
I've got a version of this.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:12.552
I'm going to comment that out.

00:46:12.552 --> 00:46:14.450
And down here in
breadth first search,

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.201
I've actually added a
little piece of code

00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:17.825
that I don't have in
the handout that's

00:46:17.825 --> 00:46:19.940
going to print out the
queue as well so we can see

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.990
what happens when we call this.

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:26.330
So let's take a look at it.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:28.330
My initial call, there's
one thing in the queue.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:29.200
It's just Boston.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.360
I started in Boston.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:35.530
So the current path
is to start in Boston.

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.660
I take that element
off the queue,

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.360
and I say what are the things
I can reach from Boston?

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.730
Oh, nice, I put two things in.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:44.230
I can get from
Boston to Providence.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.780
I can get from
Boston to New York.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.280
The top thing is
gone off the queue.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:48.820
I popped it.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.194
I've replaced it
with two things.

00:46:50.194 --> 00:46:53.200
Or I take this, and
say, OK, from Boston

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.260
to Providence, where can
I get from Providence?

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.500
Oh, I can get to New York.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.680
So I put that in the queue.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.090
This has gone off.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:02.692
That one is still there.

00:47:02.692 --> 00:47:04.150
And I do that
because I haven't yet

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.399
reached the thing I'm looking
for, which was, I think,

00:47:06.399 --> 00:47:08.291
Phoenix I was trying to get to.

00:47:08.291 --> 00:47:09.790
And you could see
at each stage, I'm

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:11.590
taking the top
thing off the queue,

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:14.170
and asking for all the
things that I can get to,

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:16.370
and adding them to it.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.420
And notice, in some cases,
it may be more than one.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.270
For example, which
one do I want here?

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:25.420
Right here, if I take
Boston, New York to Chicago,

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.470
from Chicago I
can get to Denver.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:28.630
So there's one new path.

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:30.490
I can also get to Phoenix.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.030
There's a second new path.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:36.500
Also notice how they
are only growing slowly

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.260
as I build them out.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.350
And in fact, if we go back,
we can see that nicely

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:44.410
by looking at what happens if
we were to actually trace this

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:46.240
along.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.100
So Boston to Phoenix,
I start at Boston.

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.840
Then I look at
that and then that.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.390
Those are all the
paths of length one.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:56.880
Having exhausted
those, oh nice, I'm

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.970
looking at paths of length two,
and then paths of length three,

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:03.900
and then paths the
length four, until I

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:07.550
found the one that I wanted.

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:10.660
And here's one other
way of looking at it.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:15.550
Breadth first says, I'll look
at each path of length one.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.460
And then, oh yes,
I avoid the loop.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.060
I look at each
path of length two,

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.400
then paths of length
three, until I actually

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.700
find the solution.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.730
Subtle difference,
different performance.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:32.890
Depth first, I'm
always following

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.910
the next available edge until
I get stuck and I backtrack.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:40.750
Breadth first, I'm always
exploring the next equal length

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:41.890
option.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:43.960
And I just have to keep
track in that queue

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.050
of the things I have left to
do as I walk my way through.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:53.540
What about weighted
shortest path?

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.220
Well, as the
mathematicians say, we

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.380
leave this is an easy
exercise for the reader.

00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.630
It's a little unfair.

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:02.990
The idea would be, imagine on
my edges, it's not just a step,

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:04.520
but I have a weight.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.650
Flying to L.A. Is a
little longer than flying

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:08.510
from Boston to New York.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.330
What I'd like to do is do the
same kind of optimization,

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:14.330
but now just minimizing the sum
of the weights on the edges,

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:17.420
not the number of edges.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.160
As you might guess,
depth first search

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.680
is easily modified to do this.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.420
The cost now would
simply be what's

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:24.500
the sum of those weights?

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.750
And again, I would have to
search all possible options

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:29.150
till I find a solution.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:30.710
Unfortunately,
breadth first search

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:35.900
can't easily be modified because
the short weighted path may

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.970
have many more than the
minimum number of loops.

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:39.678
And I'd have to think
about how to adjust

00:49:39.678 --> 00:49:43.100
it to make that happen.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.980
But to pull it together,
here's a new model--

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.440
graphs.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.030
Great way of
representing networks,

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:52.790
collections of entities with
relationships between them.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:55.540
There are lots of nice
graph optimization problems.

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.310
And we've just shown you
two examples of that.

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.910
But we'll come back to more
examples as we go along.

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:03.420
And with that, we'll
see you next time.
