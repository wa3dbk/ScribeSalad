JOHN GUTTAG: Hi, everybody.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.154
Welcome back to class.

00:00:39.154 --> 00:00:40.820
I have a lot to cover
today, so I'm just

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.600
going to get right to it.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.440
So you may remember at
the end of last lecture,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160
I talked about
the Empirical Rule

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.120
and said that there were
a couple of assumptions

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.160
underlying it.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.380
That one is the mean
estimation error is zero.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.200
And second, that the
distribution of errors

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.140
will be normally distributed.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.819
I didn't probably
mention at the time,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.060
but we often call this
distribution Gaussian

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.180
after the astronomer Carl Gauss.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.345
And it looks like that.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.250
Normal distributions are very
easy to generate in Python.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.290
I have a little example
here of generating, not

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.020
a real normal distribution,
but a discrete approximation

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.520
of one.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.260
And the thing to really
notice about it here

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.380
is this line random.gauss.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.720
So that's a built in function
of the random library.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.280
The first argument is the mean.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.920
And the second argument
is the standard deviation

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.970
or a mu and sigma as
they're usually called.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.300
Every time I call that,
I will get a different--

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.330
or usually a
different random value

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.260
drawn from a Gaussian with
the mean, in this case of 0

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.430
and a standard deviation of 100.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.990
I'm then going to
produce a plot of those

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.270
so you can see
what it looks like.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.760
And I'm going to do that
using some things we

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.735
haven't seen before.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.880
So first of all,
we've seen histograms.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.270
So pylab.hist
produces a histogram.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.540
Bins tells us how many bins
we want in the histogram.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.280
I said we want 100.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.240
The default is 10.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.190
Dist is the values
it will use for it.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.960
And then this is something we
haven't seen before, weights.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.540
Weights is a keyword argument.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.640
So normally when we
produce a histogram,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.980
we take all of the values,
the minimum to the maximum,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.760
and in this case, we would
divide them into 100 bins,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.490
because I said, bins equals 100.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.790
So the first bin
might be, well, let's

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.030
say we only had values
ranging from 0 to 100.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.360
The first bin would be all
the 0's, all the 1's up to all

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.960
the 99's.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.410
And it weights each
value in the bin by 1.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.560
So if the bin had 10
values falling in it,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.340
the y-axis would be a 10.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.680
If the bin had 50
values falling in it,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.470
the y-axis would go up to 50.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.190
You can tell it
how much you want

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.600
to weight each bin, the
elements in the bins.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.570
And say, no, I don't want
them each to count as 1,

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.290
I want them to count
as a half or a quarter,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.990
and that will change the y-axis.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.980
So that's what I've done here.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.480
What I've said is
I've created a list

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.450
and I want to say for
each of the bins--

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.010
in this case I'm going to weigh
each of them the same way--

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.310
the weight is going to be 1
over the number of samples.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.910
I'm multiplying it by
the len of dist, that

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.220
will be how many items I have.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.660
And that will tell me how much
each one is being weighted.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:38.380
So for example, if I
have, say, 1,000 items,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.870
I could give 1,000
values and say,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.660
I want this item
weighted by 1, and I

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.580
want this item over here
weighted by 12 or a half.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.450
We rarely do that.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.860
Usually, what we want is to
give each item the same weight.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.150
So why would I want it not
to be weighted at just one?

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.760
Because I want my y-axis to
be more easily interpreted,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.820
and essentially give me
the fraction of the values

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.990
that fell in that bin.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.660
And that's what I'm doing here.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.570
The other new thing
I'm doing here

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.900
is the plotting
commands, including

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.250
pylab.hist, many of
them return values.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.800
Usually, I just ignore
that value when we just

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.280
say pylab.plot or pylab.hist.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.820
Here I am taking the value.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.710
The value in this
case for a histogram

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.560
is a tuple of length 2.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.030
The first element is
a list or an array,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.540
giving me how many
items are in each bin.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.740
And the second is
the patches used

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.660
to produce the beautiful
pictures we're use to seeing.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.560
So here what I'm going
to do is take this value

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.360
so that I can do
this at the end.

00:06:11.456 --> 00:06:13.330
Now, why would I want
to look at the fraction

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.820
within approximately
200 of the mean?

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.070
What is that going to
correspond to in this case?

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.540
Well, if I divide
200 by 2 I get 100.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.710
Which happens to be
the standard deviation.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.730
So in this case, what I'm
going to be looking at

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.150
is what fraction
of the values fall

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.970
within two standard
deviations of the mean?

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.740
Kind of a check on the
empirical rule, right?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.600
All right, when I run
the code I get this.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.350
So it is a discrete
approximation

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.150
to the probability
density function.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.270
You'll notice, unlike
the previous picture

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.830
I showed you which was nice
and smooth, this is jaggedy.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.600
You would expect it to be.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.800
And again, you can see it's
very nice that the peak is what

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.230
we said the mean should be, 0.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.240
And then it falls off.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.200
And indeed, slightly
more than 95%

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.666
fall within two standard
deviations of the mean.

00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:30.490
I'm not even surprised that
it's a little bit more than 95%

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.560
because, remember the magic
number is 1.96, not 2.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.820
But since this is
only a finite sample,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.860
I only want it to be around 95.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.770
I'm not going to worry too much
whether it's bigger or smaller.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.180
All right?

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.670
So random.gauss does a nice job
of giving us Gaussian values.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.580
We plotted them and now
you can see that I've

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.100
got the relative frequency.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:06.400
That's why I see fractions in
the y-axis rather than counts.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.400
And that would be because of the
way I use the weights command.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.360
All right, let's return to PDFs.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.240
So as we said last
time, distributions

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.090
can be defined by Probability
Density Functions,

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.000
and that gives us
the probability

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.980
of some random variable
lying between two values.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.890
It defines a curve where
the values in the x-axis

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.990
lie between the minimum and
maximum values of the variable.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.000
And it's the area
under the curve--

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.980
and we'll come back to this--

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.650
between those two
points that give us

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.010
the probability of an example
falling in that range.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.960
So now let's look at it
for a normal distribution.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.680
You may recall from the last
lecture this rather exotic

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:02.380
looking formula which defines a
PDF for a normal distribution.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.580
And here's some code
that's as straight forward

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:13.720
an implementation as one could
imagine of this formula, OK.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.900
So that now is a
value that, given

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.610
a mu and a sigma and an x,
gives me the x associated

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:26.810
with that mu and sigma, OK?

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.770
And you'll notice there's
nothing random about this.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.030
All right, it is
giving me the value.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.215
Now, let's go down here.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.380
And I'm going to,
for a set of x's, get

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:53.010
the set of y's corresponding
to that and then plot it.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.170
I'm going to set
mu to 0 and sigma

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.260
to 1, the so-called standard
normal distribution.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:05.690
And I'm going to look at the
distribution from minus 4 to 4.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.240
Nothing magic about that
other than, as you'll see,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.450
it's kind of a place where
it asymptotes near 0.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.420
So while x is less
than 4, I'll get

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.980
the x-value, I'll get the
y-value corresponding to that x

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.440
by calling Gaussian,
increment x by 0.05

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.810
and do that until I'm done.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.680
And then simply, I'll plot the
x-values against the y-values

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.940
and throw a title on
it using pylab.title.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.270
All right, code make sense?

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.550
Well, this is where I got
that beautiful picture

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.840
we've looked at before.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.740
When I plotted here, it
looks, actually quite smooth.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.820
It's not, it's really connecting
a bunch of tiny little lines

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.950
but I made the points
close enough together

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.180
that it looks at least here
smooth at this resolution.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.840
So we know what the
values on the x-axis are.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.300
Those are the values
I happen to want

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.560
to look at, from minus 4 to 4.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.180
What are the values
on the y-axis?

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.710
We kind of would like
to interpret them

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.170
as probabilities, right?

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.800
But we could be pretty
suspicious about that

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.280
and then if we take this
one point that's up here,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.540
we say the probability of
that single point is 0.4.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.690
Well, that doesn't make any
sense because, in fact, we

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.740
know the probability
of any particular point

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.850
is 0 in some sense, right?

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:58.670
So furthermore, if I chose
a different value for sigma,

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:05.200
I can actually get this to go
bigger than 1 on the y-axis.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.240
So if you take sigma
to be say, 0.1--

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.480
I think the y-axis goes
up to something like 40.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.290
So we know we don't have
probabilities in the range 40.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.710
So if these aren't
probabilities, what are they?

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.530
What are the y values?

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.950
Well, not too surprising
since I claimed

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:32.670
this was a probability density
function, they're densities.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.270
Well, what's a density?

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.400
This makes sense.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.460
I'll say it and then
I'll try and explain it.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.120
It's a derivative of the
cumulative distribution

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.540
function.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.850
Now, why are we talking about
derivatives in the first place?

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.960
Well, remember what
we're trying to say.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.340
If we want to ask, what's the
probability of a value falling

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.110
between here and here,
we claim that that

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:10.380
was going to be the area under
this curve, the integral.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.960
Well, as you know
from 18.01, there's

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.620
a very clear relationship
between derivatives

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.750
and integrals.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.460
And so if we interpret each of
these points as a derivative,

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.310
in some sense the
slope here, then we

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.040
can look at this
as the area just

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.570
by integrating under there.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.790
So to interpret a PDF, we
always do it mathematically.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.260
Actually, I do it
just by looking at it.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.420
But the only really interesting
mathematical questions to ask

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.400
have to do with area.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.950
Once we have the
area, we can, then,

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.390
talk about the probabilities
of some value falling

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.920
within a region of the curve.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.070
So what's interesting
here is not

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:06.930
the numbers per se on the y-axis
but the shape of the curve,

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.240
because those numbers
have to be related

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.190
to the numbers on the
x-axis, dx, dy right?

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.860
We're looking at derivatives.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.300
All right, so now, we have
to talk about integration.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.700
I promise you'll only hear
about it for another few minutes

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.730
then we'll leave the topic.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.520
So I mentioned before
SciPy as a library

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.780
that contains a lot of useful
mathematical functions.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.295
One of them is integrate.quad.

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:43.790
Well, the integrate
part is obvious.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.440
It means integration.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.930
Quad is telling you
the algorithm it's

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.240
choosing to do the integration.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.945
All of these integrals are going
to be actual approximations

00:14:54.945 --> 00:14:55.820
to the real integral.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.010
SciPy is not doing
some clever mathematics

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.900
to get an analytical solution.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.520
It's using a numerical technique
to approximate the integral.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.490
And the one here happens
to be called quadrature,

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.810
it doesn't matter.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.400
All right, you can pass
it up to four arguments.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.930
You must pass it to
function to be integrated,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.540
that makes sense.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.810
A number representing the lower
limit of the integration--

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.160
you need to give it that.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.290
A number representing
the upper limit--

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.150
you need to give it that.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.450
And then the fourth
argument is a tuple

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.490
supplying all values
for the arguments,

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:48.050
except the first of the
function you are integrating.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.270
I'll show you an example
of that on the next slide.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.640
And we'll see that it returns
a tuple, an approximation

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.730
to the result, what it
thinks the integral is,

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.940
and an estimate
of how much error

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.040
there might be in that one.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.780
We'll ignore the
error for the moment.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.020
All right, let's
look at the code.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.685
So we start by importing
scipy.integrate.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.460
That gives us all the
different integration methods.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.250
I'm not going to show
you the code for Gaussian

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.750
since I showed it to you
a couple of minutes ago.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.750
But I wanted you to
remember that it takes three

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:32.480
arguments, x, mu, and sigma.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.460
Because when we get down
here to the integration,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:44.180
we'll pass at the function
Gaussian and then the values

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.890
that we want to integrate over.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:56.250
So those will be the values
that x can take upon.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:02.330
And that will change
as we go from mu

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.060
minus the number of standard
deviations times sigma

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.220
to mu plus the number
of standard deviations

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.800
times sigma.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.819
And then, this is the optional
fourth argument, the tuple, mu,

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.460
and sigma.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.740
Why do I need to pass that in?

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.089
Because Gaussian is a ternary
argument, or a function

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.460
that takes three values.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.770
And I'm going to
integrate over values

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:32.830
of x so I have to fix mu and
sigma to constants, which

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.080
is what I'm doing down here.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.390
And then I'll take
the zeroth value,

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.320
which is its estimate
of the integral.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.980
All right, so that's
the new thing.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.980
The rest of the code is
all stuff you've seen.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.680
For t and range
number of trials,

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.760
I'm going to choose a random
mu between minus 10 and 10

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.790
and a random sigma
between 1 and 10.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.070
It doesn't matter what
those constants are.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.500
And then for the number
of standard deviations

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:10.430
in 1, 1.96, and 3,
I'm going to integrate

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:16.720
Gaussian over that range.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.800
And then we're just going
to see how many of them

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.864
fall within that range.

00:18:21.864 --> 00:18:23.280
In some sense,
what we're doing is

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.090
we're checking the
empirical rule.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.590
We're saying, take the Gaussian.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.270
I don't care what
mu and sigma are.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.010
It doesn't matter.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.490
The empirical rule will
still hold, I think.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.481
But we're just
checking it here, OK?

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.370
Well, here are the results.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.655
So from mu equals 9
and sigma equals 6,

00:18:46.655 --> 00:18:49.400
I happened to
choose those, we'll

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:55.380
see the fracture within 1,
fraction within 1.96 and 3.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.800
And so for these
random mus and sigmas,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.440
you can see that all
of them-- and you

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.190
can set them to whatever
you want when you

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.380
get your hand them the code.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:10.880
Essentially, what we have is,
whoops, the empirical rule

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.430
actually works.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.120
One of those beautiful cases
where you can test the theory

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.674
and see that the
theory really is sound.

00:19:21.674 --> 00:19:25.340
So there we go.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.240
So why am I making such a big
deal of normal distributions?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.910
They have lots of nice
mathematical properties,

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.142
some of which we've
already talked about.

00:19:34.142 --> 00:19:35.600
But all of that
would be irrelevant

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.020
if we didn't see them.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.110
The good news is they're
all over the place.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.900
I've just taken a few here.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.320
Up here we'll see SAT scores.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.900
I would never show that
to high school students,

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.260
or GREs to you guys.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.020
But you can see that
they are amazingly

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.944
well-distributed along
a normal distribution.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:09.420
On down here, this is plotting
percent change in oil prices.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:14.380
And again, we see something very
close to a normal distribution.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.350
And here is just looking at
heights of men and women.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.980
And again, they clearly
look very normal.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:29.970
So it's really quite impressive
how often they occur.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.630
But not everything is normal.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.360
So we saw that
the empirical rule

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.600
works for normal distributions.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.230
I won't say I proved it for you.

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.915
I illustrated it for you
with a bunch of examples.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.640
But are the outcomes of the
spins of a roulette wheel

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.140
normal?

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.390
No.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.430
They're totally uniform, right?

00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:01.650
Everything is equally probable--
a 4, a 6, an 11, a 13, double-0

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.330
if you're in Las Vegas.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.370
They're all equally probable.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.750
So if I plotted
those, I'd basically

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.580
just get a straight
line with everything

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:17.060
at 1 over however many
pockets there are.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:23.810
So in that case, why does
the empirical rule work?

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:28.040
We saw that we were doing
some estimates about returns

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.400
and we used the empirical
rule, we checked it

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.560
and, by George, it was
telling us the truth.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.470
And the reason is
because we're not

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.620
reasoning about a
single spin of the wheel

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.450
but about the mean
of a set of spins.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.910
So if you think about it,
what we were reasoning about

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.820
was the return of betting.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.190
If we look at one spin--

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.680
well, let's say we bet $1.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.060
The return is either minus 1
because we've lost our dollar.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.360
Or if we get lucky and our
pocket happens to come up,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.460
it was 36, I think, or 35.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.090
I forget which, OK?

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.560
But that's all.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.860
So if we plotted a
histogram, we would

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:23.880
see a huge peak at minus
1 and a little bump

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.900
here at 36 and
nothing in the middle.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.655
Clearly, not a
normal distribution.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.850
But what we're
reasoning about is not

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.870
the return of a single spin
but the return of many spins.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.500
If we played 1,000 spins,
what is our expected return?

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.580
As soon as we end up reasoning,
not about a single event

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.890
but about the mean of something,
we can imply something

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.060
called the Central
Limit Theorem.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.380
And here it is.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:10.280
It's actually for something
so important, very simple.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.865
It says that given a
sufficiently large sample--

00:23:12.865 --> 00:23:16.120
and I love terms like
sufficiently large

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.700
but we'll later put a
little meat on that--

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.200
the following three
things are true.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.920
The means of the samples
in a set of samples,

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.340
the so-called sample means
will be approximately normally

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.650
distributed.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:39.140
So that says if
I take a sample--

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:44.130
and remember, a sample will
have multiple examples.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.375
So just to remind people.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.030
A population is a
set of examples.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:07.770
A sample is a subset
of the population.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.010
So it too is a set of
examples, typically.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.785
If this set is
sufficiently large--

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.870
certainly 1 is not
sufficiently large--

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:34.460
then it will be the case
that the mean of the means--

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.950
so I take the mean
of each sample

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.740
and then I can now
plot all of those means

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.390
and so take the mean
of those, right--

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.220
and they'll be
normally distributed.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.540
Furthermore, this
distribution will

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.700
have a mean that is close to
the mean of the population.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.000
The mean of the means
will be close to the mean

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.930
of the population.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.980
And the variance
of the sample means

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.940
will be close to the variance
of the population divided

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.090
by the sample size.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.180
This is really
amazing that this is

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.105
true and dramatically useful.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.780
So to get some insight,
let's check it.

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.500
To do that, postulate that we
have this kind of miraculous

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.790
die.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.940
So instead of a die that when
you roll it you get a number 1,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:44.220
2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, this
particular die is continuous.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.000
It gives you a real
number between 0 and 5,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.530
or maybe it's
between 1 and 6, OK?

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.420
So it's a continuous die.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.360
What we're going to do is
roll it a lot of times.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.335
We're going to
say, how many die?

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.500
And then, how many
times are we going

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.780
to roll that number of die?

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.170
So the number of die
will be the sample size--

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.870
number of dice will
be the sample size.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.960
And then we'll take a
bunch of samples which

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.910
I'm calling number of rolls.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.520
And then we'll plot
it and I'm just

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.070
choosing some bins
and some colors

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.770
and some style and
various other things

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.350
just to show you how we
use the keyword arguments.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.880
Actually, I said the number of
rolls is the number of trials.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.240
But it isn't quite
that because I'm

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.830
going to get the
number of trials

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.820
by dividing the number of
rolls by the number of dice.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.110
So if I have more dice, I get
to have fewer samples, more

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:04.540
dice per sample, all right?

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.360
Then we'll just do it.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.790
So it will be between 0
and 5 because random.random

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:17.045
returns a number between 0 and
1 and I'm multiplying it by 5.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.720
And then we'll look at the
means and we'll plot it all.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.620
Again, we're playing
games with weights just

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.810
to make the plot a
little easier to read.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:36.870
And here's what we get.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:46.070
If we roll one die, the
mean is very close to 2.5.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.470
Well, that's certainly
what you'd expect, right?

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.890
It's some random
number between 0 and 5.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.890
2.5 is a pretty good guess
as to what it should average.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.225
And it has a standard
deviation of 1.44.

00:28:01.225 --> 00:28:02.950
And that's a little
harder to guess

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.720
that that's what it would be.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.210
But you could figure it
out with a little math

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.840
or as I did here
with the simulation.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.670
But now, if I roll 50
dice, well, again, the mean

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:20.000
is close to 2.5.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.530
It's what you'd expect, right?

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:27.900
I roll 50 die, I get the
mean value of those 50.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.960
But look how much smaller
the standard deviation is.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:38.140
More importantly,
what we see here

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:46.200
is that if we look at the
value, the probability

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.240
is flat for all possible
values between 0 and 5

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.430
for a single die.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:57.960
But if we look at the
distribution for the means,

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.730
it's not quite Gaussian
but it's pretty close.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.030
Why is it not Gaussian?

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.970
Well, I didn't do it an
infinite number of times.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.670
Did it quite a few, but
not an infinite number.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:13.870
Enough that you didn't want
to sit here while it ran.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.850
But you can see the
amazing thing here

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:19.960
that when I go from looking at
1 to looking at the mean of 50,

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:25.180
suddenly I have a
normal distribution.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.710
And that means that
I can bring to bear

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:35.560
on the problem the
Central Limit Theorem.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.170
We can try it for roulette.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.930
Again I'm not going to make you
sit through a million trials

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.000
of 200 spins each.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.340
I'll do it only
for fair roulette.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:51.077
And again, this is a
very simple simulation,

00:29:51.077 --> 00:29:52.160
and we'll see what we get.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.960
And what we see is it's
not quite normal, again,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:04.040
but it definitely
has that shape.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.500
Now, it's going
to be a little bit

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:15.340
strange because I can't
lose more than one,

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.440
if I'm betting one.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.440
So it will never be
quite normal because it's

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.890
going to be truncated
down on the left side,

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:31.080
whereas the tail can
be arbitrarily long.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.520
So again, mathematically
it can't be normal

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.930
but it's close enough in
the main region, where

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:46.460
most of the values lie,
that we can get away

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.700
with applying the empirical
rule and looking at answers.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:56.500
And indeed as we
saw, it does work.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.690
So what's the moral here?

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.170
It doesn't matter what the
shape of the distribution

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:08.140
of the original
values happen to be.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.700
If we're trying to estimate
the mean using samples that

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.020
are sufficiently
large, the CLT will

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.320
allow us to use the
empirical rule when

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.120
computing confidence intervals.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:30.180
Even if we go back and look at
this anomaly over in the left,

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.470
what do you think would happen
if I, instead of had 200, have,

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:40.670
say, 1,000?

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:46.265
What's the probability of the
average return being minus 1

00:31:46.265 --> 00:31:50.090
of 1,000 bets?

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:54.560
Much smaller than for 100 bets.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.290
To lose 1,000 times in a
row is pretty unlikely.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.180
So to get all the
way to the left

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.470
is going to be less
likely, and, therefore,

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.580
the thing will start
looking more and more normal

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.970
as the samples get bigger.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:15.870
All right, and so
we can use the CLT

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.720
to justify using
the empirical rule

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.390
when we compute
confidence intervals.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.630
All right, I want to look at
one more example in detail.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.070
This is kind of an
interesting one.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.710
You might think that
randomness is of no use for,

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.880
say, finding the value
of pi because there's

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.320
nothing random about that.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.000
Similarly, you might think
that randomness was of no use

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.880
in integrating a
function, but in fact,

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.000
the way those numerical
algorithms work

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.700
is they use randomness.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.210
What you're about to
see is that randomness,

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:55.350
and indeed things related
to Monte Carlo simulations,

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:59.190
can be enormously useful, even
when you're computing something

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:04.620
that is inherently not random
like the value of pi here.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.690
And we won't ask you to
remember that many digits

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:08.740
on the quiz and the exam.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.616
All right, so what's pi?

00:33:10.616 --> 00:33:13.860
Well, people have known about
pi for thousands and thousands

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.180
of years.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:20.520
And what people knew was
that there was some constant,

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.480
we'll call it pi.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.460
It wasn't always called that.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.410
Such that it was equal
to the circumference

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:28.910
of a circle divided
by the diameter,

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:34.100
and furthermore, the area
was going to be pi r squared.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:38.450
People knew that way back to the
Babylonians and the Egyptians.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.250
What they didn't know
is what that value was.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:47.800
The earliest known estimate
of pi was by the Egyptians,

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.890
on something called the
Rhind Papyrus pictured here.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.250
And they estimated pi
to be 4 times 8 over 9

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.840
squared, or 3.16.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.720
Not so bad.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.030
About 1,100 years
later an estimate of pi

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:14.466
appeared in the
Bible, Kings 7:23.

00:34:14.466 --> 00:34:20.010
It didn't say pi is
but it described--

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.639
I think this was a construction
of King Solomon's Temple.

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.980
"He made a molten sea,
ten cubits from one brim

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.210
to the other."

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.480
it was round.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.120
It was a circle.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.120
"His height was five cubits
and a line of 30 cubits

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.699
did compass it round about."

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:38.219
Well, if you do the
arithmetic, what does

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.460
this imply the
value of pi to be?

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:46.300
3, and I'm sure that's what
Mike Pence thinks it is.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:58.450
About 300 years
later, Archimedes

00:34:58.450 --> 00:34:59.980
did a better job of it.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:08.140
He estimated pi by constructing
a 96-sided polygon.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.290
There's a picture of one.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.860
It looks a lot like a circle.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.380
On the left is one
with fewer sides.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.420
And what he did is he then--

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:20.740
since it was a polygon he
knew how to compute its area

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.750
or it's circumference and
he just counted things up

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:25.940
and he said, well,
pi is somewhere

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:31.780
between 223/71 and 22/7.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.600
And that turns out
to actually-- if you

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.411
take the average of that it
will be a really good estimate.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:44.830
2000 years after Archimedes,
the French mathematicians

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.980
Buffon and Laplace
proposed finding

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.130
the value of pi using what we
would today call a Monte Carlo

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.110
simulation.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:56.770
They did not have a
computer to execute this on.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.850
So what they proposed--

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.420
it started with
this mathematics.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.180
They took a circle
and inscribed it

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:11.610
in a square, a square of
two units of whatever it

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:12.990
is per side.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.090
And therefore we know that
the area of the square

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:19.060
is 2 times 2 or 4.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:24.440
We know that the area of
the circle is pi r squared.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.530
And since we know that r is 1--

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.140
because that's the square
it's inscribed in--

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.060
we know that the area of
a circle is exactly pi.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.850
What Buffon then proposed was
dropping a bunch of needles

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:44.690
at random-- kind of like when
Professor Grimson was sorting

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:46.530
things--

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.700
and seeing where they land.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.420
Some would land in the
square but not in the circle.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.040
Some would land in the circle.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.560
You would ignore any that
landed outside the square.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.490
And then they said, well, since
they're falling at random,

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:07.660
the ratio of the needles in the
circle to needles in the square

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.870
should exactly equal
the area of the square

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.870
over the area of
the circle, exactly,

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.910
if you did an infinite
number of needles.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.940
Does that make sense?

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:24.140
Now, given that, you
can do some algebra

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.590
and solve for the
area of the circle

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.890
and say it has to be the
area of the square times

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.050
the number of needles
in the circle divided

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.630
by the needles in the square.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.880
And since we know that
the area of the circle

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:44.810
is pi that tells
us that pi is going

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:48.460
to equal four times the
needles in the circle.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.200
That's 4 is the area
of the square divided

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.350
by the number of
needles in the square.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.930
And so the argument
was you can just

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.590
drop a bunch of these
needles, see where they land,

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:02.860
add them up and from that
you would magically now know

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.440
the actual value of pi.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.940
Well, we tried a simulation
one year in class but rather

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.920
than using needles
we had an archer

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:17.340
and we blindfolded him so he
would shoot arrows at random

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.560
and we would see
where they ended up.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.160
There's a video of this
here if you want to see it.

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.950
I'm going to play only the
very end of the video which

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.005
describes the results.

00:38:40.591 --> 00:38:42.840
Maybe we should just use
Python to build a Monte Carlo

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.830
simulation instead.

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.290
So that's what happened.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.330
After it was all
over, Anna came up

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:50.340
and gave me some sound advice.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.910
Yeah, I was very proud of that
particular shot with the apple.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.370
I had hoped the student would
put it on his or her head

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.190
but no one volunteered.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.010
That was not done blindfolded.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:05.970
Any rate, so here
is the simulation.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:07.725
So first we have
throwing the needles.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:15.160
For needles in range 1 to
number of needles plus 1,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.290
we're going to choose
the random x or random y

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.100
and we're going to see whether
or not it's in the circle.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.530
And there we will use
the Pythagorean theorem

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.460
to tell us that, all right?

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.060
And we'll just do
this, and then we're

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.370
going to return
exactly the formula we

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:39.080
saw in the previous slide.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.390
Now, comes an interesting part.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.810
We need to get an estimate.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.720
So we start with the
number of needles

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.964
and the number of trials.

00:39:48.964 --> 00:39:51.400
For t in range number
of trials, we'll

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.510
get a guess by throwing
number of needles.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:40:00.790
And then we'll append that
guess to our list of estimates.

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:10.180
We'll then compute the
standard deviation,

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.950
get the current
estimate which will

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.630
be the sum of the
estimates divided

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:17.860
by the len of the estimate,
just the mean of the estimate.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.860
And then we'll
print it, all right?

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.040
So given a number of needles
and a number of trials,

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.190
we'll estimate pi and we'll
give you the standard deviation

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.324
of that estimate.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.240
However, to do that within
a certain precision,

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.670
I'm going to have
yet another loop.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.100
And I'm showing you
this because we often

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.880
structure simulations this way.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.640
So what I have
here is the number

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.630
of trials, which is not so
interesting, but the precision.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.260
I'm saying, I would like
to know the value of pi

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.090
and I would like
to have good reason

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:04.240
to believe that the
value you give me

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.920
is within 0.005, in this
case, of the true value.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.620
Or maybe more
precisely, I would like

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:19.550
to know with a confidence of
95% that the true value is

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.720
within a certain range.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.830
So what this is going to do
is it's just going to-- and I

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:32.220
should probably use 1.96
instead of 2, but oh, well--

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.860
it's just going
to keep increasing

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.490
the number of needles,
doubling the number of needles

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.880
until it's confident
about the estimate,

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.990
confident enough, all right?

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.390
So this is a very common thing.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:50.630
We don't know how many needles
we should need so let's

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.700
just start with
some small number

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.015
and we'll keep going
until we're good.

00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:58.640
All right, what
happens when we run it?

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.140
Well, we start
with some estimates

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:12.770
that when we had 1,000 needles
it told us that pi was 3.148

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:16.590
and standard deviation
was 0.047 et cetera.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.590
So a couple of things to notice.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:26.120
One, are my estimates of pi
getting monotonically better?

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.030
You'd like to think,
as I add more needles,

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.164
my estimates are
getting more accurate.

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.780
So that's question one.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.020
Are they getting more accurate?

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.220
Not monotonically, right?

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.040
If we look at it, where
are they getting worse?

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:48.790
Well, let's see.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:43:00.760
All right, 3.148, well, 3.13
is already worse, right?

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.860
So I double the
number of needles

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.340
and I get a worse estimate.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.340
Now, the trend is good.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:15.680
By the time I get here, I've
got a pretty good estimate.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:23.250
So overall as I look at
larger samples, a bigger

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:26.010
subset of the
population, my estimates

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:29.360
are trending towards
better but not every time.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:38.940
On the other hand, let's look
at the standard deviations.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.510
What we see here is that
the standard deviations

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:45.880
are, indeed, getting
monotonically better.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.620
Now, there's nothing
mathematical guaranteeing that,

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.120
right?

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.490
Because there is
randomness here.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:59.150
But I'm increasing the
number of needles by so much

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.540
that it kind of overrides
the bad luck of maybe getting

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.730
a bad random set.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:08.570
And we see those
are getting better.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.570
So the important
thing to see here

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:15.420
is not that I happened
to get a better estimate,

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:19.272
but that I know more
about the estimate.

00:44:19.272 --> 00:44:22.530
I can have more
confidence in the estimate

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:26.342
because it's closing in on it.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:32.850
So the moral here is it's
not sufficient to produce

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:33.630
a good answer.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.850
I've said this before.

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.070
We need to have reason
to believe that it

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.988
is close to the right answer.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.850
So in this case, I'm using
the standard deviation

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:51.130
and say, given that it's
gotten quite small--

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:58.800
you know, 1.96 times 0.002
is indeed a small number.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.810
I could make it
smaller if I wanted.

00:45:04.616 --> 00:45:05.990
I have good reason
to believe I'm

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.210
close to the right value of pi.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.300
Everyone agree with that?

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.020
Is that right?

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:19.180
Not quite, actually.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.620
It would be nice
if it were true.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.530
But it isn't.

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:26.000
So let's look at some things.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.240
Is it correct to state
that 95% of the time we

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.270
run this simulation you'll
get an estimate of pi

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:35.070
between these two values?

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.560
I don't expect you to do
the arithmetic in your head

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.570
but the answer is yes.

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:42.960
So that is something
we believe is

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.790
true by the math we've been
looking at for the last two

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:47.290
lectures.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.570
Next statement, with
a probability of 0.95,

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:58.940
the actual value of pi is
between these two things.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:45:59.690
Is that true?

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:11.250
In fact, if I were to say,
with a probability of 1,

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:14.020
the actual value is pi is
between those two values,

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.940
would it be true?

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.370
Yes.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.160
So they are both true facts.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:27.210
However, only the
first of these can be

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:28.690
inferred from our simulation.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.350
While the second
fact is true, we

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:36.980
can't infer it from
the simulation.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:44.110
And to show you that,
statistically valid is not

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:49.100
the same as true,
we'll look at this.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.430
I've introduced a
bug in my simulation.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:47:00.725
I've replaced the 4 that
we saw we needed by 2, now,

00:47:00.725 --> 00:47:03.870
an easy kind of mistake to make.

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.012
And now, if we go to the code--

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.840
well, what do you think will
happen if we go to the code

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.620
and run it?

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.370
We'll try it.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:28.817
We'll go down here to the code.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:35.328
We'll make that a 2.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:55.080
And what you'll see as it
runs is that once again we're

00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:02.790
getting very nice confidence
intervals, but totally

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:04.170
bogus values of pi.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:11.790
So the statistics
can tell us something

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:15.720
about how reproducible
our simulation is

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.570
but not whether the
simulation is an actually,

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:21.347
accurate model of reality.

00:48:21.347 --> 00:48:22.430
So what do you need to do?

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:25.610
You need to do something
like a sanity check.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.730
So here you might
look at a polygon

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:32.300
and say, well, clearly that's
a totally wrong number.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.877
Something is wrong with my code.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:49.620
OK, so just to wrap-up.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.610
What we've shown is
a way to find pi.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.730
This is a generally
useful technique.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:00.790
To estimate the area
of any region r,

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:02.650
you pick an enclosing
region, call

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:08.640
it e, such that it's easy
to estimate the area of e,

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.650
and r lies within it.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:16.590
Pick some random sets of points
within e, let f be the fraction

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:21.980
and fall within r, multiply
e by f and you're done.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:26.410
So this for example, is a very
common way to do integration.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:29.230
I promised you we'd
talk about integration.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.140
So here's a sine of x.

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:35.510
If I want to integrate the
sine of x over some region,

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:39.320
as done here, all
I need to do is

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:43.280
pick a bunch of random points,
red and black in this case,

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.440
and look at the ratio
of one to the other.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.940
So showing how we
can use randomness

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.750
to again, compute something
that is not inherently random.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.090
This is a trick people
use over and over

00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:03.340
and over again when confronted
with some situation where

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.390
it's not easy to solve
for things mathematically.

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:11.470
You just do a simulation
and if you do it right,

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.720
you get a very good answer.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:20.190
All right, we will move on to
a different topic on Wednesday.
