JOHN GUTTAG: Today
we're starting

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.270
a new topic, which
is, of course, related

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.260
to previous topics.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.150
As usual, if you go to either
the 60002 or the 600 web site,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.700
you'll find both today's
PowerPoint and today's Python.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.050
You'll discover if you
look at the Python file

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.530
that there is quite a
lot of code in there.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.050
And I'll be talking
only about some of it.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.350
But it's probably
all worth looking at.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.530
And a fair amount of reading
associated with this week.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.140
Why are we looking
at random walks?

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.700
See a picture here of, think of
them as molecules just bouncing

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.351
around.

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:16.850
This is actually a
picture of what's

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.750
called Brownian motion,
though Robert Brown probably

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.960
did not discover it.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.110
We're looking at random walks
because, well, first of all,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.900
they're important
in many domains.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.270
There are people who
will argue, for example,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.000
that the movement of
prices in the stock market

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.970
is best modeled
as a random walk.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.850
There was a very popular book
called A Random Walk Down Wall

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.330
Street that made this argument.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.604
And a lot of modern portfolio
analysis is based upon that.

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:51.770
Those of you who are not
interested in making money,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.990
and I presume
that's most of you,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.860
it's also very important
in many physical processes.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.490
We use random walks,
say, to model diffusion,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.450
heat diffusion, or the
diffusion of molecules

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.320
in suspension, et cetera.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.150
So they're very important in a
lot of scientific, and indeed,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.880
social disciplines.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.010
They're not the only
important thing,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.230
so why are we looking at those?

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.530
Because I think it provides
a really good illustration

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.410
of how we can use simulation to
understand the world around us.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.650
And it does give me an excuse
to cover some important topics

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.600
related to programming.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.390
You'll remember that one of
the subtexts of the course

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.690
is while I'm covering a
lot of what you might think

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.080
of as abstract
material, we're using it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.990
as an excuse to teach more
about programming and software

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.190
engineering.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.370
A little practice with
classes and subclassing,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.110
and we're going to also
look at producing plots.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.930
So the first random
walk I want to look at

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.470
is actually not a diffusion
process or the stock market,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.230
but an actual walk.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.930
So imagine that you've got
a field which has somehow

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.920
inexplicably been mown to look
like a piece of graph paper,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.160
and you've got a drunk
wandering around the field,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.090
taking a step every once in a
while in some random direction.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.390
We can then ask the
question is there

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.260
an interesting relationship
between the number of steps

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.770
the drunk takes and
how far the drunk is

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.680
from the origin at the
end of those steps?

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.560
You could imagine that if
the drunk takes more steps,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.000
he's ever further
from the origin.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.810
Or maybe you could
imagine, since it's random,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.070
that he just wanders away and he
wanders back in all directions

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.340
and more or less
never gets very far.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.250
So just out of curiosity,
I'll take a poll.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.370
Who thinks that the
drunk doesn't much

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.170
matter how many
steps he takes, he'll

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.110
be more or less the
same distance away?

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.810
And who thinks the more steps
he takes, the further away he's

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.540
likely to be?

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.700
It seems to be a season
where when you take polls,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.020
they come out almost tied.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.690
Let's look at a small example.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.440
Suppose he takes one step only.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.670
Well, if he takes
one step, and we'll

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.615
assume for simplicity
that he's not so drunk

00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:29.615
that he moves at random.

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:34.310
He either moves north
or south, east or west.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.650
These are all the places
he can get to in one step.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.940
What they have in common
is that after one step,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.590
the drunk is always exactly
one unit away from the origin.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.090
Well, how about after two steps?

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.430
So without loss of
generality, let's assume that

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.160
the first step--

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.900
let me use the pen
that you're supposed

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.070
to use to write on this, rather
than this pen, which would

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.960
make a real mess on my screen.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.720
What did I do with it?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.630
Well, I won't write on it.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.160
So without loss of
generality, we'll

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.330
assume that the drunk
is there after one step.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.370
Took one step to the east.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.040
Well, after two steps, those
are all the possible places

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.660
he could be.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.900
So on average, how far is
the drunk from the origin?

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.270
Well, if we look, he could
either be two steps away,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.620
if he took another step
east, zero steps away,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:47.180
if he took a step west, or
what do we see for the top two?

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.490
Well, the top and
the bottom one,

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.940
we can go back and use
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.060
c squared equals a
squared plus b squared.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.690
And that will tell us that
it'll be the square root

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.130
of a squared plus b squared.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.680
And that will tell us how
far away the upper two are,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.330
and then we can just average
them and get a distance.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.870
And as we can see,
on average, the drunk

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.300
will be a little bit further
away after two steps than

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.110
after one step.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.490
Well how about
after 100,000 steps?

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.790
It would be a little bit
tedious to go through the case

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.190
analysis I just did.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.500
There are a lot of cases
after 100,000 steps.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.820
So we end up resorting
to a simulation.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.700
So we'll structure it
exactly the same way

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.790
we've been structuring
our other simulations.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.220
We're going to simulate one
walk of k steps, n such walks,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.470
and then report the
average distance

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.905
from the origin of the n walks.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.610
Before we do that, in line
with the software engineering

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.640
theme of the course,
we'll start by defining

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.580
some useful abstractions.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.460
There are three of
them I want to look at.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.440
Location, the field
that the drunk is in,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.885
and the drunk him or herself.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.390
So let's first look at location.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.590
This is going to be
an immutable type.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.220
So what we see here--

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.845
as long as I can't
point in the screen,

00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:37.970
I'll point with a pointer--

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.270
is that we'll initiate it.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.860
We'll initialize it
with an x and y value.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.990
That makes sense.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.200
We'll be able to have two
getters, getX and getY.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.200
And here's how we
see it's immutable.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.530
What move is doing is it's
not changing the location,

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.060
it's returning a new location.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.880
Perhaps move is poor
choice of name for that.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.090
But that is what it's doing.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.310
It's just returning
a new location

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.580
where it adds the change
in x and the change in y

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.980
to get two new xy values.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.470
Notice, by the way,
that I'm not restricting

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.880
these to be integers, or
one, or anything like that.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.570
So this would work
even if I did not

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.930
want to take those nice little
east-west, north-south steps.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.020
I've got a underbar
underbar string, _str_,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.270
and then here's my
implementation--

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.260
you can see it's
very sophisticated--

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.720
of the Pythagorean theorem.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.440
So I just do it
that way, and that

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.050
will get me the distance
between two things.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.880
It's one of the annoying things
about classes in, actually,

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.520
all languages I know
with classes, is

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.530
you would like to
think that self

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.075
and other-- there's
a symmetry here.

00:09:00.075 --> 00:09:02.450
The distance from self to
other is the same as from other

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.560
to self.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.870
But syntactically,
because of the way

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.420
the language is structured,
we treat them a little bit

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.333
differently.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.080
How about class Drunk?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.690
Well, this is kind of boring.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:22.240
Drunk has a name and a string.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:22.970
And that's all.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.660
The point of this,
and I don't think

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.720
we've looked at
this before, is this

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.800
is not intended to be a
useful class on its own.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.970
It's what we call a base class.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:44.590
The notion here is its only
purpose is to be inherited.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.380
It's not supposed to
be useful on itself,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.660
but it does give me
something that will

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.710
be used for the two subclasses.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.490
And we'll look at
two subclasses.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.300
The so-called usual
drunk, the one

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.810
I tried to simulate when
I was wandering around,

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.760
wanders around at random.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.170
And a drunk I like
to think of it

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.200
as a New Englander, or
a masochistic drunk,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.740
who tries forever to move
ever northward, because he

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.710
or she wants to be frozen.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.637
I do like this picture of
entering the state of Maine

00:10:18.637 --> 00:10:19.220
in the winter.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.510
So here is the usual drunk.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.140
Subclass of drunk,
and it can take steps

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:35.230
at random, one step, either
increasing y, a step north,

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.570
decreasing y, a step south,
increasing x, a step east,

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:45.770
or decreasing x a step west.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.940
So those are the choices.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.410
And it's going to return
one of those at random.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.350
I think we saw random.choice
in the last lecture.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.420
And then our
masochistic drunk, it's

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.100
almost the same, except the
choices are slightly different.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.890
If he chooses to head north,
he doesn't go one step.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.380
He goes 1.1 steps north.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.902
And if he chooses to go south,
he only goes 9/10 of a step.

00:11:12.902 --> 00:11:14.360
So what we're seeing
here is what's

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.250
called a biased random walk.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.110
And the bias here is the
direction of the walk

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.330
that he's moving
either up or down.

00:11:27.612 --> 00:11:28.195
Pretty simple.

00:11:30.755 --> 00:11:33.310
How about just for
to test things out,

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.040
we'll ask the question is this
an immutable or a mutable type?

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.710
Are drunks mutable or immutable?

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:48.160
This is a deep
philosophical question.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.820
But if we ignore the
philosophical underpinnings

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.380
of that question, what
about the two types here?

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:00.010
Who thinks it's immutable?

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.010
Who thinks it's mutable?

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.220
Why do you think it's mutable?

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.178
What's getting changed?

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.990
The answer is nothing.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.210
It gets created, and then
it's returning the step,

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.260
but it's not actually
changing the drunk.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.620
So so far we have two things
that are immutable, drunks

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.380
and locations.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.480
Let's look at fields.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.690
Fields are a little
bit more complicated.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.730
So field will be a
dictionary, and the dictionary

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:47.590
is going to map a drunk to his
or her location in the field.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:52.430
So we can add a drunk
at some location,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.620
and we're going to check.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.680
And if the drunk
is already there,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.290
we're not going to
put the drunk in.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.040
We're going to raise a value
error, "Duplicate drunk."

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.230
Otherwise we're going to set
the value of drunkenness mapping

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.610
to loc.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:14.540
Now you see, by the way, why I
wanted drunks to be immutable.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.000
Because they have
to be hashable so

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.990
I can use them as a
key in a dictionary.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.710
So it was not an idle question
whether they were immutable.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.250
It was an important question.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.230
I can get the
location of a drunk.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.720
If the drunk is not
in there, then I'll

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.490
raise a different value
error, "Drunk not in field."

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.030
Otherwise I'll
return the location

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.440
associated with that drunk.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.810
And finally, we're
going to have moveDrunk.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.670
Again I'll check whether
the drunk is there.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.760
If the drunk is there, I'm
going to get the distance

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.070
on x and the distance in y
by calling drunk.takeStep.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.410
So we saw takeStep for a drunk
didn't move the drunk anywhere,

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.080
because the drunks
were immutable,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.790
but returned new locations.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.860
A new x and new values.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:20.350
And then I'm going to use that
to move the drunk in the field.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.955
So I'll set self.drunk, so
drunk to move x distance and y

00:14:26.955 --> 00:14:27.455
distance.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.950
So it's very simple, but having
built this set of classes,

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.180
we can now actually
write the simulation.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.760
Oh.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.718
What about our classes?

00:14:43.718 --> 00:14:45.220
Are they mutable or immutable?

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.245
Not classes.

00:14:46.245 --> 00:14:46.995
What about fields?

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.280
Any votes for mutable?

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.650
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.280
Because you can see I'm
mutating it right here.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.770
I'm changing the value
of the dictionary.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.100
And in fact, every time I
add a drunk to the field,

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.860
I'm changing the value
of the dictionary, which

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.360
is to say mutating the field.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.160
So I'll have a
bunch of locations,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.500
which are immutable objects.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.020
Makes sense that a
location is immutable.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.570
A bunch of drunks, and the
thing I'm going to change

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.520
is where the drunks
are in the field.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:34.370
I said we'd start by
simulating a single walk.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:40.910
So here it is, a walk in a field
with a drunk, and that drunk

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.890
will take some number
of steps in the field.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.900
And you can see this.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.900
It's very simple.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.960
I just have a loop.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.640
Drunk takes some
number of random steps,

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.710
and I'm going to return
the distance from the start

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:02.700
to the final location
of the drunk.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.420
So how far is the
drunk from the origin?

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.780
I then need to simulate
multiple walks.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.840
Notice here that I've
got the number of steps,

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:23.300
the number of trials, and dClass
stands for class of the drunk.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.510
And that's because I want
to use the same function

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.000
to simulate as many
different kinds of drunks

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.530
as I care about.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.200
We've only seen two here,
the masochistic drunk

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.010
and the usual drunk, but you
can imagine many other kinds

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:37.540
as well.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:41.850
So let's do it.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.770
So here I'm going to simulate
a walk for one drunk, Homer.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.310
So we'll create a drunk named
Homer, or the variable Homer,

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.550
which is the drunk class.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:59.000
Then the origin,
distances, and for t

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.980
in range number of
trials, we'll just do it,

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.319
and then we'll
return the distances.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:07.790
So it's initialized
to the empty list.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.710
So we're going to return a list
for however many trials we do,

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.650
how far the drunk ended
up from the origin.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.960
Then we can average that,
and we look at the mean.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.420
Maybe we'll look at
the min or the max.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.629
Lots of different questions we
could ask about the behavior.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.860
And now we can put
it all together here.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.850
So drunkTest will take a set
of different walk lengths,

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.240
a list of different walk
lengths, the number of trials,

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.580
and the class.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.530
And for a number of
steps and walk lengths,

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.630
distances will be
simWalks of number

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.820
of steps, numTrials, dClass.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.450
And then I'm going to just
print some statistics.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.360
You may or may not
have seen this.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.640
This is something that's
built in to Python.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:09.130
I can ask for the
name of a class.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.760
So dClass, remember, is a
class, and _name_ will give me

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.620
the name of the class.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.710
Might be usual, it might
be drunk, in this case.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.740
So let's try it.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.310
So the code we've looked at.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.970
So let's go down here,
and we'll run it,

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.795
and we'll try it for
walks of 10, 100, 1,000,

00:18:40.795 --> 00:18:42.740
and 10,000 steps.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.910
And we'll do 100 trials.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.150
Here's what we got.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.800
So my question to you is
does this look plausible?

00:19:09.806 --> 00:19:10.930
What is it telling us here?

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.080
Well, it's telling us here
that the length of the walk

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.930
actually doesn't really affect--

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.110
the number of steps doesn't
affect how far the drunk gets.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.310
There's some randomness.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:27.080
8.6, 8.57, 9.2, 8.7.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.990
Not much variance.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.980
So we've done this simulation
and we've learned something,

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.620
maybe.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.060
So does this look plausible?

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.660
We can look at it here.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.850
I've just transcribed it.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.070
What do you think?

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.592
Well, go ahead.

00:19:54.592 --> 00:19:56.740
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say, it seems plausible

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.307
because after the
first two steps,

00:19:58.307 --> 00:20:02.203
there's a 50% chance he's
going closer to the origin.

00:20:02.203 --> 00:20:04.650
And a 50% chance he's
going away from it.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.800
JOHN GUTTAG: So we have at
least one vote for plausible,

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:13.120
and it's certainly a
plausible argument.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.910
Well, one of the things
we need to learn to do

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:21.050
is whenever we
build a simulation,

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.680
we need to do what I
call a sanity check

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.010
to see whether or not
the simulation actually

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.510
makes sense.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.440
So if we're going to
do a sanity check,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.860
what might we do in this case?

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.700
We should try it on cases where
we think we know the answer.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.980
So we say, let's take
a really simple case

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.010
where we're pretty sure we
know what the answer is.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.690
Let's run our
simulation and make

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.690
sure it gives us the right
answer for this simple case.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:59.610
So if we think of a
sanity check here,

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.600
maybe we should look
at these numbers.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.930
We just did it.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.700
We know how far the drunk
should get in zero steps.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.800
How far should the drunk
move in zero steps?

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.300
Zero.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.850
How far should the
drunk move in one steps?

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.780
We know that should be one.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.890
Two steps, well, we knew
what that should be.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.460
Well, if I run
this sanity check,

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.870
these are the numbers I get.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.410
I should be pretty suspicious.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.940
I should also be
suspicious they're

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:39.470
kind of the same numbers
I got for 10,000 steps.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.270
What should I think about?

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.640
I should think that maybe
there's a bug in my code.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.710
So if we now go back
and look at the code,

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.400
yes, this fails the
pants on fire test

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.930
that there's clearly something
wrong with these numbers.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:04.650
What we were appending is
walk of Homer, numTrials, 1.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.340
Well, numTrials is a constant.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.880
It's always 100.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.410
What I intended to write here
was not numTrials but numSteps.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.260
I actually did
this the first time

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.940
I wrote this simulation
many years ago.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.080
I made this typo,
if you will, and I

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.510
got these bizarre answers.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.900
So I looked at the
code and I said, well,

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.100
that's actually wrong.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.080
No wonder it's always
the same number.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.775
I'm calling it with a constant.

00:22:37.775 --> 00:22:40.670
The constant happens to be 100.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.950
So let's go fix the simulation.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.150
So this should
have been numSteps.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.250
Now let's run it again.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.920
Well, these results
are pretty different.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.622
Now we see that in fact,
they're increasing.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.860
Should I just look
at this and be happy?

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.030
Probably not.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.520
I should run my
sanity check again

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:47.530
and make sure I get the right
results for zero, one, and two.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.475
So let's go back and do that,
just to be a little bit safe.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.120
So I'll just change this
tuple of values to be--

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.450
and I should feel a
lot better about this.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.950
The mean, the max, and
the min are all zero

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.820
when he doesn't take any steps.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.960
One is exactly what
we should expect,

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.890
and two is also-- the mean is
where we would guess it to be,

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.500
and the max is two,
happened to take

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.130
two steps in the same direction,
and the min is zero, happened

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.230
to end up where he started.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.040
So I've passed my sanity check.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.810
Doesn't mean my
simulation is right,

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.180
but at least I have
reason to be hopeful.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.660
So getting back.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.730
So we saw these results, and
now we're getting the indication

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.090
that in fact, contrary to
what we might have thought,

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:13.110
it does appear to be that the
more steps the drunk takes,

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:15.020
the further away
the drunk ends up.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.560
And that was the usual drunk.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.430
We can try the
masochistic drunk,

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:26.350
and then we see something
pretty interesting.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:30.130
I won't make you sit through
it, but when we run it,

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.530
here are the usual
drunks, the numbers,

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.110
and I just looked at
it for 1,000 and 10,000

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.300
so it would fit on the screen.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:43.690
You see for the usual drunk,
it's 26.8, roughly 90.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.870
Fair dispersion in
the min and the max.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.920
And the masochistic drunk seems
to be making considerably more

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.080
progress than the usual drunk.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.780
So we see is this
bias actually appears

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.025
to be changing the distance.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.090
Well, that's interesting.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.850
Now we could ask
the question why?

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.840
What's going on?

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.130
And to do that, I want to
go and start visualizing

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.170
what's the trend?

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.770
So rather than just looking at
two numbers or three numbers,

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.670
as we've been doing, I'm going
to draw a pretty picture.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.070
Actually, I'm not going to draw.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.710
I'm a terrible artist.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.800
But Python will draw us
some pretty pictures.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.320
We're going to simulate
walks of multiple lengths

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.170
for each kind of
drunk, and then plot

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.180
the distance at the
end of each length

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.980
walk for each kind of drunk.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:46.100
I now digress for a moment to
talk about how we do plotting.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.380
So we're going to use
something called Pylab.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:56.730
I've listed here four
really important libraries

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.770
that you will surely
end up using extensively

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:06.060
if you continue to use
Python for research purposes.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.280
NumPy adds vectors,
matrices, and many high-level

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.200
mathematical functions.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.500
Actually, it might be NumPy.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.416
It might be "Num-Pee."

00:27:14.416 --> 00:27:16.700
I'm not sure how
to pronounce it.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.470
But we'll call it NumPy.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.420
So these are really
useful things.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.860
SciPy adds on top
of that a bunch

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:30.590
of mathematical classes and
functions useful to scientists.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.990
Things like-- well, we'll
look at some of them

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.220
as we go on through the term.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:40.450
MatPlotLib adds an
object-oriented programming

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.460
interface for plotting.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.920
Anybody here used MATLAB?

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.880
Great.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.120
Well you'll find that MatPlotLib
is the Mat, think MATLAB.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.910
Lets you, in Python, use
all the plotting stuff

00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:00.440
that you've come to either
like or hate in MATLAB.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.000
So it's really convenient.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.740
If you know how to
do plots in MATLAB,

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.840
you'll know how to
do it in Python.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.260
PyLab combines all
of these to give you

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.900
a MATLAB-like
interface to Python.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.780
So once you have PyLab,
you can do a lot of things

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.390
that you would normally
want to do in MATLAB,

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.580
for example, produce
weird-looking plots

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.530
like this one.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:29.440
I'm going to show you one of the
many, many plotting commands.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.940
It is called plot.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.370
It takes two arguments,
which must be

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.340
sequences of the same length.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:40.920
The first argument
is the x-coordinates,

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.450
the second argument is the
y-coordinates corresponding

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:44.920
to the x ones.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.910
There are roughly three
zillion optional arguments,

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.530
and you'll see me use only
a small subset of them.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.330
It plots the points in order.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:29:00.670
First the first xy, then the
second xy, then the third xy.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.850
Why is it important that I
say it plots them in order?

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:08.350
Because by default, as
each point is plotted,

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.320
it draws a line connecting
one point to the next point

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.060
to the next point.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.460
And so the order in
which they're plotted

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.260
will determine
where the lines go.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.290
Now we'll see, as we go on, that
we often don't draw the lines,

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.330
but by default they are drawn.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.340
Here's an example.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.320
You start by importing PyLab.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.520
Then I've given xVals
and yVals1, and if I call

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.230
pylab.plot of xVals, yVals1.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.410
Here is one of the
arguments I can give it.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:46.950
I'm saying I'd like this to be
plotted in blue, b for blue,

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:51.540
and I'd like it to be plotted
as a solid line, a single dash.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.630
And I want to give that
line a label, which

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.440
I've said is first.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.960
YVals2 is a different list.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.930
I'll plot it again.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:06.810
Here I'm going to say I
want a red dotted line,

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.100
and the label will be second.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.920
And then after
plotting it, I'm going

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.030
to invoke pylab.legend, which
puts this nice little box up

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.460
here in the corner,
in this case,

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.265
saying that first is a
solid blue line and second

00:30:20.265 --> 00:30:27.970
a dashed red line, I should say.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.680
Now again, there are
lots of arguments,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.800
lots of other arguments
I could give in plot.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.500
Also legend, I can tell it
where to put the legend,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.030
if I so choose.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.620
Here I've just said,
put it wherever

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.180
you happen to want to put
it, or PyLab wants to put it.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.045
So a very simple way
to produce a plot.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.860
There are lots of
details and many more

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.250
examples about plotting
in the assigned reading.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.460
We've posted a video that
Professor Grimson produced

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:06.320
for an online course, 600.1x.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.430
It's about a 50 minute video
broken into multiple segments

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.390
about how to use plotting in
PyLab with a lot more detail

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.110
than I've given you.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:17.859
You'll see if you read
the code for this lecture.

00:31:17.859 --> 00:31:19.400
And as you see this
lecture, there'll

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.210
be lots of other plots
showing up of different kinds.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.150
These are my two
favorite online sites

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.090
for finding out what to do.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.570
And of course, you can
google all sorts of things.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.420
That's all I'm going to tell
you about how to produce plots

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.330
in class, but we're
going to expect

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.580
you to learn a lot about
it, because I think

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.650
it's a really useful skill.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:45.630
And at the very
least, you should

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:50.070
feel comfortable that any
plot I show you, you now--

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.780
obviously not right now--

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.760
but you will eventually
know how to produce.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.660
So if you do these
things, you'll

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.980
be more than up to speed.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:08.450
So I started by saying I wanted
to plot the trends in distance,

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.840
and they're interesting.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.600
So here's the usual drunk
and the masochistic drunk.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.730
So you can see, sure
enough, the usual drunk,

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:20.360
this fuschia line is
progressing very slowly

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.880
and the masochistic drunk,
considerably faster.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.150
I looked at these, and
after looking at those two,

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.660
I tried to figure
out whether there

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.700
was some mathematical
explanation of what

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.670
was going on, and
decided, well, it

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.830
looked to me like
the usual drunk

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.440
was moving at about the square
root of the number of steps.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.010
Not so odd to think about it,
if you go back to old Pythagoras

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.880
here.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.870
And sure enough, when I plot,
and I ran this simulation up

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.120
to 100,000 steps.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.950
When I plot the square root
of the number of steps,

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:03.280
it's not identical, but
it's pretty darn close.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.630
Seems to be moving just a tad
faster than the square root,

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.440
but not much.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.690
But who knows exactly?

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.760
But pretty good.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.090
And then the
masochistic drunk seems

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:23.960
to be moving at a rate
of numSteps times 0.05.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.574
A less intuitive answer
than the square root.

00:33:27.574 --> 00:33:29.240
Why do you think it
might be doing that?

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.300
Well, what we notice is that--

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.800
and we'll look at this--

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.380
maybe there's not
much difference

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.010
between what the masochistic
drunk and the usual drunk

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:50.640
do on the x-axis, east and west.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.760
In fact, they shouldn't be.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.210
But there should be a
difference on the y-axis,

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.900
because every time,
1/4 of the time,

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:05.840
the drunk is taking a
step north of 1.1 units,

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:11.034
and 1/4 of the time, he's taking
a step south of 0.9 units.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.560
And so 1/2 the
time, the steps are

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:22.239
diverging by a small fraction.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:25.320
And if we think about
it, 0.1 1/2 the time.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.480
We divide it.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.989
We get 0.05.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:36.620
So at least we need to
do some more analysis,

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.380
but the data is
pretty compelling here

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.940
that it's a very good fit.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.139
Well, let's look at
the ending location.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:49.830
So here you see a rather
different kind of plot.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.260
Here I'm showing
that you can plot

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:56.719
these things without
connecting them by lines.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.190
And giving them
different shapes.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.630
So what here I've said is
that the masochistic drunk

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:14.500
we're going to plot
using red triangles,

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:21.915
and the usual drunk I'm going
to plot using black plus signs.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.870
And since I'm going
to plot the location

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:32.690
at the end of many walks,
it doesn't make sense

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.180
to draw lines
connecting everything,

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:39.780
because all we're caring
about here is the endpoints.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.720
So since I only
want the endpoints,

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.600
I'm plotting them
a different way.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:55.880
So for example, I can write
something like plot( xVals,

00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:06.340
yVals, and then if I do
something like let's see.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.610
Just 'b0' in fact.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:17.150
What that says is
plot blue circles.

00:36:21.094 --> 00:36:22.010
I could have written--

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:33.370
in fact I did write 'k+' and
that says black plus signs.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.840
And I don't actually
remember what

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.110
I did to get the triangles,
but it's in the code.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:44.970
And so that's very
flexible what you do.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:47.040
And as you can see
here, we get the insight

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.750
I'd communicated earlier that
if you look at east and west,

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:56.870
not much difference between
this ball and that ball.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:02.060
They seem to be moving about the
same spread, the same outliers.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.470
But this ball is
displaced north.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:10.400
And not surprisingly,
after 10,000 steps,

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.200
you would not expect
any of these points

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.200
to be below zero, where
you'd expect roughly half

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.625
of these points
to be below zero.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.630
And indeed that's about true.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:28.950
And we see here what's
going on that if we

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:33.840
look at the mean absolute
difference in x and y,

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.800
we see that not
a huge difference

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.480
between the usual drunk
and the masochistic drunk.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.550
There happens to be a distance.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.050
But a huge difference--

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.200
sorry, x and x.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.150
Comparing the two y values,
there's a big difference,

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:51.487
as you see here.

00:37:51.487 --> 00:37:52.820
So what's the point of all this?

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.090
It's not to learn about
different kinds of drunks.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:59.120
It's to show how,
by visualization, we

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.990
can get insight into
our data that if I just

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:07.040
printed spreadsheets showing
you all of these endpoints,

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.160
it would be hard to make
sense of what was there.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.130
So get accustomed
to using plotting

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:14.630
to help you understand data.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:21.710
Now let's play a little bit
more with the simulation.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.900
We looked at different
kinds of drunks.

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.030
Let's look at different
kinds of fields.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:29.000
So I want to look
at a field with what

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.440
we'll call a wormhole in it.

00:38:34.032 --> 00:38:35.740
For those of you of
a certain generation,

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.980
you will recognize the Tardis.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.850
So the idea here is
that the field is such

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.700
that as you wander around
it, everything is normal.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.190
But every once in a
while you hit a place

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.750
where you're
magically transported

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.330
to a different place.

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.480
So it behaves very peculiarly.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.910
So let's call this an OddField.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:03.480
Not odd numbers, but
odd as in strange.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:07.620
So it's going to be
a subclass of field.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.780
We're going to have a
parameter that tells us

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.390
how many worm holes it has.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:16.880
A default value of 1,000.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:23.000
And we'll see how we use
xRange and yRange shortly.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.510
So what are the
first thing we do?

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:28.400
Well, we'll call Field _init
to initialize the field

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.200
in the usual way.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.720
And then we're going to create
a dictionary of wormholes.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.560
So for w in the range
number of worm holes,

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.450
I'm going to choose a
random x and a random y

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:45.980
in xRange minus xRange to plus
xRange, minus yRange to yRange.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.050
So this is going to be where
the worm holes are located.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.790
And then for each
of those, I'm going

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:57.690
to get a random location
where you're, in some sense,

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:01.830
teleported to if you
enter the wormhole.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.770
So here we're using random
to get random integers.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:07.390
We've seen that before.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:09.600
And so the new location
will be the location

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.040
of the new x and
the new y, and we're

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:18.570
going to update this
dictionary of wormholes

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:23.280
to say that paired with the
location x, y is newLoc.

00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:34.310
Now when we move the drunk, and
again this is just changing--

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:37.460
we're overriding moveDrunk,
so we're overriding one

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.410
of the methods in Field.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:46.230
So Field.moveDrunk will
take a self and a drunk.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.460
It's going to get the
x value, the y value,

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:55.350
and if that is in
the wormholes, it's

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.810
going to move the drunk
to the location associated

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.650
with that wormhole.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.320
So we move a drunk, and
if the drunk ends up

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:07.060
being in the wormhole,
he gets transported.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.750
So we're using Field.moveDrunk.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:16.150
So notice that we're using the
moveDrunk of the superclass,

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.100
even though we're
overriding it here.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.400
Because we've overridden it
here, I have to say Field.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.010
to indicate I want the one
from the superclass, not

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.510
the subclass.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.900
And then we're doing something
peculiar after the move.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:36.120
So interestingly
here, I've taken,

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.990
I think, a usual drunk and
plotted the usual drunk

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:44.450
on a walk of 500 steps.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:50.250
One walk, and shown all the
places the drunk visited.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.820
So we've seen three
kinds of plots,

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.100
one showing how far the drunk
would get at different length

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:01.800
walks, one showing
all the places

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.850
the drunk would end up with
many walks of the same length,

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:10.890
and here a single walk, all
the places the drunk visits.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:12.480
And as you can
see, the wormholes

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.450
produce a profound
effect, in this case,

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:19.720
on where the drunks end up.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.030
And again, you have the code.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:24.420
You can run this
yourself and simulate it

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.950
and see what you go.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.970
And I think I've set
random.Seed to zero

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.630
in each of the
simulations in the code,

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.070
but you should play
with it, change it,

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:38.021
to just see that you'll
actually get different results

00:42:38.021 --> 00:42:38.895
with different seeds.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:50.380
Let me summarize here,
and say the point of going

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:55.430
through these random walks is
not the simulations themselves,

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.090
but how we built them.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:02.070
That we started by
defining the classes.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.250
We then built
functions corresponding

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:10.520
to one trial, multiple trials,
and reported the results.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.090
And then made a set
of incremental changes

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:17.600
to the simulation so
that we could investigate

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.780
different questions.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.670
So we started with
a simple simulation

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:28.090
with just the usual drunk
and the simple field,

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:31.930
and we noticed it didn't work.

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:32.830
How did we know it?

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.470
Well, not because when we
did the full simulation

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:38.410
we had great insight.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.300
I probably could have
fooled 1/2 of you

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.370
and convinced you that that
was a reasonable answer.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:46.870
But as soon as we went and
did the sanity check, where

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:52.780
we knew the answer, we could
know something was wrong.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.730
And then we went
and we fixed it.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.590
And then we went
and we elaborated it

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.730
at a step of a time.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.560
I first got a more sophistic--

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.090
I shouldn't say sophisticated.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.510
A different kind of drunk.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.350
And then we went to a
different kind of field.

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.810
Finally, we spent
time showing how

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.630
to use plots to get an insight.

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.340
And in the remaining few
minutes of the class,

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.580
I want to go back and show you
some of the plotting commands.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.780
To show you how these
plots were produced.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.020
So one of the things
I did, since I

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.830
knew I was going to be producing
a lot of different plots,

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:53.060
I decided I would actually
not spend time worrying

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.926
about what kind of markers--

00:44:56.926 --> 00:44:58.550
those are the things
like the triangles

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.650
and the plus sign-- or
what colors for each one

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:03.080
individually, but
instead I'd set up

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.560
a styleIterator that
would just return

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.860
a bunch of different styles.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:13.160
So once and for all, I
could define n styles,

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.490
and then when I want to
plot a new kind of drunk,

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:18.500
I would just call
the styleIterator

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.680
to get the next style.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.790
So this is a fairly
common kind of paradigm

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:28.420
to say that I just want to
do this once and for all.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.880
I don't want to have to go
through each time I do this.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.030
So what do the styles look like?

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.441
Let me just get this window.

00:45:47.441 --> 00:45:47.940
Oh.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.990
So here it is.

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:05.910
I said there were going to
be three styles that I'm

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.830
going to iterate through.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:12.400
Style one is going
to be an m, I guess

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:20.050
that's maroon with a line,
a blue with a dashed line,

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:29.810
and green with a line with
a comma and a minus sign.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:33.440
So these are called the styles.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.370
And you can control the
marker, if you have a marker.

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:38.930
You can control the line.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:41.220
You can control the color.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.950
Also you can control the size.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.070
You can give the sizes
of all these things.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.640
What you'll see when
you look at the code

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.110
is I don't like
the default styles

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.250
things, because when they
show up on the screen,

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.020
they're too small.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.310
So there's something
called rcParams.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:03.810
Those of you who
are Unix hackers

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:06.889
can maybe guess where
that name came from.

00:47:06.889 --> 00:47:08.430
And I've just said
a bunch of things,

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:11.670
like that my default line
width will be four points.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.610
The size for the
titles will be 20.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:16.120
You can put titles
on the graphs.

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:20.700
Various kinds of things.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:26.120
Again, once and for all trying
to set some of these parameters

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.730
so they get used
over and over again.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:43.260
And then finally
down here, you'll

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.870
see that I did
things like you want

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:48.900
to put titles on the slides.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.490
So on the graph.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.970
So here's the location
at end of walk.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.250
Title is just a string.

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:58.840
You want to label
your x and y-axis,

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.990
so I've labeled them here.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:06.140
And here I've said where I
want the legend to appear

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.175
in the lower center.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:15.210
I've also set the y-limits
and the x-limits on the axis,

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.430
because I wanted a
little extra room.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:20.760
Otherwise, by default
it will put points

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.620
right on the axes, which
I find hard to read.

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.620
Anyway, the point here is
not that you understand

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.930
all of this instantaneously.

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:34.850
The point I want to communicate
is that it's very flexible.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:37.190
And so if you decide
you don't like

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.810
the way a plot looks and
you want to change it,

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:41.830
and you know what you
want it to look like,

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:45.380
there's almost surely a
way to make it do that.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.360
So don't despair.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.150
You can look at the
references I gave earlier

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.990
and figure that out.

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:56.140
Next lecture we're
going to move on.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.030
No more random walks.

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.550
We'll look at
simulating other things,

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:05.230
and in particular, we'll look at
the question of how believable

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.360
is a simulation?

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.610
See you Wednesday if the
world has not come to an end.
