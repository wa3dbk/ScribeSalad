00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.320
JOHN GUTTAG: Hello, everybody.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.880
Some announcements.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.310
The last reading assignment of
the semester, at least from us.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.850
Course evaluations are still
available through this Friday.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.530
But only till noon.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.930
Again, I urge you all to do it.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.180
And then finally,
for the final exam,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.890
we're going to be
giving you some code

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.800
to study in advance of the exam.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.110
And then we will ask
questions about that code

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.480
on the exam itself.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
This was described in the
announcement for the exam.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.290
And we will be making this
code available later today.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.110
Now, I would suggest
that you try and get

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.610
your heads around it.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.160
If you are confused,
that's a good thing

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.850
to talk about in office hours,
to get some help with it,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.160
as opposed to waiting till
20 minutes before the exam

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.410
and realizing you're confused.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.720
All right.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.850
I want to pick up where
we left off on Monday.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.850
So you may recall that we
were comparing results of KNN

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.970
and logistic regression
on our Titanic data.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.240
And we have this up using 10
80/20 splits for KNN equals 3

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.170
and logistic regression
with p equals 0.5.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.800
And what I observed is that
logistic regression happened

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.979
to perform slightly
better, but certainly

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.810
nothing that you would
choose to write home about.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.344
It's a little bit better.

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.135
That isn't to say it
will always be better.

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:19.620
It happens to be here.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.390
But the point I
closed with is one

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.680
of the things we care about when
we use machine learning is not

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.890
only our ability to make
predictions with the model.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.120
But what can we learn by
studying the model itself?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.630
Remember, the idea is
that the model is somehow

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.590
capturing the system
or the process that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.330
generated the data.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.720
And by studying the model we
can learn something useful.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.170
So to do that for
logistic regression,

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.390
we begin by looking
at the weights

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.400
of the different variables.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.850
And we had this up
in the last slide.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.070
The model classes are
"Died" and "Survived."

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.500
For the label Survived,
we said that if you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.880
were in a first-class
cabin, that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.170
had a positive impact on
your survival, a pretty

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.740
strong positive impact.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.920
You can't interpret these
weights in and of themselves.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.540
If I said it's 1.6, that
really doesn't mean anything.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.970
So what you have to look at
is the relative weights, not

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.080
the absolute weights.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.420
And we see that it's a pretty
strong relative weight.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.940
A second-class cabin also has a
positive weight, in this case,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.230
of 0.46.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.300
So it was indicating
you better had

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.870
a better-than-average
chance of surviving,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.410
but much less strong
than a first class.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.990
And if you are one of those poor
people in a third-class cabin,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.170
well, that had a negative
weight on survival.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.640
You were less likely to survive.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.899
Age had a very small effect
here, slightly negative.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.160
What that meant is the older
you were, the less likely

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.959
you were to have survived.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.610
But it's a very
small negative value.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.720
The male gender had a relatively
large negative gender,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.280
suggesting that
if you were a male

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.650
you were more likely to die
than if you were a female.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.300
This might be true in
the general population,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.010
but it was especially
true on the Titanic.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.360
Finally, I warned you that
while what I just went through

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.500
is something you will read in
lots of papers that use machine

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.520
learning, you will
hear in lots of talks

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.800
about people who have
used machine learning.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.610
But you should be very wary
when people speak that way.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.290
It's not nonsense, but
some cautionary notes.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.200
In particular,
there's a big issue

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.950
because the features are often
correlated with one another.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.345
And so you can't interpret the
weights one feature at a time.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.980
To get a little bit
technical, there

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.410
are two major ways people
use logistic regression.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.180
They're called L1 and L2.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.960
We used an L2.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.610
I'll come back to
that in a minute.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.460
Because that's the default
in Python, or in [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.290
You can set that parameter at L2
and do that to L1 if you want.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.460
I experimented with it.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.580
It didn't change the
results that much.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.760
But what an L1 regression
is designed to do

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.595
is to find some weights
and drive them to 0.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.150
This is particularly
useful when you

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.160
have a very high-dimensional
problem relative to the number

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.840
of examples.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.030
And this gets back
to that question

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.650
we've talked about many
times, of overfitting.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.290
If you've got 1,000
variables and 1,000 examples,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.565
you're very likely to overfit.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.270
L1 is designed to
avoid overfitting

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.450
by taking many of
those 1,000 variables

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.470
and just giving them 0 weight.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.030
And it does typically
generalize better.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.000
But if you have two variables
that are correlated,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.160
L1 will drive 1
to 0, and it will

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.602
look like it's unimportant.

00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:51.060
But in fact, it
might be important.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.370
It's just correlated
with another, which

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.880
has gotten all the credit.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.880
L2, which is what we
did, does the opposite.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.550
Is spreads the weight
across the variables.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.300
So have a bunch of
correlated variables,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.060
it might look like none of
them are very important.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.230
Because each of them gets a
small amount of the weight.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.350
Again, not so important when
you have four or five variables,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.850
is what I'm showing you.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.180
But it matters when you
have 100 or 1,000 variables.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.110
Let's look at an example.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:36.410
So the cabin classes, the way we
set it up, c1 plus c2 plus c3--

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.600
whoops-- is not equal to 0.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.000
What is it equal to?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.916
I'll fix this right now.

00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:47.040
What should that have said?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.040
What's the invariant here?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.010
Well, a person is in
exactly one class.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.510
I guess if you're
really rich, maybe

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.590
you rented two cabins, one
in first and one in second.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.110
But probably not.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.900
Or if you did, you put your
servants in second or third.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.290
But what does this
got to add up to?

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:11.790
Yeah?

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.289
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:14.044
JOHN GUTTAG: Has to add up to 1.

00:08:14.044 --> 00:08:15.012
Thank you.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.240
So it adds up to 1.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.900
Whoa.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.990
Got his attention, at least.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.250
So what this tells us is the
values are not independent.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.590
Because if c1 is 1, then
c2 and c3 must be 0.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.090
Right?

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.410
And so now we could go
back to the previous slide

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.000
and ask the question well, is
it that being in first class

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.590
is protective?

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:57.070
Or is it that being in second
or third class is risky?

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.580
And there's no simple
answer to that.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.140
So let's do an experiment.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.910
We have these
correlated variables.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:10.270
Suppose we eliminate
c1 altogether.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:18.020
So I did that by changing the
init method of class passenger.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:25.650
Takes the same arguments,
but we'll look at the code.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.190
Because it's a little
bit clearer there.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.240
So there was the original one.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.190
And I'm going to
replace that by this.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.670
combine that with
the original one.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:54.700
So what you see is that instead
of having five features,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.870
I now have four.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.290
I've eliminated the
c1 binary feature.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:09.330
And then the code
is straightforward,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.240
that I've just
come through here,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.900
and I've just enumerated
the possibilities.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.830
So if you're in first
class, then second and third

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.570
are both 0.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.150
Otherwise, one of them is a 1.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.690
So my invariant is
gone now, right?

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.030
It's not the case that
we know that these two

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.740
things have to add up
to 1, because maybe I'm

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:35.535
in the third case.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:46.120
OK, let's go run that
code and see what happens.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.680
Well, if you remember, we
see that our accuracy has not

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.570
really declined much.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.960
Pretty much the same
results we got before.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.320
But our weights are
really quite different.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.000
Now, suddenly, c2 and c3
have large negative weights.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.320
We can look at them
side by side here.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.730
So you see, not much difference.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.040
It actually performs maybe--

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.145
well, really no real
difference in performance.

00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:41.020
But you'll notice that
the weights are really

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.490
quite different.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:49.400
That now, what had been a strong
positive weight and relatively

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.370
weak negative weights
is now replaced

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.095
by two strong negative weights.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:04.120
And age and gender
change just a little bit.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.770
So the whole point
here is that we

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.710
have to be very careful, when
you have correlated features,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.590
about over-interpreting
the weights.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.560
It is generally pretty
safe to rely on the sign,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.160
whether it's
negative or positive.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.740
All right, changing
the topic but sticking

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.760
with logistic regression,
there is this parameter

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.342
you may recall, p, which
is the probability.

00:12:30.342 --> 00:12:32.810
And that was the cut-off.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.440
And we set it to 0.5,
saying if it estimates

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:41.660
the probability of survival
to be 0.5 or higher,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.110
then we're going to guess
survived, predict survived.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.440
Otherwise, deceased.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.510
You can change that.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:57.300
And so I'm going to try two
extreme values, setting p

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:04.500
to 0.1 and p to 0.9.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.875
Now, what do we think
that's likely to change?

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.682
Remember, we looked at a
bunch of different attributes.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.360
In particular, what
attributes do we

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.310
think are most likely to change?

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.062
Anyone who has not answered
a question want to volunteer?

00:13:24.062 --> 00:13:25.770
I have nothing against
you, it's just I'm

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.490
trying to spread the wealth.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.555
And I don't want to give you
diabetes, with all the candy.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.552
All right, you get to go again.

00:13:35.552 --> 00:13:37.356
AUDIENCE: Sensitivity.

00:13:37.356 --> 00:13:38.290
JOHN GUTTAG: Pardon?

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.039
AUDIENCE: The sensitivity
and specificity.

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:42.630
JOHN GUTTAG: Sensitivity
and specificity,

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.400
positive predictive value.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.080
Because we're shifting.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.845
And we're saying, well, by
changing the probability,

00:13:51.845 --> 00:13:53.220
we're making a
decision that it's

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.570
more important to
not miss survivors

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:03.020
than it is to, say,
ask gets too high.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.870
So let's look at what
happens when we run that.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.230
I won't run it for you.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.900
But these are the
results we got.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.380
So as it happens, 0.9
gave me higher accuracy.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.040
But the key thing is, notice
the big difference here.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.460
So what is that telling me?

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.800
Well, it's telling me that
if I predict you're going

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.520
to survive you probably did.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.980
But look what it did
to the sensitivity.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.380
It means that most
of the survivors,

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.300
I'm predicting they died.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.910
Why is the accuracy still OK?

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.060
Well, because most people
died on the boat, on the ship,

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.140
right?

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.740
So we would have done
pretty well, you recall,

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.135
if we just guessed
died for everybody.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.960
So it's important to
understand these things.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.799
I once did some
work using machine

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.340
learning for an
insurance company who

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.440
was trying to set rates.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.570
And I asked them what
they wanted to do.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.059
And they said they didn't
want to lose money.

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:29.600
They didn't want to
insure people who

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.060
were going to get in accidents.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.750
So I was able to
change this p parameter

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.730
so that it did a great job.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:43.130
The problem was they got to
write almost no policies.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.010
Because I could pretty much
guarantee the people I said

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.787
wouldn't get in an
accident wouldn't.

00:15:47.787 --> 00:15:49.370
But there were a
whole bunch of people

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.980
who didn't, who they
wouldn't write policies for.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.844
So they ended up not
making any money.

00:15:53.844 --> 00:15:54.760
It was a bad decision.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.960
So we can change the cutoff.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:09.720
That leads to a really
important concept

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.330
of something called the Receiver
Operating Characteristic.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.870
And it's a funny name, having
to do with it originally

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.990
going back to radio receivers.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.050
But we can ignore that.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.970
The goal here is
to say, suppose I

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:33.160
don't want to make a decision
about where the cutoff is,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.320
but I want to look at, in some
sense, all possible cutoffs

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.980
and look at the shape of it.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.190
And that's what this
code is designed to do.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:54.180
So the way it works is I'll
take a training set and a test

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.450
set, usual thing.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.990
I'll build one model.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.620
And that's an important thing,
that there's only one model

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.589
getting built. And then
I'm going to vary p.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.300
And I'm going to
call apply model

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.390
with the same model
and the same test set,

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:23.234
but different p's and keep
track of all of those results.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:33.050
I'm then going to plot
a two-dimensional plot.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.590
The y-axis will
have sensitivity.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.940
And the x-axis will have
one minus specificity.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.695
So I am accumulating
a bunch of results.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.920
And then I'm going to
produce this curve calling

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:14.050
sklearn.metrics.auc,
that's not the curve.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:20.455
AUC stands for Area
Under the Curve.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.175
And we'll see why we want to
get that area under the curve.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:37.410
When I run that,
it produces this.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.202
So here's the curve,
the blue line.

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.270
And there's some things
to note about it.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:55.640
Way down at this end
I can have 0, right?

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.430
I can set it so that I
don't make any predictions.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.210
And this is interesting.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.070
So at this end it
is saying what?

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.180
Remember that my x-axis
is not specificity,

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.280
but 1 minus specificity.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:27.600
So what we see is this corner
is highly sensitive and very

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.300
unspecific.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.570
So I'll get a lot
of false positives.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:40.330
This corner is very specific,
because 1 minus specificity

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.610
is 0, and very insensitive.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.210
So way down at the bottom,
I'm declaring nobody

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.100
to be positive.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.960
And way up here, everybody.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.580
Clearly, I don't
want to be at either

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.470
of these places on
the curve, right?

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.680
Typically I want to be
somewhere in the middle.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.820
And here, we can see, there's
a nice knee in the curve here.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.910
We can choose a place.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.490
What does this green line
represent, do you think?

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:26.430
The green line represents
a random classifier.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.370
I flip a coin and I
just classify something

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:38.430
positive or negative, depending
on the heads or tails,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.000
in this case.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:49.190
So now we can look at an
interesting region, which

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:57.560
is this region, the
area between the curve

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.780
and a random classifier.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.650
And that sort of tells me how
much better I am than random.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:12.810
I can look at the whole area,
the area under the curve.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.280
And that's this, the area under
the Receiver Operating Curve.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:33.160
In the best of all worlds,
the curve would be 1.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.290
That would be a
perfect classifier.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.110
In the worst of all
worlds, it would be 0.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:45.190
But it's never 0 because
we don't do worse than 0.5.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.170
We hope not to do
worse than random.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.320
If so, we just reverse
our predictions.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.840
And then we're
better than random.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.750
So random is as bad
as you can do, really.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.600
And so this is a very
important concept.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.120
And it lets us evaluate how good
a classifier is independently

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.000
of what we choose
to be the cutoff.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.020
So when you read the
literature and people say,

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.050
I have this wonderful method
of making predictions,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.780
you'll almost always
see them cite the AUROC.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.430
Any questions about
this or about machine

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.900
learning in general?

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.420
If so, this would be a
good time to ask them,

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.640
since I'm about to
totally change the topic.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.750
Yes?

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.710
AUDIENCE: At what
level does AUROC

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.160
start to be statistically
significant?

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.610
And how many data
points do you need

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.080
to also prove that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.871
JOHN GUTTAG: Right.

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.340
So the question
is, at what point

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:59.260
does the AUROC become
statistically significant?

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.515
And that is, essentially,
an unanswerable question.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.260
Whoops, relay it back.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.046
Needed to put more
air under the throw.

00:23:13.046 --> 00:23:18.751
I look like the
quarterback for the Rams,

00:23:18.751 --> 00:23:21.790
if you saw them play lately.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:27.370
So if you ask this question
about significance,

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.890
it will depend upon
a number of things.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:36.147
So you're always asking, is it
significantly better than x?

00:23:36.147 --> 00:23:38.230
And so the question is,
is it significantly better

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.150
than random?

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.770
And you can't just say, for
example, that 0.6 isn't and 0.7

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.880
is.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.320
Because it depends how
many points you have.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.910
If you have a lot
of points, it could

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.280
be only a tiny bit
better than 0.5

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.360
and still be
statistically significant.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.990
It may be
uninterestingly better.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.120
It may not be significant
in the English sense,

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.280
but you still get
statistical significance.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.570
So that's a problem when
studies have lots of points.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.620
In general, it depends
upon the application.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.950
For a lot of applications,
you'll see things in the 0.7's

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.770
being considered pretty useful.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.740
And the real question shouldn't
be whether it's significant,

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.450
but whether it's useful.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.270
Can you make useful
decisions based upon it?

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.420
And the other thing
is, typically,

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:36.010
when you're talking about that,
you're selecting some point

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:40.410
and really talking about a
region relative to that point.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.710
We usually don't really
care what it does out here.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.950
Because we hardly ever
operate out there anyway.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.970
We're usually somewhere
in the middle.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.040
But good question.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.576
Yeah?

00:24:53.576 --> 00:24:55.836
AUDIENCE: Why are we
doing 1 minus specificity?

00:24:55.836 --> 00:24:58.300
JOHN GUTTAG: Why are we
doing 1 minus specificity

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.320
instead of specificity?

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.500
Is that the question?

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.720
And the answer is,
essentially, so we

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.630
can do this trick of
computing the area.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.480
It gives us this nice curve.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.620
This nice, if you
will, concave curve

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.750
which lets us compute
this area under here

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:21.850
nicely if you were to take
specificity and just draw it,

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.055
it would look different.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.500
Obviously, mathematically,
they're, in some sense,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.820
the same right.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.920
If you have 1 minus x and x, you
can get either from the other.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.750
So it really just has
to do with the way

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.904
people want to
draw this picture.

00:25:39.904 --> 00:25:42.748
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:42.748 --> 00:25:43.696
JOHN GUTTAG: Pardon?

00:25:43.696 --> 00:25:45.592
AUDIENCE: Does that
not change [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:45.592 --> 00:25:47.694
JOHN GUTTAG: Does it not--

00:25:47.694 --> 00:25:49.908
AUDIENCE: Doesn't it
change the meaning

00:25:49.908 --> 00:25:51.112
of what you're [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:51.112 --> 00:25:53.570
JOHN GUTTAG: Well, you'd have
to use a different statistic.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:59.550
You couldn't cite the AUROC if
you did specificity directly.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.760
Which is why they do 1 minus.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.650
The goal is you want to have
this point at 0 and this 0.00

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.350
and 1.1.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.480
And playing 1 minus
gives you this trick,

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.760
of anchoring those two points.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.170
And so then you get a
curve connecting them,

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.330
which you can then easily
compare to the random curve.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.330
It's just one of
these little tricks

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.760
that statisticians
like to play to make

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.530
things easy to visualize and
easy to compute statistics

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.310
about.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.920
It's not a fundamentally
important issue.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.330
Anything else?

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.315
All right, so I told you I
was going to change topics--

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.760
finally got one completed--

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.000
and I am.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.300
And this is a topic I
approach with some reluctance.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.540
So you have probably all
heard this expression,

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:04.290
that there are three
kinds of lies, lies,

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.480
damn lies, and statistics.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.390
And we've been talking
a lot about statistics.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.810
And now I want to spend
the rest of today's lecture

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:19.340
and the start of
Wednesday's lecture

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.080
talking about how to
lie with statistics.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.750
So at this point, I usually put
on my "Numbers Never Lie" hat.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:36.260
But do say that numbers never
lie, but liars use numbers.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.530
And I hope none of you will
ever go work for a politician

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.440
and put this
knowledge to bad use.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.960
This quote is well known.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.220
It's variously
attributed, often,

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.490
to Mark Twain, the
fellow on the left.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.590
He claimed not to
have invented it,

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:55.460
but said it was invented
by Benjamin Disraeli.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.620
And I prefer to
believe that, since it

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:02.690
does seem like something a
Prime Minister would invent.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.880
So let's think about this.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.090
The issue here is the
way the human mind works

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.320
and statistics.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.440
Darrell Huff, a
well-known statistician

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.064
who did write a book called
How to Lie with Statistics,

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:20.480
says, "if you can't
prove what you

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.740
want to prove, demonstrate
something else and pretend

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.200
they are the same thing.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.780
In the daze that follows
the collision of statistics

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.300
with the human
mind, hardly anyone

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.940
will notice the difference."

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:39.910
And indeed, empirically,
he seems to be right.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.530
So let's look at some examples.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.360
Here's one I like.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.890
This is from another famous
statistician called Anscombe.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.890
And he invented this thing
called Anscombe's Quartet.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.600
I take my hat off now.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.530
It's too hot in here.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.745
A bunch of numbers,
11 x, y pairs.

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:05.550
I know you don't want
to look at the numbers,

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.980
so here are some
statistics about them.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:14.090
Each of those pairs
has the same mean value

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.840
for x, the same mean
for y, the same variance

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.750
for x, the same variance for y.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.630
And then I went and I fit a
linear regression model to it.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.560
And lo and behold, I got the
same equation for everyone,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.430
y equals 0.5x plus 3.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:36.020
So that raises the
question, if we go back,

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.740
is there really much difference
between these pairs of x and y?

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.212
Are they really similar?

00:29:46.212 --> 00:29:47.670
And the answer is,
that's what they

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:49.010
look like if you plot them.

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.710
So even though
statistically they

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.580
appear to be kind
of the same, they

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.110
could hardly be more
different, right?

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.440
Those are not the
same distributions.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.560
So there's an
important moral here,

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.960
which is that
statistics about data

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.380
is not the same thing
as the data itself.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.460
And this seems obvious,
but it's amazing

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.590
how easy it is to forget it.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.270
The number of papers
I've read where

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.470
I see a bunch of
statistics about the data

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.550
but don't see the
data is enormous.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.940
And it's easy to lose
track of the fact

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:33.470
that the statistics don't
tell the whole story.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.800
So the answer is the
old Chinese proverb,

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.824
a picture is worth
a thousand words,

00:30:39.824 --> 00:30:41.740
I urge you, the first
thing you should do when

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.740
you get a data set, is plot it.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.980
If it's got too many points
to plot all the points,

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.050
subsample it and
plot of subsample.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:57.530
Use some visualization tool
to look at the data itself.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.820
Now, that said,
pictures are wonderful.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.400
But you can lie with pictures.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.380
So here's an interesting chart.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:10.020
These are grades in
6.0001 by gender.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.600
So the males are blue
and the females are pink.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.440
Sorry for being such
a traditionalist.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:20.520
And as you can see, the women
did way better than the men.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.970
Now, I know for some of you
this is confirmation bias.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.680
You say, of course.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.350
Others say, impossible, But in
fact, if you look carefully,

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.730
you'll see that's not what
this chart says at all.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:37.050
Because if you look
at the axis here,

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:41.510
you'll see that actually
there's not much difference.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:45.490
Here's what I get if
I plot it from 0 to 5.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.390
Yeah, the women did
a little bit better.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.620
But that's not a
statistically-significant

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.190
difference.

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:57.510
And by the way, when I plotted
it last year for 6.0002,

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.780
the blue was about that
much higher than the pink.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.480
Don't read much
into either of them.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.350
But the trick was
here, I took the y-axis

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:13.280
and ran it from 3.9 to 4.05.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.550
I cleverly chose my
baseline in such a way

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:20.160
to make the difference look
much bigger than it is.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:26.740
Here I did the honest thing
of put the baseline at 0

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.750
and run it to 5.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.140
Because that's the
range of grades at MIT.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.820
And so when you look
at a chart, it's

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.410
important to keep
in mind that you

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:43.650
need to look at the axis
labels and the scales.

00:32:47.092 --> 00:32:48.800
Let's look at another
chart, just in case

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.580
you think I'm the only one who
likes to play with graphics.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.280
This is a chart from Fox News.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.210
And they're arguing here.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.860
It's the shocking
statistics that there

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.640
are 108.6 million
people on welfare,

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.980
and 101.7 with a full-time job.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.780
And you can imagine the rhetoric
that accompanies this chart.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.255
This is actually correct.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.880
It is true from the
Census Bureau data.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.230
Sort of.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:30.010
But notice that
I said you should

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:33.970
read the labels on the axes.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.150
There is no label here.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:45.640
But you can bet that the
y-intercept is not 0 on this.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.670
Because you can see how
small 101.7 looks like.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.420
So it makes the difference
look bigger than it is.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:02.000
Now, that's not the only
funny thing about it.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.650
I said you should look at
the labels on the x-axis.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.290
Well, they've labeled them.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.639
But what do these things mean?

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.679
Well, I looked it
up, and I'll tell you

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.960
what they actually mean.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.760
People on welfare
counts the number

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.581
of people in a household in
which at least one person is

00:34:23.581 --> 00:34:24.080
on welfare.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.340
So if there is say, two
parents, one is working

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.590
and one is collecting
welfare and there

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.949
are four kids, that counts
as six people on welfare.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:43.860
People with a full-time
job, is actually

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.370
does not count households.

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:50.030
So in the same
family, you would have

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:56.179
six on the bar on the left, and
one on the bar on the right.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:35:00.670
Clearly giving a very
different impression.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:04.600
And so again,
pictures can be good.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.970
But if you don't dive deep into
them, they really can fool you.

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.010
Now, before I should
leave this slide,

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.740
I should say that it's not the
case that you can't believe

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.500
anything you read on Fox News.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.560
Because in fact, the Red Sox
did beat the St. Louis Cardinals

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.540
4 to 2 that day.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.840
So the moral here is to ask
whether the things being

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.990
compared are
actually comparable.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.860
Or you're really comparing
apples and oranges,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.600
as they say.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.370
OK, this is probably the
most common statistical sin.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.260
It's called GIGO.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.110
And perhaps this
picture can make

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.510
you guess what the
G's stand for GIGO

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:55.590
is Garbage In, Garbage Out.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.260
So here's a great,
again, quote about it.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:10.840
So Charles Babbage designed
the first digital computer,

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.750
the first actual
computation engine.

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.430
He was unable to build it.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.650
But hundreds of years
after he died one

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:22.030
was built according to his
design, and it actually worked.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:24.460
No electronics, really.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.220
So he was a famous person.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.090
And he was asked by Parliament
about his machine, which

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:32.890
he was asking them to fund.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:36.640
Well, if you put wrong
numbers into the machine,

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.450
will the machine have right
numbers come out the other end?

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.250
And of course, he
was a very smart guy.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.830
And he was totally baffled.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.020
This question
seems so stupid, he

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.510
couldn't believe anyone
would even ask it.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.810
That it was just computation.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:58.420
And the answers you get are
based on the data you put in.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.270
If you put in garbage,
you get out garbage.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:08.100
So here is an example
from the 1840s.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.140
They did a census in the 1840s.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.840
And for those of you who are not
familiar with American history,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.610
it was a very contentious
time in the US.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.640
The country was divided
between states that had slavery

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.610
and states that didn't.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:28.160
And that was the dominant
political issue of the day.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.550
John Calhoun, who was
Secretary of State

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:37.010
and a leader in the Senate,
was from South Carolina

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:41.420
and probably the strongest
proponent of slavery.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:47.480
And he used the census data to
say that slavery was actually

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.920
good for the slaves.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.780
Kind of an amazing thought.

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.040
Basically saying that
this data claimed

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.760
that freed slaves
were more likely to be

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.590
insane than enslaved slaves.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:13.250
He was rebutted in the
House by John Quincy

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:17.120
Adams, who had formerly been
President of the United States.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.810
After he stopped being
President, he ran for Congress.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.390
From Braintree, Massachusetts.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:24.980
Actually now called
Quincy, the part

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.280
he's from, after his family.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.920
And he claimed that
atrocious misrepresentations

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.550
had been made on a subject
of deep importance.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.100
He was an abolitionist.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.292
So you don't even have to
look at that statistics

00:38:39.292 --> 00:38:40.250
to know who to believe.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:42.137
Just look at these pictures.

00:38:42.137 --> 00:38:43.970
Are you going to believe
this nice gentleman

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:49.100
from Braintree or this scary
guy from South Carolina?

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.780
But setting looks aside,
Calhoun eventually

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:58.080
admitted that the census
was indeed full of errors.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.600
But he said that was fine.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.992
Because there were
so many of them

00:39:01.992 --> 00:39:03.950
that they would balance
each other out and lead

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.500
to the same conclusion, as
if they were all correct.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.880
So he didn't believe in
garbage in, garbage out.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.050
He said yeah, it is garbage.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:16.160
But it'll all come
out in the end OK.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.790
Well, now we know enough
to ask the question.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:27.480
This isn't totally
brain dead, in that

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.090
we've already looked
at experiments

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.580
and said we get
experimental error.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:37.750
And under some circumstances,
you can manage the error.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.890
The data isn't garbage.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.390
It just has errors.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.370
But it's true if the
measurement errors

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:46.840
are unbiased and
independent of each other.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.740
And almost identically
distributed on either side

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.330
of the mean, right?

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.370
That's why we spend
so much time looking

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.990
at the normal distribution,
and why it's called Gaussian.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.880
Because Gauss
said, yes, I know I

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.730
have errors in my
astronomical measurements.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:08.200
But I believe my errors are
distributed in what we now

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.120
call a Gaussian curve.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.130
And therefore, I can
still work with them

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.960
and get an accurate
estimate of the values.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.010
Now, of course, that
wasn't true here.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.570
The errors were not random.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.360
They were, in fact,
quite systematic,

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.970
designed to produce
a certain thing.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:31.570
And the last word was
from another abolitionist

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.710
who claimed it was the
census that was insane.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:40.070
All right, that's
Garbage In, Garbage Out.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:45.130
The moral here is that
analysis of bad data

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:49.090
is worse than no
analysis at all, really.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:52.270
Time and again we see people
doing, actually often,

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:57.190
correct statistical
analysis of incorrect data

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.400
and reaching conclusions.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.500
And that's really risky.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.540
So before one goes
off and starts

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:08.770
using statistical techniques of
the sort we've been discussing,

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.690
the first question
you have to ask is,

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.620
is the data itself
worth analyzing?

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.250
And it often isn't.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:21.220
Now, you could argue that
this is a thing of the past,

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:25.090
and no modern politician would
make these kinds of mistakes.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.130
I'm not going to
insert a photo here.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.700
But I leave it to you to
think which politician's photo

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.810
you might paste in this frame.

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.490
All right, onto another
statistical sin.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:42.062
This is a picture of a
World War II fighter plane.

00:41:42.062 --> 00:41:44.520
I don't know enough about planes
to know what kind of plane

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.019
it is.

00:41:45.019 --> 00:41:45.810
Anyone here?

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.190
There must be an
Aero student who

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.660
will be able to tell
me what plane this is.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.460
Don't they teach you guys
anything in Aero these days?

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.150
Shame on them.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.080
All right.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.310
Anyway, it's a plane.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.690
That much I know.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:00.340
And it has a propeller.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.100
And that's all I can tell
you about the airplane.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.980
So this was a photo taken
at a airfield in Britain.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:12.960
And the Allies would
send planes over Germany

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.920
for bombing runs and fighters
to protect the bombers.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.610
And when they came back, the
planes were often damaged.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.070
And they would inspect
the damage and say look,

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:24.990
there's a lot of flak there.

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:28.740
The Germans shot
flak at the planes.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.560
And that would be
a part of the plane

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.990
that maybe we should
reinforce in the future.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:38.740
So when it gets hit by
flak it survives it.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.419
It does less damage.

00:42:40.419 --> 00:42:42.460
So you can analyze where
the Germans were hitting

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:46.030
the planes, and you would
add a little extra armor

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.160
to that part of the plane.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.528
What's the flaw in that?

00:42:53.528 --> 00:42:54.492
Yeah?

00:42:54.492 --> 00:42:56.366
AUDIENCE: They didn't
look at the planes that

00:42:56.366 --> 00:42:57.785
actually got shot down.

00:42:57.785 --> 00:42:59.080
JOHN GUTTAG: Yeah.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.070
This is what's called, in
the jargon, survivor bias.

00:43:09.955 --> 00:43:16.120
S-U-R-V-I-V-O-R.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.440
The planes they really
should have been analyzing

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.720
were the ones that
got shot down.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.000
But those were hard to analyze.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.370
So they analyzed
the ones they had

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:29.820
and drew conclusions,
and perhaps totally

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.254
the wrong conclusion.

00:43:31.254 --> 00:43:33.420
Maybe the conclusion they
should have drawn is well,

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.430
it's OK if you get hit here.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:38.070
Let's reinforce
the other places.

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.590
I don't know enough to know
what the right answer was.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:44.250
I do know that this was
statistically the wrong thing

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:47.420
to be thinking about doing.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.630
And this is an issue we have
whenever we do sampling.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:55.620
All statistical techniques
are based upon the assumption

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.140
that by sampling a
subset of the population

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.910
we can infer things about
the population as a whole.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:06.210
Everything we've done this
term has been based on that.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:11.220
When we were fitting
curves we were doing that.

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:15.270
When we were talking about the
empirical rule and Monte Carlo

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:17.362
Simulation, we were
doing that, when

00:44:17.362 --> 00:44:19.320
we were building models,
with machine learning,

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.170
we were doing that.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.290
And if random
sampling is used, you

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.800
can make meaningful
mathematical statements

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.000
about the relation of the
sample to the entire population.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:40.700
And that's why so much
of what we did works.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.150
And when we're
doing simulations,

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.010
that's really easy.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:48.970
When we were choosing
random values of the needles

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:52.045
for trying to find
pi, or random value

00:44:52.045 --> 00:44:54.490
if the roulette wheel spins.

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:57.130
We could be pretty sure our
samples were, indeed, random.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:04.290
In the field, it's not so easy.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:05.040
Right?

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.750
Because some samples
are much more

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:10.050
convenient to
acquire than others.

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.470
It's much easier to acquire a
plane on the field in Britain

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.960
than a plane on the
ground in France.

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:21.730
Convenient sampling,
as it's often called,

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:25.290
is not usually random.

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:27.620
So you have survivor bias.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:31.830
So I asked you to do
course evaluations.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:34.370
Well, there's
survivor bias there.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:38.240
The people who really hated this
course have already dropped it.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.310
And so we won't sample them.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:43.400
That's good for me, at least.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.890
But we see that.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.960
We see that with grades.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.769
The people who are
really struggling,

00:45:49.769 --> 00:45:51.560
who were most likely
to fail, have probably

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.715
dropped the course too.

00:45:53.715 --> 00:45:56.090
That's one of the reasons I
don't think it's fair to say,

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:57.256
we're going to have a curve.

00:45:57.256 --> 00:45:59.840
And we're going to always
fail this fraction,

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.910
and give A's to this fraction.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:05.800
Because by the end of the term,
we have a lot of survivor bias.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.430
The students who are left
are, on average, better

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.150
than the students who
started the semester.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:15.090
So you need to take
that into account.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:19.050
Another kind of
non-representative sampling

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:23.620
or convenience sampling
is opinion polls,

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:28.200
in that you have something
there called non-response bias.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.700
So I don't know
about you, but I get

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.470
phone calls asking my
opinion about things.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.010
Surveys about
products, whatever.

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:36.850
I never answer.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.470
I just hang up the phone.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:39.910
I get a zillion emails.

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:42.880
Every time I stay in a
hotel, I get an email

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.460
asking me to rate the hotel.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.310
When I fly I get e-mails
from the airline.

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:51.010
I don't answer any
of those surveys.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:54.580
But some people do, presumably,
or they wouldn't send them out.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.590
But why should they
think that the people who

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:59.080
answer the survey
are representative

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.790
of all the people who stay in
the hotel or all the people who

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.180
fly on the plane?

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.090
They're not.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:06.790
They're the kind
of people who maybe

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:09.350
have time to answer surveys.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:13.550
And so you get a
non-response bias.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:16.040
And that tends to
distort your results.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:23.970
When samples are not
random and independent,

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:25.920
we can still run
statistics on them.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.560
We can compute means
and standard deviations.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.630
And that's fine.

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.450
But we can't draw
conclusions using

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:36.780
things like the Empirical
Rule or the Central Limit

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.940
Theorem, Standard Error.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:43.200
Because the basic assumption
underlying all of that

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:48.180
is that the samples are
random and independent.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.190
This is one of the reasons
why political polls are

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:53.020
so unreliable.

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.230
They compute statistics
using Standard Error,

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:59.940
assuming that the samples
are random and independent.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:06.030
But they, for example, get them
mostly by calling landlines.

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:09.090
And so they get a bias
towards people who actually

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:11.621
answer the phone on a landline.

00:48:11.621 --> 00:48:13.620
How many of you have a
land line where you live?

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.950
Not many, right?

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:20.470
Mostly you rely on
your cell phones.

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:24.070
And so any survey that
depends on landlines

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:27.090
is going to leave a lot
of the population out.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:30.280
They'll get a lot of
people of my vintage,

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.220
not of your vintage.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.820
And that gets you in trouble.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:42.200
So the moral here
is always understand

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:48.110
how the data was collected, what
the assumptions in the analysis

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:53.700
were, and whether
they're satisfied.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.000
If these things
are not true, you

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.690
need to be very
wary of the results.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.100
All right, I think
I'll stop here.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:07.130
We'll finish up our
panoply of statistical sins

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.340
on Wednesday, in the first half.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:11.210
Then we'll do a course wrap-up.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:14.450
Then I'll wish you all
godspeed and a good final.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.570
See you Wednesday.
