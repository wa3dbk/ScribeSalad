00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.860
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.160
GUOLONG: Good morning, students.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.550
STUDENTS: Good morning, Mr. Su.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.196
GUOLONG: Can anyone tell
me the answer, please?

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:39.453
STUDENTS: I can!

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:40.661
GUOLONG: Is everything clear?

00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:44.112
STUDENTS: Yes, perfectly clear.

00:00:44.112 --> 00:00:46.577
GUOLONG: Are there
any other questions?

00:00:46.577 --> 00:00:49.540
STUDENTS: No, no questions.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.540
GUOLONG: I will
see you on Tuesday.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.540
STUDENTS: Thank you.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.410
NARRATOR: Wait a minute.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.060
That's not what
happens in real life.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.099
Actual MIT undergraduates
often come to class

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.710
on three hours of sleep.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.830
GUOLONG: Can anyone tell
me the answer, please?

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.960
NARRATOR: Sometimes
they're afraid to volunteer

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.530
what might be the wrong answer.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.930
GUOLONG: [INAUDIBLE] lecture by
considering a simple example.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.870
NARRATOR: They're not
always paying attention.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.007
STUDENT: What?

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:23.840
NARRATOR: And they might
not understand what

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.480
you thought you explained well.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.860
GUOLONG: Is everything clear?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.620
STUDENTS: Not really.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.590
NARRATOR: So how can you
be a successful TA at MIT?

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130
Try thinking of your
class as a popular website

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.200
that visitors come back
to again and again.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.390
What makes a website
user-friendly?

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.440
CAROL: User-friendly to
me means that in order

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.070
to complete the task at
hand, the website is designed

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.500
in a way that's logical.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.930
CHANDLER: Yeah.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.060
I feel like format, just
a clean, simple format

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.260
is really nice.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.330
ADRIAN: It's not
cluttered and messy.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.530
BILLY: The most important things
for a user-friendly website

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.920
is a clear interface, simple
categories, and a search

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.990
option.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.539
ADRIAN: And accessible language.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.830
CHANDLER: So being able to
find things very efficiently

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.230
and quickly is definitely
pretty important.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.560
ADRIAN: I think it's
more user-friendly when

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.580
you can actually understand
what they want you to do

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.480
and where things are.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.150
CAROL: Being able to
find the right things

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.850
in a way that's easy.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.980
NARRATOR: In other words,
a user-friendly website.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.130
GUOLONG: Should be the
designed with a thinking that

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.380
to make the user feel
happy and easy, instead

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.732
of making the computer engineers
to feel happy and easy.

00:02:40.732 --> 00:02:42.780
NARRATOR: What if the
engineer is a teacher

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.220
and the user a student?

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.430
ADRIAN: The main
principle of accessibility

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.347
should be the same.

00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:51.180
CHANDLER: A website
should be simple, clean,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.210
and also, like,
should have where

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.310
you want to go right away.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.139
And a teacher should be able to
judge where the students need,

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.180
what the students need to
where the students want

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.760
to go and adapt in that way.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.980
BILLY: I guess like the Search
button would be asking the TA

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.690
or asking the professor
for more information.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.720
ADRIAN: It's not
necessarily that everyone

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.220
is going to be your friend.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.130
But it's more about
being easy to understand.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.251
BILLY: In terms of having
a clear interface, just

00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:21.000
a simple structure of
the class, something

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.290
that students can expect, like
the lectures go the same way,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.040
the recitation go the
same way, and something

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.780
that students can expect.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.270
NARRATOR: So organization
and predictability

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.950
are key to the
user-friendly class.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.150
CAROL: Planning that way
in a logical session, where

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
you, like, review things
that are necessary

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.570
and then going into
problem, practice problems,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.259
and then going over what
were the right answers,

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.800
I thought that was, like, pretty
user-friendly for a student.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.090
Because it was a good review
and then good practice.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.470
So it was, like, logical.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.780
TA: For today's recitation,
we're going to do--

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.190
NARRATOR: The TA acts as
a guide for the students.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.510
BILLY: It's important to, well,
explain the learning objectives

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.672
of the class early on.

00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:08.630
CHANDLER: Have just,
like, an air of confidence

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.900
and be able to direct
the recitation.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.680
BILLY: A very big expectation
in a recitation is for the TA

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.690
to provide us with the big
picture of the concepts.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.779
NARRATOR: The TA is
approachable and supportive.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.190
ADRIAN: You need to feel that
you can approach them and ask

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.570
questions without any problem.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.430
NARRATOR: And knowledgeable.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.840
CAROL: The most
important thing for a TA

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.060
is that they have to have a very
solid understanding of what's

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.910
going on in the material.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.790
NARRATOR: But is
knowledge enough?

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.780
BILLY: Unfortunately,
it's not enough to simply

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.257
be knowledgeable
about the subject.

00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:46.590
It's the way you present it,
the way you communicate it.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.790
CHANDLER: They're
all very smart.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.790
I know they all know what
they're talking about.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.270
So it's just how they can
communicate that to us.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.200
NARRATOR: So what is
good communication

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.994
in the user-friendly classroom?

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:58.160
CHANDLER: The biggest thing
that came across my mind

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.920
was definitely, like, how
they answered questions

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.550
and the feedback
they got the students

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.890
and how they responded to that.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.950
ADRIAN: It's not the same
when they read a paper,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.020
and they just write the
problem in the board

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.190
and solve the problem
than explaining,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.650
why is it going like this?

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.350
Or why is it working like this?

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.760
CAROL: I think just a
willingness to clarify

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.020
is very, very important.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.050
BILLY: Being patient and
being able to explain

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.577
the same concept
in different ways.

00:05:23.577 --> 00:05:25.535
ADRIAN: And they can
actually explain it to you

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:29.090
at a basic undergrad level.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.150
NARRATOR: In the next videos, we
will learn communication skills

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.350
and strategies to meet
students' expectations

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.250
and create a
user-friendly classroom.
