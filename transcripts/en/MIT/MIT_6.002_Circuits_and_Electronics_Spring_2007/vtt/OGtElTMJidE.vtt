00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
-- will try it again at the end
of this lecture and you show you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that stuff hopefully next time.
For today we are going to start

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with nonlinear analysis.
Before we do that I wanted to

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
do a little bit of review.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I wanted to give you the past
three weeks in perspective and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
show you how all of these things
fit into the grand scheme of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
things.
We began by building a great

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
little playground,
and within that playground we

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
said that by enforcing upon
ourselves the lumped matter

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
discipline we created the lumped
circuit abstraction.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So within that playfield we
assumed that we had dq by dt and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
d phi by dt to be 0 so that gave
us as the lumped circuit

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
abstraction.
And within that lumped circuit

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
abstraction, within this
playground we looked at several

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
methods of analyzing circuits,
including the KVL,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
KCL method.
We also learned the method

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
involving composing resistors,
the voltage dividers and so on

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and solving circuits
intuitively.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And we also looked at the node
method, which is kind of the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
workhorse of the circuits
industry.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So when in doubt apply the node
method and it will get you where

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
you want to go.
Now, we also said that this is

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
good, here is our playground.
We said hey,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
if we focus on those circuits
that are linear we come to the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
left part of our playground.
And we said that for linear

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
circuits in this part of the
playground we can further use a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
couple of techniques,
a few techniques,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
superposition,
Thevenin, Norton and so on.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So these techniques allow you
to very quickly analyze

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
complicated circuits,
especially when you're looking

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to find a single current,
or voltage or some parameter of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
interest.
Whenever you see,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
if you see a circuit containing
multiple voltage sources or two

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
or more voltage sources or
current sources,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
as a first step think
superposition.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And so these are very powerful
techniques that let you analyze

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
very complicated circuits very
effectively.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
After we did this we said,
oh, let me draw another

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
playground here.
This is another piece of our

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
playground.
And if these are linear circuit

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
then this half of the playground
is nonlinear circuits.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And we said that if you further
focus on discretized values,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
if you discretized values and
focused only on circuits that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
dealt with binary signals,
highs and lows,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
then we came into this small
regime of the playground.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And notice that digital
circuits are,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
by their very nature,
nonlinear.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Remember the circuit,
A, B, this was one of our NOR

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
gate circuits?
And if you look at transfer

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
functions, that is if I plot,
let's say for example,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
for some combination of input
values.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Let's say I plot v in verses v
out.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Let's say, for example,
I turned this guy off by

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
setting B to 0 and then I simply
apply a low to high transition

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
at v in, then what I would see
at the output is a transfer

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
function of the following sort
where as v in changes the output

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
switches at some point and then
stays at a low value.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So when v in is low v out is
high and v in and high v out is

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
low.
So that's kind of the v out

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
versus v in when B is set at 0.
So notice that this is a

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
nonlinear curve.
This is not a straight line.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It's a nonlinear curve.
And so therefore in the digital

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
domain we see highly nonlinear
functions that look like this

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and so on.
However, take a look at this

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
circuit.
Suppose I focus on the circuit

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
for a given set of switch
settings.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Let's say, for example,
I focus on the circuit when A

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and B are both 1s.
For a given set of switch

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
settings, notice that I'm going
to be either in this region or

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
in this region.
Notice that this region is a

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
straight line.
So if I focus on let's say both

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
A and B at once then I get
something like this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And in this situation,
for a given set of switch

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
settings, notice that my digital
circuit now can be analyzed

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
using linear techniques.
So therefore my digital gets

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
moved into the linear domain for
a given set of switch settings.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So if I fix my switch settings
and look at the circuit then

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
each circuit,
for a given set of switch

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
settings, is comprised of
voltage sources and some

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
resistors and it's a linear
circuit.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Again, I can go back and apply
all my linear techniques to

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
virtually all the digital
circuits that you will be

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
dealing with in 6.002.
Again, remember if I fix my

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
switch settings,
if I fix the inputs then the

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
output can be determined using
linear techniques.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Because the digital circuits
we're showing you in 6.002

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
simply comprise linear elements
like voltage sources and

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
resistors and so on.
You'll see some more later.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But you can apply your linear
techniques and analyze them.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
The cool thing here is that
with just two weeks of stuff

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that you've learned in 6.002,
you are well on our way to

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
being able to analyze certain
classes of digital circuits for

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
a given set of switch settings
and many, many,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
many linear circuits.
What we will do today is focus

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
on nonlinear circuits.
So we look at this space.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Notice again that up until now
we've dealt with these three

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
methods, which apply to all
circuits within this playground,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the lumped circuit playground.
And the subset of that is the

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
linear domain.
And we can analyze linear

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
circuits in this way.
And digital circuits,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
for a given set of switch
settings, also fall within this

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
category.
So notice that you can go ahead

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and analyze the digital circuits
using superposition or other

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
techniques like that.
The next big step for us is to

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
begin our analysis of nonlinear
circuits today.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
The important thing to remember
is that nonlinear circuits are

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
also within this big playground
in which we are going under the

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
lumped matter discipline.
So nonlinear circuits are also

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
lumped circuits.
And therefore because we are in

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that playground we can use any
one of our techniques,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
KVL, KCL or the node method to
analyze nonlinear circuits.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So if you see a nonlinear
circuit, don't get daunted.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Just remember this is meant to
be simple stuff.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So let me simply write down the
node equation and analyze it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
There is really nothing new in
today's lecture.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I'm just going to show you a
nonlinear circuit and analyzing

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
using techniques that you
already know.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Today nonlinear circuits.
And we look at several methods

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
of analyzing nonlinear circuits.
We look at the "Analytic

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Method".
We look at a "Graphical

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Method".
You will look at a "Piecewise

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Linear Method" in the book.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I won't be covering this in
lecture.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
You can read Section 4.4 for
the piecewise linear method.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
In this method you take your
curves and you approximate them

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
with a bunch of straight line
segments, kind of like the v

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
out, v in curve I've shown you
there, and analyze the circuit

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
using linear techniques within
any given straight line segment.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We will also do incremental
analysis.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
This is also called small
signal analysis.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So I will cover these two
today, I will introduce this one

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
today, and wrap that up during
the next lecture.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Let's start with a simple
example.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So I have some voltage,
V, some voltage source V.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And I have some resistor,
R.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And I have a fictitious device
here that I labeled D.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Let's call this fictitious
device the "Expo Dweeb".

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I purposely chose a funky name
because this is a fictitious

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
device.
Let's call it the Expo Dweeb.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And let me write down the
associated variables for this

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
device as follows.
iD is the current flowing into

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
this terminal and vD is the
voltage across this device.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
So this is a nonlinear device.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And this device is
characterized by the following

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
equation.
Much like resistors were

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
characterized by an iV relation,
V is equal to iR,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
or i is equal to V/R.
This device is also

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
characterized by the following
element relationship.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It's a e raised to bvD.
So there is an exponentiation

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
here.
Again, this is a fictitious

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
device.
And I'll show some funky things

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
that it does in a second.
It's a very simple relation.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It's an exponential relation
where the current relates to the

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.000
exponentiated value of the
voltage vD across the element.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So I can plot iD versus vD for
this element as follows.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Notice that when vD is 0 iD is
a, so I have a here,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and it looks like this.
It's a funny device,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
a fictitious device.
So when vD is 0,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I have some current flowing the
device, and as vD increases I

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:57.000
get an exponential increase in
the current through that device.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
This device is funny in the
sense that it is not a passive

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
device in that notice that when
vD and iD are positive the

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
product is positive,
which is fine,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
which says that it is consuming
power.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
On the other hand,
on the left-hand side notice

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
that the vI relation is
negative, which means that when

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I put a negative voltage on it,
it can still sustain a positive

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
current.
This must imply that the device

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
is producing power.
But for the purpose of a

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
nonlinear analysis we don't have
to worry about that.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Let's just do it mathematically
and find out what it looks like.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So back to this again.
I have a voltage source,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
a resistor and my Expo Dweeb
connected in that manner.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Now, again, reflect on this
pattern.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
A voltage source or a current
source, a resistor and some

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
device.
This is a very standard pattern

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
you will see again and again and
again.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
In particular,
if you look at this device,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
it's a nonlinear device here.
And facing the nonlinear device

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is a voltage source in series
with a resistor.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And the reason I say that this
is an incredibly important

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
pairing is the following.
Notice that if on the left-hand

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
side I had any linear circuit
and I had a single nonlinear

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
element in that circuit.
Notice that by a Thevenin

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
reduction that you've learned
you can take this entire mess.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
If all you care about is the
behavior of the nonlinear

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
device, for the purpose of
analyzing this nonlinear device,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
you can take this entire linear
circuit, no matter how

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
complicated it is,
voltage sources,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
current sources,
resistors and a bunch of other

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
funky stuff, you can boil all of
that down to a Thevenin

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
equivalent, a voltage and a
resistor in series.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
So we can trick you.
We can give you a complicated

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
circuit and say ah-ha,
tell me what the current is

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
through this device if I apply
some voltage,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
3 volts there.
What you can do is you can say

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
ah-ha, I don't care what happens
here so I'm just going to

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
replace the whole thing with a
Thevenin equivalent.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And you've done your homework
now and you can calculate

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Thevenin equivalents for
circuits.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And simply replace this and
then go ahead and solve the

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
circuit.
Again, remember we are

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
engineers.
We are looking for answers.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
We are looking to build
interesting systems.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And, in general,
we like to take the simplest

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
path possible to the solution.
So simplify your lives and

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
create a simple Thevenin coupled
to a nonlinear device and then

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
you will be rolling.
When we talk about a variety of

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
other circuits,
nonlinear circuits,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
time-varying circuits and so on
in the rest of this course,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
we will look at this pattern
again and again and again and

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
again until we are blue in the
face.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And, just remember,
the reason we keep looking at

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
this pattern is that whenever
you have some big linear mess

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
connected to some interesting
device what you can do is if all

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
you care about is analyzing the
behavior of that device,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
you can take this linear mess
and simply figure out the

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Thevenin equivalent,
or the Norton equivalent if you

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
like and replace this whole
thing with its equivalent and

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
then go ahead and analyze it.
So boil an arbitrarily circuit

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
down to a very simple pattern of
this sort.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
What this means is because of
this brilliant Thevenin

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
simplification,
going forward through the rest

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
of this course we will mostly
deal with very simple circuits

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
like this, voltage source,
resistor and the device.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
That's it.
Very, very, very rarely will

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
you see multiple sources and
lots of resistors in a circuit.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
It's usually going to be simple
stuff.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And remember how we got here,
by making a Thevenin

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
simplification of a linear mess.
All right.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
If in homeworks or quizzes or
in real life,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
or in many examples of real
life, if you find that you have

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
to deal with a lot of grunge and
a lot of mess,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
step back and think a little
bit.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Try to use intuition and see if
you can simplify things using

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
some clever trick or method.
Method 1 of analysis.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Let's go ahead and analyze this
pattern here,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
this template circuit,
if you will,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
a voltage source a resistor and
a nonlinear device.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
This is the analytical method.
And remember the node method

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
applies, so let me go ahead and
apply the node method.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
To apply the node method,
what do I do?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I first have to select a ground
node.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Let me insulate this as my
ground node.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Let me label all the nodes with
their voltages.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So this node has voltage V and
this node has label the capital

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
D.
So let me go ahead and analyze

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
this using the node method.
So the node method says for

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
each of the nodes in the circuit
whose voltage is not known go

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
ahead and write down KCL
implicitly applying the element

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
relationships to replace the
current values with the voltage

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
values.
Let's start with the current

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
going in that direction.
Current going from the vD node

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
through resistor R,
which looks as follows,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
vD - V divided by R.
That's a current going that

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
way.
And the current going down is

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
iD.
In general, when I apply the

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
node method, I don't write iD
here but I go ahead and write

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
the element relation ae to the
bvD here.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Then I get an equation in vD
and I just solve the mode

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
voltage.
However, just to make a couple

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
of extra points later,
let me go ahead and do that in

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
two steps, write down this and
then go ahead and write down iD

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
separately as ae to the bvD.
Again, remember,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
don't get confused here.
In a node method,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I don't write down a second
step.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I directly write down ae to bvD
in place of iD.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I get one equation in vD,
I go solve it.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Just for fun today,
I'm taking two steps here,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
writing iD and explicitly
putting down iD as ae to the

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
bvD.
Now, that's it.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I mean this is all there is to
it.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
You guys can now go ahead and
analyze nonlinear circuits.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
You get a bunch of equations,
a bunch of unknowns,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
go solve.
I have two equations here.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
vD and iD are my unknowns and I
can just go ahead and solve for

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
them.
Now, in general with nonlinear

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
circuits, often times it's hard
to get a closed form solution so

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
you may have to use a bunch of
methods.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
You can try a closed form
solution or you can try

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
numerical solutions or you can
do trial and error.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
In this case,
I'll just go ahead and tell

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
you.
Suppose I choose V as 1 volt,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:36.000
R is 1 ohm and b is 1 over volt
and a is º amps for those

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.000
values, approximately vD is
roughly 0.5 volts and iD is

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000
roughly 0.4 volts.
You can do this by using trial

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000
and error or other methods.
In 6.002 we don't dwell on

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
working too hard to solve
equations of this sort.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
If you cannot substitute this
in here and solve it directly,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
we don't ask you to go and
learn numerical method and the

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
techniques and so on to solve
it.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
But just remember that you can
use trial and error or you can

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
use back substitution and other
techniques that you will learn

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
in future numerical methods
classes and apply it here.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
But suffice it to say that,
for here we can stick with

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
trial and error if you like.
And for these values,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
vD and iD are 0.5 and
approximately 0.4.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
You're done.
It's really that simple.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Good catch.
I know there is one person

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
that's not sleeping here.
Good.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
So, as I said,
there's not a whole lot to it.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Whether it's a nonlinear
circuit or a linear circuit and

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
as long as I am inside this
playground here where the lumped

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
circuit abstraction holds,
I can apply my node equations

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
and then go ahead and solve it.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Let me show you a few more
methods so we can articulate

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000
your repertoire of tools for
nonlinear circuits.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And I'd like to show you a
graphical technique.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
I personally rarely use a
graphical technique to solve

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
circuits.
And why am I sharing this with

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
you?
It turns out that often times

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
by looking at things graphically
you can get some better insights

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
into circuit behavior.
You can also show cool demos

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
when you show graphs of
responses kind of playing with

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
each other and so on.
So this is fun for getting

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
intuition and things like that.
Graphically all I'm really

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
going to do is solve those two
equations graphically.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
So I'm going to plot equation
one.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Let me rewrite equation one as
follows.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
iD is --

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
I'm just rewriting equation one
as follows.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:40.000
V/R - vD/R.
And I can also draw the second

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
guy --

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:04.000
OK, I can do this as well.
I can do an iD versus vD plot.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And in this particular
situation, you've seen this

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
already, that's my iD versus vD
curve right there.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And I can do the same for this
one here.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
So this equation establishes
the following straight line

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
relationship.
It says that when vD is 0,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
iD is V/R.
So that's here.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
And similarly when iD is 0 then
vD is equal to V so I get

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
something here.
So that's my straight line

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
relationship corresponding to
this equation here.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
So what I can do is I can
simply solve these by

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
superimposing the two curves on
the same vD, iD template here

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
and finding the intersection of
the curves.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
So I can take this curve
corresponding to two and I can

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000
take this curve corresponding to
one, and this is V/R and this is

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
V, 0, and I can find the
intersection point.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
This curve here,
for reasons that will be

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:33.000
obvious about three weeks from
now, is called the load line.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
It's called the load line.
You will understand why that is

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
so in a later lecture.
So I've given you a template on

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Page 6 to boil these two down
into one equation.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
So there, again,
you can substitute the values

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
for V is 1 volt and R is 1 and
so on and so forth and get the

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
same kind of result as you did
previously.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
So there is really nothing new
here.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
All I've done in the second
method is combined the two

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
equations graphically and found
the solution by looking at where

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
the two curves intersect.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
At the start of the lecture I
also told you that you may want

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
to go and check out the
piecewise linear technique --

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
-- in Section 4.4 of the course
notes.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
All right.
For today let me do a third

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
method called "Incremental
Analysis".

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
This technique is also called
the small signal method.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
I'm going to show you,
before I go into the method,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
in today's lecture what I'll do
is I'll give you a motivating

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
example for why we need the
small signal approach.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
I'll give you a motivating
example and show you a little

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
demo.
And then I will close with

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
showing you a problem with
applying a standard approach,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
and I'll ask you to see if you
can figure out a way to handle

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
it in time for next lecture.
So let me give you the

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
motivation here.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
So here is what I want to do.
Many of you have seen one of

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
those electric eye garage door
openers, right?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
You have a receiver at one end
and you have some kind of a

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
light beam at the other,
and when you walk through it

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
stops, or rather it cuts the
circuit and stops the door from

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
closing.
And when no one is going

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
through it maintains a
connection and lets the door

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
close.
So what we did is we went to

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Home Depot, or one of those
stores, and bought a very

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
standard device that essentially
produces some response when

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
light impinges on it.
And my goal will be to see if I

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
can send music over the light
beam using a simple garage door

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
opener device.
So here is the little circuit

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
that I will do.
We actually went there and

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
built this.
I will also show you a demo.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Here is my time-varying
voltage, vI(t),

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
and this is some music signal.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
And get some music signal.
And I want to connect this to

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
this device, which is a device
found in garage door openers.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I am going to call it a LED.
If you like,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
you can view it as,
this is very similar to our

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Expo Dweeb.
This is called a "Light

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Emitting Expo Dweeb".
That's why it is LED.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
So what the LED does is,
as I apply this voltage across

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
it, that same voltage appears
across the Light Emitting Expo

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Dweeb.
And there is some current that

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
flows through the device.
And for our analysis we will

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
assume that this device
virtually has an identical iD

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
characteristic to the Expo Dweeb
just that it emits light.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
So when I pass a current
through it, it emits light.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And the light intensity is
proportional to the current that

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
flows through.
So it emits light and light

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
intensity, LD,
is proportional to iD.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Here is my little light
emitting device,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
which when current flows
through it, itproduces light

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
because its intensity is
proportional to the current.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
And what I will do is I will
stick in the receiver here.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Think of it as a photo resistor
or some other device where I am

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
going to connect that in a
circuit.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
I am not going to spend too
much time on this side.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
I'm going to focus on the
left-hand side here.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And let's say I have some kind
of amplifier and speakers and so

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
on and so forth.
Suffice it to say that when the

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000
light falls on this device PR
that iR that goes through here

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
is proportional to the received
light intensity.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
So if the current is
proportional to the received

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
light intensity then I amplify
that signal in my amplifier and

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
I get the music playing out
here.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And notice that the following
chain of dependences apply.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
So I have an input music signal
VI.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
That gets converted to some iD.
These are all time-varying

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000
signals, so VI is a time-varying
signal and so is iD.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000
And iD gets converted to light
of some intensity LD.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:26.000
This in turn gets attenuated
somewhat and is received at the

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
photo resistor.
And I get some intensity LR

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
impinging on that device there.
And that in turn produces a

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
current iR and then iR is
amplified and goes through a

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
speaker and so on and produces
sound.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Notice that using this chain
I've taken a music signal here

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
and I am playing it here.
And just imagine that this is

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
your garage door opener device
here where the light emitted is

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
being articulated by the voltage
signal VI.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
And received here.
So notice that if I cut this,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
if I stick something in here
and block it then I get no

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
response here,
but if I take my hand away then

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
I do get some response.
But this is fine.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
This should work.
You could try this at home if

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
you'd like.
If you have a garage door

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
opener, just stick a little
circuit like this and it should

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
simply work.
We have a problem,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
though.
The problem is that,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
as I said, I'm using the Expo
Dweeb here, the light emitting

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Expo Dweeb, and its
characteristics are as follows.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
iD is exponentially related to
the voltage vD,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
so this is nonlinear.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
And that's a real problem.
Because this is nonlinear,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
I am going to get a distorted
output.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Let me show you a little wave
form, a little graph to show you

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
how the distortion happens and
then show you a little demo

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
showing you the distortion.
Let me graphically show you the

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
kind of distortion that is
happening here,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
and I will do it by drawing the
following graph.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
So this is the vD,
iD curve for our device.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
And what I'm going to plot for
you is if I have a time-varying

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000
vD voltage, I just want to see
what the time-varying iD current

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
looks like.
And a trick to plot that is to

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
take your input voltage like so.
And let's say I apply a

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
sinusoid.
So I am just taking a

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
time-varying sinusoidal voltage
and rotating the plot 90 degrees

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
like so, so I can see where
these points correspond to on

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
that curve.
So what this says is that at

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
some point here,
for example,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
where vI, at this point and
time, vI is here.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Notice vI and vD are the same
thing because vI is applied

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
across vD.
vI directly applies across the

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
device, and so vI equals vD at
all time.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
So this voltage here
corresponds to this voltage,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
it corresponds to this current
and then I can find out what the

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
current is for that voltage.
By using the same artifice I

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
can plot the output current iD
like so.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
So for this value I get some
current here.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And so at time T0 I start here.
And notice that as this signal

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
moves up here,
I can find out the

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
corresponding values of iD by
looking at where a straight line

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
intersects here and plotting the
values here.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
I have a nice little graphical
animation to show you this.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Hopefully, the laptop will work
tomorrow and we can check that.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
I am doing nothing new here.
Just showing you a trick to be

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
able to plot vI versus v out
relationships,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
or vI or versus other
relationships based on some kind

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
of a transfer function.
So what you end up getting is

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
something that looks like this.
Why is that?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Notice that this curve here
corresponds to the signal.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
As this signal moves from here
to here, this point moves from

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
here to here and that
corresponds to this iD.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
When this moves from here to
here that corresponds to a point

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
moving from this part of the
curve to here,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
and that looks like so.
And then for the whole negative

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
incursion, notice that the whole
negative incursion moves here,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
so for that entire negative
incursion I get an output that

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
looks like this.
Notice that this device has

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
completely cut off and hammered
negative going signals.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
What it's done is that rather
than giving me a nice little

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
negative spike incursion here,
or excursion here,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
what this is doing is that it
is taking this excursion and

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
simply slamming it down to this
value here.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
And then again,
when I go back up,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
I get this peak here.
So notice that what was a nice

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
little sinusoid out there gets
hammered and squished into this

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
funny curve here.
What this device is doing is

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
for positive values it tends to
produce exponentially greater

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
current so I get boom,
high-rising peaks corresponding

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
to these two,
and for negative going voltages

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
it simply compresses them to a
low positive value here.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And that's what I see here
corresponding to negative

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
excursion.
So notice that what this will

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
do, if I view sound,
if I input sound here,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
and sound has negative going
excursions it will simply

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
scrunch them.
But more or less let the

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
positive things through.
And that is going to give rise

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
to a bunch of distortion in my
signal.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
So I would like to show you a
little demo.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Actually, we've gone ahead and
built a little device like this.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
We have an honest to goodness
little device costing,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
I don't know,
50 cents or $1 or something,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
which is a little voltage,
it's a device that emits light

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
proportional to the current
flowing through it.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
I have a receiver.
And I am going to play some

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
music, and you will listen to
the output here.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And hopefully you should see a
bunch of distortion because of

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
that effect that I showed you.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And what I will do is,
before we do that,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
you will see two curves up
there.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
The yellow, I believe is the
vI, is the input,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
and the green,
I believe, is a signal

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
proportionate to --
The other way around.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Oh, I see.
So green is the input.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
So green, the lower one is the
input and the upper one is the

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
distorted output.
So we are going to play some

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
sound through it,
music through it and you can

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
listen, through a little CD
player.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
So a couple of things.
The good news is that it works.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
However, I doubt that music
artists will come to my studio

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
to record if this is the quality
of what I produce.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Do notice that there are hardly
any negative going excursions in

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
that curve up there,
right?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
All the negative ones have been
like scrunched up down into a

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
flat line there,
and that's the reason I get

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
this distortion.
And just to prove to you that I

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
am indeed using a garage door
opener device and not faking it

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
here, I am going to just shut
the signal off by stopping the

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
light using a piece of paper
here.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
So notice that this device here
is the little device that has a

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
light beam going through the
center, and I am going to take

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
this piece of paper,
can you turn it up?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
So let's have some fun with
this.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
If I were to put this piece of
paper halfway down,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I should get half the
intensity, right.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
So my sound should diminish in
volume a little bit.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Maybe that will work.
Let's see if it works.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Nothing to do with 002 but it's
just fun.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Louder.
You can make it loud.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Too much coffee.
My hand is shaking.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
I guess you did see the
lowering of volume,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
right?

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
OK.
Just way too much coffee,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
and so my hand was shaking too
fast imposing its own sine wave

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
on top of the signal.
What did I show you?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
This was garbage,
right?

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
We had a nice little signal
input, and the output was

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
completely distorted because I
was playing sound over this and

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
this is what happened.
Switch to Page 9.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Now, this is what I would have
liked to have happened.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
On Page 9 what I would have
liked to see happen is this.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Suppose I had a light emitting
device that looked linear,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000
a straight line where the
current was linearly related to

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
vD.
Then what I would see,

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
if I had a sinusoid here then I
would get a sinusoid here.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
No distortion there,
right?

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
If only things were like I
wanted them, if I had a linear

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
device, but I don't have a
linear device.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
I have an Expo Dweeb.
Now you know why I call it a

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
dweeb.
Well, I'd like a linear device

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
and it's exponential.
But this is what I would like.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
And if I had this I wouldn't
show it to you today.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
If I had this my music would go
through without any distortion

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
and I wouldn't have to run
cables through my attic.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
I could just use my garage door
opener to play signals from my

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
bedroom and living room and so
on, right?

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
So the key thing here is how do
I get this?

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
And what I would like you to do
is think about it yourselves.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
What I am given is something
like this.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
This about it yourselves,
you know, what would you do?

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
See if you can come to me
before lecture tomorrow or

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Thursday and tell me the answer,
OK?
