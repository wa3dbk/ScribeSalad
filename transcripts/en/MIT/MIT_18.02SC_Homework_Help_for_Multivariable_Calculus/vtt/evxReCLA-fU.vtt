CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.760
In this video, what I'd like us
to do is answer some questions

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.480
I've posed here in a
really long problem.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.880
So let me take us through it.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.750
So we're going to consider
a position vector that's

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.130
described by x of t, y of t, 0.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.010
I want to have it
in three-space so I

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.920
can take a cross product later.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.290
And then we're going to
suppose that it actually

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.840
has constant length.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.930
And that when I look at the
acceleration vector at t,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.730
it's actually equal to
a constant times r of t,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.740
where the constant is not 0.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.240
OK?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.220
So I can, these
are the two things

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.860
I know about this
position vector.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.080
It has constant length.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.900
For all t, it has
constant length.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.720
And the acceleration is always
equal to some constant times

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.890
the position.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.570
OK, that's what I'm giving you.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.240
And now I want you to use
those things and vector

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.360
differentiation to show
that r dot v is equal to 0,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090
where v is the velocity.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.090
And then to show that
r cross v is constant.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.132
So you're going to have to
figure out-- essentially,

00:01:14.132 --> 00:01:15.590
the thing you have
to figure out is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.860
what relationship do you
want to differentiate

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.490
to show these two things.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.550
OK?

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.370
That's the hard part
of this problem.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.290
And then, I went
to see if you can

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.890
give an example of such an r.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.570
So if you can give an
example of a position vector

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.130
that has these properties.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.430
And maybe if you're
having a hard time,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.690
the first thing for you to do
might be to think about this,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.040
and to see if you can figure
out an example of that,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.520
and then see kind of how things
work together in that example.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.240
That may actually
proved helpful.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.090
So why don't you work on this
problem, pause the video,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.880
and then when you're feeling
good about your answer,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.550
you can bring the video back up
and I'll show you how I do it.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.640
OK, welcome back.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.740
So there was a lot to
do in this problem,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.100
but let me just remind
you what the framework is.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.410
We have a position vector, and
we know two things about it.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.990
We know that it
has constant length

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.090
and we know that the
acceleration is always

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.987
equal to some constant
times the position.

00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:19.570
I didn't give you
the constant, but we

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.320
know it's always equal to some
constant times the position.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.840
And then we wanted to
show two things using

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.960
vector differentiation.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.670
We wanted to show
that r dot v was 0.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.317
And we wanted to show that
r cross v was constant.

00:02:33.317 --> 00:02:35.400
And then we want to talk
about what is an example.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.670
So let's start off and
see if we can figure out

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.270
how to show that r
dot v is equal to 0.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.040
And, you know, as you're
thinking about this problem,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.870
something that you
want to remember

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.857
as you're thinking
about this is, well,

00:02:47.857 --> 00:02:49.190
what are the things that I know?

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.340
I know that r dot r
is constant, so I'm

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.700
going to write that down.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.261
r dot r-- I'm not
going to say is

00:02:57.261 --> 00:02:59.636
equal to c, because that's a
different constant-- so I'll

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:02.200
just, let me just call it c_1.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.700
OK?

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.010
That's a different
constant than my c, maybe.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.480
OK, I know that r dot
r is some constant,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.110
and I want to show something
about r dot v. Right?

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.610
So if I'm looking
at this and I say,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.100
well, I know this thing here.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.490
So it's the only dot product
relationship that I have.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.286
Because right now, I know a
relationship between a and r,

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.660
and I know r has
constant length.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.542
Since that's all
I gave you, if I

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:28.000
want to look at a
dot product, this

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.124
is the relationship I know.

00:03:29.124 --> 00:03:30.620
The constant length thing.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.050
And so I know I somehow have
to use this one to figure out

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.235
something about r dot v.

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:35.735
OK.

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:38.510
Well, what's the point
that we should realize?

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.940
What is v?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.730
v is d/dt of r.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.730
So I could take the
derivative-- if I

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.840
could take the derivative
of just one of these things,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.070
then I would get
r dot v down here.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.610
Right?

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.300
If I took d/dt of
just one of these,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.680
I would get the r dot v.
And d/dt of this is 0.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.080
But I can't do that, right?

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.620
Because if I take d/dt
of this whole thing,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.052
I'm going to end up having
to differentiate this r once

00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:05.510
and leave this
alone, and I'm going

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.310
to have to differentiate
this r and leave this alone.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.770
But if you heard what
I was just saying,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.300
maybe you see that that's
actually still going to be OK.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.930
So let's look at what happens.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.490
I mean, this is all really
I have to work with,

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.489
so I'm going to explore.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.940
Let's look at what happens
when I take d/dt of r dot r.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.700
And I'm going to start
leaving off the hats here,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.920
because I'm going to
leave them off somewhere,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.150
so we'll just
leave them off now,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.787
and then I won't leave
some off and put some on.

00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:35.120
So from here on out, I'm just
going to write r, v, and a

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.181
without that hats,
but they're vectors.

00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:38.680
OK.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.740
So d/dt of r dot r, well,
I have to take d/dt of r,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.850
and then I dot that
with r, and then

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.220
I take r dotted with--
sorry-- d/dt of r.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.390
Right?

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.720
Well, what do I get here?
d/dt of r we said was v,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.390
so that's v dot r.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.350
And what do I get here?

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.680
This is r dot-- there's d/dt
of r again-- so I get r dot v.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.860
Now the great thing
about the dot product

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.330
is that if I switch
the order of these two,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.780
it's still the same thing.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.982
So I can just write
this as-- well, I'll

00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:19.190
switch the order of this one.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.340
So they both look like
r dot v plus r dot v,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.470
and that means I get
2 r dot v. Right?

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.840
So d/dt of r dot r
is actually 2 of r

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.210
dotted with v-- the position
dotted with the velocity.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.080
Now why is this
going to help me?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.310
Because what do I know
about this quantity r dot r?

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.010
I know it's constant, right?

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.390
So what is d/dt of a constant?

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.390
d/dt of a constant is 0.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.250
So I actually started off
with knowing this was 0.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.110
So if I go through
the whole chain,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.220
I see 0 is equal to-- let me
put the 0 down here again-- 0 is

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.960
equal to 2 r dot v, and so r
dot v I know is equal to 0.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.590
What does that
mean geometrically?

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.500
That means r and
v are orthogonal.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.320
And where is v going to sit?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.780
Well, if I come back over
to how I described r,

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.210
r is in the xy-plane, right?

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.690
The z-component is 0.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.800
So if I differentiate--
if I take

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.285
d/dt of r-- I'm going to
have the derivative of x

00:06:21.285 --> 00:06:22.420
as a function of t.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.370
And then whatever y
is as a function of t,

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.328
I take that derivative.

00:06:25.328 --> 00:06:26.710
And this is still 0.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.556
So v is going to
sit in the xy-plane,

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:30.930
and based on what
we know so far,

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.720
we know it's actually
orthogonal to r.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.556
So they make a 90-degree
angle at all times t.

00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:38.930
OK, and how did
we do that again?

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.400
I just want to
remind you, we knew

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.820
one dot product
relationship, that

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.500
was r dot r was a constant.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.420
So we differentiated that and
tried to see what happened.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.730
And the main point
at the end of it,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.570
was that when I had a v dot r, I
could rewrite it as an r dot v,

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.480
and so I just end up
with two of something

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.250
that I want to know about.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.870
So that's the main
idea of the first part.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.317
Now the second part was
I asked you to figure out

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:03.150
something over here.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.400
We wanted to know that
r cross v is constant.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.150
OK?

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.380
And t, it's always the same.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.880
All right?

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.210
So let's think about
if I want to show

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.920
that for every t
something is constant,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.040
I could show-- actually, I've
sort of seen it already--

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.950
I could show that
its derivative is 0.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.780
OK.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.835
So if r cross v is constant--
or if its derivative is 0,

00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:29.490
I should say-- then r
cross v was constant.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.050
Right?

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.100
If its derivative is 0 for all
t, then r cross v is constant.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.600
Right?

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.770
So that's really what
we want to exploit here.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.990
So let's look at the idea.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.490
So we want to-- again,
let me write it down--

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.174
show r cross v is constant.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.530
And the strategy
we're going to use

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:59.020
is to do this we're going to
show that d/dt of r cross v

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.901
is equal to 0.

00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:01.400
Right?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.240
If we can show that, then
this means that for all t

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.250
it's the same.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.091
It's not changing in t.

00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:07.590
Right?

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.670
So for all t, r cross v
is going to be the same,

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.520
so r cross v is
going to be constant.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.270
So the difference
between the two problems

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.150
was in the first problem
you didn't quite know maybe

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.367
what expression you needed
to differentiate to find

00:08:19.367 --> 00:08:20.450
what you were looking for.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.294
Here, we know what we
need to differentiate,

00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:23.960
but we have to make
sure we understand--

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.230
to show this is constant--
when we differentiate,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.160
we should get 0.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.660
OK?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.917
So that's sort of a slightly
different type of problem.

00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:33.000
And I'm asking you maybe
from the other side here.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.450
So let's now--
let's just see what

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.710
we get on the left-hand side.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.440
So what's d/dt of r cross v?

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.340
Well, d/dt of r is v, right?

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.510
So we get v cross v
for the first term.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.875
So take d/dt of r, we get
v. We leave this v alone,

00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:54.470
and then we add to that, r cross
d/dt of v-- what's d/dt of v?

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.520
That's a.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.230
Right?

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.240
Now, let's take a look at this.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.520
Well, v cross v, v is
pointing in the same direction

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.890
as itself.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.290
So when you try and take
a cross product of that,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.270
you know that the
length of your vector

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.400
should be the area of
the parallelogram formed

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.820
by these two vectors.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.360
But v is pointing in the
same direction as itself,

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.670
so there's no area there.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.100
That's a geometric
interpretation

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.160
of why this thing should be 0.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.670
Another reason is that
remember that your v cross

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.500
v is going to
include a sine theta

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.200
term, where theta is the angle
between the two vectors, right?

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.780
That's another formula you have.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.170
And so when you look at the
angle between this vector

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.260
and itself, it's 0.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.410
And sine 0 is 0.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.500
So this is, in fact,
0 in that part.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.662
So if this is 0, then
we get what we want.

00:09:41.662 --> 00:09:43.120
Well, I only gave
you one other bit

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.370
of information in the problem.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.550
And if you remember,
it was that a is always

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.600
equal to a constant times r.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.210
So I can rewrite
this right-hand side

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.230
as r cross a constant times r.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.034
And because of properties
of these cross products,

00:09:57.034 --> 00:09:58.200
I can pull out the constant.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.729
Or I can actually,
I guess I don't

00:10:00.729 --> 00:10:02.270
need to pull it out
to talk about it,

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.410
but it's nicer if I pull it out.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.680
And look at what I have here.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.716
I have the exact same
situation as v cross v. I mean,

00:10:08.716 --> 00:10:10.590
this is still pointing
in the same direction.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.880
Constant times r and r still
point in the same direction

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.750
as if I were to compare r and r.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.500
So I didn't have to
pull out the constant,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.220
but then right
here it's very easy

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.370
to see that this is also 0.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.120
So I had 0 plus
this, so I get 0.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.860
So, I've shown through
this process-- maybe

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.070
I should have written
equal signs here--

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.720
that d/dt of r cross v
is actually equal to 0.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.870
And so you see that this cross
product between r and v--

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.640
which we know are orthogonal
sitting in the xy plane--

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.100
that it's always the same,
it's always the same vector.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.232
And now I asked you
to give an example,

00:10:47.232 --> 00:10:48.690
and maybe you
thought of an example

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.930
first, and then thought
of how it worked.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:56.750
And so the easiest example is if
you let r of t equal cosine t,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.100
sine t.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:04.400
So the easiest example--
there are others, obviously--

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.480
is if you let r of t equal
cosine t, sine t comma 0.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.920
Sorry, I was thinking about
it in three-space, right?

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.100
And in fact, if I were to scale
this, it would still work.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.070
I could put any
constant in front.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.950
This carves out-- if I
let t go between 0 and 2

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.080
pi, or even minus
infinity to infinity,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.020
I'm just carving
out vectors that

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.790
are-- the position vector
is always on the unit

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.950
circle on this case.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.590
Right?

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.220
If I put a constant in front,
it's on another circle.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.580
So for whatever values of t
I'm letting myself vary over,

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.160
all the vectors are going to
lie on some part of a circle.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.790
OK?

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.600
And so this is maybe
the easy example.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.060
Maybe you want to
calculate, just

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.290
to give yourself some practice,
what v of t is and what a of t

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:50.870
actually is.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.710
What these two quantities
actually are, and then look

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.380
at what happens.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:59.245
What happens with r and v, and
see why r dot v is equal to 0.

00:11:59.245 --> 00:12:02.970
What you should see-- I'll try
and give you a picture of it

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:03.600
geometrically.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.730
What you should see
is that, you know,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.995
if this is-- we'll see
if I can effectively

00:12:10.995 --> 00:12:13.970
do a two-dimensional drawing
in three-space-- if this is

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.910
the r I'm looking at, that v
has to be coming in this way,

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.370
out this way.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.980
So there's r and there's v.
And this angle-- because I'm

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.070
trying to squash what
was a circle-- I guess

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.460
I'll look from above first.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.400
My picture, from
above, is looking

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.900
like something like this.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.140
There's r and there's v,
and that's a right angle.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:33.640
Right?

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.500
So if I look from-- coming
down on to the xy-plane,

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.450
here's a position vector,
here's its velocity,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.372
they're orthogonal.

00:12:41.372 --> 00:12:43.205
And as I move all the
way around the circle,

00:12:43.205 --> 00:12:44.930
that position vector
and the velocity

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.430
are going to keep
that relationship.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.810
When I look at this-- I'm trying
to insert in the z-axis here.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.570
When I look at this,
if I look at what

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.320
is the cross product
of these two vectors,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.714
well it's always going to
point in the z-direction.

00:12:56.714 --> 00:12:59.130
It's going to point straight
in the z-direction from here.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.060
Because it's orthogonal
to both of these,

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.740
it's going to point
straight in the z-direction.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.910
I know r is constant length.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.530
I can then see v
is constant length

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.750
from the example I have here.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.124
And as I rotate,
I'm going to get

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.850
that this is constant length.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.350
OK?

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:18.450
So this is where
the picture of what

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.050
we were actually describing
very much more generally

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.930
in the first part of this.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.950
So the main point that I want
us to see in this problem

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.590
is that when we want to find
information about relationships

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.055
between r, v, and a--
this position and velocity

00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:35.970
and acceleration--
what we can do

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.640
is differentiate
these vector fields.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.912
We saw an example when
you were looking at I

00:13:39.912 --> 00:13:44.070
think Kepler's second law
you saw this in lecture.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.960
But I just want to show
you that you can use this

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.010
if you don't necessarily
know explicitly

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.330
things about a position vector.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.340
You can still find out
things about its relationship

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.702
if you're given
some information.

00:13:57.702 --> 00:13:59.410
You don't actually
have to have a formula

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.910
to find out some information
about these relationships.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.000
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
