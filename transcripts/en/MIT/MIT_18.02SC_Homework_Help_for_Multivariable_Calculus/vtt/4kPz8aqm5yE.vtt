JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.177
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:10.760
In lecture, among
other things, you've

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.720
been learning about
computing components

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.390
of one vector in the
direction of another vector.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.020
So I have a
straightforward problem

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.090
about that for you here.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.730
So we've got two vectors.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.170
The vector 2i minus 2j plus k.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.029
And we've got the
vector i plus j plus k.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.570
And so what I'd like
you to do for me

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.030
is to compute the component
of this first vector

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.090
in the direction of
the second vector.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.630
So why don't you pause
the video, take some time

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.130
to work that out, come back,
and we can work on it together.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.320
Welcome back.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.610
So hopefully you had some
luck with this problem.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.290
Now this problem is
pretty straightforward.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.900
Really all you have
to do is remember what

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.360
the definition of component is.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.220
And after that,
it's smooth sailing.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.110
So in particular, the
component of one vector

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.087
in the direction of
another is the length

00:01:09.087 --> 00:01:11.545
of what you get when you project
this vector onto that one,

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:13.640
well, plus a sign, right?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.610
So if the projection is
in the same direction,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.110
then it's positive, or if it's
in the opposite direction,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.000
it's negative.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.490
So let me draw a picture
of what I mean by that.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:32.080
So if you have a vector v and
you have another vector w,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.160
then the projection
of v onto w is

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.160
what you get if you make a,
drop a perpendicular line there,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.060
and then it's just
this vector here.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.750
So that's the projection.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.930
And then the component is the
length of that projection.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.399
Again, with the
sign if necessary.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.940
And so we can see
since this is going

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.030
to be a right
triangle here, we can

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.470
see that this vector
has length that's

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.766
just given by the length of
v-- so the length-- rather,

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:19.910
the component of
v in direction w

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.110
is-- so it's just the
length of v, right-- that's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.020
the length of the hypotenuse--
times the cosine of the angle

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.460
between them, so it's
times cosine of theta.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.380
Now this length of v
times cosine theta,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.400
this should remind
you of something.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.750
This looks very much
like this formula we

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.400
had for the dot product, right?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.210
So another way of
writing this is

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.710
to say that this is
equal to v dot w--

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.930
so v dot w is the length
of v times the length of w

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.470
times the cosine of the angle.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.780
And so here we just
have the length of v

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.610
times the cosine of the angle.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.300
So we have to divide this
through by the length of s.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.660
So this is what
the component is,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.910
and this is the
simple formula for it,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.620
if you're given v and w
in some easy-to-use form.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.210
And indeed in this
problem, we're

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.840
given v and w just in their
nice coordinate forms.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.550
So we're given that
our vector v that we

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.920
want the component of
is 2i minus 2j plus k.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.660
And the direction w that we're
looking at is i plus j plus k.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.810
So in our case, we just have to
compute these expressions v dot

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.520
w and the length of w in order
to put them into this formula,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.680
and then we'll be done.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:47.087
So in our case, v dot w--
well, that's straightforward

00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:48.920
because we're given v
and w in coordinates--

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:58.710
so this is just 2 times 1 plus
minus 2 times 1 plus 1 times 1.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.460
So that's, OK, 2
minus 2 plus 1 is 1.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.590
And the length of
w-- well, you know,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.836
it's just your usual
length formula--

00:04:08.836 --> 00:04:13.470
is 1 squared plus 1 squared plus
1 squared, the whole thing is

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.260
square rooted, which is equal
to the square root of 3.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.179
So we've got v dot w and
we have the length of w,

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:24.720
and so then we just need to put
them right into this formula.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.719
That the component of
v in the direction of w

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:28.885
is given by this expression.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.840
So the component of-- I'm
not going to write it out

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.990
with i's, j's, and k's,
I'm going to write 2,

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:52.030
minus 2, 1-- in
direction [1, 1,  1]

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.140
is, well we just have to divide
the dot product by the length

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.520
of the direction vector.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.950
So that's 1 divided by
the square root of 3.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.141
So that's that, I'll end there.
