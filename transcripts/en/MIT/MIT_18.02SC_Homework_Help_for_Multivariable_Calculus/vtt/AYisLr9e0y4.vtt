00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.750
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.610
What I'd like us to do
in these two problems

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.160
is to understand how to compute
the flux in three dimensions--

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.590
the flux of a vector in three
dimensions-- across a surface,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.490
without maybe doing a
lot of calculations.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.240
So we're going to see
if we can figure out

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.930
how to do these problems without
doing a lot of computation.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.630
So the first one is to find
the flux of the vector k

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.060
through the infinite
cylinder x squared

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.430
plus y squared equals 1.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.050
So notice this doesn't depend on
z, but in fact, at every height

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.940
it is a unit circle.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.389
So it's an infinite cylinder.

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:45.680
And then the second problem
I'd like you to think about

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.620
and to try is to find
the flux of the vector j

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.050
through one square that has
side length 1 in the xz-plane.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.900
So you pick any square, in
the xz-plane, of side length 1

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.760
and find the flux of
j through that square.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.457
And so I think that
that's enough information.

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:03.290
So why don't you try
both of those problems,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.831
pause the video,
and then when you're

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:08.001
ready to see my explanation
of how they work,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.000
bring the video back up.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.170
OK, welcome back.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.640
Again, what we're
trying to do is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.720
to understand the flux of a
vector field across a surface.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.390
And we're hoping to
do it with the least

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.820
amount of calculation possible,
for these particular problems.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.510
So obviously it's
going to be helpful

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.750
if you can draw a picture,
to draw a picture.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.790
So I'm going to draw
the surface that

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.880
is the infinite cylinder
first and then I'm

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.690
going to look at
the vector field k.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.280
So let me draw my picture first.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.360
If these are my
coordinate axes, I

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.320
get-- I think you have
something usually like this.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.640
This is x, this is
y, and this is z.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.260
This is how you do
them in your class.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.497
And so it's not going
to be a great picture

00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:59.830
but I'm going to try and make
it look like a cylinder up

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.290
here coming down.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.050
So this is in fact going
to be infinitely long,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.490
going down forever, but I'll
stop at somewhere down here.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.320
And then so every slice in the
z, at a fixed height for z,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.980
is going to be a circle.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.000
I should think about these are
intersecting the x- and y- axes

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.350
at (1, 0) and (0, 1).

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.410
So there's actually a sort of
unit circle down here as well.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.282
Now that's the surface.

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:31.990
Now what does the
vector field look like?

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.650
Well, in general what does
the vector field look like?

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.290
k is just a constant
vector field

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.190
that points in this direction.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.920
This is k.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.670
So k at every point
on the surface

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.680
is just the vector
that's pointing straight

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.190
up in this direction.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.330
And the normal to the surface,
if you think about it,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.640
the normal to the surface
is independent of z.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.140
It doesn't depend on z at all.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.290
It is always going
to be a vector that

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.050
is in the x-y direction only.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.210
It's going to be--
essentially at every point,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.992
it's going to be sitting in
the plane z equals a constant.

00:03:03.992 --> 00:03:05.700
Because if you think
about what you have,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.010
you have a unit circle
at every height.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.110
And it doesn't vary
in the z-direction

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.410
at all, the bending
of that unit circle.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.230
So in fact the normal is always
going to point straight out

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.590
from the unit circle.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.570
There's going to
be no z-component.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.420
Or I should say the
z-component's 0.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.180
Maybe that's the
best way to say it.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.367
So that means that the normal
dotted with k is going to be 0.

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:28.700
And so the answer to the first
question is the flux of k

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.280
through the infinite
cylinder is actually 0.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.790
So the answer to part a is 0.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.960
Been getting a lot of
zeroes in my video so far.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.990
The next one is to find
the flux of the vector j

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.929
through one square
in the xz-plane

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:48.470
where the squares
have side length 1.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.490
So I can draw any square I want.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.011
That seems to imply
that maybe it'll

00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:53.260
be the same answer everywhere.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.170
So let's see what we get.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.270
Let me draw a
picture for part b.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.520
Label this first maybe.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.440
Let me label my axes.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.360
And I'm going to draw
the simplest one I can.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.790
That does not look like a square
but I'm not great at this.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.040
There we go.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.150
So this is my surface
sitting in the x-z plane.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.180
This side length is 1 and
this side length is 1.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.490
So what is the normal
to that surface?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.840
Well, we have two choices
and so we will actually have

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.434
a possibility of two answers.

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:31.600
So let me point out that
the normal to the surface--

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.410
well, what direction
does it point in?

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.120
Because this plane
is in the xz-plane,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.180
the normal to the surface
is either j or it's minus j.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.660
And so if I'm
integrating j dotted

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.330
with the normal over
the surface-- I'll just

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.140
call this surface capital R--
if I'm integrating over R j

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.170
dotted with the
normal dS, j dotted

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.030
with the normal is going
to be either 1 or minus 1.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.330
And hopefully that
makes sense because j--

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.460
let me draw this-- j is pointing
exactly in the y-direction.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.610
And the normal is
either in this direction

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.330
or in the opposite direction.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.300
Up to how I choose to
orient the surface.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.150
And so j dotted with n is
either plus or minus 1,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.994
and so I just get the area of
R with a plus or minus-- ooh,

00:05:22.994 --> 00:05:24.660
that doesn't look
like a plus or minus--

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.910
with a plus or minus in front.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.390
Depending on whether
j dotted with n is 1

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.510
or whether j dotted
with n is minus 1.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.630
So the solution for
this computation

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.130
is just the area of R or
minus the area of R. Well,

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.750
what's the area of the region?

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.790
The area, it's a square of side
length 1, so it has area 1.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.554
So the final answer is
just plus or minus 1.

00:05:50.554 --> 00:05:52.720
So again, let me remind you
what we're trying to do.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.700
We're trying to
determine these fluxes

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.900
of vector fields across
surfaces without doing

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.600
a lot of calculation.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.380
And in the first case
we had a vector field

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.380
that pointed in the
z-direction only,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.150
and the normal was only
in the x and y direction.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.179
And so the flux was
0, even though it

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:12.970
was a vector field on
an infinite cylinder,

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.720
the flux was still 0.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.410
And in the other case,
I had actually here, I

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.060
had a surface that was
exactly in the xz-plane.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.080
And so its normal was exactly
either in the same direction

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.450
as j or 180 degrees
around from j.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.860
So j dotted with the normal
was either plus or minus 1.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.440
And so I only had to know
the area of the region.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.980
Which is why it didn't matter
where I moved this unit square.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.150
I didn't tell you where
the unit square had to sit,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.670
so that's where you can
see why it didn't matter.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.820
Because it's just the area.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.840
OK, I think that's
where I'll stop.
