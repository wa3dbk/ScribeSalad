PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.600
I have a nice
exercise here for you

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.460
that tests your knowledge
of triple integration.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.970
So in particular, I've
got for you a cylinder.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.830
And my cylinder has height
h and it has radius b.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.170
And this is the kind
of cylinder I like.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.920
It's a constant
density cylinder.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.680
So its density is
just 1 everywhere.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.820
So what I'd like you to
do is, for the cylinder,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.390
I'd like you to compute
its moment of inertia

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.510
around its central axis.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.194
So why don't you pause the
video, have a go at that,

00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:44.360
come back, and you can check
your work against mine.

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.640
Hopefully you had some luck
working on this problem.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.350
Let's talk about it.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.540
So the first thing to
notice is that there

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.020
aren't any coordinates
in this problem.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.210
I've given you a cylinder
but it's up to you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.550
to choose coordinates, a way to
arrange your cylinder in space

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.790
or a way to arrange your
coordinates with respect

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.590
to your cylinder.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.700
So a convenient thing
to do in this case

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.920
is going to be-- you
know, we're working

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.400
with respect to the central
axis of the cylinder.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.440
So let's make that
one of our axes.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.800
So in particular, why don't
we make it our z-axis.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.210
That seems like a natural
sort of thing to do.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.160
So let me try and draw
a little picture here.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.655
So we've got our cylinder.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.980
And there it is with our
three coordinate axes.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.365
I guess it's got radius
b and it's got height h.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:55.170
Now we've arranged it,
now we have coordinates,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.290
so now we want to see what it
is we're trying to do with it.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.830
So we're trying to compute
a moment of inertia.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.430
So we have to remember what
a moment of inertia means.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.270
So let me think.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.160
So a moment of inertia,
when you have a solid--

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.130
so your moment of inertia I with
respect to an axis is what you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.010
get when you take
the triple integral--

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:28.470
so let's say your solid is D.
Your solid D. So you take D.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.600
So you take a triple
integral over D

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.800
and you're integrating
r squared with respect

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.600
to the element of mass.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.100
OK.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.560
So r squared here,
this is the distance

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.970
from the axis around
which you're computing

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.030
the moment of inertia.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.120
And in our case, so in any
case, this little moment of mass

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.560
is-- sorry, little
element of mass--

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.000
is density times a
little element of volume.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.450
So we can also write this
as the triple integral

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.590
over our region of r squared
times delta times dV.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.060
OK, so this is what
this is in general.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.800
So now let's think
about it in our case.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.240
Well, in our case,
we've cleverly

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.940
chosen our central
axis to be the z-axis.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.100
So this r is just the
distance from the z-axis.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.640
This I was kind
enough to give you

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.560
a constant-density cylinder,
so this delta is just 1.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.590
That's going to be easy.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.640
And then we have
this triple integral

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.894
over the whole cylinder.

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:33.060
So we want a triple integral
over the whole cylinder

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.800
of some integrand
that involves r.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.241
So a natural thing to
do in this situation--

00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:41.740
the natural sort
of thing to do when

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.160
you have a cylinder or anything
that's rotationally symmetric,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.050
and you have an integrand that
behaves nicely with respect

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.750
to rotation, that
can be written easily

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.470
in terms of r, or
r and theta-- is

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.575
to do cylindrical coordinates.

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:59.450
Is to think of
cylindrical coordinates.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.390
So in our case
that means we just

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.430
need to figure out-- at this
point-- we need to figure out

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.266
how do we integrate
over the cylinder

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:07.390
in cylindrical coordinates?

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.505
So let's do it.

00:04:13.505 --> 00:04:23.764
So in our case-- so it doesn't
matter too much what order

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:24.430
we do things in.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.410
So we need dV.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.680
We need to write that in terms
of the cylindrical coordinates.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.850
So that's dz, dr, and d theta.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.220
And so we know that
dV is r dz dr d theta.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.440
You might want some
other order there,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.270
but that's a good, nice order.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.100
It usually is the simplest
order to consider.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.570
So this moment of
inertia, in our case,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.680
is going to be this
triple integral.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.550
OK, so we said r squared
delta, r squared times density,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.620
density is 1.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.100
So that's just r squared.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.840
And r, the distance
to the axis is

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.520
r, the distance to the z-axis.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:11.830
So that's just r squared
times r dz dr d theta.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.650
So this is the integral
we're trying to compute,

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.690
but we need bounds, right?

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.660
It's a triple integral,
it's a definite integral,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.670
we need to figure out what
the bounds are to evaluate it

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.760
as an iterated integral.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.050
So let's go look at this
little picture we drew.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.270
So I guess I didn't
discuss this,

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.460
but I made a choice
just to put the bottom

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.060
of the cylinder in the xy-plane
and the top at height h.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.560
It's not going to matter.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.130
If you had made some other
choice, it would work out fine.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.610
So that means the z
is going from 0 to h,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.580
regardless of r and theta.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.980
So z is going from 0 to h.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.775
That's nice, let's
put that over here.

00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:51.470
z is the inside one.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.070
It's going from 0 to h.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.730
Then r is next.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.380
Well, this is also--
you know, cylinders

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.090
are great for
cylindrical coordinates.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.610
Shocker, right, given the name.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.110
I know.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.630
So r is going from 0
to what's the radius?

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.700
Our radius was b.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.530
So r goes from 0
to b, and that's

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.640
true regardless of theta.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.150
So back over here, so we have r
going from 0 to b and theta is

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.760
just going from 0 to 2*pi;
we're doing a full rotation all

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.070
the way around the cylinder.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.900
So this is what our
moment of inertia is,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.840
and now we just
have to compute it.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.670
So we've got our inner integral
here is with respect to z.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:38.390
So the inner integral
is the integral from 0

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.620
to h of r cubed dz.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.140
And r cubed doesn't
have any z's in it.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.920
Fabulous.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.400
So that's just going
to be r cubed z,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.190
where z goes from 0 to h.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.050
So that's h r cubed minus 0.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.250
So h r cubed.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.750
All right.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.570
So that's the inner.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.153
Now let's look at
the middle integral.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.440
So this is going
to be the integral

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.810
as-- that's our r integral.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.424
So that's going from 0 to b.

00:07:14.424 --> 00:07:15.590
And what are we integrating?

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.410
We're integrating
the inner integral.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.130
So the inner integral
was h r cubed.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.960
So we're integrating h
r cubed dr from 0 to b.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.730
All right, this is
not quite as easy.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.210
But h as a constant,
we're integrating r cubed.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.770
I've done worse.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.040
You've done worse.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.940
So that's going to be h r to the
fourth over 4 between 0 and b.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.440
So OK.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.610
So that's h b to the fourth
over 4 minus h times 0

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.550
to the fourth over 4.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.710
So the second term's 0.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:52.550
So this is just equal to h
times b to the fourth over 4.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.590
And finally, we have
our outermost integral.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.010
So what was that integral?

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.800
Well, that was the integral from
0 to 2*pi d theta of the second

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.820
integral.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.600
So this is of the
middle integral.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:13.660
So it's the integral from 0
to 2*pi d theta of the middle

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.740
integral which was h b
to the fourth over 4.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.800
And this is just
a constant again.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.940
Great.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:27.950
So this is h b to the
fourth over 4 times 2*pi.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.170
So what does that work out to?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:37.640
That's h b to the
fourth pi over 2.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.270
All right.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.160
So there you go.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:45.370
Now if you wanted to, you could
also rewrite this a little bit,

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.660
because you could note that
this is pi h b squared,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.316
that's your volume
of your cylinder.

00:08:54.316 --> 00:08:55.940
And in fact, it's
not just your volume,

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.570
it's your mass of your
cylinder, because it

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.690
had constant density 1.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:04.580
So you also could've
written this as mass times

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.470
a squared over 2.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.610
Sorry. b squared over 2.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.910
I don't know where a came from.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.080
Mass times b squared.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.890
So you have some
other options for how

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.220
you could write this
answer by involving

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.020
the volume and mass and so on.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.800
So let's just recap very
quickly why we did what we did.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.200
We had a cylinder.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.290
And so really,
given a cylinder, it

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.360
was a natural choice to look
at cylindrical coordinates.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.437
And once we had
cylindrical coordinates,

00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:37.270
everything was easy.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.060
So we just took our general
form of the moment of inertia,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.430
took the region in
question, in cylindrical

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.960
coordinates it was very,
very easy to describe

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.970
this entire region.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.730
And then our
integrals were pretty

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.140
easy to compute after
we made that choice.
