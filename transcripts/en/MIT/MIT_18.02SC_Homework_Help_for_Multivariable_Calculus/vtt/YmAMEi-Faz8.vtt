00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.280
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.880
In this video, I'd like us to
work on the following problem.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.550
Which is we begin with a
vector field, capital F,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.270
that is z*x*i plus
z*y*j plus x*k.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.080
And we're going to
look at the curve

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.260
C that is a helix, that we can
describe by the parameter t.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.042
So we'll describe it as
cosine t comma sine t comma t.

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:33.500
And we're interested
in the portion

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.864
of the helix that goes from
(1, 0, 0) to (minus 1, 0, pi).

00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:40.030
And I'd like you to do two
things with this problem.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.570
The first thing
I'd like you to do

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.050
is I'd like you to sketch
the curve that is carved out

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.480
when you follow the t
values that will start you

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.580
at (1, 0, 0) and will finish
you up at (minus 1, 0, pi).

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.410
The second thing I
would like you to do

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.110
is I would like you to compute
the line integral F dot dr

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.200
over that portion of the helix.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.270
So there are two
parts to this problem.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.684
Why don't you pause the video,
work on these two parts,

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:06.350
and then when you're
feeling comfortable

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.559
seeing the solution,
bring the video back up

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:09.850
and I'll show you how I did it.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.410
OK, welcome back.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.826
So again what we're interested
in doing in this problem is

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:23.960
first, understanding
what the curve looks

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.160
like that we want to take
this line integral over.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.800
And then actually computing
the line integral.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.990
So we have this
C that is a helix

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.810
and it's described by
cosine t, sine t, t.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.780
And in fact-- well, I won't
say any more about this helix.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.250
But it actually
should remind you

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.260
when you see the picture of some
portion of what DNA looks like.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.610
It's going to spiral
around, just the way

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.570
some little side of-- if you
take DNA, how it spirals up,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.800
it's going to be the
boundary of some of that.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.540
So we'll see that momentarily.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.700
And if you notice, the
first thing that's helpful

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.400
if you want to
sketch the curve, is

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.300
that t-- I know immediately
what the parameters are in t.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.120
t is ranging from 0 to pi.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.940
So I know already exactly
what I want to do.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.210
And in order to draw this
curve, what I'm going to do

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.090
is I'm going to give myself
a frame of reference.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.300
Because otherwise
it's going to be

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.630
really hard to draw this curve.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.770
And the frame of reference
is the following.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.070
All of these points, all
of the points cosine t,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.250
sine t, t, lie-- in the x-y
distance from the origin,

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.530
they lie at a radius 1.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.180
So in terms of x
and y, they're all

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.610
going to sit on the boundary
of a cylinder of radius 1.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.614
So let me draw
what I mean by that

00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:39.280
and then we'll see
where the points are.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.710
So let me actually come
write right over here.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.970
So my first part
sketching the curve,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.810
the first thing I'm going to
do is give myself a cylinder.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.840
Which I'll show you is
of radius 1 momentarily.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.510
And I'm going to actually say
this is the z-axis, coming

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.830
straight through the middle.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.830
And then the y-axis is going
to come out the side, as usual.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.140
And the x-axis is going to
come down in this direction.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.010
OK, so this cylinder I'm
thinking of, it has radius 1.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.420
So at any given z
value, any fixed z

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.550
value that I intersect
with the cylinder gives

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.450
a circle of radius 1.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.050
Now if you notice
again, what I was

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.360
trying to explain
from over here,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.530
is that if I don't look at
the z component, obviously

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.270
the cosine t, sine
t is something

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.050
that's on the unit circle
if I ignore the z component.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.090
And so that's how I know that
these x and y values here

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.120
are just going to
lie on the cylinder,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.060
because they're always
distance 1 from the z-axis,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.180
at any given height.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.400
So that's the first
thing I observe.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.370
The second thing I observe
is that I mentioned

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.920
t goes from 0 to pi, and that's
exactly the z values also.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.690
So the z values are
going from 0 to pi,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.870
so I know my first value is
going to be on the xy-plane.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.250
And my last value is going to
be on the z equals pi plane.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.190
And then the last
thing to observe

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.920
is that what is being carved
out in the x and y components?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.830
Well, it's really
exactly what you

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.884
would do if you were trying
to parameterize a circle.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:20.300
But you're
parameterizing a circle

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.841
and instead of just
drawing it always

00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:25.230
on the same z
plane-- so xy-plane,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.970
z equals a constant-- you're
parameterizing that circle

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.540
and you're also moving up.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.150
And so the first value (1, 0,
0) is happening somewhere here.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.170
And the last value is
happening at negative 1, 0, pi.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.450
And so I have to go sort of
in the backwards direction.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.430
So here's my x equals
negative 1, 0, pi.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.802
And so I'm kind of behind.

00:04:47.802 --> 00:04:49.260
You should think
of this as being--

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.134
let me see if I can draw
this-- this is behind the pi--

00:04:54.134 --> 00:04:55.800
maybe I should draw
it a little further.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.540
If this is the pi height, it
was more like right there.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.582
It's behind the z-axis here.

00:05:01.582 --> 00:05:02.540
It's on the other side.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.869
And so the curve
that's carved out

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:06.410
is going to look
something like this.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.200
It's going to come
up through here.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.930
It's spiraling.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.820
And then it's
going to go behind,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.220
on the other side of the
cylinder, and spiral up.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.470
Now in a perfect world, if
I could draw this actually

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.230
in three dimensions, the way
it's coming up is actually,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.200
it has to have some
sort of constant rate.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.390
Because it's always
moving in the z direction

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.640
at a constant rate.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.197
It's moving in the z
direction linearly.

00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:31.280
Maybe this picture is not
the most perfect picture

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.260
because it looks like it's
going up really fast at the end.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.040
But it gives us a feel
for how the curve looks.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.730
If I continued it, it would
come back around to the front

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.650
by the time t went to 2*pi.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.920
And so this is a spiral.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.880
It goes around the cylinder,
behind the cylinder.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.207
And then if I go for
another pi, from pi to 2*pi,

00:05:49.207 --> 00:05:51.790
it's going to go-- continue to
curve around and then come back

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.520
out to the front and be
right above this point.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.780
So that's the helix.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.610
That's the shape of the helix.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.400
So this is an
approximate sketch.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.110
Good thing I said
sketch the curve.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.856
So this is a sketch
of the curve.

00:06:03.856 --> 00:06:05.230
And now what we
want to do, again

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.430
as I mentioned, is we want
to compute a line integral,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.030
we want to compute F
dot dr over this curve.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.250
So what I'm going
to need is I'm going

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.620
to know that this
is the curve here,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.510
and I need to understand how to
parameterize F and dr in terms

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.976
of this parameter t.

00:06:25.976 --> 00:06:27.350
So that's what
I'm interested in.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.270
So let's think about what F
dot dr is in order to do this.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.350
I think the notation
you've seen from lecture

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.940
is F we usually denote by
capital P, capital Q, capital

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.740
R. And dr we denote
[dx, dy,  dz].

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.020
And so F dot dr, as
we've seen previously,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:56.580
is P*dx plus Q*dy plus R*dz.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.270
So let's see what that is
in the parameters we have.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.890
So let me first
remind ourselves, x

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.570
in this situation is cosine t.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.040
y is sine t.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.490
And z is equal to t.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.400
Based on how we're
parameterizing the curve.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.720
And we're interested in the
values of t going from 0 to pi.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.510
So these are the quantities
that we're going to need.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.760
Now in order to solve this
problem I need dx, dy, dz.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.772
I also need P, Q, and R in terms
of these x, y, and z values.

00:07:28.772 --> 00:07:31.230
So let me remind you also--
I'm going to write it over here

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:38.792
so I don't have to look again--
F is actually z*x comma z*y

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.340
comma x.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.410
Let me check that.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.920
Yes, that is what I have.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.565
So that is my F. So now that
I have it a little closer,

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:47.940
I'm going to put
it all together.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.106
And I actually have to move
over to put it together,

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:51.950
but now the reference is closer.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.740
So notice first I'm
going to do P*dx.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.550
So P is z times x.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.240
And then what is dx?

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.670
Well, dx-- I really need to
figure out what dx/dt is,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.020
right? dx/dt is negative sine t.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.490
And so I'm going to replace
the dx by a negative sine t dt.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.860
I'll be replacing
dy by cosine t dt

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.004
and I'll be replacing dz by dt.

00:08:18.004 --> 00:08:20.670
So I have all the pieces here; I
just have to put them together.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.450
So let me do that.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.220
I want to integrate over C
F dot dr. I'm really going

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.420
to be integrating-- let's see.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.320
Let me come to this side so
I can see everything I need.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.820
I'm really going
to be integrating--

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.710
I know I'm integrating from
0 to pi in my parameter t.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.560
My first component of
F I told you was z*x.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.810
So that's t cosine t, and
then dx is, as I said,

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.680
negative sine t dt.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.150
So times negative sine t dt.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.920
That's my first component.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.200
My next component,
as I said, is Q*dy.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.700
Q was z*y and so it's t sine t.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.540
And then dy is cosine t dt.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.254
Oops, let me put the dt
there, it's a little easier.

00:09:17.254 --> 00:09:19.420
And then I'm going to write
the last component here,

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.300
so we can see it
all in one frame.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.180
And then the last
thing was R*dz.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.080
And R is just x.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.850
So that's cosine t.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.234
And dz is just dt.

00:09:31.234 --> 00:09:32.400
So there's three components.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.880
This was the P*dx component,
this is the Q*dy component,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.840
and this is the R*dz component.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.390
And so notice, this is great.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.681
This is why I like this
problem, it's going to be nice.

00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:44.940
Because I've got a t cosine
t times negative sine t,

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.250
and a t sine t times a cosine t.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.600
And so these two add
up to 0, and so I only

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.080
have to integrate one thing.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:56.710
So I only have to integrate
from 0 to pi cosine t dt.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.100
And so what do I get?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:08.720
I get-- this should be sine
t evaluated at 0 and pi.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.980
And sine of pi I believe is 0.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.830
And sine of 0 I believe is 0.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.050
And so I get 0
minus 0, so I get 0.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.480
So they're actually--
when I compute

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.050
the line integral of F
dot dr over that helix,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.747
I actually get 0.

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:25.330
So let me just remind
you, real quick,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.010
what the point of the
problem was and what we did.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:33.490
We had-- at the very beginning,
we had a vector field,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.872
we had a curve, and
essentially all we were doing

00:10:35.872 --> 00:10:38.330
is a problem we've done in two
dimensions many times, which

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.470
is compute a line
integral along a curve.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.330
And so we just
added a dimension.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.910
The problem is exactly the same.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:48.750
Instead of now just dx and dy,
now we have a dx, dy, and a dz.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.400
We have one extra
direction you're moving.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.302
But that's all that's different.

00:10:53.302 --> 00:10:55.260
So the first thing we
did was sketch the curve.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.343
Then we computed the line
integral, as I'm saying,

00:10:57.343 --> 00:11:00.190
by exactly the same methods
that we did in two dimensions.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.010
So everything, really,
should remind you

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.020
of what you've done
previously, we now just

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.720
have a third component
we have to deal with.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.530
And that was, in our case, in
this problem, the R*dz part.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.506
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
