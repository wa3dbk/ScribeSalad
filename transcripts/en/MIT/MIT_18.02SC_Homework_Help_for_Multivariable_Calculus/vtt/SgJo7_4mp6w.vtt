JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.020
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.270
In lecture, you've been
learning about planes

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.690
and their equations and various
different geometric problems

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.640
relating to them.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.990
So I have an example
of such a problem here.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.820
So I've got a
point, which happens

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.110
to be the origin, which I'm
going to call P, (0, 0, 0).

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.210
And I've got a plane which
has the equation 2x plus y

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.575
minus 2z is equal to 4.

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:33.060
And what I'd like you to
do is compute the distance

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.800
from that point to that plane.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.330
So just to remind you, so there
are lots of points on a plane,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.450
of course.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.180
And our point in question has
a distance to each of them.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.680
When we talk about the distance
between a point and a plane,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.340
what we mean is the
shortest distance.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.270
So the perpendicular distance.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.390
So if we have the plane
and we have the point,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.110
so we want to drop
a perpendicular

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.000
from the point to the
plane, and then we're

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.540
asking for that length
of that segment.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.980
So that's the distance between
the point and the plane.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.260
So why don't you pause the
video, take a little while

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.731
to figure this out, come
back, and we can figure it out

00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:11.230
together.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.130
So hopefully you had some
luck working out this problem.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.570
Let's think about
it a little bit.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.300
We have a point and
we have a plane,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.680
and we want to figure out what
the perpendicular distance

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.140
from the point to the plane is.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.740
So one thing that's going
to be important then

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.150
is definitely knowing what
direction that vector is.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.650
Right?

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.570
We have the plane and we want
to find a perpendicular segment

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.500
to it.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.170
And so in order to do that, it's
useful to know what direction

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.680
is that segment pointing in.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.340
So luckily, we're given the
plane in this simple equation

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.840
form.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:10.350
So the normal to
the plane-- and when

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.570
you're given an equation
of a plane in this form,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:26.020
the normal vector is just given
by the coefficients of x, y,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.570
and z.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.880
So in our case, the plane is
2x plus y minus 2z equals 4,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.745
so the normal
vector to this plane

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:35.650
is the vector 2, 1, minus 2.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.450
So this is the
direction in which

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.819
we need to go from our point
P in order to get to the plane

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:43.860
by the shortest distance.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.260
So now what we need
is we need to know

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.580
the component of--
or sorry, rather, we

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.400
need to know the
actual distance we have

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.000
to travel in that direction.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.610
So one way to do this is if we
go back to our little picture

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.110
here.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.550
We don't know what
this point is.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.252
We don't know--
when we start from P

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:07.460
and head in the direction
perpendicular to the plane,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.040
we don't know what point we're
going to land on the plane at.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.520
But what we could do is,
if we knew some other point

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.710
on the plane--
somewhere-- we could

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.790
look at the vector connecting
P to that other point,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.420
and then we could project it
onto the normal direction.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.340
So we could take the component--

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.030
so let's call this
other point Q.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.010
So if we choose any
point Q in the plane

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.130
that we're looking at, we
could take the vector PQ

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.930
and we can project it
onto this normal vector.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.440
And if we take the
component of this vector,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.117
project it onto
that normal vector--

00:03:49.117 --> 00:03:51.450
if we take the component of
this vector in the direction

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.980
of the normal vector-- what
that will give us is exactly

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.461
the length of this segment.

00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:56.960
Yeah?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.920
That projection will be
exactly the perpendicular

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.110
segment we're looking for.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.700
And its length, the component--
or the absolute value

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.130
of the component, perhaps--
will be exactly that distance.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.760
So good.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.890
So then we just have
to compute-- well,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.270
we need to find a point Q, and
we need to compute a component.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.310
So we need any
point on the plane.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.960
So, actually I'm going
to walk back over here.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.280
And to find a
point on the plane,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.970
we can just do this by
looking at the equation.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.180
So one way to go about
this, for example,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.680
is that you pick a variable
that appears in the equation.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.500
So x appears in the equation.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.612
And now you could just set all
the other variables equal to 0.

00:04:42.612 --> 00:04:44.820
And that will give you
something you can solve for x.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.278
So in particular,
you know, there's

00:04:46.278 --> 00:04:49.110
a point on this plane
with y equals z equals 0,

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.240
and that point has 2x equals 4.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:01.920
So we can take, for example,
Q to be the point (2, 0, 0).

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.250
So this is a point on the plane.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.750
So this is our
point on the plane,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.800
and so we have--
what we want to do

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.110
is we want to project-- so
PQ, the vector from P to Q,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.140
we get by subtracting
the coordinates of P

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.620
from those of Q. Q minus P. So
this is the vector [2, 0, 0].

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.290
And we want the component
of PQ in the direction N.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:49.830
So the distance in
question is the--

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.360
and really, when I say
component in this case,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.980
I mean the positive component.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.140
I want-- because the
distance has to be positive.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.140
So if I get a
negative component,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.530
I really want its
absolute value here.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.770
So the distance is the positive
component in the direction N.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.770
So what's that equal to?

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.340
Well, it's just equal to the
absolute value of-- so we know

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.910
the component of PQ in the
direction N is what we get when

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:25.250
we take PQ and we dot it with
N divided by the length of N,

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.840
and then to make sure
it's positive at the end,

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.200
I want to throw in these
absolute values signs.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.730
So OK.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.670
So this is-- and this is now,
you know, we have our vector PQ

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.570
and we have our
vector N, so it should

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.430
be straightforward to compute
this final expression.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.980
So we know that N is
equal to 2, 1, minus 2.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.320
So the length of N-- which
is in the denominator here--

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.320
is equal to the square
root of 2 squared

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.950
plus 1 squared plus
minus 2 squared.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.680
And in the numerator, we have
the absolute value of PQ dot N.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.160
So PQ dot N is
going to be 2 times

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:12.160
2, plus 0 times 1,
plus 0 times minus 2.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.690
OK.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.850
And so if we-- this is
just a fraction bar here.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.840
And so we simplify
that a little bit.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.915
So up top, we just have
4 plus 0 plus 0 is 4.

00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:24.960
And on the bottom, we
have the square root

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.590
of 2 squared plus 1
squared plus 2 squared.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.410
That's going to be the
square root of 9, which is 3.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.270
So this is just equal to 4/3.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.960
So there we go.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.530
The distance in question is 4/3.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.520
The way we got it is we realized
that that distance is just

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.980
the component of any
segment-- any vector--

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.170
connecting our point
P to the plane,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.330
in the direction of the normal.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.880
So you choose any vector PQ.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.750
So, you know, you just have
to come up with a point

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.500
Q on the plane, which
you can do by inspection

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.810
from the equation.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.950
So that gives you a
vector that gets you

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.050
from P to some
point on the plane,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.450
and then you choose
the component

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.640
in the normal direction.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.450
And so once you do that, you
get this distance: your answer.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.128
So I'll end there.
