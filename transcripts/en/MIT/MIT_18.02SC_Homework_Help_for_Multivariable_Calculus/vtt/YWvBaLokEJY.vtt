CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.310
In this video, I'd like us to
work on the following problem.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.560
So the problem is as follows.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.900
For which of the
following vector fields

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.820
is the domain where
each vector field

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.360
is defined and
continuously differentiable

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.882
a simply connected region.

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:24.840
So there's a lot there.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.673
I'm going to break that
down first, and then

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:27.950
show you the vector fields.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.860
So we're starting with some
different vector fields.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.190
And we want to determine first
the domain for each vector

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.550
field where it is both
defined and continuously

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.980
differentiable.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.090
And then once you've
determined that domain,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.930
the next object is to determine
whether or not that region is

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.550
simply connected.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.979
So there are two parts for
each of these problems.

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.520
So again, the first
thing is you want

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.130
to determine all of the values
for which the vector field is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.900
both defined and
continuously differentiable.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.017
You want to look at that region
that contains all those values,

00:01:01.017 --> 00:01:03.100
and you want to determine
if that region is simply

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.270
connected.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.140
So there are four
different vector fields,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.080
and I'll just point
them out here.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.800
They're all in the plane.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.040
So the first one is
root x i plus root y j.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.180
The second one is i plus j,
divided by the square root of 1

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.100
minus x squared minus y squared.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.810
The third one looks fairly
similar to the second one,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.050
but it's i plus j,
divided by the square root

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.470
of the quantity x squared
plus y squared minus 1.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.180
And the fourth one is i plus j
times the quantity natural log

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.312
of r squared-- natural log
of x squared plus y squared.

00:01:38.312 --> 00:01:40.270
So there are four different
vector fields here.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.070
You have do two
things for each one.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.730
So find the domain where
it's defined and continuously

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.512
differentiable,
and then determine

00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:47.970
if that domain is
simply connected.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.280
So why don't you pause
the video, work on these,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.737
and then when you're
ready to see what I did,

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:54.070
you can bring the video back up.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.750
OK, welcome back.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.090
So we're going to do
this problem one vector

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.050
field at a time.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.780
We're going to take
each vector field,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.147
I'm going to determine
where it's defined

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:12.730
and differentiable,
and then I'm going

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.729
to determine if that
region is simply connected.

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.640
So we're going to do
each one separately.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.250
So I'm going to start
off with a, which

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.550
was root x i plus root y j.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.600
And I want to point out
first, for the function

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.060
f of x is equal to square root
of x, it is defined for all x

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.590
greater than or equal to 0,
and it is differentiable for x

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.360
greater than 0.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.280
I left out the T. There we go.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.970
So it is both defined
and differentiable

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.210
when x is greater than 0.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.270
And now if I replace
this with a y,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.900
the same thing is true for y
greater than or equal to 0,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.290
and y greater than 0.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.950
So we know the region
where this vector field is

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.100
both defined and differentiable
is when x is greater

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.490
than 0 and y is greater than 0.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.620
So we need the region-- let me
draw it this way-- the region

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.170
that is the first
quadrant in the xy-plane.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.170
And it's not including
the x-axis or the y-axis.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.880
So it's this full shaded region.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.350
OK, that is the
region where it's

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.100
defined and differentiable.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.910
If I was going to
write that precisely,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:52.610
I would say something like, all
(x, y) with x greater than 0

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.181
and y greater than 0.

00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:55.680
Right?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.220
You need both.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.370
So it's exactly the (x, y) pairs
with x positive and y positive,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.506
and that's the region.

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:03.880
And now the question is, is
that region simply connected?

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.410
Well, the way we
think about simply

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.810
connectedness, from what
you've seen in class, is you

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.290
want to show that if you
take a closed curve that's

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.070
contained in the
region, that everything

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.790
on the interior of that closed
curve is also in the region.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.490
And you notice that is in fact
true for this first quadrant.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.766
Any closed curve I draw
that's in the region, all

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:25.390
the points on the
interior of the curve

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.020
are also in the region.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.410
So this domain where it's
defined and differentiable

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.390
is simply connected.

00:04:35.137 --> 00:04:36.845
So the first one, it
is simply connected.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.250
All right.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.940
So that's part a.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.010
Part b-- let me
rewrite that one so

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:58.890
we don't have to zoom
over to the other side--

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.240
this was i plus j divided by
the function square root of 1

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.970
minus x squared minus y squared.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.530
Well, we already know that
the square root function

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.800
is defined as long as the
inside function is greater

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.787
than or equal to 0.

00:05:13.787 --> 00:05:15.620
Because it's in the
denominator, we actually

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.265
need this function 1
minus x squared minus y

00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:20.040
squared to be greater than 0.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.290
And that's also where it's
going to be differentiable.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.540
The differentiable and
the defined regions

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.930
are exactly the
same, and they're

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.110
both where 1 minus x
squared minus y squared

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.231
is greater than 0.

00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:35.730
Right?

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.224
The function is only defined
as long as this quantity is

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:39.890
greater than 0, and
that's exactly where

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.400
it's differentiable as well.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.900
And so what does
this correspond to?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.275
Well, if you think
about it, this

00:05:44.275 --> 00:05:47.250
is actually 1 is greater than
x squared plus y squared.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.340
And what are the points
that look like this?

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.890
Well, the x- and y-points
that satisfy this inequality

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.560
are the x- and y-values that
are on the interior of the unit

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.330
circle.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.630
So if I draw a picture of that.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.520
Let me try and dot
the unit circle.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.440
It's not containing
the boundary,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.960
but it's all the points that
are on the interior of the unit

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.460
circle.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.777
Every point here, when I
take the ordered pair (x, y)

00:06:15.777 --> 00:06:17.610
and it's on the interior
of the unit circle,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.470
it satisfies this inequality.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.130
Those are the only
points that do that.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.960
So this is the region
that has this vector

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.540
field both differentiable
and defined.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.040
Right?

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.130
Now, is this region
simply connected?

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.970
It is, again for
the same reason.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.060
Because if you take
any closed curve here,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.040
and you look at the interior
of that closed curve,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.350
every point on the interior
of that closed curve

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.060
is also in the region.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.560
Right?

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.995
So it is also simply connected.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.290
OK.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.460
So we had two so far that
were simply connected.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.120
They were
different-looking regions,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.730
but ultimately they both
had any closed curve,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.460
the interior of it was all
contained in the region

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.920
that we were interested in.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.040
So now the third one
we have is somewhat

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.790
similar-looking to
part b, except that

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.940
what's in the square root
is a little different.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.170
So now we can use
exactly the same logic

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.900
as what we did in part b.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.350
And what we see is by
the exact same logic

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.830
that this vector field will
be defined and differentiable

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:38.050
as long as x squared plus y
squared minus 1 is positive.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.570
Because that's where the
square root function is

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.560
differentiable, and
that's also where

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.170
1 divided by the square root
of this thing is defined.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.510
So they correspond to
exactly the same regions.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.000
And that is x squared plus
y squared greater than 1.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.090
So if you think about that,
what we did previously

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.384
was we had x squared plus
y squared less than 1.

00:07:58.384 --> 00:07:59.800
So obviously if
you want x squared

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.130
plus y squared greater than
1, we're taking all the (x, y)

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.940
pairs that are outside
the unit circle.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.620
So again, we take
the unit circle.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.180
We don't include
the unit circle,

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.280
because that's where x squared
plus y squared equals 1.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.910
And then we want all of the
values outside of that region.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.800
So this extends off to infinity.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.790
All of the values
outside of that region.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.980
Now, is this region
simply connected?

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.230
It is not.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.990
And the point is that while
you do have some curves,

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.830
that if I take a
closed curve, all

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.980
of the points on the
interior of that closed curve

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.790
are in the region, there are
some curves for which that's

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:43.870
not true.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.510
For example, if
I take the circle

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.510
of radius-- what does that
look like-- 2, 1 and 1/2,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.870
something like that?

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.690
If I look at all of the points
on the interior of this curve--

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.560
I'm going to try and shade
it without getting rid

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.040
of everything, so
you can see still

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.480
what's behind-- if I look
at all those points, notice

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.510
in particular, there
are a bunch of points--

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.510
for instance, this one
here, this one here,

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.070
and this one here-- all the
ones inside the unit circle,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.360
are on the interior
of this curve,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.970
but they're not in the region.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.570
Right?

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.270
I'll shade it extra dark.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.930
All the points that
are in here, that

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.140
are inside the unit
circle, are actually still

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.320
on the interior of this curve,
but they're not in the region.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.540
And while there are some
curves for which everything

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.020
on the inside is in
the region, but there

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.200
are some curves for
which it's not true,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.430
and that is what we know about
not-simply connectedness.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.425
So we know this one is
not simply connected.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:52.960
OK.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.730
So now we have one left.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:05.030
And the last one was i
plus j, times natural log

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.465
of x squared plus y squared.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.640
So in this vector field,
what I'm really interested in

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.140
is the behavior of this function
natural log of x squared

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.540
plus y squared.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.660
And the point I want to make
is that natural log is defined

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.120
as long as the input
value is positive,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.220
and it is differentiable
everywhere it's defined.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.410
And so this function will be
both defined and differentiable

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:38.230
as long as x squared plus y
squared is greater than 0.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.709
So it's defined for
all of these values,

00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:42.750
and natural log is
differentiable everywhere it's

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.250
defined.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.290
So it's also differentiable
for all of these values.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.250
And so we see that
this vector field

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.620
is defined and differentiable
everywhere except at one point.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.760
And so let me draw--
this is a zooming

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.524
in of that it's
missing that point-- I

00:11:00.524 --> 00:11:01.690
want to make it extra large.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.922
But it's really only
missing one point.

00:11:03.922 --> 00:11:04.880
And what point is that?

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.950
That point is the origin.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.600
So everywhere except the origin.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.600
Maybe I should make it
smaller, because maybe it

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.920
looks like it's
missing a whole circle.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.260
It's just missing the point.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.410
It's just missing the origin.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.190
But every other
point on the xy-plane

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.020
is a place where
this vector field

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.970
is differentiable and defined.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:27.950
Right?

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.600
So it's only missing
that one point,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.160
but that still gives us the
fact that this region is not

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.340
simply connected.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.420
And again, it's
exactly the same type

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.220
of logic as the
previous problem,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.960
that I could draw curves, where
every point on the interior

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.450
is contained in the region.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.240
But there are curves
that also fail.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.740
Right?

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.930
If I draw a curve that contains
the origin, every point

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.870
on the interior of this
region except the origin,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.180
is contained in the
domain of interest, right?

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:04.570
But because the interior of
the curve contains the origin,

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.080
I know that this region is,
in fact, not simply connected.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.177
So if I look at all of R^2--
so if I look at all the (x,

00:12:12.177 --> 00:12:16.120
y)-values except x
equals 0 and y equals 0--

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.781
except the origin-- I get
a region that's not simply

00:12:18.781 --> 00:12:19.280
connected.

00:12:22.847 --> 00:12:24.430
And this one is maybe
a little tricky,

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.020
so I'm going to say
it one more time.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.740
OK?

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.190
So while there are
some curves that we

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.600
can see some portions
of this region

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.850
behave like simply connected
regions, when you're

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.990
around the origin, any curve
you take around the origin

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.650
is going to contain the
origin on its interior.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.350
Right?

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.190
But the origin is not in
our domain of interest.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.610
And therefore, there
are curves that we

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.330
can take that their interior
contains a point that's

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.480
not in the region.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.541
And that's what it means
to be not simply connected.

00:12:56.541 --> 00:12:57.040
OK?

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.340
So let me go back
to the beginning

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.673
and just remind you again
real quickly what we did here.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.530
We had these four vector fields.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.610
We wanted to do two
things with all of them.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.010
We wanted to first find the
regions where they were defined

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.560
and differentiable, and then
determine if those regions were

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.890
simply connected.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.210
And so we had two
examples where the regions

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.670
were simply connected.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.300
And then I gave you two examples
where the regions were not

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.720
simply connected.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.900
And so hopefully this
was informative for how

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.080
we can understand that vector
fields are not necessarily

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.330
always defined
everywhere, but also

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.730
to understand what this simply
connected region term actually

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.120
means.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.600
And I guess that's
where I'll stop.
