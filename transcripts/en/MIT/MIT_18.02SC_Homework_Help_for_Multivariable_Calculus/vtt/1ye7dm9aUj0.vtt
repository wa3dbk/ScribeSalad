JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.570
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.510
In lecture, you've been learning
about two-dimensional flux

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.990
and the normal form of
Green's theorem-- so normal

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.750
here meaning perpendicular--
so I want to give you

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.710
a problem about that.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.830
So what I'd like you
to do is to verify

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.140
Green's theorem in normal form
for this particular field,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.310
the field F equals x i hat
plus y j hat and the curve C

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.260
that consists of the upper
half of the unit circle

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.760
and the x-axis
interval minus 1 to 1.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.900
So first of all, let me
say what I mean by this C.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.500
So C, it's the usual unit
circle, circle of radius 1

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.550
centered at the origin,
so just its top half,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.400
And the x-axis
interval minus 1 to 1,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.590
I mean the line segment that
connects the points (-1, 0)

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.460
and (1, 0), so the diameter
of that semicircle.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.340
So that's the curve
C and the field F.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.780
What I mean by verify
Green's theorem

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.520
is I'd like you to compute
both the double integral that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.672
appears in Green's theorem and
the line integral that appears

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:13.380
in Green's theorem
and check that they're

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.700
really equal to each other.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.160
So that'll confirm
Green's theorem

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.060
in this particular
instance and hopefully

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.880
help give us a feel for
how it works a little bit.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.920
So why don't you pause
the video, have a go,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.730
compute both of those
integrals, come back

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.670
and we can work
them out together.

00:01:38.447 --> 00:01:40.030
Hopefully you had
some luck with this.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.390
Let's have a go at it.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.520
So what Green's
theorem tells you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.240
is that the flux across
a curve, which we usually

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.470
compute as a line
integral, is also

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.844
equal to an integral of the
divergence over the region

00:01:53.844 --> 00:01:54.760
bounded by that curve.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.950
So here the curve has to be
a closed curve so that it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.960
bounds a region of the plane.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.650
So in particular, let's
draw the picture here

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.630
so we know what
we're talking about.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.000
So the curve C, so we've got
the segment from minus 1 to 1

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.419
along the x-axis, and
then we have the top half

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.210
of the unit circle.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.820
That's the curve C. And I
didn't specify an orientation

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.302
but in any context
like this, when

00:02:29.302 --> 00:02:31.052
you don't specify an
orientation, what you

00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:32.650
mean is positively oriented.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.880
So it's a positively
oriented curve.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.320
So that's our curve C.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.310
And so the region that
it bounds is this half

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.210
of the circle, the semicircle.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.730
I keep saying half
of the semicircle.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.450
Sorry about that.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.160
This upper half of the
circle, of the disc, in fact.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.830
That region of the plane.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.370
OK, so what Green's
theorem tells

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.410
us is that when we compute
the surface integral-- sorry,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.380
the double integral--
of the divergence of F

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.060
over this region, that
should be the same as what

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.920
we do if we compute F
dot n around the boundary

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.860
of the curve.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.540
And now we're going to check it.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.635
So let's do the
double integral first.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.980
The double integral
in this case,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.130
so it's the double
integral over--

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.650
let me call that region R-- so
it's the double integral over R

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.790
of the divergence of F dA.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.380
So what is the divergence of F?

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.650
Well, here's F. It's
x i hat plus y j hat.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.400
So its divergence
is the partial of x

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.760
with respect to x, plus the
partial of y with respect to y.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.800
So that's 1 plus 1.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.990
So the divergence of F
is just 2, in this case.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.120
So it's equal to
the double integral

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.570
over the semicircle of 2 dA.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.290
And of course when you integrate
a constant over a region, what

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.330
you get is just that constant
times the area of the region.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.640
So dA here is the area
of the semicircle,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.820
it's half of a
circle of radius 1.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.980
So circle of radius
1 has area pi.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.790
So this is 2 times 1/2 pi.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.720
So this is pi.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.010
OK.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.790
So that's the double
integral that we

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.880
get from Green's
theorem in normal form.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.100
And what Green's theorem
says is that this

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.602
is equal to a particular
line integral.

00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:48.810
So what is the line integral?

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.110
Well, it's the integral
around C of F dot n.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:02.770
So let's write down what it
is, the line integral part now.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.620
So it's an integral.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.940
It's a closed curve.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:20.100
So it's integral
around C of F dot n ds.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.580
So that is the line integral
that we're looking to compute.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.035
So how do we compute this?

00:05:29.035 --> 00:05:33.270
Well, usually we compute it
by using the coordinates of F.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.200
So this is equal to, and we know
that this is always equal to,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.982
the integral around
C of-- and let

00:05:40.982 --> 00:05:43.440
me make sure I'm getting this
right before I screw anything

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.680
up.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.179
Yes.

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:44.690
OK, I am.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.270
Good.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.490
M*dy minus N*dx, where M and
N are the coordinates of F--

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.370
or the components of F. M and
N are the components of F.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.640
So M is the first component
and N is the second component.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.530
So in our case, F has
this fairly simple form.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.940
So in our case, this is
equal to the integral

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:13.155
around C of-- so M, the
first component of F is x.

00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:20.120
So this is x*dy minus-- the
second component is y*dx.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.730
So this is the line integral
we're interested in computing.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.490
But, of course,
this curve is not

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.716
easy to parameterize
as a single go.

00:06:29.716 --> 00:06:31.340
So we want to split
it into two pieces.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.710
So let's look.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.320
So the first piece we
want to split it into

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.700
is that line segment.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.210
So let's call that maybe--
well, I'm not even going

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.890
to bother giving them names.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.090
We want to split it into
the integral over the line

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.700
segment plus the integral
over the semicircle.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.040
The boundary of that--
yes, the semicircle.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.960
So this is equal to-- so it's
the integral over the line

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.180
segment.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.730
So let's see.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.940
So that integral-- well,
OK, I will give them names.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.898
I will give them names.

00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:01.560
I take it back.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.300
We'll call the line
segment C_1 and we'll

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.930
call the semicircle C_2.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.310
So it's equal to the
integral over C_1--

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.760
OK, well, what is the
integral over C_1?

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.260
What are x and dy and
y and dx in this case?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.670
So in this case, well, x
is what we're integrating.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.820
But dy, we're on this line
segment, y isn't changing.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.110
y is constant.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.070
So dy is just 0.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:32.990
So it's 0 minus-- OK, and now on
this line segment y is 0 also.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.260
So it's 0*dx.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.790
So the first integral,
the integral over C_1,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.870
is the integral of 0.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:49.998
Plus-- we have to
integrate over C_2 of-- OK,

00:07:49.998 --> 00:07:56.870
so x*dy minus y*dx.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:57.370
All right.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.286
So this one's just going
to be 0, that's easy.

00:07:59.286 --> 00:08:01.720
So now we just have to
work with this second one.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.820
OK, so for the second
one, we're integrating

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.130
over the semicircle, so we
want to parameterize it.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.213
And we're going to use our
usual parameterization.

00:08:08.213 --> 00:08:11.340
x equals cosine t,
y equals sine t.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.710
And in this case, we just
want to do this semicircle.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.660
So we just want to go from
(1, 0) all the way around to

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.170
(-1, 0).

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.910
So that is from
going from 0 to pi.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.170
So this is equal to-- so this
first integral is just 0.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.430
It's the integral
of 0 and that's 0.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.480
So it's the integral-- OK, so
t is going to go from 0 to pi.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.100
So now x*dy So x is cosine t.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.500
y is sine t.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.890
So dy is sine t dt.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.420
Sorry, it's cosine t dt.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.910
y is sine t.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.840
dy is cosine t dt.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.710
So it's cosine t times cosine
t dt, minus-- all right,

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.500
now y is sine t again.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.820
And x is cosine t.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.000
So dx is minus sine t dt.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.777
So this is times
minus sine t dt.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.140
OK, well what happens here?

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:21.930
So this becomes cosine squared
t dt minus minus sine squared t.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:22.930
Minus minus is plus.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.620
So it's cosine squared t
dt plus sine squared t dt.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.500
But, of course, cosine squared
plus sine squared is just 1.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:36.253
So we can write this even more
simply as the integral from 0

00:09:36.253 --> 00:09:43.660
to pi of 1 dt or just dt, and
the integral dt is just t.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.881
So this is t between
0 and pi, which is pi.

00:09:48.881 --> 00:09:49.380
Whew!

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.060
OK.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.991
Pi.

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:51.490
Good.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.910
And what did we get before?

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.100
We also got pi.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.990
Great.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.550
So we have successfully
verified Green's theorem

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.210
in normal form in this
particular instance.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.990
So let's just recap
again what we did.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.340
We had this field
F and this curve

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.970
C. This closed curve C
that bounded some region.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.130
And so what we've done is we
computed the double integral

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.850
over the region of div F dA.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.540
So that's what we did first.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.140
Double integral over the
region bounded by the curve.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.630
And then second, we
computed the line

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:31.490
integral, around the
boundary, of F dot n ds.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.410
So that was what--
this is always

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.950
a useful form in which
to write this F dot n dA.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.620
OK, and then we substituted
and computed it.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.280
And Green's theorem tells
us that the two integrals

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.600
have to be equal to each other.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.450
And indeed, for this particular
F and this particular C,

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.084
we verified that in this
case they both give us pi.

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:53.750
And, of course, Green's
theorem tells us

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.125
that that would have been
true, that they would have come

00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:58.160
out the same, regardless
of what the choice of F

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.620
and the choice of C
that we made were.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.296
So I'll stop there.
