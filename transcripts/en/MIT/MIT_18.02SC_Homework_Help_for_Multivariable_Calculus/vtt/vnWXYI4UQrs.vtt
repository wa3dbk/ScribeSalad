00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.600
Hi.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.110
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.630
In lecture you've been
learning about vector calculus,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.570
Stokes' theorem, all sorts of
cool stuff like that, curl.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.920
So I have a nice
problem here for you.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.980
So let F be the
following vector field.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.000
So it's the vector
field whose direction

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.620
is x i hat plus y
j hat plus z k hat,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.030
but in addition I want to
multiply it by rho to the n.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.760
So this is your usual rho
from spherical coordinates.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.350
This is the square
root of x squared

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.610
plus y squared plus z squared.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.130
And n can be any number.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.610
So it might be positive,
it might be negative,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.940
it might be 0, doesn't
have to be an integer.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.040
Some number, though,
it's some constant.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.320
So what I'd like you to do is
to show that for this field,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.600
regardless of what the
value of n happens to be,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.220
that it is a gradient field.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.370
So it is the gradient
of some function.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.122
So why don't you pause the
video, have a go at that,

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:01.830
come back and we can
work on it together.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.420
So recall that for something to
be a gradient field, what that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.130
means-- well, first
of all, that means

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.700
that there is some function
that has it as the gradient,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.010
and we know a lot of other
characterizations of it.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.610
And one of them that we
know involves the curl.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.520
So let's talk about that one.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.245
So in order to look at
the curl of this field,

00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:31.120
I'm going to want to
take partial derivatives

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.300
of its components.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.910
And so I'm going to want to
take partial derivatives of rho.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:43.430
So let's just remember or
recall that partial rho

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.230
partial x equals x over rho.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.760
And similarly, partial rho
partial y is y over rho.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.650
And partial z partial--
sorry, partial rho partial z

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.720
is z over rho.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.440
So you can just check that using
the fact that you know what rho

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.050
is.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.720
Et cetera.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.020
I'm going to write et
cetera because it's

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.220
the same for the other two.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.540
So let's call-- for
shorthand-- let's call F,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.380
M*i plus N*j plus P times k.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.720
So M, N, and P are
its components.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.270
If F is this, then
we know that curl F

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.580
is equal to-- what is it?

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.200
So it's P, the y-th
partial derivative of P,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.900
minus the z-th partial
derivative of N,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.250
i hat, plus-- OK, so it's the
z-th partial derivative of M

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.360
minus the x-th partial
derivative of P, j hat, plus--

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.380
it's going to be,
what's the last one?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.200
The x partial derivative of N,
minus the y partial derivative

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.480
of M, k hat.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.080
So if this is our
formula for F, then this

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.870
is our formula for
the curl of F. And OK,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.050
so now we just have to compute
these various different partial

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.720
derivatives in order to
see what the curl is.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.630
And then hopefully that'll tell
us something about this field.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.200
So let's see.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.040
So P_y.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.540
In our case, so M is equal to
rho to the little n times x.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.000
Big N is equal to rho
to the little n times y.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.140
And big P is equal to rho
to the little n times z.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.030
So let's look at
our components here.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.590
So P sub y-- well, z is a
constant with respect to y.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.340
So this is just rho to the n.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.990
Well, z times the y-th
partial of rho to the n.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.750
So that's by the
chain rule, so we

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:23.110
got n rho to the n minus 1
times y over rho times z.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:34.450
So we can rewrite this as
n*y*z rho to the n minus 2.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:42.350
And similarly-- so
that was P sub y,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.730
so let's look at N sub z.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.000
So N is rho to the n times y.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.780
So you take the z-th partial
derivative, so y is a constant.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.460
So we need to look at the
z-th partial derivative of P

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.960
to the n.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.720
So this is, again,
it's n-- sorry,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.130
I think I said P to the n.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.360
But of course this isn't
a P, this is a rho.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.600
So it's n rho to the n minus 1
times partial rho partial z--

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.610
so that's z over rho-- times y.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:25.490
And again, this is equal to
n*y*z rho to the n minus 2.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.780
OK, so P sub y,
the y partial of P,

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.160
is n*y*z rho to the n minus 2.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.930
And the z partial of n is
n*y*z rho to the n minus 2.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.422
And they're the same.

00:05:41.422 --> 00:05:42.380
So what does that mean?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.890
So that means the first
component of curl of F is 0.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.670
So if you do a little
bit more arithmetic

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.310
of exactly the same
sort-- you have two more

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.510
components to check--
what you're going to find

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.550
is that the other
ones are 0 also.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.030
I'm not going to do out all
those partial derivatives

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.340
for you, but I trust that you
can compute the similar looking

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.610
partial derivatives that appear
in these other two components--

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.340
this j should have had a hat--
the other partial derivatives

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.610
that appear in these components
and show that they're all also

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.260
equal to 0.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:29.360
So in our case, curl of F is
just equal to the zero vector.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.670
OK, great.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.840
So what does that mean?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.000
Well, we want to show that
something is a gradient field.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.580
So we know that we can do that.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.185
We know that that happens
precisely when its curl is 0,

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:50.790
if it's defined on a
simply connected domain.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.280
On a simply connected region.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.090
So we know that a function
is a gradient field

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.570
if it's defined on a
simply connected domain

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.320
and has curl 0.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.720
Well, let's see.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.700
So where is this thing defined?

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.130
Where is F defined?

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:11.260
Well, if n is bigger than
or equal to 0-- well,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.205
I guess I want strictly
bigger than 0 just

00:07:13.205 --> 00:07:14.400
to be on the safe side.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.260
If n is positive, this
is defined everywhere

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.300
and we're great.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.230
If n is negative, then
we have a problem at 0.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.420
Because then we have
division by rho.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.560
So we don't want to divide by 0.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.560
So if n is negative, there's
a problem at the origin.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.250
So in the worst case,
F is defined everywhere

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.100
except the origin.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.320
But that's simply connected.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.340
Because we're in space.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.715
If we were in the plane, this
would be a different story.

00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:44.519
But in space, just
removing a point

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:46.060
doesn't destroy
simply connectedness.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.030
So this field F is
defined everywhere,

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.090
except the origin
perhaps, so we're

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.700
in a simply connected region.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.210
So when you have curl F in
a simply connected region,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.520
your field is, in
fact, a gradient field.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.105
Now I leave it as
an exercise to you

00:08:02.105 --> 00:08:04.290
to come up with the
actual function,

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.651
or one of the actual functions,
of which this is a gradient.

00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.400
But we've just shown
that because its curl

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.320
is 0, and because it's defined
in a simply connected region

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.750
of space, that this field
really is the gradient field

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.760
of some function.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.401
So I'll stop there.
