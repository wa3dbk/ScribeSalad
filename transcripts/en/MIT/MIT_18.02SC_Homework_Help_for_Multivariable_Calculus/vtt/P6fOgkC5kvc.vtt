CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.390
In this video, I
really just want

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.930
to practice matrix
multiplication, which

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.830
is potentially something
new for some of you,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.996
and maybe some of you have
been doing it for a while

00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:19.044
and are very good at it.

00:00:19.044 --> 00:00:21.460
But I want to make sure that
everyone is feeling confident

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.550
in their ability to
multiply matrices.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.170
So we have three matrices here.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.650
We have A, B, and C. And
what I want you to do

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.370
is I want you to compute
what makes sense below.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.140
I have four products
of matrices below.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.060
a is A times B, b is B
times A, c is B times C,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.560
and d is A times
C. So I want you

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.780
to multiply the matrices
that make sense to multiply,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.260
and then the ones that don't,
make sure you understand why.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.960
Give yourself a
brief explanation

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.620
of why you can't multiply them.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.737
So why don't you work on
that, pause the video,

00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:01.570
and when you feel
confident in your answers,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.236
bring the video back up, and you
can check them against my work.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.610
OK, welcome back.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.320
Well, we wanted to make sure
we felt comfortable multiplying

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.310
matrices.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.530
So what we're going to do
is look at the four products

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.870
I mentioned below, and we're
going to see how they do,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.840
whether or not we can
actually compute them.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.660
So let's first look
at a, which was

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.120
A times B. So before
I write it down again,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.320
A times B is-- notice A is a
2 by 2 matrix, and B is a 2

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.360
by 3 matrix, right?

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.870
And so if I write letter
a, we know we're taking a 2

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.350
by 2 by a 2 by 3.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.570
And so the fact that the
interior dimensions agree,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.450
that the number
of columns of A is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.130
equal to the number
of rows of B,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.700
means that I can multiply them.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.510
So I can multiply them, and
my result I expect to get

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.460
is, of course, the dimensions
we have on the outside.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.940
So I expect to get
a 2 by 3 matrix.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.310
So I'm going to
rewrite A and B here,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.810
so that I don't have to
keep walking back and forth,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.440
and then we'll do
the multiplication.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:26.900
So I have [6, 5; 1, 2]
times [2,  -1, 3; 1, 0, 4].

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.760
OK.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.880
So I want to perform
this multiplication.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.200
Now remember that
when you are looking

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.110
for a value in your resulting
matrix, which I know is 2 by 3,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.780
so I can even make a
little space for myself.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.495
I know it's 2 by 3,
so I know I'm going

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:45.130
to have to fill in these spots.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.880
When I look at this position,
it's row 1, column 1.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.870
That means I take row
1 of the first matrix,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.680
and I'm essentially
just dotting it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.380
with column 1 of
the second matrix.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.630
So I'm taking row 1 times column
1 in the way it was described,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.910
which is I take 6 times 2,
and I add it to 5 times 1.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.810
So row 1, column 1 gives me
6 times 2 is 12, plus 5 times

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.380
1 which is 5, so I get 17.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.620
And then if I come in to
the next spot, what is this?

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.850
And the resulting matrix's
position is row 1, column 2.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.000
So now I take row 1
of the first matrix

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.550
and column 2 of
the second matrix,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.190
and I get 6 times negative 1
is negative 6, plus 0 times 5,

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.050
so I get a negative 6 here.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.815
Negative 6 times 0.

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:36.190
Maybe I should
show you this way.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.150
Negative 6 times 0.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.170
OK.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.860
And then here I am now in the
third spot of the first row,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.060
so I'm in a row 1, column 3.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.370
So that's again, row 1 of the
first, column 3 of the second.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.894
So you see a pattern here about
where we're getting our things

00:03:51.894 --> 00:03:53.060
from that we're multiplying.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.540
For row 1, column
3 of the resulting,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.600
I take row 1 of the first
and column 3 of the second.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.580
So 6 times 3 is 18,
plus-- 5 times 4 is 20.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.920
So 20 plus 18 is 38.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.284
OK.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.200
Now I have to do the
same thing on the bottom.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.339
Right?

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:16.380
So I have now here, the
row, notice I'm in row 2,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.470
so I'm always going to use
row 2 of this first matrix.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.370
And then what we
saw last time is I

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.400
used column 1 in the
first spot, column 2

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.430
in the second spot, column
3 in the third spot.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.930
Right?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.596
That's what happens
over and over again.

00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:28.440
So what do I do?

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.760
I take [1, 2], and I
multiply it by [2, 1].

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.570
So I take 1 times
2, plus 2 times 1.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.290
So I get 2 there and
2 there, so I get a 4.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.970
And then the next
column: row 2, column 2.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.235
1 times negative 1 is
negative 1-- 2 times 0

00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:50.420
is 0-- so I get a negative 1.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.010
And then the last column.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.620
1 times 3 is 3.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.200
2 times 4 is 8.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.230
So I get 3 plus 8, so I get 11.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.980
Hopefully I didn't make any
stupid summing mistakes there,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.750
but if I did, you
probably caught it.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.010
Because I was trying to
say what I did as we went.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.191
So that is the answer to a.

00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:09.690
OK.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.460
So now let's think
about what is b.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.880
b was take B times A, which
is just to switch the order.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.690
So let's look at the
dimension match-up.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.250
Now we have a 2 by
3 matrix, and I'm

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.730
trying to multiply it
by a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.720
Well, I don't have
to do any more work,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.950
because I can't do it.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.880
Because the dimensions of the
insides here-- three columns

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.880
for B, two rows for A--
means that I can't actually

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.920
multiply them.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.420
OK?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.320
So this isn't even defined.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.460
OK, so that was easy.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.470
That was b.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.790
All right.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.950
Letter c-- I'll give
myself a lot of room

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.805
to do that-- letter
c was B times C.

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:56.680
And so I'm going to
write down the dimensions

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.350
to see if I even need to
write down the matrices.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.670
B was two rows by
three columns, and C

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.170
was three rows by two columns.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.270
So if I look at the dimensions,
the 3 and the 3 match up,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.020
so I am going to be
able to multiply them,

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.910
and my result-- as I mentioned
before-- should be a 2 by 2.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.480
So let me write
down B and C here,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.290
so we don't have to
keep going to the side.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.640
OK.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:40.370
And then C is 1, 2 negative
1; negative 1, 3, 2.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.930
All right, let me just make sure
I didn't transcribe anything

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.074
incorrectly.

00:06:45.074 --> 00:06:45.990
I think it looks good.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.630
OK.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:53.920
So row 1 of B. Row 2 of B.
Column 1 of C. Column 2 of C.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.060
We're going to be dealing
with those, specifically.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.650
So we want to multiply these.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.320
We said our resulting matrix
is going to be 2 by 2.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.192
OK.

00:07:03.192 --> 00:07:04.900
Because I'm going to
have a lot of terms,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.720
I might write them down on
this one, and then simplify.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.990
Because I may make a mistake,
so to be more careful,

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.320
I'll write down all the pieces.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.630
So here I am in row 1,
column 1 of the resulting.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.130
So I take row 1 of the first,
column 1 of the second,

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.360
and what do I get
when I multiply?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.180
I get 2 times 1-- that's 2.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.830
Plus negative 1 times
2-- that's negative 2.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.261
Plus 3 times negative
1-- that's negative 3.

00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:31.760
Right?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.440
That's all we have to do
for the first position.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.420
Then I do, for the second
one, it's row 1, column 2.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.289
So I do row 1, column 2.

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:42.080
So I'll try to keep my
head out of the way.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.538
I realize I keep
stepping in front.

00:07:43.538 --> 00:07:45.410
So it's 2 times negative 1.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.540
I get negative 2.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.690
Negative 1 times 3,
so I get negative 3.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.800
And 3 times 2 gives me 6.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.960
OK.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.900
And then the bottom two.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.050
I get row 2, column
1 over here, and then

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.220
row 2, column 2 over here.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.310
So row 2, column 1 is
going to be 1 times 1.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.250
Plus 0 times 2.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:18.130
Plus 4 times negative
1, so I get negative 4.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.120
And then here.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.240
Row 2, column 2.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.400
I get 1 times negative
1, so I have negative 1.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.230
Plus 0 times 3-- plus 0.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.820
And then 4 times 2 is 8.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.500
So if I simplify these, it
looks like in the first spot

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.830
I should get a negative 3.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.030
And the second spot,
I should get a 1.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.160
This is just for you
to check your answer.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.240
And the third spot,
I get a negative 3.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.320
And then the fourth
spot, I get a 7.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.120
So hopefully I added
correctly all throughout.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.490
I think I did, so I
think we're good there.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.570
So that is the answer to c.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.860
And again, the reason
we can multiply those,

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.310
was that the dimensions-- when
you wrote them down in order--

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.840
the dimensions to
the inside agreed,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.460
and then the outside
gives us the size

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.140
of the resulting matrix.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.570
So there was one more
problem, and that was d.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.960
And I wanted you to take A
times C. And A was a 2 by 2.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.710
And C was a 3 by 2.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.360
And so again, we
see we can't do it,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.710
because the two
interior dimensions

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.240
here-- when I write them in
that order-- don't agree.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:33.740
OK.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.010
So d is not defined.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:43.930
All right, so the basic
idea of this whole video

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.160
is just to make sure we
felt comfortable multiplying

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.890
matrices.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.440
We're trying to use some simple
examples to understand that.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.730
Understand how we can
recognize from the dimensions

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.540
whether or not multiplication
is even defined,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.550
and then what size the
resulting matrix will be.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.550
I do want to point
out one thing.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.970
And I want to point out that
if we come over to our example

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.000
back in the beginning.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.350
We had A*B as our first example
and then B*A as our second

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.350
example.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.130
And A*B-- well, I think, I got
to remember what they were--

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.250
yeah, A*B you could multiply,
but B*A you could not.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.340
So I think it has
been stressed before,

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.190
but I think I should
stress it again, that order

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.850
matters in multiplication.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:29.350
OK?

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.641
You can't commute these things.

00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:33.860
You can't switch the order
and get the same result.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.470
So matrix
multiplication, you have

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.960
to be very careful about
keeping things in the same order

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.770
as you're multiplying.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.730
OK, I think that is
where I will stop.
