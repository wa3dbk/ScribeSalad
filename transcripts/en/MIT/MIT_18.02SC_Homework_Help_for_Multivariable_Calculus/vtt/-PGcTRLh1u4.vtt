CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.650
In this video, I'd like
to do two problems that

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.720
ask us to determine the flux of
a vector field along a surface.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.890
So the first one is
I'd like you to find

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.240
the outward flux of the
vector z comma x comma

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.110
y through the piece of
the cylinder that's shown.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.930
So it's just shading
the cylindrical part.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.820
So it's a cylinder of
radius a, and you're

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.390
taking the piece in the
first octant up to height h.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.565
So that's the first question
I'd like you to answer,

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:37.690
is the flux of this vector
field through that piece

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.730
of the cylinder,
the outward flux.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.230
And then I'd also like you to
find the outward flux of this

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.480
vector field x*z comma y*z comma
z squared through the piece

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.990
of the sphere of radius
a in the first octant.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.069
So again, it will be
in the first octant,

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:53.610
like this one is in
the first octant.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.151
It'll be the piece
of the sphere that

00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:58.500
sits in the same part of
three-dimensional space

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.780
as the piece of the cylinder
we're looking at here.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.196
So what I'd like
you to do, again,

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:04.180
is just find the
flux-- in both cases,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.150
the outward flux-- of the vector
listed through the surface that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.711
is listed.

00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:11.710
And then when you feel
comfortable and confident

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.819
with your answer, you can
bring the video back up

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:15.110
and I'll show you how I did it.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.016
OK, welcome back.

00:01:25.016 --> 00:01:26.390
So again, what
we're trying to do

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.070
is determine flux of a vector
field through a surface.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.140
So I am going to determine
first what the normal is here,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.190
and then what F dot
n is here, and then

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.150
using the fact
that I know F dot n

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.840
and I know dS in a
good parametrization,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.215
I'm going to be
able to calculate

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:45.380
the integral quite simply.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.940
So let's point out
first, that the normal

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.420
at any point on the
surface is going

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.360
to be equal to x comma
y comma 0 divided by a,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.440
where a is, again, the radius.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.390
Because in the normal, I
know there's no z-component.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.620
And I actually know it's
the same as the normal would

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.100
be on a circle of radius a.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.470
And so this vector x comma
y has length a obviously,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.450
so that's why I'm dividing by a.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.000
So when I look at the
normal and I dot it with F,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.930
let's see what I get.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:30.310
F dotted with the normal
is going to be x*z plus x*y

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.390
divided by a, right?

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.365
So I just took x dotted
with x times z, y times z,

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.190
and 0 times y, I add
those up, and I still

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.620
have to divide by my a.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.129
So that's actually the vector
dotted with the normal.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.170
Now, what's a natural
parametrization to use here

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.878
is obviously the
cylindrical coordinates,

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:50.680
because I'm on a cylinder.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.410
The radius is fixed.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.127
But what I'm interested in is
changes in theta and changes

00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:55.710
in the height.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.430
So I'm going to be
interested in d theta and dz,

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.180
and I need to understand
what dS in this case is.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.850
And it's just a d theta dz.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.100
So let me write
down what I'm going

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.970
to need to completely determine
the rest of number one

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.460
is I'm integrating
over the surface.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.464
And I'll put the
bounds momentarily.

00:03:16.464 --> 00:03:17.880
Actually, I should
also point out,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.540
I'm going to write x
and y in terms of theta,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.480
because now I know
what they are.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.480
x in terms of theta is a cosine
theta, and y in terms of theta

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.480
is a sine theta.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.400
So when I simplify the
expression F dot n,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.380
I get z times cosine theta
for my first component.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.810
And I get a times
cosine theta sine

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.210
theta for my second component.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.510
So let me maybe point
out again how I got that.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.190
Let me come over here.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.040
x is a cosine theta.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.040
So I get z times a cosine
theta divided by a.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.502
So I get z times cosine theta.

00:04:00.502 --> 00:04:04.080
x again is a cosine
theta. y is a sine theta.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.555
So I get a squared
cosine theta sine theta.

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:09.920
And I divide by a, so I get
a single a cosine theta sine

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.640
theta.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.777
And then my dS, as I mentioned
before, is a d theta dz, right?

00:04:18.777 --> 00:04:21.110
And so now I just have to
figure out the bounds in theta

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.050
and the bounds in z.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.060
Well, the bounds
in z are very easy.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.400
The bounds in z
are simply 0 to h,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.870
and so I'm going to put
those here on the outside.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.310
And then the bounds in theta.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.640
Maybe it's helpful to come
over and look at my picture.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.130
This direction, in the
x-direction, is theta equals 0.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.980
When I swing around
to the y-direction,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.870
I'm at theta equals pi over 2.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.205
So I need to go from
0 to pi over 2, right?

00:04:51.205 --> 00:04:52.455
So let me come back over here.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.100
OK, so now, really,
I have a couple

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.480
of constants that are letters,
but everything now, I'm

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.420
ready to integrate.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.800
So a is just a constant,
and h is a constant,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.420
and z and theta
are my variables,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.800
and I can actually do this
integration quite simply.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.342
I'm not going to do
it because I know

00:05:11.342 --> 00:05:13.758
this is at this point something
we already know how to do,

00:05:13.758 --> 00:05:15.030
but I'll give you the answer.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.770
So let me write down the answer.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:26.230
You get a h squared over
2, plus a squared h over 2.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.500
So that's the solution
you actually get.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.524
So again, I mean, you have to
integrate in d theta first.

00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:33.940
So you have to deal with this,
you have to deal with this,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.580
and this uses a
good trig identity.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.070
You can use the fact
that 2 sine theta cosine

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.930
theta is sine 2 theta.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.832
I'll give you that
little hint, and then you

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:44.040
can figure it out from there.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.100
And then you integrate in z,
and you evaluate from 0 to h.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.500
So that's the solution
to number one.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.900
So now, let's look
at number two.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.980
In number two, we
have to again figure

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.415
out-- we have our vector field
and we know our surface is

00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:02.910
a piece of a sphere.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.410
And so if we're
going to parametrize

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.270
the surface of a
sphere, we know we want

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.270
to use d theta and d phi, OK?

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.395
And let me point out first,
that again, the normal is going

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:16.090
to be in some ways similar to
what we saw on the cylinder,

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.450
but now instead of x comma y
comma 0, because it's a sphere,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.770
it's going to be x comma
y comma z divided by a.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.360
So again, as before, let me
just point out the normal

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.190
that I'm going to be using
is x comma y comma z,

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.420
all divided by a.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.800
So I'm going to dot F with n
and look at the surface integral

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.250
with respect to dS--
d capital S there--

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.890
and I'll see what I get.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.490
So again, I know how I'm going
to parametrize this sphere.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.490
I already mentioned it,
but let me say it again.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.584
It's going to be in
theta and phi, right?

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:54.000
Because we have a
constant radius.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.610
We're on a sphere of radius a.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.970
So I don't need to change rho.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.370
It's a two-dimensional thing.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.620
So theta is varying
and phi is varying.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.220
So let's see what we get first.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.220
Let me do a little work
and see what we get when

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.170
we look at F dotted with n.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.710
So let me first point out
that F dotted with n looks

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.940
like it's x squared
z plus y squared

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.970
z plus-- just to
make this obvious-- z

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.850
squared z, all divided by a.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.860
x squared plus y squared plus
z squared is a squared, right?

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.750
So it's actually a squared
times z divided by a.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.460
So it's just a times z, right?

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.860
So far, all I've done was
I dotted F with the normal,

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.280
and I knew the fact that x
squared plus y squared plus z

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.030
squared was a squared, because
I was on a sphere of radius a.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.920
So a squared times z
divided by a is a times z.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.880
And now, if I want to use
the right coordinates,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.510
think about theta and phi.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.280
z is a cosine phi.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.440
So F dot n in the
coordinates I'm interested in

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.990
is going to be a
squared cosine phi.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.760
So let me get out of the
way so you can see that.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.364
So that's what our
F dot n will be.

00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:12.780
And now, if we're going to
figure out the flux, of course,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.560
it's the integral of F dot n dS.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.200
And let's remind
ourselves what dS is.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:28.320
dS is going to be a squared
sine phi d theta d phi.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.270
You saw this in
lecture, actually, also.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.270
So this should look familiar.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.410
And so now I just have
to integrate F dot n

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:38.910
dS over the right bounds
for theta and phi.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.426
So let's determine
what those are.

00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:42.050
I'll put everything
together, and we'll

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.160
determine what those are.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.950
So I've got F dot n dS.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:55.370
That's going to be a to the
fourth sine phi cosine phi

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.830
d theta d phi.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.110
And let's think about
what is the picture

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.570
that I need in terms of the
first octant of a sphere.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.460
Maybe I should draw a
quick picture over here

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.800
so we can remember
what that looks like.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.921
So it's going to
be-- this is not

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:16.920
going to be the greatest
drawing ever-- but it's

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.500
something like this.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.310
And so I've got pieces of
a circle at each level.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.704
I've got a piece
of a circle, right?

00:09:25.704 --> 00:09:27.870
If this is the x-direction,
this is the y-direction,

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.190
and this is the z-direction,
theta is going from 0-- again--

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:40.310
to pi over 2, and phi is going
from 0 to pi over 2, right?

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.060
So they're both going
from 0 to pi over 2.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.400
So hopefully, you were able
to get this far at least,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.320
in terms of figuring
out the flux of F

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.490
through that piece
of the sphere.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.100
And I'm, again, just going
to write down the solution,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.790
and then you can check your
answer against the solution.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.930
And I got a to the
fourth over 4 times pi.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.900
So this whole solution
is a to the fourth

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.270
divided by 4 times pi.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.232
So you can check
your solution there.

00:10:13.232 --> 00:10:14.690
Again, I want to
point out, what we

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.110
did in both of these
problems is we were trying

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:21.070
to compute the flux of a certain
vector field through a surface.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.860
And if you'll notice, what
I actually did in this case

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:30.090
is I kept the parametrization in
terms of the x, y, z variables

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.040
first, and then I put it
in the parametrization

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.550
of theta and phi after.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.540
And that made it a little easier
to hang on to and figure out

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.040
what it was.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.470
Because notice, that x, y,
and z become very complicated

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.070
in theta and phi.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.780
I have to write a lot
more down, I guess.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.590
And then simplify
things more carefully.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.760
This way, it was very obvious
that I got an a squared times

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.030
z in the numerator.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.030
So sometimes it's
a little easier

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.650
to compute the F dot n in the
initial x, y, z variables,

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.320
and then change it to the
appropriate parametrization

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.887
for the surface
you're looking at.

00:11:01.887 --> 00:11:03.220
So that's what we did, actually.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.140
In both cases we
computed F dot n,

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.550
we put it in the
right parametrization,

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.340
and then we had to
figure out what dS was.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.220
We had to make sure
we knew dS, and then

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.440
we just had to integrate
over the appropriate bounds

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.670
for our parameters.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.230
And that's giving us the
flux across the surface.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.915
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
