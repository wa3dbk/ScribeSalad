CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.220
In this video I would like
us to use Green's theorem

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.140
to compute the
following integral,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.790
where it's the integral
over the curve C,

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.140
where C is the
circle drawn here.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.020
So the circle is oriented so
the interior is on the left

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.320
and it's centered at the point
where x equals a, y equals 0.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.620
So the integral-- you can read
it but I will read it also

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.320
for you-- it's the integral of 3
x squared y squared dx plus 2 x

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.340
squared times the
quantity 1 plus x*y dy.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.090
So you are supposed
to use Green's theorem

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.180
to compute that.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.989
And why don't you
pause the video,

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.530
give it a shot, and then when
you're ready to see my solution

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.863
you can bring the video back up.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.040
OK, welcome back.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.050
Well, what we're
going to do, obviously

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.370
to use Green's theorem
to compute this--

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.690
because I gave you a big
hint that you're supposed

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.160
to use Green's
theorem, because we

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.990
have an integral
over a closed curve.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.580
And what we're
going to do is now

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.250
take the integral of another
certain integrand-- obviously

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.080
related in some way to
this-- over the region

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.000
that I will shade here.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.400
So we're interested in
this shaded region now.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.075
So let me write down what
Green's theorem is and then

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:25.450
we'll put in the
important parts.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.050
OK, so just to remind you, I'm
not going to write down all

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.010
the hypotheses of Green's
theorem that we need,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.770
but the point that I want
to make is that if we start

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.800
the integral over this closed
curve C of M*dx plus N*dy we

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.290
can also integrate over the
region that C encloses of N sub

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.660
x minus M sub y dy dx.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.500
So that is ultimately
what we're going to do.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.400
And so in this case
again, as always,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.470
M is going to be the function
associated with the dx portion.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.270
It's the i-th component
of the vector field.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.970
And N is going to be the
function associated here

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.880
with the dy.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.830
That's standard obviously.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.455
So now what we want
to do is transform

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:18.746
what we have there into
something that looks like this.

00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:20.810
So the region-- I'm just
going to keep calling it

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.570
R for the moment-- but the
region R, you'll notice,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.790
is the thing that I
shaded in the drawing.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.420
And so now let's compute
what this is-- well

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.110
you have the
capacity to do that.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.090
That's just some straight
taking derivative.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.677
So I'm just going to write down
what it is and not show you

00:02:38.677 --> 00:02:39.760
all the individual pieces.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.727
So I'll just write
down what you get

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:43.060
and then the simplified version.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.120
So you get 6 x squared
y plus 4x is N sub x.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.080
And then M sub y is
negative 6 x squared y.

00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:57.360
And I'm going to call dy*dx, I'm
just going to refer to it now

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.510
as dA, because that makes
it a lot easier to write.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.735
Oh, I guess I should call this--
well, dA, this is the area.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.460
The volume form there.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.440
So this simplifies and I
just get the integral of 4x

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.590
over this region dA.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.760
Now this-- you saw
an example of this

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.220
in lecture of how to deal
with these types of problems.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.470
At this point, if
I really wanted to,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.675
I could figure out what the
bounds are in that region

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:32.420
R in terms of x and y, and
I could do a lot of work

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.380
and integrate it all, or I
could remember one simple fact.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.820
Which is that if
I have-- I think

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.140
you see it in class as x
bar-- the center of mass

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.770
should be equal to
1 over the volume

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:57.887
of the region times the integral
of x dA over the region.

00:03:57.887 --> 00:03:58.720
That's what we know.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.803
This should be-- this maybe
doesn't look like a V.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:03.330
But so in this case,
volume is area, isn't it?

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.720
Maybe I should write area,
that might make you nervous.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.635
So if I take the area--
I could just say A of R--

00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:12.240
if I take the area,
1 over the area,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.200
and then I multiply by the
integral of x over R with

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.040
dy*dx, with respect to dA,
then I get the center of mass.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.150
Well, let's look at what--
in this picture, what

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.380
is the center of mass here?

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.670
If I want to balance this
thing on a pencil tip,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.157
if I want to balance this
disc-- assuming the density is

00:04:32.157 --> 00:04:33.740
everywhere the same--
on a pencil tip,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.660
where am I going
to put the pencil?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.520
I'm going to put it
right at the center.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.330
The x-value there is a,
the y-value there is 0.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.970
So if I had the y center
of mass, I would want 0.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.750
But I want the x center
of mass, so I want a.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.540
This x bar is actually
equal to, from the picture,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.720
is equal to a.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.380
And now let's notice
what I've done.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.420
I have taken-- I had
this quantity here-- I've

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.230
taken this quantity
except for the 4

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.320
and I have a way of
writing explicitly

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.200
what this quantity
is without actually

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.240
doing any of the integration.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.540
I haven't done any sophisticated
things at this point

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.030
except know what the
center of mass is.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.310
So also what is the
area of the region?

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.320
I'm going to need that.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.730
The area of the region--
it's a circle of radius a.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.840
So the area is pi a squared.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.810
So this quantity
is pi a squared.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.870
And all this together tells me
that the integral of x over R

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.690
dA, if I solve for this part,
I get a times pi a squared.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.650
So I get pi a cubed.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.000
And that only differs from
our answer by one thing.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.785
There's a scalar--
you multiply by 4

00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:49.270
and that gives us what we want.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.561
I said differs from our answer.

00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:52.510
Differs from what we
want by one thing.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.710
We just multiplied by 4 there,
so we multiply by 4 here.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.360
So in fact-- maybe there looks
like there was a little magic

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.740
here, so let me point out some
of the key points at the end.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.270
I started off knowing I
was trying to integrate 4x

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.590
over the region R.
And R in this case

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.520
was a circle centered at
(a, 0) and of radius a.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.960
And then I said, well, I
don't want to do a lot of work

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.460
for this.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.112
So I'm going to
not cheat, but I'm

00:06:21.112 --> 00:06:23.070
going to use my knowledge
of the center of mass

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.940
to make this easier.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.490
So the center of
mass is equal to 1

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.940
divided by the area of the
region times the integral of x

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.140
over the region.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.670
So I want to find the
integral of x over the region,

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.550
I just solve for the integral
of x over the region.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.450
I just solve for that part.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.672
The center of mass-- from
just looking at the picture

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:43.380
and understanding what
the center of mass

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.480
means-- the center of mass
in the x component is a.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.100
The area is pi a squared.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.100
So I end up with
a pi a cubed when

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.860
I solve for the integral of x.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.900
And then because I wanted
the integral of 4x,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.930
I just multiply by 4.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.000
And so the final answer
is actually 4 pi a cubed.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.920
So what I was trying
to find, if you

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.460
remember, was I was
trying to find the value,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.710
when I integrated
over this curve,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.980
of a certain vector field.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.649
And that one was going to be a
little messy to do it that way.

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:21.190
But Green's theorem,
actually there's

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.250
a lot of cancellation
which makes it much easier,

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.630
and then the center of
mass is a nice little trick

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.580
to use at the end.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.070
And then the calculation
is quite simple.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.151
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
