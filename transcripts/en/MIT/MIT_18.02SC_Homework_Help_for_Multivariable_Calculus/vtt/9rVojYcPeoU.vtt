DAVID JORDAN: Hello,
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:10.130
The problem I'd like to work
on with you now is a long one.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.480
So it's going to be practice
computing line integrals.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.590
So to begin with, we have this
function of two variables.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.500
f is x to the fifth
plus 3x y cubed.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.240
And we have this-- C is
the upper semi-circle going

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.320
from (1, 0) to (-1, 0).

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.710
So it's this upper semi-circle
here that we often consider.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.240
And so the first
thing that we want

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.250
to do is to just compute
the gradient, capital F,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.730
to be the gradient
of this function f.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.540
And then parts b
through d, we're

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.890
going to compute this line
integral of this vector field

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.835
f along this curve C.
We're going to compute it

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:55.550
in three different ways.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.050
So first of all, we're going
to compute it directly,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.130
just using the definition.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.490
And then in Part c, we're going
to compute it using the path

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.630
independence of line
integrals and we're

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.600
going to replace the path
C with a simpler path.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.480
And then finally
in Part d, we're

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.390
going to use the fundamental
theorem of line integrals.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.402
Now when you do Part b,
what I want you to do

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:20.360
is set up the integral.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.070
You're going to get a very
complicated integral that I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.403
wouldn't want to try to compute.

00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:27.800
So just set up the integral
completely and then go ahead

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.807
and move on to Part c and d.

00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:31.890
So why don't you pause the
video and work on that,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.870
and we'll check back
in a few minutes

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.390
and we'll solve it together.

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:43.390
Welcome back.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.300
I hope you had some luck
working these problems.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.755
So let's do the easy one
first, computing the gradient.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.490
So for the gradient we just take
the two partial derivatives.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.920
So we get 5 x to the
fourth plus 3 y cubed.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.900
That's the partial derivative
in the x-direction,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:18.860
and in the y-direction,
we just get 9x y squared.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:33.330
So now for Part b, we're
asked to compute this integral

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.840
directly.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.530
So we have to recall
what it means.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.450
So first of all, if
we go back over here,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.930
we have this curve
C. And we need

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.800
to give a
parameterization for it,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.400
and so we're going to
introduce a parameterization

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.210
r of a variable
t, and we're going

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.490
to use that to do
our computations.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.794
So let's set r of t-- so
this is our usual circle

00:03:00.794 --> 00:03:02.710
that we're used to working
with, so we're just

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.961
going to take the usual
parameterization, cos t and sin

00:03:06.961 --> 00:03:07.460
t.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.500
And what's important is that
the range is going to be from t

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.130
equals 0 to t equals pi.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.860
It's t equals pi
because we don't

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.100
want to go all the
way around the circle.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.475
We just want to
go halfway around

00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:29.900
until we get to negative 1.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.090
So if that is r of t, then we
can compute the differential

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.910
dr of t.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.890
And so it's going to be
just taking the derivative.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:54.380
So we have negative
sin t and cos t dt.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.730
And so now we can just write
out this line integral directly.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.550
So the integral over
C of F dot dr just

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.810
becomes-- so we have the
integral from t equals 0 to pi.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.820
Those are the ranges
for our curve.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:26.220
And now we're going to take the
dot product of F, which was 5 x

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.990
to the fourth plus 3
y cubed, 9x y squared.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.430
We're just going to dot this
with our dr vector, which

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.910
is minus sin t, cos t.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.060
Altogether we have dt.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.910
And so now, notice
that here we've

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.930
got the variables x and y, and
here we've got the variables t,

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.540
but because of our
parameterization,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.265
we actually know
that, for instance, x

00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:59.580
is cos t and y is sin t.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.070
So we can write this all out.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:20.780
So we have 5 cos to the
fourth t plus 3 sine cubed t.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.990
So that's this guy
written out in terms of t.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.800
And then we multiply it
by a negative sine t.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.860
And then to that we add
the other component.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.210
So we have plus a 9.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.830
So we have cos t coming from
the x and another cos t here.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:55.480
So we have cos squared t, and
we have a sine squared t dt.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.810
OK, so that's what it
means to compute this line

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.518
integral directly,
and it's not something

00:05:59.518 --> 00:06:01.430
that I look forward to doing.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.999
So let's see if we can use
path independence to make

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:06.290
our lives a little bit simpler.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.860
So that's going to be c.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:21.520
So what we want to do is we want
to replace our original curve

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.630
C with any other curve that
has the same starting point

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.027
and the same ending point.

00:06:28.027 --> 00:06:29.610
And the curve that
I would like to use

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.554
is just a straight
line connecting them.

00:06:32.554 --> 00:06:34.720
There's lots of different
choices that you could do,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.280
but to me this one
seems the most natural.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.500
So let's give that a try.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:54.680
So let's let r of t be
the curve negative t, 0.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.280
Negative t because we want
it to run moving to the left.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:09.310
And then our range is just
going to be from minus 1 to 1.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.490
So when t is minus 1, then
we get minus the negative 1

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.900
and it starts at 1.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.030
And when t is 1 it
goes to negative 1.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.450
And notice that it goes
along the y equals 0 axis.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.540
So now we can do
the same computation

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.650
that we did before but
we can use this curve.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.960
So the thing that
I want to emphasize

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.000
is that if we're
computing a line

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.750
integral of a
gradient function--

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.600
so of a function which
is conservative--

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.270
then we can use any line
and we can use any path that

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.800
connects the two end points.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.857
We can replace our path.

00:07:47.857 --> 00:07:48.940
And so that's what we did.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.040
We replaced C_1 with C_2.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.710
So now this becomes
much easier in two ways.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.370
So we'll see.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.640
So our range now is just
t goes from minus 1 to 1.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:17.090
And so dr here is
just minus 1, 0.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:25.130
That's dr. And there's a dt.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.250
And let's see.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.790
So now F, we had
this value for F,

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.479
but notice that the y-coordinate
is always 0 along this curve.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.930
So the y-coordinate
being 0 means

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:54.990
that we just have 5 t to
the fourth and then 0 here.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.840
That's it, because we set
y to be 0 along this curve.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.990
So altogether this is a
very nice integral to do.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.880
So just taking this
dot product, all we

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.770
have is minus 5 t
to the fourth dt.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.370
That's simplified greatly.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:23.050
And we just have minus t to
the fifth from 1 to minus 1.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:28.410
And so we get simply minus 2.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.660
So that was a much, much
more straightforward integral

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.530
to do than the one
we started with.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:37.560
Now finally, in
d, we're suggested

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.010
to use the fundamental
theorem of line integrals.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.580
So let's remember
what that says.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:50.420
That says that if we have any
curve and the line integral

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:57.735
that we're taking-- if we know
that we're taking the line

00:09:57.735 --> 00:09:59.110
integral not of
any vector field,

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.970
but of a vector field which is
already the gradient of f, then

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.455
that tells us that
this is simply

00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:17.500
f of the endpoint minus f of
the starting point of our curve.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.350
So really we don't need
to do any integral at all.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.295
And so let's see.

00:10:25.295 --> 00:10:36.510
So recall that f was x to
the fifth plus 3x y cubed.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:44.680
And so the endpoint-- so we
just need to take f of (-1, 0)

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.660
and subtract f of (1, 0).

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:56.960
And so plugging this all
in together we get minus 1

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.090
minus a positive 1.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.050
Altogether we get minus 2.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.970
And, of course, this
does agree with what

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.100
we did when we computed
using the line integrals.
