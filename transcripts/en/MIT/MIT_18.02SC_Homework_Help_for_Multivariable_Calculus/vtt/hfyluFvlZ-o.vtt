JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.240
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.600
In lecture, you've learned
a little bit about the dot

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.148
product, and how
the dot product can

00:00:13.148 --> 00:00:14.898
be used to compute
angles between vectors,

00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:18.880
or the relationship between
the dot product of vectors

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.590
and the angle between them.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.870
So, here I have two questions,
two related questions for you.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.860
So the first one,
you've got two vectors.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.250
i hat plus j hat plus 2 k hat.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.075
And a second vector, 2 i
hat minus j hat plus k hat.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:36.400
I'm probably going to stop
saying the hats in a minute,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.205
just warning you.

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.390
So you've got these
two different vectors,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.340
and what I'd like to know is
what the angle between them is.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.000
And the second one is
that we have three points.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.760
So the P has coordinates
a, 1, and minus 1.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.890
Q has coordinates 0, 1, and 1.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.730
And R has coordinates
a, minus 1, and 3.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.940
So when you've
given three points,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.380
that define some angles.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.270
So what I'd like to know
is for which values of a

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.290
is the angle PQR a right angle?

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.195
So why don't you take some
time, work out these problems,

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:16.070
come back, and we can
work them out together.

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:26.510
Hopefully you had some
luck on these problems.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.380
Let's get started.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.220
Let's start with the first one.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.540
So we have these two vectors, i
plus j plus 2k, and 2i minus j

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.150
plus k.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.770
And we want to know
what the measure

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.202
of the angle between them is.

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:39.785
So the thing that
we have to use here,

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:42.090
is that for vectors
v and w, we know

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.740
that v dot w can
be written in terms

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.010
of the angle between them.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:02:02.000
So in particular, we know
that for vectors v and w,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.190
if the angle between
them is equal to theta,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.430
then cosine of theta
is equal to v dot w,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.360
but I have to divide
by the length of v

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.570
and the length of w.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.890
So I have this simple
formula for cosine

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.770
of theta in terms of v and w.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.900
And so then if we
want, we can find theta

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.550
by taking an arccosine.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.690
So let's apply this formula
in the case of problem a.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.790
So we could say that v is
equal to i plus j plus 2k,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.160
and w is equal to
2i minus j plus k.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:54.360
And so what that means is that
in our case, v dot w-- well,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.030
we just take, you know,
the products of the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.500
coordinates and add them up.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.190
So in that case, this is 1
times 2 plus 1 times minus 1

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.290
plus 2 times 1.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.740
So this is 1 times 2 plus 1
times minus 1 plus 2 times 1.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.910
So that's 2 minus 1 plus
2, so that's equal to 3.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.410
And so then we also need to
know what the length of v and w

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.550
are in order to
apply this formula.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.610
So the length of v is
equal to-- well it's

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.510
the square root of the sum of
the squares of the coordinates,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.845
or the square root of v dot
v. So in this case, that's

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:40.860
the square root of 1 squared
plus 1 squared plus 2 squared.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.150
So that's the square root of 6.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.660
And the length of w
is equal to-- it's

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.040
the square root of 2
squared plus minus 1

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.600
squared plus 1
squared, which is also

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.540
equal to the square root of 6.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.020
So if you put these
three things together,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.940
we have that cosine
of theta is equal--

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.270
so I'm going to write
it right up here

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.750
next to this
general formula just

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.710
to save a little bit of
space-- so in our case,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.435
this is equal to 3 divided
by the square root of 6

00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:17.560
times the square root of 6.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.390
So that's 3 divided by
6, which is equal to 1/2.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.490
So if cosine of theta
is equal to 1/2,

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.800
well we know that
that means that theta

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.150
is equal to pi over 3.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.790
OK?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:41.600
So the angle between these
two vectors is pi over 3.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.630
OK, great.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.870
That's part a.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.570
Now let's talk about part b.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.530
So we have these
three points and we

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.050
want to know for what values
is the angle that they

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.630
define a right angle.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.370
For what values
of this parameter.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.870
Right?

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.970
Our points depend on
this parameter, a.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.470
So in order to do that, we have
these three points in space.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.420
Let me draw a picture up here.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.120
So we have point P somewhere
and point Q somewhere and point

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.580
R somewhere, and they
define this angle,

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.500
and we want to know when
this angle is a right angle.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.140
Well, we don't have
any vectors yet,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.030
but it's easy to get
some vectors involved

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.810
in this problem.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.000
We can look at the
vectors QP and QR.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.300
So those two vectors
are the two sides

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.560
of this angle that
we're interested in.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.430
And it's easy when you're given
coordinates for points to find

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.520
the vector between them.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.360
So you just subtract, right?

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.480
So QP.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.010
In order to get from
our point Q over here--

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.210
in order to get from (0,
1, 1) to (a, 1, -1)-- well,

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.060
you have to increase the first
coordinate by a, the second

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.601
coordinate has to stay the same,
and the third coordinate has

00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:53.660
to decrease by 2.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:01.000
So this vector QP is
equal to [a, 0, -2].

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.055
So now I'm using angle brackets,
because this is a vector.

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:08.336
SPEAKER 1: Positive
2 or negative 2?

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:09.294
JOEL LEWIS: Negative 2.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.760
Yes.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.260
Right.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.160
Negative 2, yeah?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.230
Because we're going
from 1 to minus 1.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.680
OK, good.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.390
And similarly QR.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.630
So to get from Q to R-- I
have to go back and look

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.200
at the coordinates
over here-- so I

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.430
increase the first
coordinate by a,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.340
decrease the second
coordinate by 2,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.040
increase the third coordinate
by 2, to get from Q to R.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:43.450
So the vector QR is equal to
a-- what did I say-- minus 2, 2.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.920
So these are the
vectors QP and QR,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.262
and we want to know when the
angle between these two things

00:06:49.262 --> 00:06:49.970
is a right angle.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.880
We want to know when these
vectors are perpendicular.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.600
OK?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.820
So the two vectors are
perpendicular exactly when

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.050
their dot product is 0.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.060
Right?

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.580
When the angle is 90 degrees.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.440
Cosine of 90 degrees,
cosine of pi over 2 radians,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.010
is equal to 0, so those
two things are the same.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.615
The dot product equals 0
and the angle is 90 degrees.

00:07:16.615 --> 00:07:18.810
So OK.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:28.310
So in our case, we just have
to look then at QP dot QR.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.050
So that's equal to-- well,
we just take this dot product

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.030
here-- so it's equal to a
squared plus-- 0 times minus 2

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:41.540
is 0-- minus-- 2 times 2,
so plus minus 2 times 2-- so

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.600
that's minus 4.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.250
So that's a squared minus 4.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.430
And so this dot
product is equal to 0

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.620
exactly when a squared
minus 4 is equal to 0.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:58.080
So a squared minus 4 is equal
to 0 when a is equal to 2

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.470
or when a is equal to minus 2.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.970
So there are two
values of a for which

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.390
those three points form
a right angle at Q.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.650
So just to quickly summarize, we
used this general formula here

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.280
for the cosine of an angle
in terms of the two vectors

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.560
that are the sides of the angle.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.910
And with that formula, we
can compute the measure

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.725
of angles between
two vectors as here--

00:08:26.725 --> 00:08:29.750
or, as in the first
part, in part a.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.000
Or in a special case when we're
looking for a 90 degree angle,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.460
we can use the simplified
form when we just

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.520
need to figure out when the
dot product is equal to 0.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.140
OK.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.920
So I'll end there.
