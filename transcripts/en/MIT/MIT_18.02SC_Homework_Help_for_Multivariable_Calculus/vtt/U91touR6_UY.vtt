DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.300
So today, the problem I'd like
to work with you is about

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.120
taking partial derivatives in
the presence of constraints.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.160
So this is a pretty
subtle business.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.440
So take your time when you
work these problems.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.260
So what we have is we have this
function w, and it's a

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.020
function of four variables:
x, y, z, and t.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.490
OK?

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.230
But it's not really a function
of these four variables

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.890
because we have a constraint.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.380
So we want to study how w
changes as we vary the

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.190
parameters, except that
we have imposed

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.260
this constraint here.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.190
So that really we kind of only
have three variables, because

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.960
we have four variables
and one constraint.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.630
So that's what partial
derivatives with constraints

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.240
help us do.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.260
So let's explain first
the notation.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.810
OK?

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.450
So it says partial w partial
z, and then we have the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.790
subscripts x and y.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.320
So what's important about this
notation is not what you see

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.480
as much as what you don't see.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.950
What you don't see is
the variable t.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.660
OK?

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.340
So what this notation means is,
as always, the denominator

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.990
in our derivative expression--

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.045
partial z here-- that means
that we want to vary z.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.620
And we want to see how w
changes as we vary z.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.810
And the x and y here mean that
we want to keep x and y fixed.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.970
So if we didn't have a
constraint, this x and y here

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.770
would be superfluous.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.410
Because by partial derivative,
we always mean to keep the

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.510
other unlisted variables
unchanged.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.790
However, the fact that t is
missing here, it means that--

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.960
so if you think about it-- if we
vary z, and we keep x and y

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.820
fixed, then t also is varying.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.070
Right?

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.690
Because we have this
constraint here.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.995
And so it wouldn't make sense
for me to ask you to compute

00:02:04.995 --> 00:02:07.593
the partial derivative of w in z
varying x, y and t because--

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:08.843
excuse me--

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.680
keeping x, y, and t fixed,
because then there would be no

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.880
room for z to vary.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.070
OK?

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.880
So this notation means that z
is going to be allowed to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.020
vary, but it's going to vary
in a way that we're

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.840
just going to ignore.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780
So you will see how this works
out in the problem.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.550
So what we're really interested
in is making sure

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.810
that x and y stay fixed
and that z varies.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.540
And then we're going to need to,
when we do some algebra,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.470
we're going to need to get
rid of any mention of

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.250
the variable t.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.930
OK.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.380
So the first way that we're
going to work this out is

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.930
using total differentials.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.040
And I like to use total
differentials when I'm on new

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.830
ground because they're not
the most computationally

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.940
effective, because they involve
computing all the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.900
derivatives that we might
possibly need in sight.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.750
So they're not the most
efficient computationally.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.180
But if you go ahead and
compute the total

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.660
differentials, then all the
other computations that you

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.260
have to do are just
substitution.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.300
So it really just becomes linear
algebra, and that's

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.100
what I like about it.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.600
In part b, we'll see a shortcut
using implicit

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.340
differentiation and
the chain rule.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.810
And this is going to be
a little bit tricky.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.950
So we have these two equations,
we need to turn

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.480
them both into differential
equations.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.800
And so we'll do that using
a combination of implicit

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.300
differentiation and
the chain rule.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.440
So I'll let you pause the video
and get started on these

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.710
problems. And you can
check back and

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.960
we'll work it out together.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.990
OK, welcome back.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.260
So let's start by doing a, let's
start with problem a.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.520
So we have total differentials
is the suggested

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.290
way to attack this.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.230
So why don't we just start
computing the total

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.630
differentials that we know.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.590
So we have two equations.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.630
w in relation to the
other variables and

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.830
the constraint equation.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.570
And what we first want to do
is just take the total

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.080
differential of both of those
equations to get started.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.600
So we can take the first
one and it tells us

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.363
that dw is equal to--

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:24.560
OK so we have--

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:46.450
3x squared y dx, plus x cubed
dy, minus 2zt dz, minus z

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.820
squared dt.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.790
OK.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.280
Now right away, we can simplify
this equation.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.330
So this is the total
differential, but we have to

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.860
remember that in the setting
we're interested in, x and y

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.280
are held fixed.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.440
And so holding x and y fixed
means that the differentials

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.070
dx and dy are both set to 0.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.760
So that lets us rewrite this
first differential equation is

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:29.670
just dw equals minus 2zt
dz minus z squared dt.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.050
So that's our first equation
that we get.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.645
Let me just check with my
notes to make sure.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.510
That's right.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.330
OK.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.050
And so now, we have the
constraint equation from the

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.390
original statement
of the problem.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.640
And we need to take
its differential.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.530
So on the one hand, we
get x dy plus y dx.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.940
That's the total differential
of the left-hand side.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:11.110
And then on the right-hand side,
we have t dz plus z dt.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.750
OK?

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.020
And now we notice that now the
left-hand side of this

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.910
equation is just 0 for
the same reason.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.100
dy and dx are being
held fixed.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.260
So the relation that we end up
getting is we get that dt is

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:37.560
equal to minus t over
z dz by just doing

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.830
straightforward algebra.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.080
OK.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.532
So with that in hand now we
can-- so remember I mentioned

00:06:51.532 --> 00:06:52.120
in the beginning our goal
was-- so from the very

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.700
beginning, we knew that if we
varied z, because of our

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.950
constraint, we're going to be
forced to be varying t.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.850
And that's exactly what this
equation says, doesn't it?

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.840
We got this by just taking
the differential of the

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.140
constraint.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.840
And it says if you vary z,
you have to vary t in an

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.230
appropriate way, and
that's what this

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.340
coefficient tells us.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.870
So what we're really interested
in is how does w

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.460
vary in terms of z here.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.010
And so we want to get
rid of this dt here.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.060
And in fact, we can by
using the constraint.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:33.880
So combining this equation with
this equation, we get

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:41.453
that dw here is equal to--

00:07:41.453 --> 00:07:42.820
OK, so we have--

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.085
minus 2zt dz.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.820
And then we have--

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.035
minus--

00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:53.420
OK--

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.640
z squared times another
minus times t over

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.290
z, so this all becomes--

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:04.000
plus zt dz.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.250
So all I did is I plugged in for
dt using our formula here.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:18.840
And so this altogether is equal
to just minus zt dz.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.920
And that tells us that the
partial derivative that we're

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:31.520
after is just this coefficient,
right?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.780
The partial derivative is just
defined to be the coefficient

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.220
of the differential once you
work everything out.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.300
And so this is minus zt.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.350
OK, so that's a.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:53.080
So now let's see if we can use
some tricks to make the

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.075
computation a bit shorter.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.790
So the tricks that we're going
to use are implicit

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.880
differentiation and
the chain rule.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.650
So at the end of the
day-- excuse me--

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.330
we're interested in partial
w partial z.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.930
And what we're going to do is
use the chain rule to just

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.950
take a straightforward partial
derivative of our original

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:22.590
expression.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.450
So remember, w was x cubed
y minus zt squared.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.400
And so let's just take a partial
derivative of that in

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.650
the z-direction.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.095
So the partial derivative
in the z-direction of x

00:09:37.095 --> 00:09:38.450
cubed y is just 0.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.830
So that will go away.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:48.210
And so we only have minus,
we have a 2zt component.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.870
That's just because the partial
derivative of z

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.820
squared is 2z.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:58.060
And then we have another term
which is minus z squared, and

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.270
now we need to take the partial
derivative of t in the

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.520
z-direction.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.530
So, you know, often times when
we take partial derivatives of

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:27.240
one variable in terms of the
other, it's common to think

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.780
that the partial derivative of
one variable in terms of the

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.630
other is just 0.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.610
Because usually our variables
are independent.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.270
They don't vary in terms
of one another.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.950
But this is exactly a situation
where t does vary

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.630
depending on z, and so
we had to include

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.450
that into our notation.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.460
OK.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.290
So now this is almost what we
want, except we have this

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.400
mystery component here.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.160
And of course, there's only
one way we can solve this

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.100
mystery, which is the same way
we solved it in part a.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.350
We have to use the constraint.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:04.220
So let's take partial z of
our constraint equation.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.672
And remember, our constraint
equation was xy equals zt.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.880
OK.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.178
So if we take the partial
derivative of this equation,

00:11:16.178 --> 00:11:22.290
so if I take the partial
derivative x and y in terms of

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:28.210
z, then I do get 0, because
x and y are genuinely

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.790
independent from z.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.230
It's only t that depends on z.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.080
So on this side we get 0.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.370
Now, on the other side I just
need to use the product rule.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:55.590
So I get t, plus z partial
t partial z.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.730
OK?

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:08.060
So we can rewrite this as saying
that partial t partial

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.790
z is minus t over z.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.670
OK?

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.640
Now, you might notice that,
you know, this is formally

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.820
very similar to what we did in
part a, and of course, that's

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.290
no surprise.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.880
When we are manipulating using
implicit differentiation and

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.223
the chain rule, it's just a
compact way of doing what we

00:12:31.223 --> 00:12:32.740
were doing with the total
differentials.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.930
I mean, to me, the chain rule
is a computation which you

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.750
could prove by doing the
corresponding thing with total

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.720
differentials.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.920
And so we get this same
coefficient negative t over z,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.880
which you recall that
we got in part a.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.390
OK.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:59.990
So now we have, once again we
have this, two equations and

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.880
we just can do substitution.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:08.780
So we get that partial
w partial z is

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:15.592
equal to minus 2zt.

00:13:15.592 --> 00:13:21.500
And now again, we get minus
another minus, and z here

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.490
cancels the z squared,
so we get plus zt.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.400
And so we get minus zt.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.530
OK, and finally, if we remember
our assumptions, our

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.390
assumptions were that x and
y were independent of z.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.810
That was our notation.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.070
And we use that assumption
at this step right here.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.870
So in fact, we don't just have
the partial derivative of w

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.780
with respect to z.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.140
We need to specify that
we held x and y fixed.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.150
OK.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:01.750
So just to review again, if we
look now at what we did in

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.900
part b, you know, the meat of
the argument was the exact

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.880
same as what we did in part a.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.300
The meat of the argument
was right here.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.420
We took some derivative and
then this was an unknown.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.050
The definition of w doesn't
know how t and z

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.800
depend on one another.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.230
That you can only find by
looking at the constraint.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:27.690
And so we just went through
the problem and we took

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.590
derivatives of the constraint,
and that gave us an equation

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.840
that we were looking for.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.140
Now if we go back now
to part a over here.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.530
So as you can see, there's
a lot more work

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.510
involved in part a.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.670
On the other hand, to me it
was more straightforward.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.240
We just had to compute the total
differentials and then

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.630
do some linear algebra
with cancellations.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.980
And somehow, when you do total
differentials, you just

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.340
compute everything that could
possibly come up, and then you

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.860
just substitute it in.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.950
And indeed, we got the same
answer: partial w partial z as

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.690
being minus zt.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.980
OK, and I think I'll
stop there.
