DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:11.310
I'd like to work on a
problem with you, which

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.250
is to compute the volume
of a parallelepiped using 3

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.910
by 3 determinants.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.140
So here we've got the
parallelepiped drawn.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.090
It has, one of its vertices
is at the origin, (0, 0, 0),

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.370
and the other three
edges are given to us

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.590
with these coordinates here.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.420
So why don't you take some
time to work out this problem,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.980
pause the video, and check
back with me and I'll show you

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.760
how I solved it.

00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:44.880
OK, welcome back.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.350
Let's get started.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.820
So the first thing
that we need to do

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.630
is we need to remember
that computing

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.430
volumes of parallelepipeds is
the same thing as computing 3

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.970
by 3 determinants.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:10.780
So the volume is just equal
to the determinant, which

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.060
is built out of the vectors,
the row vectors determining

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.620
the edges.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.990
So we have-- well,
that's almost true.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.182
This determinant will be either
a positive or negative number

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:35.140
and we always want to
take the positive number.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.860
So I'm going to write
plus or minus here,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.401
and we'll have to
remember at the end

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:40.304
that we want a positive number.

00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:41.720
So we can compute
this determinant

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.040
using Laplace expansion as
we did in the last video.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.950
So for Laplace
expansion, we take

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.470
the-- we can do Laplace
expansion on the first row.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.860
And that will again be nice,
because this 0 here will

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.770
make our computation simpler.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.890
And so, remember what we do
is we take the first entry

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.080
in the row, and then we need
to multiply by the minor

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.480
that we get by covering up
that row and that column.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.700
So we have this little
2 by 2 determinant,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.273
which looks like minus 1.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.480
And now we need to
subtract the next entry

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.680
in the row times its
minor, which is now

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.360
this matrix [1, 1; 0, 1].

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.060
So taking that determinant,
we get 1 minus 0.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.430
So altogether, we get 1.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.860
So what that tells us is that
our determinant is minus 4.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.180
But then that tells us
that our volume is plus 4.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.610
And I'll leave it at that.
