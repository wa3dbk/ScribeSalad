JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.560
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.090
In lecture, you've been
learning about line integrals

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.210
of vector fields.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.870
And I have a couple
of nice questions

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.260
on that subject
for you right here.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.750
So I want F to be the vector
field whose first coordinate is

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.120
x*y and whose second coordinate
is x squared plus y squared.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.270
And so what I'd like you do is
compute the line integral of F

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.350
around two different
curves C. So both curves

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.620
start at the point (1, 1) and
they end at the point (2, 4).

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.130
So in part a, the curve is just
the straight line that connects

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.190
the point (1, 1) to (2, 4).

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.780
And in part b, the curve
is this sort of piecewise--

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.580
it's two sides of
a rectangle, right?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.890
It goes straight up until
it gets to the point (1, 4),

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.990
and then it goes across
to the point (2, 4).

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.170
So it's a piecewise
smooth curve, path,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.320
that connects those two points.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.140
So I'd like you to compute
the integral over each

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.804
of these curves of F dot dr. So
why don't you pause the video,

00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:10.970
have a go at that, come
back, and we can work it out

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.470
together.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.540
So, when you're computing a
line integral over a curve,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.100
really the thing
that you want to do

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.960
is you want to
parametrize the curve,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.300
and then that gives you
stuff that you can plug in.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.380
You'll have
expressions for x and y

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.650
in terms of your parameter.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.180
So you can plug it in and you
just turn this integral right

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.164
into a nice single
variable integral,

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.330
and then you can compute it.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.704
So that's our basic strategy
for computing integrals

00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:44.620
of this form, line
integrals of vector fields.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.910
So let's have a go.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.700
Let's start with part a.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.080
So in part a, what we need
to do to apply this method

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.990
is that we need to parametrize
the curve in question.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.670
So this is a straight line.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.400
And if you look at it, it's the
line through the points (1, 1)

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.670
and (2, 4).

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.120
So this line has equation
y equals 3x minus 2.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.760
That's our line, and OK.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.630
So we need to choose some
parameter that will give us

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.830
this segment of this line.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.550
So a natural thing to do in
this case is-- it's easy enough,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.540
y is already written
in terms of x,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.280
so it's natural
enough just to take

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.090
a parameter that's equal to x.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.990
So it's up to you whether you
introduce the letter t in order

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.300
to do this, or not.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.450
I'm going to do it with the
letter t here in part a,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.710
but you could do this problem
exactly the same way just using

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.810
the letter x.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.100
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to let x equals t

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.840
so that y is equal
to 3t minus 2.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.390
OK, so that is the parametric
equation for the entire line,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.090
but we only want the part
between the points (1, 1) and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.150
(2, 4).

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.270
So the part between the
lines (1, 1) and (2, 4)

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.760
is the part where t
is between 1 and 2.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.620
Where x is between 1 and 2.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.350
OK.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.700
So this is our parametrization.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.800
So now we need to
figure out what

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.300
is the field F in
this parametrization,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.840
and what is dr. And then
after we have those,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.320
we can just put them into
our integral and compute.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.830
So F, in this
parametrization, well,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.550
we take the equation for F,
which is x*y comma x squared

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.170
plus y squared, and
we just plug in.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.970
So in this case, x*y is going
to be 3t minus 2 times t,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.390
so that's 3 t squared minus 2t.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.840
And x squared plus y squared,
well that's t squared plus 3t

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.250
minus 2 quantity squared.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.630
So that's what F is.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.680
And also we have that dr-- well,
we just take the differentials

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.490
of x and y-- so this is
going to be dt comma 3*dt.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.660
Or if you like, 1
comma 3 times dt

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.720
if you like to
factor out your dt.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.090
So that's what F and dr is.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.130
So now we need to
compute our integral.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.600
So the integral over C of F
dot dr, well, you just plug in.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.290
So this is the
integral over C now.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.790
So OK.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.910
So now we need to
look at our bounds.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.210
So the integral over
C means the integral

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.330
as t varies in the range
that we need to cover.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.090
That whole curve.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.310
So in this case, we said that
was from t equals 1 to 2.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.690
So it's the integral as t
goes from 1 to 2 of F dot dr.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.860
So in the first coordinates--
let me factor out

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.610
the dt at the end.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:05.710
So that's going to be 3 t
squared minus 2t, times 1,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.430
plus-- OK, well, let's
expand this out now.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.600
3t minus 2 quantity
squared, that's

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.130
going to give me a 9 t
squared minus 12t plus 4--

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.250
so this is 9 t squared
minus 12t plus 4,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.470
and then we have to
add t squared to it.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:38.200
So this is plus 10 t squared
minus 12t plus 4, times 3,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.000
and then this whole thing is dt.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.105
dt is the whole
integrand, there.

00:05:43.105 --> 00:05:45.436
I could even put in another
pair of parentheses just

00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:48.380
to emphasize that, perhaps.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.190
OK.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.470
Now this is a
straightforward-- I mean,

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.470
it's a little
complicated looking,

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.130
but it's just an
integral of a polynomial.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.310
Easy enough to do.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.770
Let's first just combine terms.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.240
OK, so let's look
at the t squareds.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.350
We have a 10 t squared times 3.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.670
So 30 t squared, and
then another 3 times 1.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.232
So 33 t squared.

00:06:15.232 --> 00:06:22.560
And I've got minus 2t
minus 36t is minus 38t,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.770
plus 12-- 4 times 3-- dt.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.400
OK, and now we integrate.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.080
So this is equal to
11 t cubed-- that's

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:44.310
a 3-- minus 19 t
squared plus 12t as t

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.810
varies between 1 and 2.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.930
And all right.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.430
OK, so now we've got to plug
in and evaluate and so on.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:07:06.420
So at 2, this is 88 minus 76
plus 24, minus 11 minus 19

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.100
plus 12.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.570
So you do some
arithmetic and this

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.860
is going to work out to 32.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.500
OK, so there's part a.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.040
It's a nice, simple
curve, so we had

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.025
a nice, simple parametrization.

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:29.040
We computed F and dr, then we
dotted them, and integrated.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.690
OK, so now we're going to do
the same exact thing for part b,

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.940
but in part b, the curve is
a little more complicated.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.620
Let's come over here where
we've got some empty space.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.730
So in part b, our
curve looks like this.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.796
So it starts at
the point (1, 1),

00:07:46.796 --> 00:07:52.510
and then it goes up
to the point (1, 4),

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:57.090
and then it goes over
to the point (2, 4).

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.120
All right?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.440
So it's hard to parametrize
in one fell swoop

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.890
something that makes a
sharp right angle like that.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.450
So a natural thing to do
is to split the integral

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.940
over this whole curve into
the integrals over the two

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.900
different pieces.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.080
So let's call this vertical part
C_1 and this horizontal part

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.480
C_2.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.640
And so we know that the
integral over C of F

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.124
dot dr is equal to
the integral over C_1

00:08:25.124 --> 00:08:33.380
of F dot dr plus the integral
over C_2 of F dot dr.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.720
And so now, it's easy enough
to parametrize these two

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.930
separate curves separately.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.020
C_1, for example, is the
straight line segment that

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.050
goes from (1, 1) to (1, 4).

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.530
So C_1.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:52.500
So that means we have x
equal to 1, and 1 less than

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.280
or equal to y less
than or equal to 4.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.690
So a natural
parametrization here

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.690
is just the parametrization
that uses the parameter y.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:02.190
Right?

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.231
So in this one, I'm not going to
bother introducing a new letter

00:09:05.231 --> 00:09:05.730
t.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.510
I'm just going to
stick with x and y.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.935
So we have x equals 1,
and y is our parameter

00:09:10.935 --> 00:09:13.000
and it goes from 1 to 4.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.050
So now let's look at
what F and dr are.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.340
So in this case, F is equal to--
its first coordinate is x*y,

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.260
and x is just 1
here, so this is y.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.215
And its second coordinate
was x squared plus y squared,

00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:33.510
and so that's going to
be 1 plus y squared.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:39.950
And dr-- well, r
here is 1 comma y--

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:45.610
so dr is equal to 0 comma dy.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.380
Or (0, 1) times dy, if
you wanted to factor that

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.060
dy out to the end.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.780
OK.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.280
Good.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.510
So we're all set to do
that first integral.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.980
So let's do that.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:07.820
So we have the integral over C_1
of F dot dr is equal to-- well,

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.490
we dot these two
things together.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.780
And the first term gives me
y times 0, and that's just 0.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.780
So that's going to
die, and all we're

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.510
left with is the second term.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:24.060
So it's the integral of 1 plus y
squared dy, but we need bounds.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.560
Right?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.975
OK, so y was going from
1 to 4 in this integral.

00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:34.440
So it's the integral from 1
to 4 of 1 plus y squared dy.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.940
OK.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.430
So we can either continue
and evaluate this now,

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.920
or we could go and
do the second one.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.560
Let's finish evaluating
it since we've already

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.830
got it written up here.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:56.084
So this is equal to y, plus y
cubed over 3, between 1 and 4.

00:10:56.084 --> 00:10:56.750
So what is this?

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:08.080
This is 4 plus 64/3,
minus 1 plus 1/3.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.880
So that looks like
it's 24 to me.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.540
OK, so we get 24
for the first part.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.465
Now, let's do the second part.

00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:18.415
So C_2 here.

00:11:18.415 --> 00:11:21.270
I'll draw a little line
there to separate them.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.770
Now, curve C_2-- let's go
back and look at it-- OK,

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.820
so curve C_2 is the segment
connecting the points (1, 4)

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.230
and the point (2, 4).

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.690
OK, so y is always 4 on this
curve, and x goes from 1 to 2.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.070
So 1 is less than or equal
to x less than or equal to 2,

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.820
y is equal to 4.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.550
So a natural
parametrization here,

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.219
again, is just to take
x to be our parameter.

00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:50.260
And again, I'm not going
to introduce a letter t.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.330
We're just using x
as our parameter.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:58.280
So in this case,
F-- well, it's x*y,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:04.160
so x is just x and y is
4-- so that's 4x comma--

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.645
and the second coordinate is
x squared plus y squared--

00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:10.980
so that's x squared plus 16.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:22.210
And dr is equal to dx comma 0.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.440
OK, so that's F and dr.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:30.000
So the integral that I want
now is the integral over C_2

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.900
of F dot dr. OK, so we just
plug in here what we've got.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.920
So this is equal to
the integral of-- well,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.120
the first coordinates are 4x dx
and the second coordinates just

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.875
give me 0-- so it's 4x dx.

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:49.230
And again, I need my bounds.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.507
Well, I had-- over
here, I had 1 less than

00:12:51.507 --> 00:12:53.215
or equal to x is less
than or equal to 2.

00:12:53.215 --> 00:12:55.620
So that's the integral
between 1 and 2.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:04.300
4x-- integrate that-- and I get
2 x squared between 1 and 2,

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.295
which is equal to
8 minus 2, or 6.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.650
All right.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.080
So let's see what we've got.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.610
So we had-- back here, we had
our curve C, which we split

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.040
into the two parts C_1 and C_2.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.830
And we wanted to know what
the integral over C was,

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:32.965
and we've separately computed
the integral over C_1.

00:13:32.965 --> 00:13:35.790
And we computed that to be 24.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.075
And we computed the integral
over C_2, and that was 6.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.910
So the integral over
the whole curve of F

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:55.170
dot dr is equal to 24
plus 6, which is 30.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.350
OK.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.250
So there's your answer
for the second part.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.930
Now one thing I'd
like you to notice

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.150
is that over this
curve C in part b--

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.210
over the whole
curve in part b-- we

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.645
got that the integral
of this field F was 30.

00:14:09.645 --> 00:14:13.550
And now if you
remember, right here,

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.950
in the first part, in part
a, we computed the integral

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.130
over a different curve
that connected the two

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.340
same endpoints.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.300
And we found that the
integral came out to 32.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.160
So one thing you should
take away from this

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.190
is that the integral over
a curve joining two points

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.200
can depend on which
curve you choose, right?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.770
So we had two
different curves and we

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.620
got two different answers, even
though the two curves connected

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.920
the same points.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.190
So that's interesting.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.939
And the other thing
to take away from this

00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:42.190
is just the general approach.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:48.080
Which is that whenever you
have a problem like this, what

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.430
you want to do is you
want to take your curve--

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:56.360
so whether it be-- well, in part
a we had this straight line,

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.640
slanted line.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.460
In part b where we had
this nice piecewise

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.060
linear with these vertical
and horizontal parts--

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.925
you want to break it into
nice pieces, parametrize them.

00:15:06.925 --> 00:15:08.300
You know, sometimes
you only need

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.620
one piece when it's an
easy-to-parametrize curve

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.770
like that.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.990
Sometimes, if it has
corners or so on,

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.700
you might want more pieces.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.000
Break it into pieces, choose
a nice parametrization,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.450
and that reduces your problem
just to computing integrals,

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:26.370
just like we've done in
Calculus I-- in 18.01--

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.620
and then you just integrate.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.400
All right.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.020
I'll end there.
