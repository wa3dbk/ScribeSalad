CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.740
In this video, I'd
like us to work

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.040
on the following problem that
has to do with tangent planes

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.130
and approximations.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.540
So we know that a rectangle--
we'll say a rectangle

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.470
has sides x and y, and
we know that to find

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.030
the area of the rectangle
then, we just take x times y,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.040
and I would like us to
approximate the area for x

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.020
equal to 2.1 and y equal to 2.8.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.740
And obviously, with
this type of equation,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.420
it's not hard to
just compute this,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.230
but I'd like us to use the
tangent plane approximation

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.110
to determine the
value, and then we'll

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.340
compare it to the actual
value, just to give us

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.420
an idea of how we can
use the tangent plane

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.960
to approximate things.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.380
And obviously, I'd like to
do this near x equal 2 and y

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.060
equal 3.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.690
So when you're doing your
tangent plane approximation,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.030
do the approximation at
x equal 2 and y equal 3.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.700
And then when you're
done with that,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.040
I would like you to
answer this question.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.980
So near x equal 2 and y equal
3, which has the greater effect?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.050
A change in x or an
equal change in y?

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.520
So if I change by
x in the same value

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.490
as I change by y, which will
have the greater impact?

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.569
So why don't you pause the
tape, work on the problems,

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.110
and when you're ready to see
how I do them, bring it back up,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.842
and I'll come back and show you.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.522
OK, welcome back.

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:36.980
So we're going to work on this
problem, and as I mentioned,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.560
the first thing we want to
do is do a tangent plane

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.269
approximation near x
equal 2 and y equal 3.

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:45.810
So let me write down
what we're going

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.340
to need in order to do that.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.510
First, we'll remind ourselves
that in this case, what

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.280
I'm going to
approximate is the area

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.750
function for a rectangle,
which is A of x,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.650
y is equal to x times y.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.260
So that's the function I'm
going to be approximating.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.520
And now the actual
approximation,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.620
the tangent plane approximation,
has the following form.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.010
So we know A of x,
y is approximately--

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.180
well, it's going to be the
area evaluated at the point I'm

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.085
interested in, which
we said was 2 comma 3,

00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:25.790
right, plus the x-derivative
of area evaluated at 2

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.160
comma 3, times the change in x.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.700
And the change in x is where x
is now versus where we started,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.350
which is at x equal 2.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.530
And then the same
thing in terms of y.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.360
So you do the y-derivative
evaluated at 2 comma 3,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.460
and then you do the change in y.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.950
And since we started at y
equals 3, the change in y

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.854
is y minus 3, OK?

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:51.270
So now we obviously need to
fill in three quantities here.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.436
The three things we need
to evaluate: area evaluated

00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:57.160
at (2, 3), its x-derivative
evaluated at (2, 3),

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.640
and its y-derivative
evaluated at (2, 3).

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.180
So let me just point
out what we have.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.510
Area evaluated at (2, 3),
well, that's just 2 times 3,

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.740
which we can do, so that's 6.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.080
That's pretty easy.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.850
Now A sub x, so the
derivative of the area

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.407
function with respect to x.

00:03:14.407 --> 00:03:16.615
The derivative of the area
function with respect to x

00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:17.870
is just y.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.680
y in that case we
treat as a constant.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680
We take this derivative.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.620
We just get y back.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.790
And so, A sub x
evaluated at (2, 3)

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.540
is going to be y,
which-- y here is 3,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.030
so we get A sub x is
equal to 3 at (2, 3).

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.990
In a similar vein, we can
immediately look and see

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.282
that A sub y evaluated at
(2, 3) is going to be 2.

00:03:42.282 --> 00:03:43.740
And the reason for
that, of course,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.364
is if we look back
here, the derivative

00:03:45.364 --> 00:03:49.190
of A with respect to y is x,
so evaluating it at (2, 3)

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.780
gives us 2.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.730
OK.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.930
So now we just have
to fill everything in.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.560
So my tangent
plane approximation

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.410
now says I get 6 plus 3 times x
minus 2 plus 2 times y minus 3.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.050
And what I wanted was the
area at 2.1 comma 2.8.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.240
So if I fill in those
values for x and y--

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.170
so 2.1 is x and 2.8 is
y-- if I fill those in,

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.439
I get that this is
equal to-- well, I'll

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.980
keep writing
approximately just to be

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.520
safe-- is 6 plus 3 times--
well, 2.1 minus 2 gives me a 0.1

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.000
there and 2 times 2.8 minus 3
gives me a negative 0.2 there,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.560
so I get a negative 0.4,
I get a positive 0.3,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.360
so together this
is a negative 0.1.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.940
6 minus 0.1 gives me 5.9.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.680
So the area based
on the approximation

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.840
is 5.9 square units.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.750
And, in actuality, if
you multiply it out,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.200
I think you get
something like 5.88,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.960
so the approximation
is very good, right?

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.440
We're close to
(2, 3) and that is

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.648
one of the reasons we can
know it's going to be very,

00:05:05.648 --> 00:05:06.900
it should be very good.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.430
It should be pretty good, OK?

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.060
Now, I just have to answer the
second part of the question.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.470
So let me remind us what
the second part was.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.850
It was near x equal
2 and y equal 3,

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.700
which has a greater effect?

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.330
A change in x or an
equal change in y?

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.130
And to do that, it's really
easiest to come back and look

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.660
at maybe this line.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.160
I'll underline this
line right here.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.820
Actually, I'll box it, OK?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.580
This value will represent
the change in x.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.600
So we started at 2,
and we go somewhere,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.370
and that'll represent
the change in x.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.030
This value represents
the change in y.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.950
So if we look at which has a
greater impact near (2, 3),

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.920
if my change in x and my
change in y are equal,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.480
then obviously this term
has a bigger impact,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.430
because there's a 3.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.300
The coefficient here is 3 and
the coefficient here is 2.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.850
And so the point is, changes
in x will have a greater

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.690
effect than changes in y.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.020
And what this corresponds
to pictorially

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.160
is if we make a slice
where we keep y constant

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.280
and we look at the curve in
the xz-plane, that corresponds

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.790
to the fact that the derivative
in the xz-plane of the curve

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.140
there is more significant--
the curve there

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.580
has a steeper derivative-- than
if I kept the x-value fixed

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.700
and I looked in the yz-plane
and I looked at the curve there.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.730
So the sort of
one-dimensional picture

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.900
is that the derivative of
a curve in the x-direction,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.890
keeping y fixed, is
steeper than the derivative

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.930
of the curve in the
y-direction, keeping x fixed.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.319
So maybe-- hopefully,
that wasn't more confusing

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:47.360
than it should have been.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.200
From here, you can
see it right away,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.160
but that's sort of the
picture of it as well.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.381
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
