DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.010
The problem I'd like
to work with you

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.450
now is simply to compute
some partial derivatives,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.490
using the definitions we
learned today in lecture.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.150
So first we're going to
compute the partial derivative

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.140
in the x-direction
of this function x

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.250
y squared plus x squared y.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.100
Then we're going to compute its
derivative in the y-direction,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.080
and then finally we're going to
evaluate the partial derivative

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.750
in the x-direction at a
particular point (1, 2).

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.977
That's the first problem.

00:00:34.977 --> 00:00:36.560
And in the second
problem, we're going

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.760
to compute second
partial derivatives.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.500
Now these we just
compute by taking

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.950
the derivative of
the derivative,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.020
just as we do in
one-variable calculus.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.000
So why don't you work on
these, pause the tape,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940
and I'll check back
in a moment, and we'll

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.102
see how I solve these.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.150
OK, welcome back.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.460
Let's get started.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.960
So we have x squared
y-- excuse me,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.620
x y squared plus x squared y.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.950
That's our f.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.410
So when we take the partial
derivative in the x-direction--

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.280
remember, this just
means that we treat y

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.900
as if it were a
constant, and we just

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.370
take an ordinary derivative
in the x-direction

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.440
as we would do in
one-variable calculus.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.270
So the derivative of
this in the x-direction

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.430
is just y squared, because we
only differentiate the x here.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.420
Similarly here, the
derivative of x squared is 2x,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.100
and y just comes along for the
ride as if it were a constant.

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:50.340
For the partial derivative
in the y-direction,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.860
we do the same thing,
except now, x is a constant,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.950
and we're taking an ordinary
derivative in the y-direction.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.610
So we have 2xy plus x squared.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.650
And then the final
thing that we need to do

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.520
is we want to evaluate partial
f, partial x at the point

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.390
(1, 2).

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.990
And so all that
means is that we have

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.480
to plug in x equals
1 and y equals 2

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.680
into our previous computation,
and so we get 2 squared

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.170
plus 2 times 1 times 2.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.240
So altogether, we get 8.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.850
So that's computing
partial derivatives.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.720
Now let's move on and compute
the second partial derivatives.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.385
So, for instance,
we want to compute

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:56.780
the second partial derivative
both times in the x-direction.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.575
So all this means is that when
we took the first partial,

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:01.620
we got a function of
x and y, and now we

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.370
just need to take its partial.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.780
So we just need to take
the derivative of this

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.400
again in the x-direction.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.900
So now, the derivative
of y squared--

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.640
be careful-- the derivative of
y squared in the x-direction

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.660
is just zero, because y is
a constant relative to x.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.322
And so, then altogether,
we just get 2y.

00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:24.010
When we take the derivative
to this x, we just get 1.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.550
So that's our second partial
derivative in the x-direction.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.505
And now you can also
take mixed partials.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.512
So here, we take
a derivative of f.

00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:46.470
First we take the derivative
in the y-direction

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.100
and then we take a derivative
of that in the x-direction.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.280
So we can look at our derivative
here, partial f, partial y,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.470
and we need to take its
partial in the x-direction.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.370
And so we get 2y plus 2x.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.060
Now let's see what happens
if we switch the order here

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:19.430
and we take, instead,
the partial derivative

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.860
in the opposite order.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.080
So now let's go back to
our partial derivative of f

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.210
in the x-direction and let's
take its derivative now

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.330
in the y-direction.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.980
So the first term
there, y squared,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.540
gives us a 2y and the
second term gives us a 2x.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.680
I want to just note
that these are equal.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.840
In fact, the mixed
partial derivatives,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.970
whether you take them in the
xy order or the yx order,

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.250
for the sorts of functions that
we're going to be considering

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.400
in this class-- for instance,
all polynomial functions

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.370
and all differentiable
functions of several variables--

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.180
these mixed partials
are going to be equal.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.190
In your textbook,
there are some examples

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.260
of sort of
pathological functions

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.642
where these are not
equal, but certainly

00:05:12.642 --> 00:05:14.100
for any polynomial
functions, these

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.290
are always going to be equal.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.285
And I think I'll
leave it at that.
