00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.838
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:12.510
In this video I would like us
to do the following problem.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.880
We're going to let z
equal x squared plus y

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.410
and we want S to
be the graph of z

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.610
above the unit square
in the xy-plane.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.030
And what we'd like to do is
for F equal to z*i plus x*k,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.530
find the upward
flux of F through S.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.400
So S is our surface
that's a graph,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.380
over the xy-plane
and the unit square,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.490
of z equal to x squared plus y.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.650
And we want to compute
the upward flux of F

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.330
through that surface.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.390
So why don't you work on this
problem, pause the video,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.740
and then when you're
ready to see my solution,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.740
bring the video back up.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.360
OK, welcome back.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.370
So again, what we
want to do is we want

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.750
to find the upward flux of
F through this surface S.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.840
And let's think about first, how
do we describe the surface S?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.240
S is the graph of z
equal x squared plus y.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.710
So we can think of
it as, z is really--

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.740
we can think of it as a function
of x and y over the unit

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.250
square.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.600
So we can say f of x,
y is equal to z which

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.430
is equal to x squared plus y.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.320
And then we know how to
compute the normal-- well,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.120
we know how to compute
n*dS, which also in class is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.080
sometimes written notationally
as dS with the vector dS.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.690
So we know how to compute
this form right here.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.840
And it is-- you were shown in
class that if f is-- or sorry.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.940
If you have a graph, if
your surface is a graph,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.620
then this is exactly equal to
the vector minus f sub x comma

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:01.100
minus f sub y comma 1 dx dy.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.090
So that's exactly what this
n*dS-- so n is the vector,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.510
and dS is the surface
form we have here.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.030
So n*dS is exactly equal to
the vector minus f sub x,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.250
minus f sub y, 1, dx dy.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.560
So what do we have
here with f sub x?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.050
f sub x-- because f is
equal to z-- f sub x is 2x

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.420
and f sub y is 1.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.990
So in our case we get
exactly minus 2x, comma

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.000
minus 1, comma 1, dx dy.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.060
And now to compute the surface
integral what we do-- or sorry,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.830
to compute the flux along
the surface, what we do

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.804
is we integrate over
the surface-- which

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.970
I guess we should remember
that's a double integral,

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.620
because it's over a surface--
of F dotted with dS.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.060
But that's the same as
integrating over the region.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.890
So we have this surface,
we know the region

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.780
below that defines the
surface in the xy-coordinates.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.450
So it's integrating over
the region of F dotted

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.810
with this vector here.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.430
Because n*dS-- dS is n*dS,
and in the x-y components

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.400
it's exactly equal to this.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.619
Minus 2x, minus 1, 1, dx dy.

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:32.660
So now we're integrating.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.140
We've gone from looking
at a surface integral.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.850
Now we're integrating--
we were integrating F dot

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.540
dS on the surface,
to now taking F

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.630
dotted with this
vector on the region

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.800
in the xy-plane over
which we can define S.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.000
So the region we're
interested in, remember,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.320
is the unit square.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.510
So we have the unit square
which is x goes from 0 to 1

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.480
and y goes from 0 to 1.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.000
And then what we're
doing is we're

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.050
looking at F as a
function of x, y, and z.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.230
And we want to dot
that with this vector.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.300
And it's all being done
in the variables x and y.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.660
So we should be able to
change everything to x and y

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.740
ultimately.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.160
So let's look at what
we get when we do that.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.500
So F-- I'm going
to remind myself--

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.600
F was equal to z*i plus x*k.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.950
Which, if I write that
in the component form,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.710
it's z comma, 0 comma, x.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:45.530
So F dotted with our minus
f sub x, minus f sub y, 1--

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.150
which was minus 2x, minus
1, 1-- we see we get--

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.490
minus 2x dotted with z-- we get
minus 2x*z and then we get 0

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.760
and then we get x.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.180
So we get minus 2x*z plus x.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.510
That's exactly what f dotted
with the vector we have is.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.890
So now also, we know that z
was equal to x squared plus y.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.970
So we actually get negative 2x
times x squared plus y plus x

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.980
again.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.130
So I'm going to just expand that
so it's easier to deal with.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:29.740
So we get negative 2x
cubed minus 2x*y plus x.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.340
And now we have exactly
what-- if we look over here--

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.240
we have exactly this
entire part here written

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.420
as a function of x and y.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.030
Which is good.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.770
Why is that good?

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.920
Because everything we're
integrating is in x and y.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.300
We're doing dx and dy so we just
need to figure out the bounds

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.540
and compute the integral.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.490
So let's come over here.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.060
So the flux then is going
to be equal to-- well,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.070
we know the region.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.630
We know the region is y and
x are both going from 0 to 1.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.470
So the order doesn't
matter because nothing

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.260
depends on another function.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.400
And then we're integrating
exactly this function.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:16.540
Negative 2 x to the third
minus 2x*y plus x dy dx.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.710
So when we integrate in
y, we should be careful,

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.256
what do we get here?

00:06:24.256 --> 00:06:26.130
We're going to have the
integral from 0 to 1,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.045
and then we're going to have--
this we get a negative 2 x

00:06:29.045 --> 00:06:32.390
cubed times y, and then
evaluated at 0 and 1,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.350
so we just get a
negative 2 x cubed again.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.550
We integrate this we have a
negative 2x y squared over 2.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.290
So at 0 we get nothing
and at 1 we get 1/2.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.680
And so we get minus 2x.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.230
And then here when we integrate
in y, we get x times y

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.420
and we evaluate that at 1 and
0, and we got just plus x.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.220
So let me just make sure I
didn't make any mistakes there.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.130
So this one, I'm
integrating it in y

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.610
and so I get a negative 2 x
cubed y, evaluated at 0 and 1.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.860
So at 1 I just get a negative
2 x cubed, at 0 I get 0.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.130
In this one, I have
a negative 2x*y.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.870
When I integrate that I
get a y squared over 2.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.740
The 2s kill off.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.890
So I'm left with a
negative of x y squared.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.520
Evaluating that at 0
and 1, at 0 I get 0

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.241
and at 1 I get negative x.

00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:24.740
Oh, there.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.760
So there shouldn't be a 2 there.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.660
And then here, when I integrate
that I get x*y evaluated at y

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.900
equals 0 and y equals 1,
and take that difference.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.540
And at 1 I get just x
and at 0 I get nothing.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.030
Hopefully that one
is correct now.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.988
Because I forgot to kill
off the 2 there first.

00:07:42.988 --> 00:07:47.750
So those subtract off and I'm
left with minus the integral

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.620
from 0 to 1 of 2 x cubed dx.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.350
Well, that's going to
be minus of x cubed,

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.590
it's going to be x
to the fourth over 4.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.020
And then I have
the 2 still here.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.460
So that will divide out.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.650
Evaluate at 0 and 1.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.170
At 0 I obviously get nothing.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.980
At 1 I get negative 1/2.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.600
And so the flux of
F across the surface

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.190
is equal to negative 1/2.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.140
And that's the upward flux.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.820
So obviously if I wanted
to know the downward flux,

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.000
that would be positive 1/2.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.120
It doesn't have anything
to do with what F is.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.430
It has to do with the
direction of the normal

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.750
that I'm dotting F with.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.200
So since I was dotting F
with the upward normal--

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.480
which is the n*dS that I showed
you was the upward normal--

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.223
then I know that this
is the upward flux.

00:08:33.223 --> 00:08:35.014
So let me just remind
you what we did here.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.010
Let's come back to
the very beginning.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.900
So the object was that we had
z as a function of x and y.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.520
So we knew we had
a surface sitting

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.600
over some region
in the xy-plane.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.200
And we wanted to compute
the flux of a certain vector

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.580
field-- the upward flux of
a certain vector field--

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.220
across that surface.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.150
And so all we had to do to solve
this problem was ultimately

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.990
understand what n*dS was--
which you actually did in class.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.500
You saw what n*dS is, this
is the upward normal through

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.310
the surface.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.930
And then recognize
that the flux-- again,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.160
we saw this from class-- that
the flux is equal to the double

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.590
integral over the
surface of F dot dS,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.780
which is the same as the double
integral over the region of F

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.520
dotted with n*dS.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.310
Where n*dS, now, I'm referring
to as-- n is the vector and dS

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.860
is-- this whole component is
n*dS-- that's what we found.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.210
And so then we know F. It's
in terms of z, x, and y.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.480
But then we can find
it in terms of x and y.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.400
When we take that dot product
we end up with exactly just

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.750
a function of x and y, when we
replace z by what it actually

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.860
is equal to.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.552
And then we just
compute the integral.

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:47.510
And this is just a regular
old double integral.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.167
And we get the flux
was equal to minus 1/2.

00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:52.500
And again, I want to point
out that if we wanted instead

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.430
of the upward flux
the downward flux,

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.710
it would be the same
with the opposite sign.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:58.210
OK.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.100
That is where I think I'll stop.
