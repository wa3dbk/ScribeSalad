DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.801
The problem I'd like
to work with you today

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.060
is the intersection of
two parametrized lines.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.910
So we have two lines here.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.670
L_1, given with
the parametrization

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.820
in terms of the variable t.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.950
And L_2, also given
with the parametrization

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.570
in terms of the variable t.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.390
So the first question
that I want us to answer

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.250
is do these lines intersect?

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.267
And if so, then we want to find
out where do they intersect.

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:38.350
So why don't you pause the
video and work on this.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.060
And we can check
back in a moment

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.310
and we'll see how I solved it.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.980
OK, welcome back.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.930
Let's get started.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.920
So we have these
two lines in space.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.252
Before we start doing
any computations,

00:00:57.252 --> 00:00:58.710
I find it useful
to draw a picture.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.190
So let's see what's going on.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.450
OK.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.730
So we have these two lines.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.150
We can just find some
common points on the lines.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.720
So, well, if we put
in t equals 0 here,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.780
then it looks like we
get the point 2 comma 1.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.650
OK.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.980
And now if we plug in, let's
say, t is minus 1 here,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.920
then we get-- if we plug in t
is minus 1 here, we get x is 3

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.960
and y is 0.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.420
So there's our line L_1.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380
And now let's see, L_2.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:05.260
If we plug in t equals 0,
we get 2-- 1, 2, 3-- 4.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.670
And if we plug in, let's
say, t equals minus 1 again,

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.215
then we get 1 and 2.

00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:24.970
OK?

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.500
So there is L_2.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.927
And indeed, it does look
like they intersect.

00:02:31.927 --> 00:02:34.010
We could have probably
guessed that they intersect

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.940
by looking back over here at
the formulas for L_1 and L_2,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.850
because we see that the
sort of direction that this

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.150
is moving in, we can
take derivatives in t.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.520
And we see that L_2
is, this line is moving

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.850
in the direction 1 comma 2.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.490
And L_1 is moving in the
direction minus 1 comma 1.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.484
And so those directions
are not parallel.

00:02:57.484 --> 00:02:59.150
And so we know that
the only way the two

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.805
lines could fail to intersect
is if they're parallel.

00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:03.430
So actually, even
without drawing this,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.596
we could have guessed that
these lines do intersect.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.530
So now we know that
these lines intersect.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.440
And in fact, it even
looks, you know,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.510
it kind of looks like they
intersect-- from our sketch--

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.990
at the point-- it
looks like-- 1 comma 2.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.970
It seems to be the
point of intersection.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.899
But, you know, we got a little
bit lucky with our sketch here.

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:28.440
So let's see if
that's actually true.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.542
Let's see if we can verify
this in the general way

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:31.750
that we discussed in lecture.

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:38.100
So, now there is one place
where we have to be careful.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.320
We have two lines here, and
we parametrized both of these

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.285
with the variable t.

00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:46.850
But we need to keep
in mind that t is

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.130
what's called a dummy variable.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.920
It doesn't have any geometric
meaning to the problem.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.200
And in particular, what I
want to caution you about

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.460
is if we just start
solving these two

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.870
equations algebraically
as they're

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.360
given to us with the
variable t, the problem

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.460
that we could run into
is that, you know,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.830
we're sort of
moving-- as we vary

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.182
t-- we're moving along this
line, and as we vary t again,

00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:16.390
we're moving along this line.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.519
And you see we're
moving at the same time.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.560
And so that's really
solving a different problem.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.972
That's not asking about when
did these lines intersect,

00:04:24.972 --> 00:04:26.430
but that would be
asking about when

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.270
do two particles on these
lines collide, which

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.600
is a harder problem.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.200
So instead, what
we need to do is

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.000
we need to give a change of
variables for the line L_2.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.440
So what I want to do is I'm
going to write L_2-- I'm just

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.360
going to write the
same equations,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.000
but I'm going to introduce
a new variable u.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.790
So x is 2 plus u,
and y is 4 plus 2u.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.480
OK.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.760
So now once we've done that, to
find the point of intersection,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.560
well, the point
of intersection is

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.170
going to precisely
be a point on L_2

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.590
where the x-coordinate
and the y-coordinate

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.677
agree with another point
on L_1 with the same

00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:15.510
x- and y-coordinate.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.620
So that is, we
have the-- what we

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.450
want to do is we want to set
the x-coordinate for L_2.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.310
We want to set this equal to
the x-coordinate for L_1, which

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.895
is 2 minus t.

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:33.540
So this was for L_1.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.410
And similarly here, we want to
set the y-coordinate for L_2

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.842
equal to the
y-coordinate for L_1.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.300
So now if you think
about it, if we

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.850
can solve this system of
equations, then what we've done

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.850
is we've simultaneously
found a point which

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.747
is on L_1 and on L_2.

00:05:52.747 --> 00:05:53.580
And that's our goal.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.000
So that will be a
point of intersection.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.520
OK, so now we just
have this system

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.270
of two linear equations
and two variables,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.900
and we just need to solve it.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.232
Now, we could do, you
know, the-- in general,

00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:09.690
with an equation like this, we
might try to add or subtract

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.530
the equations.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.620
But this one is
so simple, that I

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:22.560
see that the top equation
is just the same thing as t

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.270
equaling to minus u.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.270
That's what the top equation
says if we cancel the 2's.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.800
And so if we plug that
into the next equation,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.310
then we get 4 plus
2u equals 1 minus u.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.887
And so then we can
solve this, and we get,

00:06:39.887 --> 00:06:48.000
so it looks like 3 equals
minus 3u, which tells us

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.650
that u equals minus
1, and then that

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.700
tells us that t equals plus 1.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.850
OK?

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.840
So we found our
parameters t and u.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.290
And we're not quite done yet.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:10.450
What we need to do is we need to
go back to our parametrization.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.000
So let me go back over to our
original parametrization here,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.590
and we have L_1 was 2
minus t and 1 plus t.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.560
And over here, we
found that t equals 1

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.160
was the value that we're after.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:37.420
So that tells us that x is
1-- 2 minus 1-- and y is 2.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.594
Excuse me.

00:07:38.594 --> 00:07:39.760
I wrote that in a funny way.

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:47.850
x is 1 and y is 2.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.135
Now, just as a reality check.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.040
We also found that
if we solved for L_2,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.170
we wanted the variable u
to be equal to minus 1.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:08.699
So we had 2 plus
u, and 4 plus 2u.

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:10.240
And so let's see
what happens when we

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.140
plug in u equals minus 1 here.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:19.180
We again get x equals
2 plus minus 1 is 1.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:24.370
And y equals 4
plus minus 2 is 2.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.790
So we just double check that
this is a point of intersection

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.660
of both lines.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.545
And I'll leave it at that.
