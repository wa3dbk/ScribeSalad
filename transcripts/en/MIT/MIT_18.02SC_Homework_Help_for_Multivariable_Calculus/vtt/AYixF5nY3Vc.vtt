JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.720
Welcome to recitation.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.200
In lecture, you started
learning about vectors.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.050
Now vectors are going
to be really important

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.360
throughout the whole
of this course.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.860
And I wanted to
give you one problem

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.211
just to work with them in a
slightly different context

00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:20.960
than what we're going
to do in the future.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.010
So this is the context
of Euclidean geometry.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.359
So some of you have
probably seen this problem

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.150
that we're going to
solve, but you probably

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.910
haven't seen it
solved with vectors.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.470
So let's take a look at it.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.260
So what I'd like
you to do is show

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.590
that the three medians of a
triangle intersect at a point,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.370
and the point is 2/3 of
the way from each vertex.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.780
So let me just remind
you of some terminology.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.870
So in a triangle, a
median is the segment

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.890
that connects one vertex to the
midpoint of the opposite side.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.761
So here, this point M is
exactly halfway between B and C.

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:56.260
So OK.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.360
So every triangle
has three medians--

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.100
one from each vertex
connected to the midpoint

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.660
of the opposite side-- and
what I'm asking you to show

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.850
is that these three medians all
intersect in the same point.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.950
And also, that this
point divides the median

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.390
into two pieces, and
the big piece is twice

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.970
as large as the small piece.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.530
So this is 2/3 of the median,
and this is 1/3 of the median.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.520
So, why don't you take a few
minutes, work that out-- try

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.215
and do it using vectors as much
as possible-- pause the video,

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:29.965
come back, and we can
work on it together.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.320
So hopefully you had some
luck working on this problem.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.460
Let's get started on it.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.020
So to start, I actually
want to rephrase

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.110
the question a little bit.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.680
And I'll rephrase it to
an equivalent question

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.210
that's a little bit
more clear about how

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.250
we want to get started.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.140
So another way to
say this problem is

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.430
that it's asking us to
show-- so for each median,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.110
say this median AM here, where
M is the midpoint of side BC,

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.220
there exists a point on
the median that divides it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.120
into a 2:1 ratio, so the point
that's 2/3 from the vertex

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.960
to the midpoint of
the opposite side.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.160
So for example, you know,
there's a point-- so,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.330
let's call it P, say, at
first-- so there's a point P

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.930
such that AP is twice PM.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.430
OK?

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.520
And similarly, there's
some point-- maybe called

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.110
Q-- that's 2/3 of the way from
B to the midpoint of this side.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.030
And there's some point
that's 2/3 of the way from C

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.450
to the midpoint of this side.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.240
And so an equivalent
formulation of the question

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.440
is to show that these
three points are really

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.890
the same point.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.880
That they're all
in the same place.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.360
So one way we can
do that is that we

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.590
can compare the position
vectors of those three points.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.490
And if those three points all
have the same position vector,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.800
then they're all in
exactly the same position.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.689
So in order to do that
we need some origin.

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.230
And it happens that
for this problem,

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.405
it doesn't matter
where the origin is,

00:03:07.405 --> 00:03:09.030
and so I'm not going
to draw an origin,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.770
but I'm going to call it O.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.490
So we're going to set up
a vector coordinate system

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.240
with origin O. And
now I want to look

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.970
at what the vector from O to
P is in terms of the vectors

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.420
connecting O to A,
B, and C. Right?

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.160
Those are the vectors
that determine

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.530
the vertices of the triangle.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.190
And so I want to relate
the location of P

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.620
to the locations of A, B, and C.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.330
So the first thing to do
is that-- well, in order

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.000
to talk about where P is, I
know how P is related to A and M

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.770
and I know how M is
related to B and C.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.580
So let's first figure out
what the position vector of M

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.337
is in terms of the position
vectors of A, B, and C,

00:03:54.337 --> 00:03:55.920
and then we can use
that to figure out

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.240
the position vector of P.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.260
So M is the midpoint
of the segment BC.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.670
So I think we saw
this in lecture.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.232
What this means is that the
position vector OM is exactly

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:25.770
the average of the position
vectors of B and C.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.430
It's 1/2 of the
quantity OB plus OC.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.930
All right?

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.470
So it's easy to
express the position

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.300
vector of the midpoint
of a segment in terms

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.280
of the position vectors
of the endpoints.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.450
You just add the position
vectors of the endpoints

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.970
and divide by 2.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.920
So if you like,
this is equivalent

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.910
to the geometric fact that the
diagonals of a parallelogram

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.470
bisect each other.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.340
So that's the
position vector of M.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.490
Now we have to figure out what
the position vector of P is.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.930
So in order to do
this we can note,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.560
that in order to get from
the origin to point P,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.700
well, what we have to do is we
have to go from the origin--

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.460
wherever it is--
to A, and then we

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.720
have to go from A 2/3 of
the way to M. All right?

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:29.440
So the vector OP is equal to
OA plus 2/3 of the vector AM.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.940
Right?

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.530
Because we go 2/3
of the way from A

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.730
to M in order to
get from A to P.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.570
This is because we've chosen
P to be the point that

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.390
divides segment AM into a 2:1
ratio so that AP is 2/3 of AM.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.000
OK.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.590
So good.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.030
So now we need the vector AM.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.970
Well, we know what the
position vector of A is.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.190
It's just OA.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.500
And we also know what the
position vector of M is.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.500
It's OM.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:01.880
So that means that AM is just
the difference of those two

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.870
vectors.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.360
It's going to be OM minus OA.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.520
Another way to say this is that
if you add OA to both sides,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.120
you have that OA
plus AM equals OM.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.160
In other words,
to go from O to M,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.510
first you can go from O to
A, and then go from A to M.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.340
All right.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.410
And I've just subtracted OA
onto the other side here.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.640
So we can write AM in
terms of OM and OA.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.440
And we also-- we have
an expression for OM

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.290
here in terms of OB and OC.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.190
So that means we can
get an expression for AM

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.120
in terms of OA, OB, and OC.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.830
So let's do that.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.000
So that's just by substituting
from here into here.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.960
So if I do that,
I get that AM is

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:58.550
equal to-- so OM is
1/2 OB plus 1/2 OC,

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.090
and now I just subtract OA.

00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:04.510
All right.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.790
So that's what AM is, putting
these two equations together.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.830
I get that that's AM.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.100
And so now I need to
figure out what OP is.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.980
So for OP, I just
need to substitute

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.170
in this new expression
that I've got for AM.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.444
So I have OP is
equal to, well it's

00:07:21.444 --> 00:07:28.542
equal to OA plus 2/3
of what I've written

00:07:28.542 --> 00:07:30.860
just right above-- 2/3 of AM.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:40.500
So that's 1/2 OB
plus 1/2 OC minus OA.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.020
OK.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.760
And so now you can multiply
this 2/3 in-- you know,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.710
just distribute the
scalar multiplication

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.300
across the addition there--
and then we can rearrange.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.890
We'll have two terms involving
OA and we can combine them.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:58.280
So we'll see we have a
plus OA minus 2/3 OA.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.450
So that's going to
be equal to 1/3 OA.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.280
And then we have, OK
so 2/3 times 1/2 OB.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:16.730
So that's plus 1/3
OB plus 1/3 OC.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.160
So this gives us
a simple formula

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.050
for the position vector of
P-- that vector OP-- in terms

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.980
of the position
vectors of A, B, and C.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.040
So in particular,
it's actually--

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.920
because P is the special
point-- it's 1/3 of their sum.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.830
Of the sum OA plus OB plus OC.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.010
OK, so that's where P is.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.680
Now to finish the
problem, I just

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.460
have to show that this is the
same location as the point that

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.470
trisects the other medians.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.940
So how would I do that?

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.380
Well, I could go
back to my triangle

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.912
and I could do exactly
the same thing.

00:08:51.912 --> 00:08:54.120
So I could-- maybe I'll give
this point a name, also.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.770
I'll call this midpoint N, say.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.890
So I could let Q be the point
that lies 2/3 of the way

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.540
from B to N. And then
I could write down

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.277
the position vector of N
in terms of OA, OB, and OC.

00:09:08.277 --> 00:09:10.860
And then I can use that to write
down the position vector of Q

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.580
in terms of OA, OB, and OC,
and I'll get some expression.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.390
And what will
happen at the end--

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.720
I hope if I'm lucky--
that expression

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.220
will be equal to this expression
that I found over here.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:22.760
OK?

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.950
So you can go
through and do that,

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.210
and if you do that, what you'll
find is that in fact it works.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.140
So there's actually a sort
of clever, shorter way

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.960
of seeing that.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.730
Which is that this formula
is symmetric in A, B, and C.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:42.860
So that means if I just
relabel the points A, B, and C,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.570
this expression for the
position vector doesn't change.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.010
So rather than going
through that process

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.900
that I just described,
you can also

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:55.150
say, well, in order
to look at, say Q,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.210
instead of P, what I
need to do is I just

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.150
need to switch B and A. I need
to do exactly the same thing

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.184
but the roles of A and
B are interchanged.

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:04.350
Well, if the roles of A and
B are interchanged, then

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.891
in the resulting
formula, I just have

00:10:05.891 --> 00:10:07.570
to interchange the
roles of A and B,

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.960
but that won't change the
value of this expression.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.170
So by symmetry, the point I get
really is going to be the same.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.240
If you don't like
that argument, I

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.360
invite you to go
through this computation

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.600
again in the case of
the other medians.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.860
In either case, what you'll find
is that the points that trisect

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.100
the three medians all
have position vector 1/3

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.700
OA plus 1/3 OB plus
1/3 OC, but that means

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.230
they're the same point.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:41.260
So what we've shown then,
is that the points that

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.290
trisect the three medians--
that trisects, that divide them

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.809
into 2:1 ratios from the
vertex to the midpoint

00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:51.100
of the opposite side-- that
those three points all have

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.390
the same position vector.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.210
So in fact, they're
the same point,

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.390
and that's what we
wanted to show, right?

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.660
We wanted to show that there's
one point that trisects

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.380
all three of those medians.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.080
So we've shown that the three
points that trisect them

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.480
are actually the same.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.530
So that's the same conclusion,
phrased differently.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.906
So I think I'll end there.
