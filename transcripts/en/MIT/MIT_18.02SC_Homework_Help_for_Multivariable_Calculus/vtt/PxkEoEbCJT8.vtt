DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.020
As a warm up, let's get started
by computing some determinants

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.170
for 2 by 2 and 3 by 3 matrices.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.190
Why don't you take some time
to work on computing these two

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.540
determinants, and when you're
finished, check back with me

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.960
and I'll show you
how I solved it.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.690
Welcome back.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.390
So why don't we get started
with the 2 by 2 matrix first.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.680
So remember, when we compute
a 2 by 2 determinant,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.620
we multiply the entries
in the main diagonal

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.960
and we subtract from that
the product of the entries

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.270
in the off diagonal.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:57.990
So in this case, we
have 3 times minus 2,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:06.310
minus, minus 4 times minus 1.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:16.250
So we have minus 6
minus 4 is minus 10.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.346
OK, now, the 3 by
3 matrix, we're

00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:22.970
going to use a Laplace
expansion, which

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.770
means that we're going to need
to choose a row or a column

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.370
in the matrix.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.180
We can choose any row or column,
but as I look at this matrix,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.579
I'd like to choose
the first row,

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.620
because I see this 0 here,
which is going to mean

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.200
we have less work to do.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.940
So let's do Laplace expansion
across the first row.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.560
So what that means is we take
the very first entry, minus 1,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.190
and now we need to
multiply it by a 2

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.740
by 2 determinant, which
we get by covering up

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.640
the row and the
column corresponding

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.900
to our first entry.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.940
So our first entry was minus
1, and what we need to do

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.710
is cover up the row and
column containing that,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.090
and we have this little
2 by 2 matrix here.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.160
And so we get 2, 2; minus 2, 1.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.770
OK.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.010
The next entry, we have to
take negative of this entry,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.490
but this entry is 0.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.760
So minus 0 times--
just for practice,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.000
why don't I put in this
cofactor here anyways.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.780
So again, we cover up
the row and the column

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.920
containing the 0, and we
have this matrix 1, 2; 3, 1.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.830
Now finally, we have
to walk over here,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.530
and we have to take 4
times the minor-- which

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:02.750
we get by covering up the row
and column containing 4-- 1,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.670
2; 3, minus 2.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.310
And now notice that these
are just 2 by 2 determinants

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.470
and we can just compute those
the same way we did earlier.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.463
Altogether, we get
minus 1, times 2

00:03:20.463 --> 00:03:31.190
minus another 2-- excuse me, 2
minus-- 2 minus a negative 4,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.130
so we get 6.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.750
OK, this one goes away.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.542
And then we have
plus 4, times, we

00:03:41.542 --> 00:03:47.260
have minus 2 minus another 6,
so it looks to me like minus 8.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.320
Altogether, we have minus 38.

00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:00.950
Now let's just take a moment
to see what we did on the 3

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.410
by 3 matrix.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.760
We needed to do a
Laplace expansion, which

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.720
means that we needed to
choose a row or a column.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.780
And we needed to take
the entries of the row

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.760
and add these up, multiplied
by the cofactor matrix

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.820
we got by covering up the
row and column containing

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.330
our highlighted entry.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.740
And we needed to do that
alternating the signs.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.820
So we got minus 1
times this cofactor,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.410
minus 0 times this cofactor,
and then finally, plus 4 times

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.240
this cofactor.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.790
Altogether, we got minus 38.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.300
OK, I'll leave it at that.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.518
Thank you.
