CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:12.210
In this video I'd like us to
work on the following problem.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.220
We're going to let
capital D denote

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.470
the portion of the solid sphere
of radius 1 that's centered at

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.110
(0, 0, 1), which also lies
about the plane z equal 1.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.090
And then I'd like us to
first supply the limits for D

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.610
in spherical coordinates.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.370
In other words, I want you
to determine the values

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.560
for rho, theta, and phi
that will give us all of D.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.490
And then, I would
like us to just set up

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.300
the integral for the average
distance of a point in D

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.540
from the origin.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.360
So there are two
parts to this problem.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.100
The first is to determine what
values of rho, theta, and phi

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.200
describe this solid
region D. And then second

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.940
is just set up the integral for
the average distance of a point

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.590
in that region from the origin.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.670
So why don't you pause
the video, work on those,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490
and then when you're
ready to see my solutions,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.823
you can bring the video back up.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.230
OK, welcome back.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.870
Well, I would say from looking
at this problem, actually part

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.330
a is potentially a little bit
more hazardous for some of us

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.380
than part b.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.310
Once we know the
bounds that describe D,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.950
it's not too hard to
set up this integral.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.590
So the hard part
of this problem is

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.690
understanding how to write this
solid region D in spherical

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.460
coordinates.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460
But it's actually really
not that hard either,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.429
so I'm going to try and take us
through it in a reasonable way.

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:41.970
So the first thing:
I'm going to draw

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.441
a very rough picture
of the region

00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:45.940
so we understand
what it looks like.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.490
So in order to do part a.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460
And if you did not do
this, I would highly

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.780
recommend that next time you
encounter such a problem,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.100
you begin by drawing
yourself a picture.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.740
Even if it's not
a great picture,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.010
it will give you some intuition
about what's happening.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.728
So let me first draw the axes.

00:02:03.728 --> 00:02:05.630
And ultimately
what I have-- say,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.010
here is the point (0, 0, 1).

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:16.390
I have a sphere that's
looking-- in the zy-plane,

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.970
it looks something like this.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.120
And so it has this depth here.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.660
And that's the solid sphere
I want to be considering.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.870
And then I'm going to be
removing the bottom half.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.320
I'm only going to be looking
at the part that is above the z

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.540
equals 1 plane.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.260
So actually it's going to be
all of the circular slices that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.500
are in the top half, the upper
hemisphere of this sphere.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.810
And so it's this
solid region there.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.240
That's D.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.840
And what I want to
do is to determine

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.480
rho and theta and phi.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.800
Actually, the theta is
the easy one, right?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.837
Because theta, at each value
here, I go all the way around

00:02:58.837 --> 00:02:59.795
in the theta direction.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.360
At any given height or radius,
I want to go all the way around

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.120
in the theta direction
from 0 to 2*pi.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.670
So my theta bounds
are the easy ones.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.200
I'm covering 0 to 2*pi in theta.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.760
Because if I cut off the
back half of the sphere,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.240
I want to only have a
restricted value of theta.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.330
But because I'm covering
all the way around

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.890
and my restriction is
only in the bottom half,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.540
my theta values haven't changed.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.870
So theta is easy: 0 and 2*pi.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.030
Now the harder ones are
going to be rho and phi.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.730
But in fact, actually, phi
is not that hard either.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.230
I notice phi is the
angle that I make

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.795
from the z-axis to
any given point.

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.170
So I notice that I certainly
am including the point where

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.680
phi is 0, and then I'm going
all the way down to a point

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.380
out here, which is a 45
degree angle with the z-axis.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.930
So phi is also easy.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.850
It's actually just
between 0 and pi over 4.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.180
And the rho will be the
slightly harder part.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.210
So that's really the
only really tricky part

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.070
in this problem is
determining the rho value.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.540
Now, the rho value, to
get the outer boundary,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.430
we'll look at that part first.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.010
Well, the boundary
of this sphere

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.041
here has a certain equation
in x, y, and z that we know,

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:34.540
right?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.710
It's x squared plus y squared
plus the quantity z minus 1

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.360
squared equals 1.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.040
I mean, that's just the
equation for a sphere of radius

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.711
1 centered at (0, 0, 1).

00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:47.460
So I'm going to write
that here, and we're

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.360
going to show how we
can manipulate that.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.310
Right?

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.730
x squared plus y
squared is r squared.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.290
r squared is rho squared
sine squared phi.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.180
So I can replace this by rho
squared sine squared phi.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.750
If you didn't know
that immediately,

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.770
you could make the
substitution for x and y

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.990
in spherical coordinates,
and it simplifies to this.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.500
So either way, if you didn't
know r squared was this,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.050
you can get it from just
doing the substitution.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.020
And then z is going
to be rho cosine phi.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.430
So here, I'm going to have
a rho cosine phi minus 1

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.650
quantity squared equals 1.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.330
This, in the
spherical coordinates,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.490
is describing the boundary
of this entire sphere, right?

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.780
And so I can actually
simplify this.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.980
It's not too hard.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.690
If I square this, I get
a little cancellation.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.540
And then because I
want my rho to be-- I'm

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.070
assuming in this region,
rho is greater than 0--

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.450
I can do a little
simplification.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.112
I come up with the fact that
rho is equal to 2 cosine phi.

00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:00.070
And let's describe
exactly where that is.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.690
That's the entire boundary
of this entire sphere

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.470
is described by rho is
equal to 2 cosine phi.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.810
And so I want to think about
what my bounds are for rho.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.620
Actually, I'm going to grab
a piece of colored chalk.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.410
If I start at the origin,
I think about what is rho?

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.450
So say this is a point on
the boundary of the sphere.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.140
I am going to start my
rho value-- whatever

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.930
it is when it hits
the plane z equals 1--

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.490
and I'm going to
stop it when it hits

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.380
the boundary of this sphere.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.430
So my outer boundary for rho
is going to be this value.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.830
It's going to be
determined by phi, right?

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.582
And now I have to determine
my inner boundary, right?

00:06:40.582 --> 00:06:42.540
And my inner boundary is
actually quite simple.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.630
It's a very simple
geometric thing.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.010
And so my inner boundary
deals with the fact

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.590
that if this is my
plane z equals 1,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.300
and I look at this
triangle I make right here.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.980
This angle down here,
the bottom angle is phi,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.360
and this is a right angle, and
the rho value I'm interested in

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.430
is this hypotenuse, right?

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.090
I need to figure out what the
length of this is right here.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.610
And you can see it right
away from just the fact

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:18.360
that phi is this angle here,
you get rho is secant phi.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.600
So the bottom boundary comes
from just simple geometry.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.290
You get this length is 1 here.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.190
So you get rho is equal
to secant phi, right?

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.239
This length here is
1, this is the rho

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:31.905
I'm interested in--
the blue part here--

00:07:31.905 --> 00:07:34.830
and so rho is equal to secant
phi is the lower bound.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.080
And it's equal to 2 cosine
phi at the upper bound, OK?

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.670
And the thing I want
to be careful of

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.820
is I'm not supposed to
include-- it won't matter

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.680
for the integral-- but I'm not
supposed to include the plane.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.440
Let me write this,
and make sure.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.780
Rho is going to be
greater than secant phi

00:07:53.780 --> 00:08:00.540
and it's going to be less
than or equal to 2 cosine phi,

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.990
right?

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.490
Right?

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.031
So let me double-check and make
sure I didn't make a geometry

00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:07.650
mistake here, just to be sure.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.710
This picture tells
me that cosine phi

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.740
is equal to 1 over rho.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.250
That's good.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.160
So rho is equal to
1 over cosine phi.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.000
So I get secant phi there.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.940
So my rho values start
at the secant phi length

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.960
and they go to the
2 cosine phi length.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.980
I know maybe I'm beating
a dead horse here,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.771
but I want to make sure
we understand where

00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:29.070
the rho values are coming from.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.986
So actually, I have all
the bounds I need now.

00:08:30.986 --> 00:08:34.100
I have the theta bounds,
and I have the phi bounds,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.590
and the rho bounds.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.970
Now you notice
that theta and phi

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.470
don't depend on the
other variables,

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.680
but rho depends on phi.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.790
So we're going to have
to integrate that first.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.867
So now we can deal with part b.

00:08:48.867 --> 00:08:50.950
Part b-- let's come back
over and remind ourselves

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.350
what it said-- said
set up the integral

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.600
for the average distance of
a point in D from the origin.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.080
So I'm taking the average
value of a function.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.190
What is that function
I'm averaging?

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.474
How do I find the
distance from the origin?

00:09:04.474 --> 00:09:05.890
Well, the distance
from the origin

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.098
is a great function to have
in spherical coordinates,

00:09:08.098 --> 00:09:09.540
because it's just rho.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.180
So the function I'm
supposed to average over

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.880
is the function rho.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.880
In spherical coordinates,
that's the function.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.010
So let me write down what
we're going to have here.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:27.050
So in part b, the
average distance

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:34.330
is going to equal 1
divided by the volume of D

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:44.000
times the triple integral over
D of the function rho dV, OK?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.520
So now I have to write dV in
the spherical coordinates,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.802
and I have to write D in the
spherical coordinates bounds.

00:09:50.802 --> 00:09:53.010
And then I know I have to
figure out the volume of D.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.640
So we're going to figure
out each of these things,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.012
and then we'll be done.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:56.600
All right.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.650
So first, what is
the volume of D?

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.080
Well, the volume of D, let's
think about what it is.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.180
It's a sphere of radius 1.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:13.400
And so the volume of a sphere
of radius 1 is 4/3 pi r cubed.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.740
And I want half of that.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.260
So I want 2/3.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.700
Since my radius is 1, I
just have to do 2/3 pi.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.980
So the first part is
1 divided by 2/3 pi.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.790
That's the volume of a
half-sphere of radius 1.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.855
And now let's integrate.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.502
I'll leave a little
space to write my bounds.

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:37.960
I'm going to write
the bounds last,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.080
after I have everything
in order over here.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.490
dV is rho squared sine
phi d rho d theta d phi.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:51.680
So I'm going to end up with
a rho cubed sine phi d rho d

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.750
theta d phi, right?

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:01.030
The dV gave me an extra
rho squared and a sine phi.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.830
That whole part is dV.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.660
And then I keep one
rho from the fact

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.100
that the distance
function is rho.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.181
And so I get a rho cubed there.

00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:11.430
So hopefully that makes sense.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:19.025
Now for d rho, I know the bounds
are secant phi to 2 cosine phi.

00:11:19.025 --> 00:11:22.820
For d theta, my
bounds are 0 to 2 pi.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.930
And for d phi, my bounds
were 0 to pi over 4.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.180
I didn't make you evaluate it,
I'm just making you set it up.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.510
That actually is the solution
we wanted for part b.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.340
I wanted to average the
distance from any point in D

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.520
to the origin.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.600
So I just took the average
value of the function rho

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.460
over that region D. And so
that's how you finish that up.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.190
And so in this
problem, basically we

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.030
want you to get really
familiar with how

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.800
to do some things in these
spherical coordinates, which

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.860
are sometimes a
little hard to do.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.450
But if you noticed, what we were
doing in trying to figure out

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.150
the bounds-- in particular,
trying to figure out rho--

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.210
we took what we
knew in the x-, y-,

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.940
z-coordinates about
certain relationships,

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.640
and then we replaced the x-, y-,
z-values by the values in terms

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.730
of rho and theta and phi, and
you can simplify to figure out

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.880
the relationships you have
between rho and theta and phi

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.410
for the boundary value.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.390
So that was one of the
techniques we were using there.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.430
And hopefully, the geometric
understanding of why these

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.130
angles go from 0 to 2*pi
and 0 to pi over 4 is clear.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.080
And actually, the
fact that this is rho

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.650
equals 2 cosine phi
should remind you

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.230
of the two-dimensional case
where you had some problem

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.510
like r equals 2 cosine theta.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.140
And that drew a circle
off-center from the origin.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.199
It's the analogous
thing happening here.

00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:52.490
Maybe I should stop there
before I say too many things.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.070
But again, the object
of this was just

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.880
to get really comfortable
with spherical coordinates,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.100
and I hope it's helped you.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.700
I'll stop there.
