DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.281
So the problem that I
want to work with you

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:15.110
now is to compute
some integrals,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.630
but we want to compute them
in the presence of a density

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.560
function.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.610
So the region that we're
considering is very simple.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.830
It's just the unit square.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.384
So we have the origin here,
we have the line x equals 1,

00:00:27.384 --> 00:00:29.050
we have the line y
equals 1, and we just

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.300
want to compute in this region.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.030
And so we want to use
this density function

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.500
to find various sort of physical
characteristics of this region.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.880
So first, we want
to find its mass,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.440
and so we are going
to need to recall

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.380
how you get mass from density.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.210
We want to find
the center of mass.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.960
That is, where is the point
on which we could balance this

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.670
if we cut it out?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.300
If we tried to balance
it on our fingers,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.120
where is the average
mass concentrated?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.810
We want to find the moment
of inertia about the origin,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.792
and we want to find the moment
of inertia about the x-axis.

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:12.750
So we're going to have
to remember our formulas

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.060
for moments of inertia.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.430
So why don't you pause
the video and work

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.660
on this for a little bit.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.950
Check back with me and I'll
show you how I solved it.

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:29.210
Hi.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.180
Welcome back.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.620
Why don't we start
by finding the mass.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.020
So the mass is the most
straightforward of these,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.020
and I find it helpful to use
the language of differentials.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.280
So what I want us
to do is I want

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.840
us to take a little square
here, and this little square

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.960
has area dA.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.830
OK?

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.750
And what we want
to do is we want

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.400
to sum up the masses of all
the little squares dA here.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.770
So what we want to know is what
is the little bit of mass dM

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.500
which corresponds to this
little bit of area dA.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.080
And more or less by
definition, this is delta dA.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.260
So delta is the ratio
of area to mass.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.020
And so this little
contribution of mass

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.200
is just delta times the
little contribution of area.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.950
OK?

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.070
Now, once we write
it this way, then

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.240
our total mass for
the entire square

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.970
is just the integral
over the region of all

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.820
the little contributions of dM.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.390
And so in particular, this
is just the integral from x

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.330
equals 0 to 1, y equals 0 to 1.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.500
We have x*y--
that's our density--

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.110
and then we have dy dx.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.690
OK.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.485
And this is an integral
which we can just compute.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.287
So why don't we compute
this one all the way through

00:03:26.287 --> 00:03:27.120
and see what we get.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.600
OK.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.910
So we have integral
x equals 0 to 1.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.820
So we have x*y, and we need
to integrate that in y.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.380
So we have x y squared over 2.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.350
And then y ranges
from 1 to 0, dx.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:04.940
So this is the integral from x
equals 0 to 1 of x over 2, dx.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:13.390
And this is just x squared
over 4 from 1 to 0.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.300
This is just 1/4.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:24.470
So that tells us that the
total mass of this unit square

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.140
is 1/4.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.950
OK.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.960
So now, we need
to do similar-- we

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.620
have a similar challenge for
the other physical quantities.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.807
We just need to figure out what
is the appropriate differential

00:04:38.807 --> 00:04:40.890
quantity, and then we just
need to integrate that.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.420
For b, we need to compute
the center of mass.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.950
So remember that
the center of mass

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.470
involves finding the
average x-coordinate

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.580
and the average y-coordinate.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.480
And I wanted to remind
you what the formula is

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.100
for the center of
mass, and remind you

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.900
how I remind myself of it.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.280
So in the formula for
the center of mass,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:26.790
we need to take the
average of x times dM

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.680
divided by the integral of dM.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.900
So this is our formula
for the center of mass.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.750
And I just wanted
to say that the way

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.160
that I remember this is
by thinking about seesaws.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.670
So if you think about
it-- and if we were not

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.490
doing multiple variables
but a single variable--

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.915
if I had a seesaw, and
I had some weights.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.360
So I had m_1 and m_2 and m_3
and m_4-- I had some weights--

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.900
and these were at positions
x_1 and x_2 and x_3 and x_4.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.540
Well, the fact that the
scale would be balanced

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.520
would be to say that this point
x here, where the fulcrum is

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.840
located, is exactly the weighted
average of these points.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.900
That's what's going to
guarantee that there's

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.590
the same amount of torque
pushing this way and this way.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.260
So if we were in one
variable and we just

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.180
had some discrete
weights, then we

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.100
would want to take the average
of all of these positions,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.940
and we would want to
weight it with the masses.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:06.040
So we would want to take the
sum of x_i*m_i and divide

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.720
by the sum of m_i.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.370
This would be the
average coordinates

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.420
in this kind of toy example.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.929
And now if you look at the
formula for the center of mass,

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:16.470
it's really the same
thing, isn't it?

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.350
Because integrals are just a
continuous version of the sum.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.850
We have x as a function
instead of x_i as a list.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:31.110
And the m_i's are just the
little infinitesimal dM's here.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.890
And then the bottom here is just
the total mass of the system,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.600
and so is this.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.820
OK, so that's how I think about
this center of mass formula.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.790
And it's actually
pretty easy to compute.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:55.060
So we have the integral from x
equals 0 to 1, y equals 0 to 1.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.830
So now we have x times
delta times dx dy.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:05.260
So altogether we get
x squared y dy dx.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.060
So one of those x's
is because we're

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.980
averaging x and the other one
is from the density function.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.150
So we have this whole integral.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.170
And then we divide by
this integral of the mass,

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.960
but we already computed
this in part a,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.110
and we found it to be 1/4.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.580
OK.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.050
So this numerator here is fairly
straightforward to compute.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.990
And if you do this
you'll get-- let

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.820
me double check-- I
believe we got 1/6.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.990
So you should get 1/6 when
you compute this integral.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:49.570
So we have 1/6 over 1/4, and
so cancelling off, this is 2/3.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.600
OK.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.080
So that was just the
x center of mass.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.900
But now I want to make
an important point, which

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.040
is that this density function
is symmetric in x and y.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.320
It was just x times y.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.000
It wasn't something
more complicated.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.210
And so the center of
mass in the x-direction

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.010
is just equal to the center
of mass in the y-direction,

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.751
so these are both equal to 2/3.

00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:14.250
OK.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.850
So that depended on the fact
that our density was symmetric,

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.560
and also on the fact
that our region was

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.490
symmetric about
switching x and y.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.620
So we could save ourselves
some trouble here.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.520
OK, very good.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:36.620
So now to do c, again
we need to recall

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.330
what is the infinitesimal
moment of inertia.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.950
So let me draw
this picture again.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.720
So here's our little dA here.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.930
And we want to know the
infinitesimal moment of inertia

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.850
around the origin.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.839
So we tie a string to
this little piece of mass,

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:02.380
and we start spinning
it, and we want

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.950
to know what is our moment
of inertia corresponding

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.250
to that little mass.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.980
And I'll just remind
you from lecture

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:14.340
that the formula
is r squared dM.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:24.470
So this is r squared
times x*y dx dy.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.430
And so the r squared
here is saying

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.220
that as you get farther
and farther out,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.500
your moment of inertia is
getting larger and larger.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.090
And this makes sense in
terms of the physical idea

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.780
that you're moving a longer
distance if you're farther out.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.280
So anyway.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.590
So this is our
formula, r squared dM.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:59.290
And so that tells us that I
is just the integral of dI.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.670
And so this is the integral
from x goes from 0 to 1,

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.610
y goes from 0 to 1.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.950
And then we have x
squared plus y squared--

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:18.380
that's just r squared--
times x*y dx dy.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:41.280
And so we can rewrite this as
x cubed y plus x y cubed dx dy.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.840
And this is a computation
that we can do.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.490
Let me just check
my notes real quick.

00:11:54.026 --> 00:11:55.680
So this is 1/4.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.810
I'll skip the computation,
but this is just

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.810
integrating some polynomials,
so we can do that.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.770
All right.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.935
And now finally, we want to
compute the moment of inertia--

00:12:10.935 --> 00:12:14.240
so remember, d asked us to
compute the moment of inertia

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.510
around the x-axis.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.510
So instead of around the
origin, it's around the x-axis.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.165
So the idea here is the same.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:33.210
So again, dI is a
factor times dM.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.340
And again, it's the
radius, but now it's

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.000
the radius about
which we're spinning.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.260
So we're not anymore
spinning around the origin

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.550
as we were doing before.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:48.750
Now we're spinning
around-- sort of out

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.620
of the board-- around
the x-axis here.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.240
But we still have
the same formula,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:13:00.180
and now our radius
is the height y.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.700
Because we're not spinning
around the origin anymore,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.690
we're spinning
around this rod here.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.720
And so if you think
about it, that's

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.110
the radius about which we're
spinning is just the height y.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:20.160
So this is just y squared delta.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.150
OK.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:31.610
And so that tells us that
I-- the total inertia

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.150
about the x-axis-- is
just the integral of dI.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.470
And so we get the integral
from x equals 0 to 1,

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.200
integral y equals 0 to 1.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:54.510
And then we just have
y squared x*y dy dx.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.030
And this, again, we
could compute-- and let

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:07.860
me just check my notes--
and find that it's 1/8.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.340
So in each of these problems,
the most important thing

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.530
to have been able
to do is to argue,

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.150
what is this sort of
infinitesimal contribution

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.147
to the physical quantity
that you want to compute?

00:14:26.147 --> 00:14:27.730
And eventually, you
want to express it

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.840
in terms of the quantity dA,
because dA is what we actually

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.720
can integrate.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.620
And so all the other
physical quantities

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.190
that we need to
study are going to be

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.930
an integral of some
infinitesimal element,

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.560
and that infinitesimal
element is

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.590
going to be some
coefficient times dA.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:53.960
So here, we had that
this was-- oh, dear.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.370
This is a mistake.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:04.420
So this should have
said y squared dM,

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.980
and that's y squared delta dA.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.730
So I wrote the delta implicitly.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.730
I wrote it twice.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.550
So what we meant to say is
dI is y squared delta dA.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:22.720
And so in all these examples,
the infinitesimal quantity

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.220
that we're after is some
straightforward coefficient

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.500
times the infinitesimal area.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.460
And so once we know
that, then we can just

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.500
do a straightforward integral.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.035
OK, and I'll leave it at that.
