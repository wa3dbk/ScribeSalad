JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.120
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.360
In lecture, you've been learning
about surface integrals, flux,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.760
and the divergence theorem.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.540
And I have a nice
problem here that'll

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.780
put your knowledge of
those things to the test.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.480
So in this situation,
I have a hemisphere.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.190
So this is a hemisphere.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.420
It's the right half of
a sphere, so the part

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.420
where y is positive, or
non-negative, I guess.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.370
So just the surface of that
hemisphere, and it has radius R

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.920
and it's centered at the origin.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.380
So I have this hemisphere
and I have the field F, which

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.200
is given by y times j hat.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.835
So it's just always
in the y-direction.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.232
So I have this field and
I have this hemisphere,

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:50.690
and what I'd like
to do is I'd like

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.630
you to compute the flux of the
field through this hemisphere.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.700
But as a hint,
rather than doing it

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.910
by computing the surface
integral by parameterizing,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.310
what I'd like you to do is
to use the divergence theorem

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.340
to make your life a
little bit easier.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.710
So why don't you pause
the video, take some time

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.240
to work that out, come back
and we can work on it together.

00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:20.960
Hopefully, you had some luck
working on this problem.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.080
Let's see how we
can go about it.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.470
So the thing that we're
asked to compute--

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.020
let's give this a name,
just so we can refer to it.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.960
So let's call this surface
of the sphere S. All right.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.550
So we want the flux through
S. And so the flux through S

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.540
is the double integral
over S of our field F

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:54.020
dotted with the normal, with
respect to surface area,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.820
so with respect to surface area.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.090
So I guess this was a kind
of bad choice, this S. We've

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.450
got S that means-- this
S means the sphere,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.170
this S just means surface area.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.800
OK.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.700
Hopefully, you can
keep those two sorted.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.530
This is the thing that we want.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.940
And we'd like to compute it--
rather than by parameterizing

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.250
this hemisphere, we'd like
to compute it by using

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.640
the divergence theorem.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.750
So the divergence
theorem relates

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.140
the integral over a surface to
a triple integral over a region.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.860
So what we'd like to find is
a solid region for which this

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.360
is all or part of the boundary.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.980
Now this half
hemisphere-- rather,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.490
half-sphere, this
hemisphere-- doesn't actually

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.190
enclose a region, but
there's an obvious region

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.820
that's closely
related to it, which

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.760
would be the solid sphere.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.240
If you just filled in
that half-sphere there.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.910
So then, for that solid
sphere-- so the right half

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.080
of the solid sphere, with radius
R, centered at the origin,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.670
that hemisphere, that
solid hemisphere,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.840
has a surface that
consists of S,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.100
and it also consists of a
disc centered at the origin.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.950
So it consists of--
I'm going to draw it in

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.650
right here-- it's this disc.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.030
This one.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.320
That disc right there,
together with our hemisphere

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.460
that interests us,
make up the boundary

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.880
of this solid hemisphere.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.830
So I'm going to
call that disc-- I'm

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.310
going to give it a name--
I'm going to call it S_2.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.975
So we want this
integral and we're going

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:38.140
to use the divergence theorem.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.380
So the way we're going to
use the divergence theorem

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.210
is we're going to use the
divergence theorem to relate

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.490
this double integral
over a surface

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.874
to that triple integral.

00:03:46.874 --> 00:03:49.290
But I'm going to have to get
S_2 involved because I need--

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.790
for the divergence
theorem to apply,

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.760
I need surfaces which
completely bound a solid region.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.540
So what we know by
the divergence theorem

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:10.250
is that the double integral
over both S and S_2 of F

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.600
dot n hat with respect
to surface area

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.940
is equal to the
triple integral--

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.020
OK, so I guess I need
another letter here.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.240
So I'm going to call this D
for that whole half-hemisphere,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.522
the solid hemisphere.

00:04:26.522 --> 00:04:27.980
So D, this is the
solid hemisphere.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.670
So this D is the
solid hemisphere

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.400
that they bound--
of-- OK, so it's

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.820
the triple integral over
D of the divergence of F

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.450
with respect to volume.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.300
So this is what the
divergence theorem tells us

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.670
and now we-- so OK.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.570
So good.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.360
So now what's going to be
nice is that in this case

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.080
this triple integral is going
to be very easy to compute.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.630
And the surface
integral over S_2

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.980
is going to be easy to compute.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.565
And so what we're going to be
left with-- after we compute

00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:13.690
those two things, we'll be
able to subtract and get

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.460
just the surface
integral over S.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.080
So lets think about
doing those things.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.690
So first let's do the
surface integral over S_2.

00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:31.250
The surface integral
over S_2 of F

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.590
dot n with respect
to surface area.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.150
Well, what is F
on that disc S_2?

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.970
So let's go look at
our picture again.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.290
So this disc is the disc
of radius R centered

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.025
at the origin in the xz-plane.

00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:52.700
So it's in the xz-plane.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.310
So that means it's in
the plane y equals 0.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.750
So F on that disc is just 0.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.840
It's the zero field.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.670
It's 0 everywhere on that disc.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.690
And if you take a surface
integral of a zero field

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.130
dot the normal vector, well,
0 dot the normal is just 0.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.540
So if we come back over
here, this integrand

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.820
is 0 dot the normal.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.210
So it's always 0.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.520
So we're integrating 0.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.100
So we just get 0.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.730
Definite integral of 0 is 0.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.190
Double integral of 0 is 0.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.120
Great.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.645
So this S_2, the
surface integral of F

00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:34.760
is really easy to compute.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.430
That's the first one we needed.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.505
Now we need the triple integral.

00:06:38.505 --> 00:06:41.700
So let's compute
the triple integral

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:49.300
over the solid
hemisphere of div F dV.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.140
Well, what is div F?

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.370
Well, you know, so
div F is just the sum

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.440
of the partial derivatives
of the three components.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.530
So in our case if
we go back and look,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.660
well, F is 0 i hat plus
y j hat plus 0 k hat.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.830
So when you take the
partial derivatives

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.920
you get 0 plus-- the
partial derivative of y

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.680
with respect to y is just 1,
plus-- from the third component

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.910
we also get 0.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.845
So the divergence--
let's go back over here--

00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:20.970
the divergence is just 1.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.780
It's just a constant 1.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.830
That's great.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.180
So this triple integral
is equal to-- I'm

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.580
going to bring it
down here-- so it's

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.470
equal to the triple
integral over D of 1 dV.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.500
But, of course,
when you integrate 1

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.430
over a solid region
what you get is just

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.220
the volume of that region.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.560
So whatever this number is, it's
the volume of that hemisphere.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.100
Well, OK, so what's
the volume of a sphere?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.195
It's 4/3 pi R cubed.

00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:52.890
So the volume of a
hemisphere is half of that.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:58.270
So that's 2 pi R
cubed divided by 3.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.770
So that's the triple
integral of the divergence

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.260
over the solid region.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.640
So what does that mean?

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:16.910
So our integral, the integral
over S of F dot n with respect

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.570
to surface area is equal
to this triple integral

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:31.650
over D of div F dV minus
the double integral over S2

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.590
of F dot n d surface area.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.730
And so we just saw that
this is equal to 2 pi

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.150
R cubed over 3 minus 0.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.610
But 0 is 0.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.570
So it's just 2 pi
R cubed over 3.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.200
So let's quickly recap.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.370
To start off with, we
just had this hemisphere.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.880
And we're asked to
compute a surface integral

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:04.050
over this hemisphere of
a flux of this field F.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.740
So rather than going ahead
and calculating it directly,

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.650
what we realized is that
by the divergence theorem,

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.040
we could consider this to be a
difference of a triple integral

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.210
minus another
surface integral such

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.690
that those two surfaces together
bounded the region that you

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.000
were triple integrating over.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.437
So in principle, there
were many possible regions

00:09:28.437 --> 00:09:29.520
that we could have chosen.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.470
Many possible solid
regions that we could

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.990
have chosen to do that
triple integral over

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.990
and to use the other
half of its boundary.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.690
But there's one
particularly nice one,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.510
which is just the
solid hemisphere

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.710
of which this hemisphere
S was the boundary,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.140
or part of the boundary.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.580
And so then that gave us this
other part of its boundary

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.240
was this disc.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:57.120
So we introduced this
new solid region, D,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.290
and the rest of
its boundary, which

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.130
was this other
surface, this disc S_2.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.360
And so then, by the
divergence theorem,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.950
rather than computing
the integral

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.840
over our original
region S we could just

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.470
compute the triple integral
over the solid region

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.170
and the surface integral over
the other half of the boundary.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.000
So sometimes that
won't be helpful.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.230
Sometimes you'll
have an ugly field,

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.530
you'll have an ugly region,
things won't work out.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.580
But in this case, it
worked out really nicely.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.550
The triple integral
was easy to compute,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.139
as we saw over here, because
the divergence was constant.

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:36.930
Because the divergence
was just equal to 1,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.480
the triple integral
just gave the volume.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.210
And the other surface
integral was also

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.010
easy to compute because F dot n
on that surface was equal to 0.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.940
So integrating it was very easy.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.650
We just were integrating
0 and we got 0.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.740
So in this case, these choices
worked out very, very nicely.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.330
They made our life
nice and simple.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.370
And so in the end,
all we had to do

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.860
were these two almost
trivial integrals.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.889
They didn't really require any
computation at all on our part.

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:06.430
And then a little
bit of subtraction,

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.870
except we were subtracting 0 so
even the subtraction was easy.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.100
So that was what we did,
worked out very nicely,

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.150
2 pi R cubed over
3 was our answer.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.710
And I'll end there.
