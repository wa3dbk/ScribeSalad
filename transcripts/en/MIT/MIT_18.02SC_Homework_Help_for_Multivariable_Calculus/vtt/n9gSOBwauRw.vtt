CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.600
In this video, I want us to work
on the following problem, which

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.720
is to show that this vector
field is not conservative.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.140
And the vector field
is minus y*i plus x*j,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.220
all divided by x
squared plus y squared.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.740
So you can think about this
in two separate components,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.590
if you need to, as minus y
divided by x squared plus y

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.760
squared i plus x over x
squared plus y squared j.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.029
So that's really
exactly the same thing.

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:37.320
So your object is to show
that this vector field is not

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.320
conservative.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.529
And why don't you work on that
for awhile, pause the video,

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:43.570
and then when you're ready
to see my solution you

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.736
can bring the video back up.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.820
So welcome back.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.082
Well, maybe some of you thought
I had a typo in this problem

00:00:58.082 --> 00:00:59.540
initially, and I
wanted you to show

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.004
it, in fact, was conservative,
but it actually is not

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:04.170
a conservative vector field.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.180
And let me explain how we can
show it is not conservative

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.540
and why probably what
you did initially to try

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.985
and show it was not didn't work.

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:15.860
So maybe that wording
was a little confusing,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.270
but let me take you through it.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.730
So the first thing
I would imagine

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.710
you tried is you looked
at M sub y and N sub x.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.690
So M in this case is negative y
over x squared plus y squared.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.050
And N in this case,
capital N in this case,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.760
is x divided by x
squared plus y squared.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.120
So if you worked that
out, you probably did

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.480
or maybe you didn't,
and I'll just show you.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.690
M sub y-- let me just
double check-- is y

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.910
squared minus x squared over
x squared plus y squared,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.410
I think with an
extra squared on it.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.130
Yeah.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.210
And that's also
equal to N sub x.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.710
Right?

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.680
So what you know so far,
what you might have thought

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.880
immediately, was well, N sub x
minus M sub y is the curl of F

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.390
and that's equal to 0, and
therefore this vector field

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.730
is conservative.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.070
But the problem is the
theorem you were thinking

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.480
about referencing doesn't hold.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.000
And the reason is
because there are

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.330
two hypotheses in that theorem.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.980
And one is that if I
define this vector field,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.350
if I call it capital F, the
vector field-- or the theorem

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:30.110
is that capital F defined
everywhere, and curl

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.275
of F equal to 0,
implies F conservative.

00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:40.730
OK.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.350
So that's the theorem you
might have been trying to use.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.930
You see from this the
curl of F equals 0,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.070
but the problem is the first
part of this statement,

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.370
that F being defined
everywhere, is not true.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.990
In fact, there's one place in
R^2 where this vector field is

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.829
not defined, and that is
when x is 0 and y is 0.

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.870
Because at that point,
obviously, the denominator

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.120
is zero and we run into trouble.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.050
So you cannot use this theorem
to say F is conservative

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.760
because it's not
defined everywhere.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.460
Or I should be careful
how I say that.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.890
There is somewhere
that it is not defined.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.647
So even though the
curl of F equals 0,

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:18.480
the first part of the
statement is not true.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.220
So you cannot get anything
out of this theorem.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.510
So knowing the curl of F equals
0 doesn't tell you whether it's

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.610
conservative or not.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.750
OK?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.270
So now what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.911
going to show-- I
told you we want

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.160
to show it's not conservative.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.250
I'm going to show you
how we can show that.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.900
And what we're going to do is
we're going to find a loop,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.277
a closed loop, so a
closed curve in R^2,

00:03:41.277 --> 00:03:43.610
that when I integrate this
vector field over that closed

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.910
curve, I don't get zero.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.550
And then we would know that
the vector field is not

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.830
conservative.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.540
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.274
So let me write
it out explicitly

00:03:56.274 --> 00:03:58.690
and then we'll figure out the
curve we want and then we'll

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.860
parameterize the
curve appropriately.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.610
So I'm going to show,
for some closed curve--

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.160
I'm going to pick
my curve and I'm

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.826
going to integrate
over the closed curve

00:04:07.826 --> 00:04:09.330
and I'm going to integrate this.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.790
Minus y over x squared
plus y squared dx plus x

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.610
over x squared
plus y squared dy.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.390
And I'm going to show that
if I pick a certain curve,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.710
I'm going to get something
that's not equal to zero, OK?

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.070
And the curve I'm going to
pick is the unit circle.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.120
So we're going to let
C be the unit circle.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.280
Let C equal-- I'll just
write the unit circle.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.180
But how can I parameterize
the unit circle easily?

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.980
I can parameterize
the unit circle easily

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.380
by x equal to cosine theta
and y equal to sine theta.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.850
So let me do that.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.510
And why am I picking
the unit circle?

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.660
We'll see why that
is in a second.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.750
So we're going to let x equal
cosine theta and y equal sine

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.046
theta.

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:04.420
And so now we know
what goes here

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.700
and we know what goes here.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.100
By the way, what is x
squared plus y squared?

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.260
It's cosine squared
theta plus sine squared

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.160
theta, which is equal to 1.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.850
This is exactly the
square of the radius

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.160
and since we're on the
unit circle, that's 1.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.710
That's why I picked
the unit circle

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.790
because I wanted the
denominator to be very simple.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.590
So I've got the x's and the y's.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.310
Now what's dx?

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.920
dx is going to be equal to
minus sine theta d theta.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.010
And what's dy?

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.970
I'll just write it
right underneath here.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.980
dy is going to equal
cosine theta d theta.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.620
So let me just point out
again what we were doing here.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.600
We want to parameterize
the unit circle.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.650
I chose to parameterize it in
theta, which I haven't told you

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.030
what my bounds are yet, but
I've done everything else.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.230
I needed to know
what x and y were

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.510
and also what dx and dy were.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.210
And so now I can
start substituting in.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.380
So let's figure out what I get
when I start substituting in.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.581
I'm integrating now.

00:06:03.581 --> 00:06:05.330
Again, I said I didn't
mention the bounds.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.240
What are the bounds on theta
to get the whole unit circle?

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.200
I'm just going to
integrate from 0 to 2*pi.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.170
So I integrate from 0 to 2*pi.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.650
That takes me all the
way around the circle.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.310
Minus y is negative sine theta.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.660
This part is 1 as I
mentioned earlier.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.230
And then dx is minus
sine theta d theta.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.990
So I have a minus sine theta
times a minus sine theta.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.560
That's going to give me a
sine squared theta d theta.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.720
And then this term,
the second term,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.600
when I integrate
over the curve, I'm

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.090
going to just rewrite
another one here separately

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.404
momentarily.

00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:45.970
x is cosine theta.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.285
x squared plus y squared is 1.

00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:50.010
And dy is cosine theta d theta.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.215
So I get cosine
squared theta d theta.

00:06:52.215 --> 00:06:52.970
All right?

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.420
Now here we are.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.010
If I tried to integrate
both of these separately,

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.860
it would take potentially
a very long time

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.400
and be kind of annoying.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.720
But if you notice, because
I can add these integrals,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.660
I can add over-- they
have the same bounds,

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.660
so I can put them back together.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.490
Sine squared theta plus cosine
squared theta always equals 1.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.350
That's a trig identity
that's good to know.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.050
So this in fact is equal to the
integral from 0 to 2*pi of d

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.960
theta.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.934
So let me come
back one more time

00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:29.100
and make sure we understand.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.320
We're integrating from 0 to 2*pi
sine squared theta d theta plus

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.730
cosine squared theta d theta.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.940
That's just sine squared
theta plus cosine squared

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.920
theta d theta.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.040
So that's 1.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.090
So 1 times d theta.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.920
But what is this?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.420
Well, this integral from 0
to 2 pi of d theta is theta

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.980
evaluated at 2*pi and 0.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.770
I actually get 2*pi, which is
in particular not equal to 0,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.660
right?

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.950
So that actually shows you
that this vector field is not

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.060
conservative.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.940
Now why does this make sense?

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.680
This makes sense
because if I really

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.960
think about what I'm
doing-- actually,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.532
this is the place where maybe
it'll ultimately make the most

00:08:05.532 --> 00:08:06.990
sense-- what you're
doing is you're

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.120
looking at how theta
changes as you go all

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.400
the way around the origin once.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.240
And theta changes by 2*pi.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.620
If you go all the
way around one time,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.750
the theta value starts at
0 and then goes up to 2*pi.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.120
And so that's exactly where
this 2*pi is coming from.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.002
So that actually
is ultimately how

00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:27.460
you were going to be able to
show that this vector field is

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.880
not conservative.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.430
So let me go back and just
remind you where we came from.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:35.510
We started off
with a vector field

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.284
and we wanted to know if
it was not conservative.

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:40.450
We wanted to show-- sorry--
it was not conservative.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.241
So the first thing you
might want to check,

00:08:42.241 --> 00:08:45.880
which maybe you did, was
if the curl was zero.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.920
And in fact the curl is zero.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.470
And so maybe you
thought, well, she

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.685
might have done something
wrong, or she might

00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:52.893
have written something wrong.

00:08:52.893 --> 00:08:56.510
But we can't actually appeal to
the theorem you want to appeal

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.210
to to make any conclusion
about the vector field,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.390
because the vector field in
our example is not defined

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.570
for every value of (x,y).

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.090
So for every value in the
xy-plane, we cannot define F.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.890
There's one value for
which we cannot define F.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.050
And so we cannot say
that if the curl's 0,

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.540
then the vector field
is conservative.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.130
We can't draw any conclusions
from this theorem.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.890
So then we had to
actually find a way

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.820
to show it was not conservative
without looking at the curl.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.120
And that amounts to showing
there is a closed curve

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.274
that when I integrate
over that closed curve--

00:09:27.274 --> 00:09:29.690
when I look at what the vector
field does over that closed

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.300
curve-- I get
something non-zero.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.610
And we picked an easy example.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.270
This is actually
what the integral

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.240
will look like over the
closed curve in x and y.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.080
We let our closed curve
be the unit circle,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.070
then we parameterized in theta.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.020
And we see that actually what
this vector field is doing

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.630
is it's looking at
what is d theta?

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.440
It's finding out
what d theta is.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.890
And so we find out the integral
from 0 to 2*pi of d theta is

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.385
obviously not zero.

00:09:55.385 --> 00:09:57.260
And that gives us that
the vector field's not

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.420
conservative.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.900
So that's where I'll stop.
