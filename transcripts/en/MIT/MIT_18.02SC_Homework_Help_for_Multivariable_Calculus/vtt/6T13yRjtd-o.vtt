CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.590
In this video, what
I want to work on

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.770
is using what we know
about matrix multiplication

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.420
and finding inverses of matrices
to solve a system of equations.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.910
So we've set up
the system already

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.690
as if it's already
in matrix form.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.170
And what I'd like us to do
is, for this particular A--

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.250
this 3-by-3 matrix A-- find a
vector x, so that A*x equals b.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.357
Where b is equal to
these two things.

00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:36.815
So you're going to
do two problems.

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:39.480
You're going to do when b
equals 1, 2, negative 3.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.220
And you're going to do when
b is equal to [0, 0, 0].

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.340
So you want to find vector x
so that A*x equals this value

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.954
here.

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:48.370
And what I'd like
you to do is I'd

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.190
like you to use the
strategy that you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.027
saw in the lecture,
which is find A inverse,

00:00:55.027 --> 00:00:56.110
and then take A inverse b.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.850
So we really want to practice
understanding how to find

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.350
the inverse of a matrix.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.839
So why don't you work on
this, pause the video.

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.380
When you feel
comfortable, confident,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.224
that you have the right answer,
then bring the video back up,

00:01:08.224 --> 00:01:09.890
and you can compare
your work with mine.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.027
OK, welcome back.

00:01:19.027 --> 00:01:21.110
Well, hopefully you were
able to make some headway

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.740
and you feel confident in
your answers for 1 and 2.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.700
I am going to find the
inverse of the matrix A first,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.610
and then solve the problem.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.850
And because there's
a lot of computation,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.980
I may make a mistake.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.105
So I'm going to have to
check every once in a while

00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:37.090
that I'm doing OK.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.157
So hopefully, it's-- too bad
you can't tell me if I've made

00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:42.490
a mistake, but hopefully my
studio audience will help me

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.260
out.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.690
So the first thing
I need to do is

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.200
I need to find the
determinant of A.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.050
So I'm going to do
that first, and then

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.540
I'm going to find the cofactor
matrix and go from there.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.410
So if I want to find
the determinant of A--

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.819
I guess I'll just use
the first row here,

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:04.860
because it's pretty easy.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.443
So the determinant
of A is going to be

00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:10.920
3 times the determinant of this
matrix, this 2-by-2 matrix.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.600
So it's going to be
3 times-- and then I

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.600
get a 2 times negative
1, which is negative 2,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.550
and then minus 0, so I
get a 3 times negative 2.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.050
Oops.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.010
And I was about to write plus,
but I should write minus.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.100
I take minus 1 times--
because this is my minus,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.150
I take negative of
this thing times

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.230
the matrix that is these two
components in the first column

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.290
and these two components
in the second column.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.790
Right?

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.960
We take away the column and the
row that the 1 is contained in

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.460
and we look at what remains,
the 2-by-2 matrix that remains.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.240
And we find the
determinant of that.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.450
So we get negative 1 times
negative 1, which gives me a 1.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.960
And then negative 1
times 0 gives me a 0.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.470
So I just have the negative 1
from the row 1, column 2 spot,

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.250
and then the determinant
of the matrix that remains

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.180
is 1, OK-- of the minor
matrix that remains.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.160
And then the last one
I should put a plus,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.270
but notice that it
is a minus already,

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.170
so I'm going to put just
minus 1 times what remains.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.990
What's this minor?

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.740
This one is this 2-by-2
matrix I'm looking at, right?

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.220
So I need to take
the determinant

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.490
of this 2-by-2 matrix and
multiply it by that negative 1

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.670
to get the third component
here I have to add in.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.130
Negative 1 times
negative 1 is 1.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.077
And then I subtract
negative 1 times 2.

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.660
So this is where I
have to be careful.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.990
It's 1 minus negative 2.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.400
So I'm going to get a 3.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.670
OK.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.710
1 here minus a negative 2-- so
1 plus 2-- I'm going to get a 3.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.480
OK.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.460
And so negative 6 minus
1 minus 3-- looks like I

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.374
get a negative 10.

00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:50.040
That's good, because
I think that's what

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.210
I'm supposed to get.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.340
OK.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.540
Now what I want to do is I want
to find the matrix of minors

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.090
for A. And then
I'm going to find--

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.890
so I'm going to find the
matrix of minors first,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.840
and then I'm going to switch
the signs appropriately

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.010
so I get the cofactors correct.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.829
OK?

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.120
So some of them I already have.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.120
But, the whole
matrix of minors, I'm

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.970
going to just go through and do
it again, to be very careful.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.960
So the first one I delete.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.940
For the first row
and column spot,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.560
I delete row 1 and
column 1, and I

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.030
look at the determinant
of that matrix.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.160
That's 2 times negative
1 is negative 2, minus 0,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.510
so I get a negative 2 there.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.440
For the first row, second
column I come back,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.650
and I'm now again looking-- I'm
deleting this column and row,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.230
and so I'm looking at the
determinant of this matrix.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.490
So I get negative
1 times negative 1

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.942
is 1, minus 0, so I get a 1.

00:04:44.942 --> 00:04:46.900
Again, I'm going to change
all the signs later.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.600
So I'm going to do that
in the second step.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.020
Now I'm in row 1, column 3.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.940
So I'm going to delete
row 1, column 3 and look

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.970
at the determinant
of that matrix.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.590
I get negative 1 times negative
1 is 1, minus the negative 2,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.820
so there's my 3.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.020
Those I already knew,
but I didn't want

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.459
to just plop them in from here.

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:08.000
But notice that is
what you get here.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.410
Negative 2, 1, and 3.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.570
That's exactly where
they come from, right?

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.920
We got them by the same method.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.750
OK, and so now I want to find
the minors for the rest of it.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.740
So let's look at-- when
I delete row 2, column 1,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.200
I'm left with 1,
negative 1 here.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.200
Negative 1, negative 1 here.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.700
Right?

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.980
So 1 times negative
1 is negative 1.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.830
And then negative and
negative is positive.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.690
So it's negative 1
minus negative 1,

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.200
so I get negative 2.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.660
That one was a lot of signs,
so you might want to check.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.300
Maybe I should check.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.430
OK, maybe I should check.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.300
I'm deleting this
column and this row,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.290
so I get 1 times negative 1.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.290
That's a negative 1, right?

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.870
Negative 1 minus--
negative 1 times negative 1

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.080
is 1-- and so there's
negative 1 minus 1.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.810
That looks good.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.560
Negative 2.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.060
Right?

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.268
Negative, negative, negative.

00:06:00.268 --> 00:06:00.960
Yeah.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.150
OK.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.270
And then I'm looking
at row 2, column 2.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.130
So now I'm deleting this
row and this column.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.399
All right.

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:14.190
And so I have these
sort of diagonals here.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.150
That's what I'm
interested in, right?

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.570
So I get 3 times negative 1.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.100
That's negative 3.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.430
And then minus 1, because I
have negative 1 times negative 1

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.260
is positive 1.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.210
So negative 3 minus 1.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.981
So I should get negative 4.

00:06:28.981 --> 00:06:29.480
Right?

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.760
And then I'm over here.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.800
So I need to delete this
column and this row.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.010
So I get 3 times
negative 1 is negative 3.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.720
Minus the negative
1, that's plus 1.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.034
So negative 3 plus
1 is negative 2.

00:06:46.034 --> 00:06:48.450
And before I go on, I'm going
to check those first 2 rows.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.033
Because if I made a mistake now,
it's only going to get worse.

00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:52.730
What did I have?

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.420
Yes.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.919
OK.

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:54.930
So far so good.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.750
Whew.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.520
All right.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.210
Next, final row.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:03.660
OK, final row is, I'm
going to delete this column

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.470
and row here, and I'm
looking at this matrix.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.720
1 times 0 is 0.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.160
2 times negative 1 is negative
1, but I subtract that.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.730
So it's 0 minus
negative 2, so it's 2.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.790
And then row 3, column 2.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.300
So row 3, I delete
row 3 and column 2.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.090
3 times 0 is 0.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.800
0 minus-- negative
1 times negative 1

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.730
is 1-- so 0 minus 1,
that's negative 1.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.960
And then the last
spot, I'm deleting

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.310
this row and this column.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.740
So 3 times 2 is 6,
minus negative 1.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.280
I get 7.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.960
All right, let's check that row.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.990
2, negative 1, 7.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.490
OK.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.720
I have not done the
cofactor matrix yet,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.530
because now I need to change
the appropriate signs.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.677
OK, so if this is
the matrix of minors,

00:07:53.677 --> 00:07:56.010
then if I want to change it
to the cofactor matrix, what

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.060
do I have to do?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.690
I'm going to scratch this
out and write the cofactor

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.144
matrix so that we can just
change the signs appropriately.

00:08:03.144 --> 00:08:04.560
I'm going to do
it all right here.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.570
And how does it work?

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.090
Well, remember I'm going to go
plus, minus, plus; minus, plus,

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.830
minus; plus, minus, plus.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.860
I have to do this grid
that starts with plus

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.960
and alternates minus.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.810
So this sign stays the
same, this sign switches,

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.090
this sign stays the same.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.630
That's the plus, minus, plus.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.200
This one is going to
be minus, plus, minus.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.690
So the minus switches that.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.490
Plus keeps that the same.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.430
Minus switches that.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.010
And then I was at
minus, plus, minus.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.300
So I'm going to have
plus, minus, plus.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.690
And so these two stay the
same, and this one switches.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.220
So a lot of things that were
negative became positive.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.880
And I had to change-- maybe
I threw in one negative,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.090
maybe not.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.080
But, so all the signs I kept,
this one stayed the same,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.230
this one stayed the same,
this one stayed the same,

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.890
these two stayed
the same, and then

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.990
these four switched,
because it's

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.010
the plus, minus,
plus sort of grid

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.980
that I have to put
on top of this.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.870
OK, so that's the
cofactor matrix.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.620
We're getting closer.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:04.320
OK, now we need the
transpose of this, right?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.220
So if I look at the
transpose-- actually,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.430
know what I'm going to do?

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.290
Because I'm also just going
to have to take the transpose

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.330
and then multiply it by
1 over the determinant,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.190
I'm going to do
that all at once.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.980
OK.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.940
Because we can do that
all at once, and then

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.750
we don't have to worry about it.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.230
So A inverse I know is
going to be negative 1/10,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.720
because the determinant
was minus 10.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.680
So it's 1 over the determinant
times the transpose

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.790
of this matrix.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.417
So the transpose
of this matrix--

00:09:34.417 --> 00:09:36.250
remember what I'm going
to do is essentially

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.000
you fix the diagonal and
you're going to flip.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.050
That's really what, in
the square matrix, that's

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.230
how you can think about it.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.310
But every column is
going to become a row.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.417
So I'm going to write
this as my first row.

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:47.500
This first column is going
to become my first row.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.390
So it's going to be negative
2, 2, 2 as my first row.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.765
And then the next
column is going

00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:57.670
to be negative 1, negative 4, 1.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.010
I mean next row.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.930
I will take a column
and change it to a row.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.220
The next row is going to be
negative 1, negative 4, 1.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.360
And then the last one.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.620
I take this column and
I change it to a row.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.970
It's going to be 3, 2, 7.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.780
OK.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.446
And because again, I
want to make sure--

00:10:16.446 --> 00:10:18.395
this one is really
messy-- I want

00:10:18.395 --> 00:10:22.200
to make sure I have something
similar for that, or exactly

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.800
that.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.530
OK.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.850
I think I'm still
doing all right.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.587
Now, let's get to
solving the problem.

00:10:27.587 --> 00:10:29.920
Because so far, we just were
finding the inverse matrix.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.503
So I'm going to leave
it in this form,

00:10:31.503 --> 00:10:33.230
instead of dividing
by 10 in every spot,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.290
because that will be annoying.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.850
So let's think
about how do I want

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.870
to solve the system that I had.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.990
I had A*x equals b.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.920
And actually, I
mean, my strategy

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.770
is to find the inverse matrix.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.380
I didn't talk to
you about why we

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.454
know the inverse
matrix actually exists.

00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:55.370
But ultimately, you
haven't even seen this yet

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.619
in the lecture videos, really.

00:10:56.619 --> 00:11:00.390
Except that you know that the
determinant of A being non-zero

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.790
gives you an inverse matrix.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.750
That's all you know, I
think, at this point.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.130
You have the determinant
of A. It's non-zero,

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.100
so you can find
an inverse matrix.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.650
Makes sense based on the
formulation you have,

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.000
because if the determinant
is 0, then this quantity 1

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.010
over the determinant
of A, you run

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.590
into quite a bit of trouble.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.050
So that's just as
a little sidebar,

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.960
we know the inverse
matrix exists for A.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.470
So what we do-- this
is again the strategy--

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.370
you multiply A inverse A
times x on the left side.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.056
Ooh.

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:34.000
Is equal to-- sorry-- that
should be the lowercase b.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.370
Should be a vector there.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.800
It is equal to A inverse
b on the right-hand side.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.100
And you notice,
it's very important,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.830
in the matrix
multiplication video

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.490
we saw that it's very
important the order in which

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.700
you multiply matrices.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.900
And since I'm putting A
inverse on the far left

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.940
of this side of the equality, I
have to put it on the far left

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.461
of the right-hand
side of the equality.

00:11:58.461 --> 00:11:58.960
Right?

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.640
And in fact, you
would run into trouble

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.430
if you tried to switch
the order of these.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.929
OK?

00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:05.250
We wouldn't be able
to multiply them.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.000
All right?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So A inverse A, we know is
just the identity matrix.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.340
So you get the
identity matrix times x

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.430
is equal to A inverse b.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:22.640
So you can find x by
finding A inverse times b.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.470
Right?

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.140
And so now we have A inverse.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.860
Let's see if we can
solve the problem.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.080
One point I want to make is that
now that you have A inverse--

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.850
I've tried to ask you to solve
the problem for two different

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.320
b's-- you don't have to go and
find A inverse again, right?

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.570
You're done finding A inverse.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.130
You just now have to
do the multiplication.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.997
So now for number
1, we had b was

00:12:41.997 --> 00:12:43.580
equal to-- I'm going
to write it here,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:49.120
so I don't have to keep looking
over-- 1, 2, negative 3.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.120
So A inverse b is going
to be equal to-- well

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.680
I should get another
vector, so I should just

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.610
have three components here.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.200
And I'm probably going to
have to write out what I get,

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.359
because it might be long.

00:13:03.359 --> 00:13:05.150
But let's see-- actually,
you know what I'm

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.787
going to do to make it easier?

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:08.620
Because there's a lot
of junk going on here.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.328
So what I'm going to
do to make it easier

00:13:10.328 --> 00:13:13.272
is put the negative
1/10 in front to start.

00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:14.730
Because that negative
1/10 is going

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.742
to come along with
every term, so I'm

00:13:16.742 --> 00:13:18.950
just going to put the negative
1/10 in front and deal

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.290
with it at the end.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.516
OK?

00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:22.890
So now I'm just
going to multiply

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:27.310
b-- which is this 1, 2, negative
3-- by this big matrix here

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.480
without the negative
1/10 in front.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.404
OK?

00:13:30.404 --> 00:13:31.320
So let's look at that.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.050
We're just going to have
first row times the column,

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.020
and that's going to give
me the first position.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.115
So negative 2 times
1 is negative 2.

00:13:40.115 --> 00:13:42.030
I'm going to write
them all down.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.350
Plus 2 times 2 is 4.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.300
Plus 2 times negative
3 is negative 6.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.730
So that's the first position.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.920
We'll simplify in a moment.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.180
So the next one, I get
negative 1 times 1.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.490
That's negative 1.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.450
Then I get negative 4 times 2.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.550
That's negative 8.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.190
So minus 8.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.080
And then I get 1 times
negative 3, so minus 3.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.750
So we've got two
of the rows done.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.940
We just have to simplify
them in a moment.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.360
And now we just do
this third component.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.000
So it's the third row of A
inverse without that scalar

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.890
in front, times the
only column of b

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.810
to give me the last position.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.450
Right?

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.250
So 3 times 1 is 3, plus 2 times
2 is 4, so I get 3 plus 4,

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:31.250
and then 7 times
negative 3 is minus 21.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.090
OK.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.940
So what do I get when
I write it all out?

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.500
I get negative 1/10.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.750
And then-- so negative 8 plus
4, that looks like a minus 4.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.660
Right?

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.210
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.144
That looks like a negative 12.

00:14:46.144 --> 00:14:47.310
It's a lot of adding for me.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.950
I make a lot of adding mistakes,
so we should be careful.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.170
This looks like negative 14.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.030
OK.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:58.499
So this is a matrix that,
it's just a vector, right?

00:14:58.499 --> 00:15:00.040
All the negative
signs will drop out.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.750
I'll get some fractions.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.245
But if it is the correct
answer-- which I'm really

00:15:05.245 --> 00:15:07.370
hoping it is, because I
just did this whole problem

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.490
and I hope it's the
correct answer--

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.640
if it's the correct answer,
then what should it do?

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.760
When I take the original A
that I had and I multiply it

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.020
by this, I should get b.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.870
I should get 1, 2, negative 3.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.910
So you can check your work
very easily to see if it works.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.350
You can take A times this,
and see if you get b.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.340
Right?

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.740
And then you'll know if this
is the x we were looking for.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.090
OK?

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.550
And then let's
look at number two.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.260
I just said that b
equals [0, 0,  0].

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.960
And the point I
want to make there

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.660
is that since this
has an inverse,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.940
A inverse-- since A has
an inverse, A inverse b

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:50.270
is going to be-- in this case--
A inverse times [0, 0, 0],

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.860
which is going to
give you [0,  0, 0].

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.420
So the only solution we have in
this case-- because A inverse,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.897
if I look and I try and multiply
every row by this column,

00:15:59.897 --> 00:16:02.530
right, I'm going to get
0 in the first spot,

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.060
0 in the second spot,
and 0 in the third spot--

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.570
so the solution I get-- the
x I'm looking for so that Ax

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.760
equals [0, 0, 0]-- is [0, 0, 0].

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.000
And what I just want
to mention to you,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.390
is that that is true
because A is invertible.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.230
If A were not invertible, you
could get other solutions.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.230
Other things might work.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.990
And that's also true,
actually, in this case as well,

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.860
but it's a little harder to
see that it's-- that could be

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.480
potentially a weird thing.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:39.090
To solve A*x equals
[0, 0, 0], it's sort of like,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.380
naturally we see
[0, 0, 0] is a solution.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.884
Right away you can see that,
and that's one that we get.

00:16:43.884 --> 00:16:46.050
The point I want to make
is because A is invertible,

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.620
that's the only solution.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.330
And if A were not
invertible, you

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.260
could get other
solutions to that.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.570
So that's something that
we haven't seen yet--

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.680
we haven't dealt
with yet-- but that

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.140
is something that can happen.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.160
So I just want to point out that
there could be an oddity if A

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.490
were not invertible.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.740
But since A is invertible,
we get just one solution

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.470
for both of these things.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.740
OK.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.815
So I'm going to go back
and just remind you

00:17:08.815 --> 00:17:11.470
of a few things of how we
found the inverse matrix,

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.210
and then I will stop.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.690
So we were given a
matrix A. And to go

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.570
through the steps of finding the
inverse matrix, what did we do?

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.900
The first thing we did was
we found the determinant.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.690
Then we found the
matrix of minors.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.150
And then I just took
that matrix of minors,

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.410
put the plus-minus
grid on top of it

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.150
so that I got the
cofactor matrix.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.650
Right?

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.360
And then once I had
the cofactor matrix,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.517
you just have to transpose it.

00:17:35.517 --> 00:17:36.350
So I came over here.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.740
I transposed that, and I put
1 over the determinant of A

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.260
in front.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.700
So the scalar is 1 over
the determinant of A,

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.190
times the transpose of
the cofactor matrix.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.971
And that's what
gives me A inverse.

00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:48.470
So there are a fair
number of steps,

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.710
but you can do them
very systematically,

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.300
and then you have the inverse
matrix that you're looking for.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.220
And then you can solve for x,
when you're looking for A*x

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.490
equals b, and you
know b and you know A.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.720
And you do this same process
we just outlined here again,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.590
and that gives it to you.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.456
OK, I think I'll stop there.
