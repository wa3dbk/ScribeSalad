DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.560
I'd like to work this problem
with you, in which we're

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.560
going to use
determinants to compute

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.320
the area of a parallelogram
sitting in a plane.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.600
So why don't you take
a moment to-- why

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.320
don't you take some time to work
this out, and we'll check back

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.700
and you can see how I did it.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.820
OK, so let's get
started on this problem.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.900
Now the first thing
that we need to be

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.040
careful about with
this problem is,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.697
we know that we want
to take a determinant,

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:49.780
but we need to be careful.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.510
Determinants of pairs
of vectors make sense.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.910
Determinants of points
do not make sense.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.900
So here we have
these four points,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.376
which are the endpoints
of the parallelogram.

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:05.950
And what we need to do
from these four points

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.500
is get some vectors that
we can compute with.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.860
So over here, I have
taken the vectors

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.210
which connect the endpoints
of the parallelogram.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.180
So you'll see that this
[6, 1] here, this vector [6,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.600
1] is coming from the point
(1, 1) in the original

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.650
parallelogram and (7, 2).

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.050
So this vector [6, 1] is
just the difference of (7, 2)

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.690
and the point (1, 1).

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.650
And similarly [5, 2]
here is the difference

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.990
of our original point (6, 3)
and our base point (1, 1).

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.690
So now that we have
these two vectors,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.690
the area of our
parallelogram is just

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.620
going to be the determinant
of our two vectors.

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:12.630
Well, we'd better be careful.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.270
It's going to be plus or
minus the determinant,

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.770
is going to be the area.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.460
So let's compute
this determinant.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:34.890
So we find 6 times 2 minus
5-- so we get 12 minus 5 is 7.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.610
Now we got a positive number,
and so this plus or minus

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.130
we take to be positive.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.560
Had we computed our determinant
by transposing the rows here,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.654
then we might have
found a negative 7,

00:02:47.654 --> 00:02:49.570
and of course we want
our area to be positive,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.520
so we would just choose 7.

00:02:57.567 --> 00:03:00.150
So, let me just go through the
one tricky part of this problem

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.610
is the original endpoints of
our parallelogram are not what

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.130
are important for the area.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.500
What's important is
the vectors which

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.200
connect the two of our
endpoints together.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.100
And so we computed those,
[6, 1] and [5, 2], and then

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.170
taking their
determinant gives us

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.610
the area of the parallelogram.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.438
OK, I'll leave it at that.
