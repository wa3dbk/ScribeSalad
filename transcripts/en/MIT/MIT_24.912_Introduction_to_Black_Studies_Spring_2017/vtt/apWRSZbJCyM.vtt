00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.157
MICHEL DEGRAFF: I
think it's a nice topic

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:28.561
to end this semester, because
in a way, it brings together,

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.797
I think, some of the
main threads that we've

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:32.198
through this semester.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.801
But also, in fact, the
last point of the text,

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:39.906
alliteration I can sense my
point to wait into the future.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:45.912
So without further ado, we have
Lorraine, Will, and Cynthia.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:50.483
GUEST SPEAKER: So this is
our presentation on language

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.152
resistance and liberation.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.553
Welcome to the
last day of class.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:57.557
Congratulations (CHUCKLING)
for getting this far.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.560
So as the road map, we're
going to go through first

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.729
"Rethinking Literacy,
A Dialogue,"

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.330
the piece by Freire and Macedo.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.265
Macedo?

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.399
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Freire and Macedo.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.100
GUEST SPEAKER: Macedo?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.801
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Macedo.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.169
GUEST SPEAKER: Macedo.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.137
And then we're going to look
at the "Literacy and Critical

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.941
Pedagogy" piece, and then end
with the MIT Haiti initiatives.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.180
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.882
So this is just a little bit
of a background on the writers

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.717
of the first two pieces.

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.720
Both of them are educators
in critical pedagogy.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.191
And one is from Brazil, and
one is Cape Verdean-American.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:38.798
GUEST SPEAKER: So
in the first piece,

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.668
Freire mentions the premise--
the main premises of culture,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.036
and I think that
these are really

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.170
important to keep in mind,
because this is a really

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:49.609
interesting and, I think,
powerful way to frame culture.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.213
The first one is that cultural
processes are intimately

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:56.216
connected with social relations,
especially with class relations

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.785
and class formations,
with sexual divisions,

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:01.187
with racial structuring
of social relations,

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:05.692
and with age oppressions
as a form of dependency.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:06.459
Got it?

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:07.694
[chuckling]

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.695
OK.

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:10.597
The second one,
culture involves power

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.733
and helps to produce asymmetries
in the abilities of individuals

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:17.337
and social groups to define
and realize their needs.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:19.639
And third one, culture
is neither autonomous

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.474
nor an externally
determined field,

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:25.078
but a site of social
difficulties and struggles.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.784
Those ideas are really
important to keep in mind,

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.554
because this paper
also raises the idea--

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.422
I know it is a
social field, which

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:41.628
is kind of the combination
of all of the beliefs, myths,

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:46.065
aspirations, hopes of a part
of a society, of a culture,

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:50.803
and so it includes things
such as why racial hierarchies

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.406
exist, to why sexual
divisions exist,

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:58.378
and like what roles gender
people play in a society.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.380
And it's really important
to keep that in mind,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.248
because if you're able
to keep that in mind,

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.050
then you're able to think
critically about that.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.252
And through the critical
process of engaging with it,

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:08.388
you're able to change
the social field.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.923
And so I think that
that's important,

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.457
because even though
this paper raises

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:15.361
a lot of really powerful
ideas, it's still not perfect.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.864
So one of the
quotes of this paper

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.200
is, "Literacy's oral
dimension is important,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.435
even if it takes place
in a culture, like that

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:25.371
of the United States, whose
memory is predominantly

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.207
written, not oral,
like that of Africa."

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.178
Africa is not
(LAUGHING) country.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.319
And so something like that is
also part of the social field,

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:41.254
and would make it
into this paper.

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:44.591
Because even though Freire and
Macedo are thinking critically

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.460
about this, they
are not engaging

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.165
with the full reality of
cultural objectivity and being

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.333
subjects within that.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.004
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:01.274
So in the next
article, Paulo Freire

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:04.744
talks about the use of language
as a form of resistance.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.313
And he first starts
talking about how

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:10.750
the current traditional methods
in literacy how they tend

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.553
to ignore the
importance of language

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.922
in a person's education.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:21.127
And he bases a lot of his
theories on his experiences.

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:26.199
And from the second quote he
says that, "The sad reality

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:27.934
is that while
education in Portuguese

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:31.371
provides access to positions
of political and economic power

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.806
for the higher echelon
of African society,

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.175
it screens out the
majority of the masses, who

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.844
fail to learn
Portuguese well enough

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:41.080
to acquire the necessary
literacy skills for social,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.483
economic, and
political advancement."

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:47.754
And you definitely-- from the
way that he mentions this,

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.856
you could definitely see
a lot of like correlations

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:52.558
between what's going on
around the world and currently

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.695
in the United States.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:05:04.370
And you could definitely
see that the 1%

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.706
usually have the most
control over things,

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:10.376
and that they usually tends to
drive how policies are made.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:13.112
But the fact is that
when a person is taught

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.548
in their native language, they
tend to learn things better

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.117
and comprehend things faster.

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:21.454
And can we go to the next slide?

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:25.358
There's usually backlash when
it comes to different languages

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:27.527
taught in schools.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.896
For example, in
the US, people say

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.533
that students should learn
how to speak standard American

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:34.901
English.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:39.672
But when it comes to providing
these sort of opportunities

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.874
to minority groups of,
I guess for instance,

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:44.344
like students of
color, there is usually

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.846
some racial tensions
that develop

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:50.116
that make minority
students feel inferior.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.318
For example, there was
an article mentioned

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:56.022
of like recently, like
March of 2017, that

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:59.992
talked about a robotics
team that recently had won

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:05.898
the challenge, and the fact
that after they had won

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:07.834
the students-- or I
guess people in the crowd

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:09.369
started screaming
at them and telling

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.637
them to go back to Mexico.

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:14.941
And so this form of like
demeaning commentary

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:19.479
tends to drive the dropout
rates of minority groups,

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.949
and all of this tends to
contribute to like the prison--

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.551
sorry, the school
to prison pipeline.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:28.221
As you can see in
the infographic,

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.556
it gives a lot of
percentages talking

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.291
about this sort of issue.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.060
You can see in the
bottom, it says

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.664
that 68% of all males in
state and federal prison they

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.100
do not have a high
school diploma.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.502
And this tends to be--

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:47.073
gives statistics on students.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:51.110
And all of this tends
to stem from the fact

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.879
that minority
students do not have

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.582
the same access to education
as the elite part of society.

00:06:56.682 --> 00:07:00.486
And from personal experience, I
can definitely relate to this.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.923
I went to a school about like an
hour and a half from my house,

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:08.361
and I definitely did have a lot
of good role models growing up.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.930
But were definitely students
around my neighborhood

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.568
that didn't have the same
access to the same opportunities

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:17.937
that I did.

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:20.206
Some of them did drop
out to start working.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.707
Others were influenced by
gangs around my neighborhood.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.977
And you could definitely--

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:26.512
things are definitely
getting better,

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.548
but things could
definitely be improved

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:33.252
from an emancipatory
literacy approach, which

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:35.021
is what Paulo Freire mentions.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:38.558
Yeah.

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:41.961
So in emancipatory
literacy, this

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:44.630
involves using the
language of the people,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.765
rather than the elites.

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:48.067
It teaches students to
accept their experiences

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.836
and their culture.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.705
And this moves from the
world of objectivity

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.741
to the world of subjectivity,
where individuals learn

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:57.743
to accept themselves
for who they are,

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:00.179
rather than feel like
they're a victim of society.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:04.584
And Paulo Freire does
mention that achieving

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:08.221
emancipatory literacy is
hard, but it's not impossible.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:13.059
And now I'll-- and so Lorraine
wants to talk about a few

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.961
examples of how this
is being used today.

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:21.667
So considering specifically
the case of Haiti--

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:25.304
which Michel works a lot on,
the MIT Haiti initiative--

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:28.875
virtually all of the schooling
in both K through 12 education

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.978
and then in higher education
is done in French, and not

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.613
in Kreyol.

00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:36.448
But the problem is that most
people only speak Kreyol

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.652
fluently, so like 95% or
so, and very few people

00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:41.953
speak French fluently, at all.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:44.524
So when you go through school,
and everything is in a language

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:46.325
that you don't
understand, how are you

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:49.195
supposed to be able to actually
get any of the education,

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.997
get any of this
social engagement,

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:52.465
especially if
children are punished

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.233
for speaking Kreyol in school.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.302
And they can't interact
with each other,

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:58.337
can't ask questions,
can't gather

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:01.274
any of the information
that's coming at them.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:05.244
So it's based on this false
belief and really outdated

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.246
belief about the
hierarchy of languages,

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:10.016
about which languages are
created or are younger,

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:13.185
or anything like that, and that
Kreyol isn't developed enough

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:17.423
to be able to be used for
technical language for STEM

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:21.794
education to have anything
translated into Kreyol.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.196
And part of that is
saying that like Kreyol

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:26.332
isn't widespread enough,
even though Kreyol

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:28.267
has almost 10 million speakers.

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:31.470
Finnish has only about
5.5 million speakers,

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.607
and yet in Finland all of that
education is done in Finnish.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:38.744
And people have-- studies have
found that, in Finland, kids

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:42.448
are much better equipped
to be able to learn

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:45.985
a second language, and to
go into higher education

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.788
and gather all of these
like technical studies,

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:53.159
because all of their
education is done in Finnish.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:58.798
And over at IAP, I was doing
MISTI GTL in the Catalonia

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:04.170
region, in Spain, and there
Catalan also has a little

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.439
under 10 million speakers.

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:09.208
But in Catalonia
all of the education

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:11.577
is in Catalan, which
made it difficult for me

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:14.380
as like a "Spanish
speaker"-- like not even

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.515
fluent, but trying to
speak Spanish speaker--

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.217
to be able to
teach the students.

00:10:18.317 --> 00:10:20.753
But they had such
a better experience

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:24.056
with all of their
textbooks in Catalan

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.792
all of their computer software.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:28.828
So I was trying to teach
them Inkscape and Gimp,

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:30.596
but everything was is
(CHUCKLING) Catalan,

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:34.000
and I just couldn't understand
like even how to open a window.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.835
So they taught me
a lot about this.

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:38.671
And they-- all of
them speak Catalan,

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:41.140
and Spanish, and
English, and then they

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.343
can like learn German or
French on the side, as well.

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:47.480
So all of them, because
their initial education

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.148
K through 12 and then
higher education,

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:52.018
if they want it to be,
is in Catalan, then

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:53.753
they can learn all
of these other things

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:58.591
just as well as we do like
in English, which is mostly

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:03.229
our one and kind of only
language in the United States.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.096
Yeah.

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:05.798
So that was my experience.

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:11.070
And what-- a school that is like
a really good model in Haiti

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.571
is the LKM School.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.207
I didn't know how to pronounce
it in Kreyol, so it's LKM.

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:17.777
It's a K through 10
school in a rural part

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:20.813
on an island of Haiti,
and their education

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:23.883
is starting to be in this
model of all Kreyol education,

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.885
trying to teach all
of these subjects, all

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.620
of the technical
terms in Kreyol.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.889
And the students are
learning much better

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:33.025
than the rest of the students
in Haiti, who's schooling

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:38.197
is French and who only 10%
graduate from high school.

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.032
So the linguistic
apartheid part of this

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:42.968
is that, when you teach somebody
in a language they don't

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.237
understand, you
prevent them from being

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.907
able to move into different
socioeconomic classes

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:50.142
to attain the education
and the success

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.310
that they should be able to.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.048
And this all leads to
the MIT Haiti initiative

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:59.485
that Michel started
here between MIT and all

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:01.787
the Haitian education systems.

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:07.793
So a couple of their main points
are to teach educators in Haiti

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.995
that teaching in Kreyol
is perfectly fine,

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:12.164
that it is actually
better for the students,

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:14.500
that it gives them
more opportunities,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.902
and that STEM and
technical subjects

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:18.537
can be taught in Kreyol.

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:21.173
So a lot of the
worries or concerns

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:24.643
are that like Kreyol doesn't
have words for these languages.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.145
We didn't have
words for a computer

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:28.414
either up until when
they were created.

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:32.017
A lot of other languages borrow
words from other languages.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:35.354
So I learned Japanese,
and in Japanese there's

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.189
this lovely thing called
[speaking japanese]

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:40.192
where you just grab words
from other languages.

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:41.894
So if you don't know
how to pronounce it,

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:44.130
you kind of like make
it sound like it,

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.532
and oftentimes, it is
what has been borrowed.

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:49.735
So for example, bread
is pan, from German.

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.403
And all of these
other languages have

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.706
words borrowed from
other languages,

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.540
and that's what
globalization does.

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:58.277
So the same thing should be able
to happen with Kreyol and STEM

00:12:58.377 --> 00:12:59.378
learning.

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:01.413
And the really good
results of this

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:04.016
are that they affirm students'
cultures and backgrounds,

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:07.119
and their own upbringings, and
how the society actually works,

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:10.456
as opposed to a colonial
oppressive society.

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.792
And it equalizes students
being able to have

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:15.661
more social mobility, and
to attain what they want

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:17.096
and what they should be able to.

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.635
GUEST SPEAKER: So
to kind of tie this

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:27.339
back to what we can do to stay
woke, with regards to literacy,

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.008
I think it's important
to remember that,

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.843
"language is a mediating
force of knowledge,

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.611
but it is also
knowledge itself."

00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:37.016
And so one approach
is for groups

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.652
to kind of come together
and create a language that

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.921
describes their experience
amongst themselves,

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:44.423
and then to share that language
and to share that experience

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:47.226
in their own language.

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:50.329
And I think that that is one way
that we can start breaking away

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:57.036
from the kind of putting
standard English on a pedestal,

00:13:57.136 --> 00:14:01.507
and can also kind of
validate other discourses,

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.109
and other ways of being,
and of other just languages

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.346
that kind of already exist in
the US and across the world.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.420
Questions.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.891
How have our
understandings of literacy

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.026
evolved in response
to the internet,

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:22.828
unprecedented
global integration,

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:25.698
and increased pressure
to preserve human rights?

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:27.733
For example, what does
it mean that schools

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.869
repress the development
of subjectivity,

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.104
but do largely ensure literacy?

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.606
How can modern
notions of literacy

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:36.909
evolve to address the phenomena,
such as the proliferation

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.310
of fake news?

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.514
So if we're moving past literacy
as just the idea of being

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.917
able to read, and
we are entering

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:49.455
this new kind of this new
wave being defiantly pushed

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.423
by the internet and the
influence of technology

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:53.626
on the way we live,
literacy is coming

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.896
to be a more critical
approach to life in the sense

00:14:56.996 --> 00:14:59.565
that fake news is
a thing, you know,

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:02.301
and it's actually quite hard to
distinguish what news is really

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.602
what news is fake.

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.671
And the ability to do that,
having that critical lens,

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:08.741
is maybe the next
evolution of literacy.

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.977
So any ideas on that, I
guess, is the question.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.182
AUDIENCE: So I'm just gonna
answer the first part of this,

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.885
because I'm not sure if I have
an answer for the next two.

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.688
But something that
I think is kind of

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.857
hilarious about like the
integration of the internet

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:26.992
is that I think it's
simultaneously making us more

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.028
literate and less literate.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:31.730
So like-- or like pressuring
you to be more literate.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.365
So "pressuring" you
to be more literate

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.467
is like, now there's a bunch
of sources that you can read,

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:37.036
and like now you can
be more educated,

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:39.972
it's all open to the public
if you have a computer.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.607
And then there's also
like the pressure

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:45.277
to speak English properly,
based off either, you know,

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:48.280
like there's one viral video,
this old grandma screaming

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.482
at this Hispanic woman
in IHOP because she

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:52.451
was paying in Spanish,
or something like that.

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:55.621
So like it puts pressure on
you to speak English correctly,

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:58.324
and then meanwhile, because
of like things like Facebook

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:00.359
and like any social
media, people

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:04.997
like don't speak English
correctly, like typing,

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:07.032
you know,
abbreviations and stuff

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.168
that's acceptable in text,
but like meanwhile we're

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.236
saying you should
speak English properly.

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:14.440
So it's kind of a
weird dichotomy.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.108
GUEST SPEAKER: I'm
interested in the age

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:20.713
implications of what you
just said, kind of aligning--

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:24.717
kind of a critique towards
the use of different varieties

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:27.486
of English with older
generations and the use

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:28.954
of nonstandard
varieties of English

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.689
with younger generations.

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:33.058
I'm interested in that.

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.561
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think--

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.496
I mean, I guess like--

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:41.033
so like there's a grandma that
I know that's on Facebook,

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:44.236
and like she makes sure
to type everything out,

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:45.537
including punctuation.

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:47.439
And like her Facebook
posts are longer

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:50.909
and they're more like here's
a card, that type of thing.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.413
Whereas like my Facebook,
A, I'm just sharing things,

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:56.115
but B, if I write
anything, it's probably

00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:58.450
not good, proper English.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.285
So I think it does
depend on your age group,

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:03.589
but also like going back to the
original point of, you know,

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.424
that grandma screaming
at the Hispanic woman

00:17:05.523 --> 00:17:08.694
in IHOP, like it's not just
like an older woman screaming

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:10.329
because, you know,
she's more literate.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:12.664
Like there's also like
kids who think like, oh,

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.833
you have to speak
English in here.

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:18.537
So like there is still that
weirdness between like how

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:20.906
older people act on Facebook,
and stuff like that.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:24.476
But I still think like the point
of, you know, pressuring people

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:26.045
is regardless of age.

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:31.350
AUDIENCE: I think
because we're gonna

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.087
be talking about language,
which is dialect in this class,

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:37.689
I would kind of risk
saying that we're

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.992
kind of creating a new language
because of the internet

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:42.227
with like all the
abbreviations and things.

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.529
And there's the way--

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.964
the push for speed and
everything like that.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.767
So I think the reason
that older generations

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:51.136
don't use it as much is
because they're not used to it,

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.072
and they're in a different
frame of reference

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:55.441
and they just haven't learned
this new dialect that we're

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:57.142
starting to use.

00:17:57.242 --> 00:18:01.280
So I think that it's a
good thing, in a sense,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.515
but a lot of people who
want that standard American

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:06.251
English are going to be
pushing us to go back to that,

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:08.287
as opposed to using
the internet language.

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:12.958
But going as far as our
changes in literacy because

00:18:13.058 --> 00:18:15.727
of the internet, like I didn't
know if the ending was satire,

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:16.862
at first.

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:18.297
Well, I just didn't know
that the ending existed.

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:20.732
And then when I saw that, I
realized that that was satire.

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.501
I think that nuance
like that is something

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.670
that you miss especially
with the internet,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.440
because you can't really express
sarcasm very clearly over just

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.741
plain text.

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:31.376
And I think that's something
that we're like struggling

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:35.714
with, because of the internet.

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:37.282
AUDIENCE: But I
think that you said--

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:38.684
you talked about The Onion.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:43.755
I think that shows like Stephen
Colbert or the Colbert Report,

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:46.091
and shows like
that, show that we

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:48.861
have been dealing with that
sort of satire language issue.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.529
Because for a long
time, people rushed

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:53.932
[inaudible] didn't realize
that it was satire.

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:57.336
So I think that we've
done this before,

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:59.304
and it's sort of
a different cycle.

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:03.609
Now it's on the net
instead of being TV.

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:06.011
AUDIENCE: I wanted to bounce
off what you originally said.

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.013
Like with like it's
not a bad thing

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:09.548
that we're checking
the language,

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:11.783
I agree with thi It's
kind of like [inaudible],,

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.085
as you mentioned.

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:16.054
Do you think like there
are certain rules,

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.789
like the way we type,
and like is there

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.126
like a way to be literate like
with our new abbreviations?

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:22.728
AUDIENCE: I think
there definitely is.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:27.166
Like for instance, punctuating
sentences with like LOL or ha

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:28.367
ha.

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:29.768
Like the beginning of the
end, where you put that.

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.470
Using emojis to get
more emotion in it.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.305
Like there's definitely
like a science to it

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:37.943
that we kind of fell into, but
didn't realize was [inaudible]..

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:38.577
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:39.511
OK, cool.

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:41.813
I understand what you're saying.

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:47.085
GUEST SPEAKER: My question
is, so knowing now

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.221
that people grow up in
the type of literacy,

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:51.990
whether it's traditional
or emancipatory,

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.760
what are the pros and cons
of your type of literacy?

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.564
And explain why we should
move towards or away

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:01.366
from an emancipatory literacy.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.544
AUDIENCE: I think you all
gave some really great points

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:16.982
towards moving to
emancipatory literacy.

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:23.622
I mean, if it's helping people
learn, I don't see a down fall,

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:29.294
especially because it's kind
of broadening their world view.

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:32.297
A couple of presentations
ago, there were other students

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:35.834
who were playing
jeopardy with AAE,

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:39.137
and that was kind of like
broadening their worldview.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.606
Like even if you
went to the school

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:44.743
and didn't speak AAE you were
learning about a new language

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.378
that you weren't familiar with.

00:20:46.478 --> 00:20:49.147
And so they were able to do this
through the emancipatory sort

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:49.948
literacy.

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:51.283
MICHEL DEGRAFF: What's AAE?

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:54.353
AUDIENCE: Oh,
African-American English.

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:55.320
Sorry.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.321
Not AAPE.

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:07.432
AUDIENCE: So kind of just
playing devil's advocate

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:09.301
a little bit, I think--

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:12.037
I guess one of the dangers
of emancipatory literacy

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:15.173
might be kind of this
non-standardization

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.476
like with issues like Common
Core and things like that.

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:19.411
We kind of have an
educational system

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.313
that's set up so that
everybody's kind of put

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:24.016
on the same level,
to some extent.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:27.519
Like everybody has that same
kind of baseline education.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.755
But like with
emancipatory literacy,

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.858
I think you're going to find
educational programs are more

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.594
geared towards a specific
like cultural norms

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:37.663
and things of that nature
related to whatever

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.131
population it targets.

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:42.467
So I wonder if that
could potentially

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:44.303
produce a system in
which certain students,

00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:46.238
even though they're
receiving an education that

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:49.241
is geared towards them,
it's objectively not

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:50.776
that same quality
of student who are

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:55.814
receiving more of a traditional
Thwere's the approach.

00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:58.083
[inaudible]

00:21:58.183 --> 00:21:59.518
GUEST SPEAKER: I
want to push back

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.987
on that just a little
bit, because I think

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:05.757
that the standardized
approach to education

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:08.527
is the approach that's
been taken with, you know,

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:10.796
teach for a test
approach, and it's failed.

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:12.397
It's been failing
for a while now,

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:15.300
and I think that a lot of people
in education policy and even

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.369
just teachers are
recognizing that now.

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:19.938
And I think that education--

00:22:20.038 --> 00:22:22.374
emancipatory literacy gives
us an interesting lens

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:25.444
to think about how to educate
people so that they can learn.

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:28.246
And I think maybe
another place you

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:29.915
can start kind of
investing energy

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.184
is thinking of ways in
society that we can value

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:35.520
those different ways of
knowing and being and learning,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.256
so that it's not just,
you went to college,

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:40.726
so you deserve to be paid a
lot of money kind of thing,

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:43.995
and it's a, oh you can
build a table from scratch.

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:47.366
How do you get paid to do that?

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:49.000
AUDIENCE: Where do
you think MIT falls

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:53.405
on the spectrum of like
emancipatory literacy?

00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:54.773
[laughing]

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:57.909
GUEST SPEAKER: I think MIT
is way far on the tradition.

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.479
MIT is the Alt right of
traditional literacy, I think.

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:01.880
[laughing]

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:06.385
I just think that there are--

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:08.353
I think that the
immense pressure that

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:10.956
falls on students, just on
students physical bodies,

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.991
is definitely a symptom
of a larger problem.

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:15.060
And for me, the fact
that that symptom is not

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.097
enough of an impetus to
change, is heartbreaking.

00:23:19.197 --> 00:23:20.365
Because I think that--

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:23.001
I didn't come to
college expecting

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:25.036
it to be the best
four years of my life,

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:28.206
but I didn't come here also
expecting to just suffer.

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:29.508
[laughing]

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:31.276
And so I think that
there's definitely

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:34.212
got to be a way
where I can bloom,

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.914
can reach my best potential.

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:36.948
And I love learning.

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:38.750
I love-- like I love
school, you know,

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:44.222
and the fact that I have
just kept running up

00:23:44.322 --> 00:23:48.026
against the institution, I
think, as a creative person,

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:51.797
has made me kind of step
back and think again

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:54.666
about emancipatory literacy
and how I can do that after.

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.935
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So I have a
question for you, Cynthia.

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:58.837
So given what you
just said, how would

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:01.840
you-- so if you were
to be MIT's president,

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.141
what would you change?

00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:07.546
What-- how would you make
it better more emancipatory?

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:10.382
Keeping in mind that
there are certain goals

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:12.184
that you have to reach
in terms of, say,

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.419
chemical engineering,
if you're a chemist,

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:15.520
how would you do that?

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.722
How would you advise
administration be better

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:18.857
on that score?

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:20.525
CYNTHIA: I think very
first thing I would do

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:23.562
is have people who are
more interested in research

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:24.663
not be professors.

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:25.997
So the ones who are
interested in research

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:27.199
should be doing
research full time,

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.433
and the people who are
interested in teaching

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:29.468
should teach.

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:33.271
Because I think that
that gives like--

00:24:33.371 --> 00:24:36.041
that gives people
more impetus just

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:38.577
to connect with their students
and actually get to know them,

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:40.245
and I think in that
kind of environment,

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:42.714
you would foster like a
safer, healthier environment

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:43.682
for learning.

00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:45.016
Whereas if you have
a professor who

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:47.953
is more interested in
winning the Nobel Prize,

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:51.656
like what are you-- what do
you do coming up against that?

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:56.027
I also would have MIT think
very, very hard about where

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.162
the funding is coming from?

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:58.463
What it's going to?

00:24:58.563 --> 00:25:00.565
And how that kind of fits
in the global system, where

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:03.268
MIT as an institution fits
into the global system,

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:07.038
as kind of not only
an institution that

00:25:07.138 --> 00:25:09.508
does propel you to a
higher class, but kind of

00:25:09.608 --> 00:25:14.179
does that at the expense
of a lot of other people

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:16.615
and systems across the globe
even if it's not directly

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:17.816
in the area.

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:20.085
So I think that being more
critical and intentional

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:23.255
about our values, and
also maybe adding soul

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.990
to the end of that--

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.658
end of the that motto.

00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:27.359
But--

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:28.560
MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK, OK.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.263
CYNTHIA: Yeah.

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:33.265
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Attention
to the third question.

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.866
Thank you.

00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:37.569
AUDIENCE: The last question is,
from your personal experiences,

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.971
or what you've
seen or read about,

00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:42.908
how do you think we can
improve students' experiences

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.776
and confidence through
intentional language

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:46.144
use in schools?

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:50.982
Like what mottoes do you think
are working, or would work?

00:25:51.082 --> 00:25:52.851
TEACHING ASSISTANT: Dana?

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:55.887
AUDIENCE: Well there's a model,
the only one of it's kind,

00:25:55.987 --> 00:26:00.158
it's in Canada, it's a Mohawk
language immersion school

00:26:00.258 --> 00:26:05.297
that's K through six, but it
struggles to secure funding

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:08.066
because it also doesn't
follow a standardized Canadian

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.467
curriculum.

00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:12.804
In fact the community has sort
of decolonized the curriculum,

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:16.207
and they teach history, for
instance not Canadian history,

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:19.544
they teach Mohawk
history, and it's

00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:22.247
been really affirming
for children

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:25.016
in the community,
Especially a community that

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:28.119
has its own struggles
with language preservation

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:31.022
and revitalization, and
passing on the language

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:33.258
to continued generations.

00:26:33.358 --> 00:26:37.362
Especially after a history of
residential schooling that--

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:41.132
main aim was a cultural
and linguistic genocide

00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:43.001
of these people.

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:47.505
So this is a great model,
but it's funded entirely

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:50.241
by community fundraisers
and every year

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:53.178
struggles with staying open.

00:26:53.278 --> 00:26:55.547
And it's never certain
that it will be there

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:56.581
in the next school year.

00:26:56.681 --> 00:26:59.084
But it seems to have
had a really, really

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:04.189
a positive impact on the
Mohawk community in Canada.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:09.194
And so programs like that I
think need to now be funded,

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:14.165
and that involves challenging
our federal and local

00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:18.937
requirements for funding, and to
do that we need to interrogate

00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:22.374
what value there is in
the curriculum we have

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:26.011
standardized, and why that
is considered objectively

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:29.381
the standard that should
impart the best learning

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:30.548
experience upon students?

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:44.796
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Go ahead Colin.

00:27:44.896 --> 00:27:46.398
AUDIENCE: So bouncing
of that it seems

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:50.301
we get to [inaudible]
thing where it [inaudible]

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:53.371
is inculcated in this
standard curriculum.

00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:55.173
It goes into society
and then perpetuates

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:58.643
the standard curriculum
back on the Indian students.

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.445
So I'm curious about
if anyone has thoughts

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:04.883
how you could make knowledge
about-- because one

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:08.653
of the main hurdles is people
instituting, or interrogating

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:12.457
the standard curriculum
is just strictly about how

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:15.527
the story of America's history
has been with regarding

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:18.630
the Native American
genocide, slavery,

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.566
and, for lack of a
better word, mean

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:25.070
that it is manifest destiny.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.374
How do you make people
aware of that on a level

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:32.677
that they can see those
things playing out today,

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:34.746
then work to interrogate
that curriculum?

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.715
Especially if they are
coming from a background

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.084
where race isn't talked about
in this family because it's

00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:43.054
an uncomfortable
topic, or if they just

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:46.891
haven't heard about these things
necessarily because of school.

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:52.564
AUDIENCE: For me, I feel
like it's more about where

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:56.067
do you learn to interrogate
your own beliefs,

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:58.970
and I feel like
that's hard to find.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.507
And I came to-- this class was
a huge part of that for me.

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.476
And I don't know if that
because I started out,

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:07.779
or if I just happened
to stumble upon a place

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:11.082
where I learned to
interrogate my own beliefs.

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:14.152
But I think this isn't a
point to make for themselves,

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:18.223
but I don't really have an
answer for how we get triple

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:20.625
the value in evaluating in
interrogating your own beliefs,

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:25.997
or how much more in [inaudible]
learn to interrogate your own

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:29.033
beliefs before attacking
someone else's.

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:31.269
AUDIENCE: Yeah, bouncing off
of I think a common theme

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:34.305
that we come up in
this class is how

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:36.341
do we have conversations
with people who don't

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:39.644
want to these conversations?

00:29:39.744 --> 00:29:41.980
And I think the only way
for them to figure it out is

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.414
for them to
interrogate themselves,

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:46.050
but most of those people won't.

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:50.622
So finding ways to make
them interrogate themselves,

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:54.726
I think is gonna be a common
problem throughout history.

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.661
And unfortunately I
don't know I, personally,

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:58.963
have a great solution for that.

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:02.600
But I think more
opportunities like this--

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.136
I mean obviously you mentioned
this before, the people who

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:07.505
are taking this class,
were not really diversified

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:09.407
at all right?

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:13.111
We all sought this
class out mostly,

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.913
so I don't know how
you can get someone

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:16.514
who doesn't want
interrogate themselves

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:17.849
in to a situation like this.

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:20.618
So maybe mandating
something like this

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:22.654
where you have to
go a black history

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:24.589
class, or a Native
American history class,

00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:31.162
or whatever might force people
to start talking about it.

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:34.833
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I almost
think it might be better

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:38.469
to not have a
separate class where

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.105
this is your
well-roundedness class,

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.274
this is where we're going
to learn about the others.

00:30:43.374 --> 00:30:46.578
But to integrate
what you would learn

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.713
in a specific
black history class

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:50.481
into the general curriculum.

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:53.151
Which of course is
harder, but I do

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:56.521
think would require the
same amount of conversations

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.756
and connections,
and negotiations

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:02.527
as making a requirement
of a separate class.

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.863
But I think that a
better approach that

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:10.668
might be more palatable and
have more positive effects

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:13.471
would be just straight up
integration, decolonizing

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.073
the current curriculum.

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:15.874
CYNTHIA: I totally-

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:17.175
AUDIENCE: Yeah, go ahead.

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:18.643
CYNTHIA: I was going to say
I totally agree with Dana,

00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:19.244
I think that--

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:23.948
I'm losing my train of thought--

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.519
I totally agree
with Dana because I

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:33.925
think that the history
will speak for itself.

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.293
I think that history is--

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:38.162
if you know the full history of
the United States for example--

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:39.864
it's pretty terrible
and I think that you

00:31:39.964 --> 00:31:41.633
do need to know
the whole history,

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.668
and also need to get
the alternative sides

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:47.405
and have those be integrated
into the curriculum.

00:31:47.505 --> 00:31:51.609
I also was interested in
thinking about entry points

00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:53.778
into these
conversations, and ways

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.446
that our humor can
function as entry

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:56.714
points in these conversations.

00:31:56.814 --> 00:31:58.716
I've been having
this conversation

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:01.653
with a friend of mine of
how humor, for example,

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.055
gives us a way to
kind of express

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.757
some of these things
that are more taboo,

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:08.426
and kind of laugh them off,
and kind of integrate them,

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:09.928
as opposed to
everyone shunning them

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:11.095
and people feeling bottled.

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:13.798
So I am interested
about humor and art

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:18.937
specifically as entry point
into these conversations.

00:32:19.037 --> 00:32:20.939
MICHEL DEGRAFF: [inaudible].

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:24.542
So Dana, I think
what you say in a way

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:27.679
answers the concern that
Shope expressed right?

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:31.182
Because Shope put
it as dual choice.

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:33.484
That you either do this
or you do that, right?

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:35.820
So Dana is right, right Shope,?

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.588
One can imagine
having in the class--

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:40.925
the principle math
class, chemistry class--

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:42.527
paying attention
to those issues.

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:45.163
In fact there room
for that, even

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:48.299
if you take a simple
photography class

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:51.035
one can even think about
what kind of choices

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:52.337
go into making your camera?

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.405
And actually, I have friends
who are photographers

00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:57.342
and they explain to me that
actually most cameras were not

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:59.243
geared to take pictures
of black people.

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:00.845
So even as a white
photographer he

00:33:00.945 --> 00:33:03.281
finds that when he takes a
picture with his regular Cannon

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:05.717
of a white person it comes
much better than when

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.251
takes it of a black person.

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:08.486
Why?

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:11.656
Because the lenses are
designed with a normal gaze

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:14.359
of the white subject right?

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:17.128
So he had to tweak his
camera to make it take

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:18.696
good pictures of black people.

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:21.466
So even there, even
in physics there's

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:24.135
a way to interrogate
the curriculum.

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:27.238
Why selections are made
with the lens for example?

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:30.074
So in a way it could
both, you could

00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:33.344
both have the necessary interest
in human beings the quote

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:35.513
unquote more
"traditional curriculum".

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:37.348
And going back to
the other point,

00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:39.517
can you imagine also
in history, in biology,

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:42.720
biology could include
text like I mentioned

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.225
earlier, The Mismeasure
of Man if you wish,

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:49.694
goes into lots of integral
issues about biology.

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:52.030
About how we make--
heads were measured

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.631
to show that humans
are as intelligent.

00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:56.100
At Harvard for
example, for many years

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.102
when you were coming
in you had to undress

00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:00.071
and they took your
picture naked,

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:03.674
and they would at your picture
to decide what kind of students

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:07.478
you would become based
on physical traits,

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:08.946
like because your head.

00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:10.947
This was Harvard.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:13.885
I guess this was one
proponent of what

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.887
was called then phrenology.

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.355
Which is the measure of--

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:19.322
So there is plenty,
plenty of room

00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:21.324
to integrate those
kind intricacies

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:23.728
within traditional curriculum.

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:27.965
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and I want
to express the fact that

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:31.369
to do such a thing is
not just to include

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.405
all of the hushed
historical abuses

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:38.609
that we gloss over in
our current curricula.

00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:43.281
But it's also to acknowledge the
good that we have overlooked.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.851
So discoveries and innovations
that other people who are not

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:50.822
quote unquote "western", and
who are not Anglo-American

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:54.559
have made and contributed
to the fields of science,

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.460
and history, and literature.

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:59.997
So not only to recognize
these historical evils,

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:03.234
but also the grand positive
impacts that others have had.

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:04.869
MICHEL DEGRAFF:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:10.541
So are you guys happy
with the answers?

00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:16.080
[laughter] OK, so
thank you very much.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.984
[applause]
