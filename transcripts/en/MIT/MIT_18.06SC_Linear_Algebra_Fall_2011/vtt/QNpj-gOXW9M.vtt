00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.250
OK, this is lecture twenty.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.680
And this is the final
lecture on determinants.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.390
And it's about the applications.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.730
So we worked hard in
the last two lectures

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.900
to get a formula
for the determinant

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.980
and the properties
of the determinant.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.250
Now to use the determinant and,
and always this determinant

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.710
packs all this information
into a single number.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.800
And that number can
give us formulas

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.510
for all sorts of, things that
we've been calculating already

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.550
without formulas.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.110
Now what was A inverse?

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.690
So, so I'm beginning with
the formula for A inverse.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.450
Two, two by two formula we know,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.070
right?

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.700
The two by two formula for A
inverse, the inverse of a b c d

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:22.160
inverse is one over the
determinant times d a -b -c.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.140
Somehow I want to see what's
going on for three by three

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.140
and n by n.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.200
And actually maybe you can see
what's going on from this two

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.870
by two case.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.060
So there's a formula
for the inverse,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.390
and what did I divide by?

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.880
The determinant.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.220
So what I'm looking
for is a formula

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.590
where it has one
over the determinant

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.690
and, and you remember why
that makes good sense,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.150
because then that's perfect as
long as the determinant isn't

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.330
zero, and that's exactly
when there is an inverse.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.640
But now I have to ask can we
recognize any of this stuff?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.410
Do you recognize what that
number d is from the past?

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.730
From last, from
the last lecture?

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.200
My hint is think cofactors.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.480
Because my formula is going to
be, my formula for the inverse

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.760
is going to be one
over the determinant

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.660
times a matrix of cofactors.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.290
So you remember that D?

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.700
What's that the cofactor of?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.230
Remember cofactors?

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.530
If -- that's the
one one cofactor,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.570
because if I strike out row and
column one, I'm left with d.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.080
And what's minus b?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.930
OK.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.780
Which cofactor is that one?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.900
Oh, minus b is the
cofactor of c, right?

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.670
If I strike out the c,
I'm left with a b there.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.400
And why the minus sign?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.310
Because this c was in a two one
position, and two plus one is

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.910
odd.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.000
So there was a minus went into
the cofactor, and that's it.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.780
OK.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.710
I'll write down next
what my formula is.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.900
Here's the big formula for
the A -- for A inverse.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:35.800
It's one over the determinant
of A and then some matrix.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.280
And that matrix is the
matrix of cofactors,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.370
c.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.330
Only one thing, it
turns -- you'll see,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.920
I have to, I transpose.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.760
So this is the matrix
of cofactors, the --

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.090
what I'll just --

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.710
but why don't we just call
it the cofactor matrix.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.400
So the one one entry of, of
c is the cof- is the one one

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.840
cofactor, the thing that we get
by throwing away row and column

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.340
one.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.770
It's the d.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.420
And, because of the
transpose, what I see up here

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.140
is the cofactor of this
guy down here, right?

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.450
That's where the
transpose came in.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.420
What I see here, this is the
cofactor not of this one,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.690
because I've transposed.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.920
This is the cofactor of the b.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.350
When I throw away the b,
the b row and the b column,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.240
I'm left with c, and then
I have that minus sign

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.940
again.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.580
And of course the two
two entry is the cofactor

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.660
of d, and that's this a.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.930
So there's the formula.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.790
OK.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.080
But we got to think why.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.680
I mean, it worked in
this two by two case,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.590
but a lot of other formulas
would have worked just as well.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.200
We, we have to see
why that's true.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.790
In other words, why is it --

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.530
so this is what I aim to find.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.570
And, and let's just sort of
look to see what is that telling

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.210
us.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.400
That tells us that the -- the
expression for A inverse --

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.670
let's look at a three by three.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:27.240
Can I just write down
a a b c d e f g h i?

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.780
And I'm looking for its inverse.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.340
And what kind of a
formula -- do I see there?

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.720
I mean, what --

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.630
the determinant is a bunch
of products of three factors,

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.370
right?

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.190
The determinant of this
matrix'll involve a e i,

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.160
and b f times g, and c
times d times h, and minus c

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.900
e g, and so on.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.810
So things with three
factors go in here.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:03.140
Things with how many factors do
things in the cofactor matrix

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.640
have?

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.030
What's a typical cofactor?

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.000
What's the cofactor of a?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.800
The cofactor of a, the one one
entry up here in the inverse

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.700
is?

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.690
I throw away the row
and column containing a

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.740
and I take the determinant
of what's left,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.230
that's the cofactor.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.390
And that's e i minus f h.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.890
Products of two things.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.560
Now, I'm just making
the observation

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.900
that the determinant of A
involves products of n entries.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:51.310
And the cofactor matrix involves
products of n minus 1 entries.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.620
And, like, we never
noticed any of this stuff

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.780
when we were
computing the inverse

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.090
by the Gauss-Jordan
method or whatever.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.380
You remember how we did it?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.620
We took the matrix A, we
tucked the identity next to it,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.740
we did elimination till
A became the identity.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.980
And then that, the identity
suddenly was A inverse.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.870
Well, that was
great numerically.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.300
But we never knew what
was going on, basically.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.000
And now we see
what the formula is

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.830
in terms of letters,
what's the algebra instead

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.530
of the algorithm.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.140
OK.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.780
But I have to say why
this is right, right?

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.940
I still -- that's a
pretty magic formula.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.150
Where does it come from?

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.320
Well, I'll just check it.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.200
Having, having got it
up there, let me --

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.510
I'll say, how can we check --

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.510
what do I want to check?

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.150
I want to check that A times
its inverse gives the identity.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.130
So I want, I want to check
that A times this thing,

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.000
A times this -- now I'm going
to write in the inverse --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.220
gives the identity.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.830
So I check that A
times C transpose --

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.340
let me bring the
determinant up here.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.490
Determinant of A
times the identity.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.900
That's my job.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:24.340
That's it, that if this is
true, and it is, then, then I've

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.760
correctly identified A
inverse as C transpose divided

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.810
by the determinant.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.310
OK.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.260
But why is this true?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.220
Why is that true?

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.059
Let me, let me put down
what I'm doing here.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.220
I have A --

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.630
here, here's A, here's a11 --

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.150
I'm doing this multiplication
-- along to a1n.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.210
And then down in this last row
will be an an1 along to ann.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:59.660
And I'm multiplying by the
cofactor matrix transposed.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:07.820
So when I transpose, it'll
be c11 c12 down to c1n.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.340
Notice usually that
one coming first

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.000
would mean I'm in row
one, but I've transposed,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.200
so that's, those
are the cofactors.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.700
This first column are the
cofactors from row one.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:28.670
And then the last column would
be the cofactors from row n.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:33.960
And why should that come
out to be anything good?

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.790
In fact, why should it come
out to be as good as this?

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:43.701
Well, you can tell me what the
one one entry in the product

00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:44.200
is.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.630
This is like you're seeing
the main point if you just

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.750
tell me one entry.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.470
What do I get up there
in the one one entry

00:09:54.470 --> 00:10:00.600
when I do this row of
this row from A times

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.100
this column of cofactors?

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.150
What, what will I get there?

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.460
Because we have seen this.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.590
I mean, we're, right,
building exactly

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:15.290
on what the last
lecture reached.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:21.130
So this is a11 times c11,
a12 times c12, a1n times c1n.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:25.700
What does that what
does that sum up to?

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:32.900
That's the cofactor formula
for the determinant.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.240
That's the, this
cofactor formula,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.110
which I wrote, which
we got last time.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.700
The determinant of A is,
if I use row one, let,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.450
let I equal one,
then I have a11 times

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.600
its cofactor, a12 times
its cofactor, and so on.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.650
And that gives me
the determinant.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.470
And it worked in
this, in this case.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:06.020
This row times this thing
is, sure enough, ad minus bc.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.800
But this formula
says it always works.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.830
So up here in this,
in this position,

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.470
I'm getting determinant of A.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.130
What about in the
two two position?

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:23.460
Row two times column two
there, what, what is that?

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.640
That's just the cofactors,
that's just row two

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.960
times its cofactors.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.980
So of course I get
the determinant again.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.310
And in the last here,
this is the last row

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.780
times its cofactors.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.540
It's exactly -- you see, we're
realizing that the cofactor

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.780
formula is just this
sum of products,

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.160
so of course we think,
hey, we've got a matrix

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.510
multiplication there.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:57.870
And we get determinant of A.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.920
But there's one more
idea here, right?

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.990
Great.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.410
What else, what have I not --
so I haven't got that formula

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.520
completely proved yet, because
I've still got to do all

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.130
the off-diagonal stuff,
which I want to be zero,

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.120
right?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.560
I just want this
to be determinant

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.850
of A times the identity, and
then I'm, I'm a happy person.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.860
So why should that be?

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:30.660
Why should it be that one
row times the cofactors

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.920
from a different row, which
become a column because I

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.360
transpose, give zero?

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.210
In other words, the cofactor
formula gives the determinant

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.440
if the row and the, and
the cofactors -- you know,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:54.050
if the entries of A and the
cofactors are for the same row.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.470
But for some reason, if I
take the cofactors from the --

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.920
entries from the first row and
the cofactors from the second

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.290
row, for some reason
I automatically

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.270
get zero.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.140
And it's sort of
like interesting

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.540
to say, why does that happen?

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.620
And can I just check that --
of course, we know it happens,

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.410
in this case.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.060
Here are the
numbers from row one

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.600
and here are the cofactors
from row two, right?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.820
Those are the
numbers in row one.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.510
And th- these are the
cofactors from row two,

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.110
because the cofactor
of c is minus b

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.530
and the cofactor of d is

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:34.030
a.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:40.380
And sure enough, that row
times this column gives --

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.840
please say it.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.370
Zero, right.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.870
OK.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.330
So now how come?

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.250
How come?

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.190
Can we even see it in
this two by two case?

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.460
Why did -- well, I mean,
I guess we, you know,

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.352
in one way we certainly do see
it, because it's right here.

00:13:57.352 --> 00:13:59.310
I mean, do we just do
it, and then we get zero.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.870
But we want to
think of some reason

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:07.280
why the answer's zero, some
reason that we can use in the n

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.820
by n case.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.590
So let -- here,
here is my thinking.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.310
We must be, if we're
getting the answer's zero,

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.330
we suspect that what
we're doing somehow,

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.020
we're taking the determinant
of some matrix that

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.660
has two equal rows.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:31.040
So I believe that if we multiply
these by the cofactors from

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.770
some other row, we're taking
the determinant -- ye,

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.660
what matrix are we taking
the determinant of?

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.380
Here it's, this is it.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.900
We're, when we do that times
this, we're really taking --

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.510
can I put this in little
letters down here?

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:57.220
I'm taking -- let me look
at the matrix a b a b.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:03.610
Let me call that matrix
AS, A screwed up.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.290
OK.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.240
All right.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.260
So now that matrix is
certainly singular.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.380
So if we find its determinant,
we're going to get zero.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.810
But I claim that if we find
its determinant by the cofactor

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.960
rule, go along the
first row, we would

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.810
take a times the cofactor of a.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.180
And what is the --

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.440
see, how -- oh no -- let
me go along the second row.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.810
OK.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.320
So let's see, which --

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.190
if I take --

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.510
I know I've got a
singular matrix here.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:46.310
And I believe that when I
do this multiplication, what

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:51.110
I'm doing is using the cofactor
formula for the determinant.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.700
And I know I'm
going to get zero.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.530
Let me try this again.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.920
So the cofactor formula
for the determinant

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:04.170
says I should take a times
its cofactor, which is this b,

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:09.260
plus b times its cofactor,
which is this minus a.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.040
OK.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.260
That's what we're doing,
apart from a sign here.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.980
Oh yeah, so you know, there
might be a minus multiplying

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.950
everything.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.280
So if I take this
determinant, it's A --

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:29.000
the determinant of this, the
determinant of A screwed up is

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.050
a times its
cofactor, which is b,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:38.980
plus the second guy times its
cofactor, which is minus a.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.790
And of course I get
the answer zero,

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.790
and this is exactly what's
happening in that, in that,

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.650
row times this wrong column.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.150
OK.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.460
That's the two by two picture,
and it's just the same here.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.870
That the reason I get a zero
up in there is, the reason

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:09.319
I get a zero is that when I
multiply the first row of A

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.880
and the last row of
the cofactor matrix,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.450
it's as if I'm taking the
determinant of this screwed up

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.420
matrix that has first
and last rows identical.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:26.150
The book pins this
down more specific --

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.410
and more carefully than
I can do in the lecture.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.200
I hope you're seeing the point.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.130
That this is an identity.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.310
That it's a beautiful
identity and it tells us what

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.690
the inverse of the matrix is.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.820
So it gives us the inverse,
the formula for the inverse.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.510
OK.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:49.180
So that's the first goal of
my lecture, was to find this

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:49.960
formula.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.490
It's done.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.800
OK.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.180
And of course I could
invert, now, I can,

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.900
I sort of like I can see what --

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.850
I can answer
questions like this.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:08.510
Suppose I have a matrix,
and let me move the one one

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.740
entry.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.600
What happens to the inverse?

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.780
Just, just think
about that question.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.030
Suppose I have some
matrix, I just write down

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.300
some nice, non-singular
matrix that's got an inverse,

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.170
and then I move the one
one entry a little bit.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.880
I add one to it, for example.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.730
What happens to
the inverse matrix?

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.160
Well, this formula
should tell me.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.110
I have to look to see what
happens to the determinant

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.400
and what happens to
all the cofactors.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:44.300
And, the picture,
it's all there.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:44.960
It's all there.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.420
We can really understand
how the inverse changes

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.250
when the matrix changes.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.330
OK.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:58.910
Now my second application is to
-- let me put that over here --

00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.630
is to Ax=b.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:09.060
Well, the -- course, the
solution is A inverse b.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.820
But now I have a
formula for A inverse.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.170
A inverse is one
over the determinant

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:22.030
times this C transpose times B.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.510
I now know what A inverse is.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.270
So now I just have to
say, what have I got here?

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:33.600
Is there any way to, to make
this formula, this answer,

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.550
which is the one
and only answer --

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.980
it's the very same answer we got
on the first day of the class

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.620
by elimination.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.290
Now I'm -- now I've got
a formula for the answer.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.890
Can I play with it further
to see what's going on?

00:19:51.890 --> 00:20:01.640
And Cramer's, this Cramer's
Rule is exactly, that --

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:07.010
a way of looking
at this formula.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.510
OK.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.620
So this is a formula for x.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.620
Here's my formula.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.350
Well, of course.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.050
The first thing I
see from the formula

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:21.100
is that the answer x always
has that in the determinant.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.590
I'm not surprised.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.240
There's a division
by the determinant.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.190
But then I have to say a little
more carefully what's going on

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.610
And let me tell you what
Cramer's Rule is. up here.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.610
Let, let me take x1,
the first component.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.740
So this is the first
component of the answer.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.870
Then there'll be a
second component and a,

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.900
all the other components.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.310
Can I take just the first
component of this formula?

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:52.040
Well, I certainly have
determinant of A down under.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.400
And what the heck
is the first --

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.300
so what do I get
in C transpose b?

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.440
What's the first entry
of C transpose b?

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.060
That's what I have
to answer myself.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.420
Well, what's the first
entry of C transpose b?

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.670
This B is -- let me
tell you what it is.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:18.170
OK.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:22.290
Somehow I'm
multiplying cofactors

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.970
by the entries of B,
right, in this product.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.430
Cofactors from the matrix
times entries of b.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.650
So any time I'm multiplying
cofactors by numbers,

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.980
I think, I'm getting the
determinant of something.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.990
And let me call
that something B1.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:46.730
So this is a matrix, the matrix
whose determinant is coming out

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.230
of that.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.530
And we'll, we'll see what it is.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:54.550
x2 will be the determinant
of some other matrix B2, also

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.650
divided by determinant of A.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.190
So now I just --

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:00.970
Cramer just had a good idea.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:06.920
He realized what matrix it was,
what these B1 and B2 and B3

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.470
and so on matrices were.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.520
Let me write them on
the board underneath.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:15.260
OK.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.470
So what is this B1?

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:24.430
This B1 is the matrix that
has b in its first column

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.900
and otherwise the
rest of it is A.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:38.740
So it otherwise it has the
rest, the, the n-1 columns of A.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.880
It's the matrix with --

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:51.410
it's just the matrix A
with column one replaced

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:58.520
by the right-hand side,
by the right-hand side b.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:04.490
Because somehow when I take
the determinant of this guy,

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:09.140
it's giving me this
matrix multiplication.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.570
Well, how could that be?

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.490
How could -- so what's,
what's the determinant formula

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.050
I'll use here?

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.910
I'll use cofactors, of course.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.240
And I might as well use
cofactors down column one.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.910
So when I use cofactors
down column one,

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:32.840
I'm taking the first
entry of b times what?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.650
Times the cofactor c11.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.410
Do you see that?

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.830
When I, when I use
cofactors here,

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.530
I take the first
entry here, B one

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.120
let's call it, times
the cofactor there.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.390
But what's the cofactor in --
my little hand-waving is meant

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.650
to indicate that it's a
matrix of one size smaller,

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.030
the cofactor.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.730
And it's exactly c11.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.130
Well, that's just
what we wanted.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:06.200
This first entry
is c11 times b1.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:13.970
And then the next entry is
whatever, is c21 times b2,

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:14.860
and so on.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.310
And sure enough, if
I look here, when

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.720
I'm, when I do the
cofactor expansion,

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.790
b2 is getting multiplied by
the right thing, and so on.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.400
So there's Cramer's Rule.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.560
And the book gives
another kind of cute proof

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.960
without, without building
so much on, on cofactors.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.950
But here we've got
cofactors, so I thought

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.650
I'd just give you this proof.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.700
So what is B --

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.430
in general, what is Bj?

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:58.970
This is the, this is A with
column j replaced by, by b.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:08.870
So that's -- the determinant
of that matrix that you divide

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.700
by determinant of A to get xj.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.980
So x -- let me change
this general formula.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.190
xj, the j-th one,
is the determinant

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:22.510
of Bj divided by the
determinant of A.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.360
And now we've said what Bj is.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.720
Well, so Cramer found a rule.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:39.320
And we could ask him, OK,
great, good work, Cramer.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.180
But is your rule any
good in practice?

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:49.960
So he says, well, you couldn't
ask about a rule in mine,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.220
right, because it's just --

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.850
all you have to do is find
the determinant of A and these

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:01.220
other determinants, so I guess
-- oh, he just says, well,

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.140
all you have to do is
find n+1 determinants,

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.170
the, the n Bs and the A.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:17.530
And actually, I remember
reading -- there was a book,

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:22.530
popular book that, that kids
interested in math read when I

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.980
was a kid interested in
math called Mathematics

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.840
for the Million or something,
by a guy named Bell.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.830
And it had a little page
about linear algebra.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:39.000
And it said,-- so it
explained elimination

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.250
in a very complicated way.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.200
I certainly didn't
understand it.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.950
And, and it made it, you
know, it sort of said, well,

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.120
there is this formula
for elimination,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.770
but look at this great
formula, Cramer's Rule.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:00.410
So it certainly said Cramer's
Rule was the way to go.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:05.180
But actually, Cramer's Rule
is a disastrous way to go,

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.920
because to compute
these determinants,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.060
it takes, like,
approximately forever.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:17.020
So actually I now think
of that book title

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.980
as being Mathematics
for the Millionaire,

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.160
because you'd have to
be able to pay for,

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.570
a hopelessly long calculation
where elimination, of course,

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.450
produced the x-s, in an instant.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:36.060
But having a formula allows
you to, with, with letters, you

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.010
know, allows you to do algebra
instead of, algorithms.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:44.220
So the, there's some value
in the Cramer's Rule formula

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:52.000
for x and in the explicit
formula for, for A inverse.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.890
They're nice
formulas, but I just

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.710
don't want you to use them.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.230
That'ss what it comes to.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.960
If you had to -- and Matlab
would never, never do it.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.480
I mean, it would
use elimination.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.720
OK.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.380
Now I'm ready for number
three in today's list

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:17.790
of amazing connections coming
through the determinant.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.900
And that number three is the
fact that the determinant gives

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.950
a volume.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.480
OK.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.860
So now -- so that's
my final topic for --

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.070
among these -- this my
number three application,

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:37.700
that the determinant is actually
equals the volume of something.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.720
Can I use this little space
to consider a special case,

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.050
and then I'll use the
far board to think

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.840
about the general rule.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.400
So what I going to prove?

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.970
Or claim.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.950
I claim that the
determinant of the matrix

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:02.800
is the volume of a box.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.930
OK, and you say, which box?

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:06.970
Fair enough.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.570
OK.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.670
So let's see.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:16.170
I'm in -- shall we say we're
in, say three by three?

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.780
Shall we suppose -- let's,
let's say three by three.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.680
So, so we can really -- we're,
we're talking about boxes

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.400
in three dimensions, and
three by three matrices.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.990
And so all I do -- you
could guess what the box is.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.700
Here is, here is,
three dimensions.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.450
OK.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:41.880
Now I take the first row of
the matrix, a11, a22, A --

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.360
sorry. a11, a12, a13.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.090
That row is a vector.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.190
It goes to some point.

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.220
That point will be -- and
that edge going to it,

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.650
will be an edge of the box,
and that point will be a corner

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:57.740
of the box.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.010
So here is zero zero
zero, of course.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:09.500
And here's the first row of
the matrix: a11, a12, a13.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:14.840
So that's one edge of the box.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.700
Another edge of the box
is to the second row

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.820
of the matrix, row two.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.510
Can I just call
it there row two?

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.760
And a third row of
the box will be to --

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.200
a third row -- a third edge of
the box will be given by row

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.300
three.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.470
So, so there's row three.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:38.780
That, the coordinates,
what are the coordinates

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.030
of that corner of the box?

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:47.650
a31, a32, a33.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.220
So I've got that edge of the
box, that edge of the box,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.830
that edge of the box,
and that's all I need.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:59.820
Now I just finish
out the box, right?

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.650
I just -- the proper word,
of course, is parallelepiped.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:08.920
But for obvious
reasons, I wrote box.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.550
OK.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.360
So, OK.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.550
So there's the, there's
the bottom of the box.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:19.660
There're the four
edge sides of the box.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.570
There's the top of the box.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.540
Cute, right?

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.470
It's the box that
has these three edges

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:33.080
and then it's completed to
a, to a, each, you know,

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.080
each side is a, is
a parallelogram.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:43.050
And it's that box whose volume
is given by the determinant.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:50.650
That's -- now it's -- possible
that the determinant is

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.920
negative.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.110
So we have to just say
what's going on in that case.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:32:01.840
If the determinant is
negative, then the volume, we,

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.030
we should take the
absolute value really.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:07.030
So the volume, if we, if we
think of volume as positive,

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:11.310
we should take the absolute
value of the determinant.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:14.400
But the, the sign, what does
the sign of the determinant --

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.560
it always must
tell us something.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.380
And somehow it, it will tell
us whether these three is a --

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.270
whether it's a right-handed
box or a left-handed box.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:30.300
If we, if we reversed
two of the edges,

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.250
we would go between
a right-handed box

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.390
and a left-handed box.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:35.440
We wouldn't change the
volume, but we would

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.500
change the, the cyclic, order.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.900
So I won't worry about that.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:47.020
And, so one special
case is what?

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.930
A equal identity matrix.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.070
So let's take that special case.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:55.520
A equal identity matrix.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.550
Is the formula determinant
of identity matrix,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.230
does that equal the
volume of the box?

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.460
Well, what is the box?

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.370
What's the box?

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:12.230
If A is the identity matrix,
then these three rows are

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:17.460
the three coordinate
vectors, and the box is --

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.920
it's a cube.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.200
It's the unit cube.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.970
So if, if A is the
identity matrix, of course

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.080
our formula is

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.850
Well, actually that
proves property one --

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.740
that the volume right.
has property one.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.440
Actually, we could, we could,
we could get this thing if we --

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.210
if we can show that the box
volume has the same three

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:42.010
properties that define
the determinant,

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.060
then it must be the determinant.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.080
So that's like the, the, the
elegant way to prove this.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.860
To prove this amazing fact
that the determinant equals

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:58.540
the volume, first we'll check
it for the identity matrix.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.470
That's fine.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.190
The box is a cube
and its volume is one

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:07.180
and the determinant is one
and, and one agrees with one.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.590
Now let me take one -- let me
go up one level to an orthogonal

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.889
matrix.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:16.060
Because I'd like to take this
chance to bring in chapter --

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.750
the, the previous chapter.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:21.100
Suppose I have an
orthogonal matrix.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.110
What did that mean?

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.500
I always called those things Q.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.909
What was the point
of -- suppose I have,

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:32.670
suppose instead of the identity
matrix I'm now going to take A

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:36.910
equal Q, an orthogonal matrix.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.510
What was Q then?

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:52.179
That was a matrix whose columns
were orthonormal, right?

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:54.610
Those were its columns
were unit vectors,

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:56.059
perpendicular unit vectors.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.090
So what kind of a
box have we got now?

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.520
What kind of a box comes
from the rows or the columns,

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.530
I don't mind, because
the determinant

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.420
is the determinant
of the transpose,

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.850
so I'm never worried about

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:12.730
that.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.850
What kind of a box,
what shape box have we

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:20.380
got if the matrix is
an orthogonal matrix?

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.040
It's another cube.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.710
It's a cube again.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.900
How is it different
from the identity cube?

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.140
It's just rotated.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.830
It's just the orthogonal
matrix Q doesn't

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.860
have to be the identity matrix.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.240
It's just the unit cube
but turned in space.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:48.490
So sure enough, it's the unit
cube, and its volume is one.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:53.410
Now is the determinant one?

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.410
What's the determinant of Q?

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.980
We believe that the determinant
of Q better be one or minus

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:03.100
one, so that our formula
is -- checks out in that --

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.800
if we can't check it in these
easy cases where we got a cube,

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.020
we're not going to get
it in the general case.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:18.290
So why is the determinant
of Q equal one or minus one?

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:19.810
What do we know about Q?

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:25.050
What's the one matrix statement
of the properties of Q?

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:29.020
A matrix with orthonormal
columns has --

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.860
satisfies a certain equation.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.400
What, what is that?

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.930
It's if we have this orthogonal
matrix, then the fact --

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:45.550
the way to say what it, what
its properties are is this.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:50.940
Q prime, u- u- Q
transpose Q equals I.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.790
Right?

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:57.450
That's what -- those are the
matrices that get the name Q,

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:01.241
the matrices that
Q transpose Q is I.

00:37:01.241 --> 00:37:01.740
OK.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:07.180
Now from that, tell me
why is the determinant one

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.500
or minus one.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.930
How do I, out of this fact --

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.525
this may even be a
homework problem.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.890
It's there in the, in the
list of exercises in the book,

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.100
and let's just do it.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.340
How do I get, how do I discover
that the determinant of Q

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.530
is one or maybe minus one?

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:34.180
I take determinants of
both sides, everybody says,

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.870
so I won't --

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:38.610
I take determinants
of both sides.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.250
On the right-hand side -- so
I, when I take determinants

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:46.240
of both sides,
let me just do it.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.315
Take the determinant of
-- take determinants.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.970
Determinant of the
identity is one.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:55.840
What's the determinant
of that product?

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.400
Rule nine is paying off now.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.920
The determinant of a product is
the determinant of this guy --

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.110
maybe I'll put it, I'll use
that symbol for determinant.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.152
It's the determinant of that
guy times the determinant

00:38:14.152 --> 00:38:14.860
of the other guy.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.400
And then what's the
determinant of Q transpose?

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.990
It's the same as the
determinant of Q.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.810
Rule ten pays off.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.330
So this is just
this thing squared.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:33.740
So that determinant squared is
one and sure enough it's one

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.290
or minus one.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:35.790
Great.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:42.000
So in these special
cases of cubes,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.650
we really do have
determinant equals volume.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:54.530
Now can I just push
that to non-cubes.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:39:02.930
Let me push it first to
rectangles, rectangular boxes,

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:07.820
where I'm just multiplying
the e- the edges are --

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.440
let me keep all the
ninety degree angles,

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.510
because those are -- that,
that makes my life easy.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.910
And just stretch the edges.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:21.910
Suppose I stretch that first
edge, suppose this first edge

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.230
I double.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:27.990
Suppose I double
that first edge,

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:31.060
keeping the other
edges the same.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.650
What happens to the volume?

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.640
It doubles, right?

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.420
We know that the volume
of a cube doubles.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.370
In fact, because we know that
the new cube would sit right

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:43.400
on top --

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.210
I mean, the new, the added
cube would sit right on --

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.620
would fit --

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.120
probably a geometer would
say congruent or something --

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.810
would go right in, in the other.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:52.830
We'd have two.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.540
We have two identical cubes.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.421
Total volume is now two.

00:39:58.421 --> 00:39:58.920
OK.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.392
So I want -- if I double an
edge, the volume doubles.

00:40:02.392 --> 00:40:03.725
What happens to the determinant?

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:14.880
If I double, the first
row of a matrix, what ch-

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.010
ch- what's the effect
on the determinant?

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.320
It also doubles, right?

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.910
And that was rule number 3a.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:29.500
Remember rule 3a was
that if I, I could,

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:36.780
if I had a factor in, in row
one, T, I could factor it out.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:41.020
So if, if I have a factor
two in that row one,

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.340
I can factor it out
of the determinant.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:48.860
It agrees with the -- the volume
of the box has that factor two.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.140
So, so volume satisfies
this property 3a.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:59.040
And now I really close, but I
-- but to get to the very end

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.980
of this proof, I have
to get away from right

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.650
angles.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:10.330
I have to allow the
possibility of, other angles.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:13.090
And -- or what's
saying the same thing,

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:18.600
I have to check that the
volume also satisfies 3b.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.600
So can I --

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.740
This is end of proof
that the -- so I'm --

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:34.380
determinant of A equals volume
of box, and where I right now?

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:40.820
This volume has properties,
properties one, no problem.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.030
If the box is the
cube, everything is --

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:49.000
if the box is the unit
cube, its volume is one.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.680
Property two was if
I reverse two rows,

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.960
but that doesn't change the box.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.520
And it doesn't change the
absolute value, so no problem

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.200
there.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.890
Property 3a was if I mul-
you remember what 3a was?

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:10.390
So property one was about
the identity matrix.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:12.900
Property two was about
a plus or minus sign

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.560
that I don't care about.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.490
Property 3a was a
factor T in a row.

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:24.080
But now I've got property
three B to deal with.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.520
What was property 3b?

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.270
This is a great way to
review these, properties.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:34.860
So that 3b, the property
3b said -- let's do,

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.910
let's do two by two.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:42.620
So said that if I
had a+a', b+b', c,

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:47.590
d that this equaled what?

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.120
So this is property 3b.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.840
This is the linearity
in row one by itself.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:59.060
So c d is staying the same,
and I can split this into a b

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.340
and a' b'.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:12.890
That's property 3b, at least
in the two by two case.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.340
And what I --

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:20.540
I wanted now to show
that the volume, which

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.040
two, two by two, that
means area, has this,

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:25.790
has this property.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.540
Let me just emphasize that we
have got -- we're getting --

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:37.150
this is a formula, then, for
the area of a parallelogram.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:40.310
The area of this parallelogram
-- can I just draw it?

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.160
OK, here's the, here's
the parallelogram.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.370
I have the row a b.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.000
That's the first row.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.260
That's the point a b.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:54.060
And I tack on c d.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.690
c d, coming out of here.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.065
And I complete
the parallelogram.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.750
So this is --

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:08.140
well, I better
make it look right.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.530
It's really this one that has
coordinates c d and this has

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:17.040
coordinates -- well,
whatever the sum is.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.820
And of course
starting at zero zero.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.026
So we all know,
this is a+c, b+d.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.120
Rather than --

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.460
I'm pausing on that
proof for a minute

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:37.320
just to going back
to our formula.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.650
Because I want you to see
that unlike Cramer's Rule,

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.060
that I wasn't that
impressed by, I'm

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.640
very impressed by this
formula for the area

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.540
of a parallelogram.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.930
And what's our formula?

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:54.890
What, what's the area
of that parallelogram?

00:44:54.890 --> 00:45:00.250
If I had asked you
that last year,

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.950
you would have said OK,
the area of a parallelogram

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.060
is the base times the height,

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.190
right?

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:10.890
So you would have figured
out what this base, the --

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.850
how long that base was.

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:16.182
It's like the square root
of A squared plus b squared.

00:45:16.182 --> 00:45:17.640
And then you would
have figured out

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.360
how much is this
height, whatever it is.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.920
It's horrible.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:28.330
This, I mean, we got square
roots, and in that height

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:32.040
there would be other
revolting stuff.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.800
But now what's the formula
that we now know for the area?

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:45.740
It's the determinant
of our little matrix.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.050
It's just ad-bc.

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:59.110
No square roots.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:03.000
Totally rememberable, because
it's exactly a formula

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.960
that we've been studying the
whole, for three lectures.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.460
OK.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.960
That's, you know, that's
the most important point

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.190
I'm making here.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:20.990
Is that if you know the
coordinates of a box,

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:24.750
of the corners, then
you have a great formula

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:28.620
for the volume,
area or volume, that

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:33.550
doesn't involve any lengths
or any angles or any heights,

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:37.850
but just involves the
coordinates that you've got.

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.390
And similarly, what's the
area of this triangle?

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:43.530
Suppose I chop that off
and say what about --

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:45.810
because you might often be
interested in a triangle

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.330
instead of a parallelogram.

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:48.725
What's the area
of this triangle?

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.950
Now there again,
everybody would have

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:58.110
said the area of a triangle is
half the base times the height.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.300
And in some cases, if you know
the base that a, that's --

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.300
and the height, that's fine.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.280
But here, we, what we know is
the coordinates of the corners.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.980
We know the vertices.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.690
And so what's the
area of that triangle?

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:22.550
If I know these, if I know
a b, c d, and zero zero,

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.060
what's the area?

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:29.670
It's just half, so
it's just half of this.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:33.040
So this is, this
is a- a b -- a d -

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.870
b c for the parallelogram
and one half of that,

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:43.585
one half of ad-bc
for the triangle.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.900
So I mean, this is a totally
trivial remark, to say, well,

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.630
divide by two.

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:56.910
But it's just that you
more often see triangles,

00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:01.530
and you feel you know
the formula for the area

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:04.950
but the good formula for
the area is this one.

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:06.760
And I'm just going to --

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.260
I'm just going to
say one more thing

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.750
about the area of a triangle.

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:11.220
It's just because
it's -- you know,

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:15.760
it's so great to have a
good formula for something.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.990
What if our triangle did
not start at zero zero?

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:25.630
What if our triangle,
what if we had this --

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.390
what if we had -- so I'm
coming back to triangles again.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:40.320
But let me, let me put this
triangle somewhere, it's --

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.800
I'm staying with triangles,
I'm just in two dimensions,

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:53.280
but I'm going to allow you
to give me any three corners.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.430
And in -- those six numbers
must determine the area.

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:03.750
And what's the formula?

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:05.280
The area is going
to be, it's going

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:09.530
to be, there'll be that
half of a parallelogram.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:13.580
I mean, basically this can't
be completely new, right?

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:17.230
We've got the area when -- we,
we know the area when this is

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:20.400
zero zero.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.810
Now we just want to lift our
sight slightly and get the area

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.820
when all th- so let me
write down what it, what it

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.190
comes out to be.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:37.390
It turns out that if you do
this, x1 y1 and a 1, x2 y2

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:44.150
and a 1, x3 y3 and a
1, that that works.

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:47.320
That the determinant
symbol, of course.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.640
It's just -- if I gave you
that determinant to find,

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.890
you might subtract
this row from this.

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:55.780
It would kill that one.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.170
Subtract this row from this,
it would kill that one.

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.470
Then you'd have a simple
determinant to do with

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:06.300
differences, and it would --

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.960
this little
subtraction, what I did

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.580
was equivalent to
moving the triangle

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:16.550
to start at the origin.

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:19.850
I did it fast,
because time is up.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:24.530
And I didn't complete
that proof of 3b.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:28.930
I'll leave -- the book has a
carefully drawn figure to show

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:30.870
why that works.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:34.110
But I hope you saw
the main point is

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:36.760
that for area and
volume, determinant

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.540
gives a great formula.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.100
OK.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:44.410
And next lectures are
about eigenvalues,

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:47.780
so we're really
into the big stuff.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.330
Thanks.
