LINAN CHEN: Hi.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.790
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.960
In the lecture, you've learned
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.170
of a matrix.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.250
One of the many important
applications of them

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.720
is solving a higher-order
linear differential equation

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.760
with constant coefficients.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.340
A typical example is like what
I've written on the board here.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.250
y is a function of t,
and y and its derivatives

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.510
satisfy this equation.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.830
As you can see, it involves
y, y prime, and all the way

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.370
to its third derivative.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.700
So our first goal is to solve
this differential equation

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.440
for its general solution
using the method of matrix.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.830
So the very first
thing that we should do

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.640
is to find out which matrix
we should be working with.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.380
So after that, we also
want to say something about

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.030
the explanation of
this matrix A*t.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.570
We want to find out the
first column of this matrix

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.750
exponential.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.940
Why don't you hit the pause
now, and try to write down

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.420
this matrix A by yourself.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.270
But before you continue,
make sure you come back

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.370
to this video and
check with me you've

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.850
got the correct A. I'll
see you in a while.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.950
OK, let's work together
to transform this problem

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.220
into linear algebra.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.770
The idea is to put
y double prime,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.560
y prime, and y
together as a vector.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.180
And let me call this vector u.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:07.420
So of course, vector u
is also a function in t.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.720
So this is vector u.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.790
If this is u, what's
going to be u prime?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.350
OK, u prime is going to
be-- so I take derivative

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.930
of every coordinate here that's
going to be y triple prime,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.170
y double prime, and y prime.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.580
So this is our u prime t.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.670
And my goal is to write
u prime as a matrix,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.710
call it A, times
vector u itself.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.090
So I want to put a matrix here.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.660
And I want to create this
matrix by incorporating

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.170
this differential equation.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.590
If you move everything
except y triple prime

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.060
to the right-hand
side of the equation,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.290
you can read y triple prime
is equal to negative 2 times

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.240
y double prime-- so y
triple prime is negative

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.960
2 times y double prime--
plus y prime-- that's

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.550
plus 1 times y prime-- plus 2y.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.440
That's 2y, right?

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.770
That gives you the first row.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.270
Then look at the
second coordinate,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.970
this y double prime.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.470
y double prime is simply itself.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.260
So you read y double prime is
equal to 1 y double prime, then

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.650
0, 0.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.820
That's the second row.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.850
Well, same thing
happens to the last row.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.390
y prime is again itself.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.660
So that's 0, 1, and 0.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.680
That is our matrix A. Did
you get the right answer?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.160
So we have transformed
this equation,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.770
this third-order ordinary
differential equation of y

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.540
into a first-order
differential equation of u(t).

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.480
Although u(t) is a
vector, but if we

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.000
can solve this
equation for u, we

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.380
have all the information
we need for y.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.490
So let's plan on
solving this equation.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.855
In order to solve
this equation, we

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:38.240
will need the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of this matrix A.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.930
Again, this is a good
practice for you.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.220
Why don't you pause
the video again,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.330
and try to complete this
problem on your own.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.970
When you're ready, I'm going
to come back and show you

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.820
how I did it.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.520
Let's finish up
everything together.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.540
So as we said, we need the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.395
of matrix A, and that involves
computing the determinant

00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:15.660
of the following matrix.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.540
So I want to compute the
determinant of A minus lambda

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.550
times the identity matrix I.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.180
Let's write it out.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:36.060
That's the determinant
of -2 minus lambda, 1 2;

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.540
1, negative lambda, 0;
and 0, 1, negative lambda.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.290
So we need the determinant of
this three by three matrix.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.220
Do it in your favorite way.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.570
You can either use the
big summation formula,

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.710
or you can do by cofactor
along any row or any column.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.140
The correct answer
should be this

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.570
is equal to 1 minus
lambda times 1 plus lambda

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.900
times 2 plus lambda.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.790
And this polynomial has
three roots: 1, -1, and -2.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.380
These are the eigenvalues
we're looking for.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.240
So let me write it here.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.700
Lambda_1 is equal to 1.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.990
Lambda_2 is equal to -1.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:42.970
And lambda_3 is equal to -2.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.040
So now what we need is the
eigenvector corresponding

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.620
to each eigenvalue.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.820
Let's take lambda_1 for example.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.130
The eigenvector of A
corresponding to lambda_1 is

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.390
in the null space of the
matrix A minus lambda_1*I,

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.230
so in this case it's A minus
I. So it's in the null space

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.870
of this matrix.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.360
In other words, we are
looking for a vector,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.600
let's call it [a, b, c], a
column vector a, b, and c, such

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.560
that this matrix multiplying
[a,  b, c] gives me 0.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.960
So if you write it
out, that's going

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:39.150
to be A minus I is
[-3, 1, 2; 1,  -1, 0; 0, 1, -1]

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.175
times [a; b; c] is equal to 0.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.460
OK.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.340
Could we choose
constants a, b, c

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.360
such that this is always true?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.390
Well if you read the last
row, so the last dot product,

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:04.030
it says that b has
to be equal to c.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.090
And if you read the
second row it says

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.690
that a has to be equal to b.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.750
Which means a is equal
to b is equal to c.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.140
And if this relation is
true, the first product

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.170
is always going to be 0.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.770
So that simply
means we can choose

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.780
the first eigenvector,
the eigenvector

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.690
corresponding to
lambda_1, to be x_1 is

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:41.100
equal to [1, 1, 1] transpose.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.760
So we choose the
first eigenvector

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.290
to be the column vector with
all the coordinates being 1.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.370
And you can do the same thing
to lambda_2 and lambda_3.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.600
But please allow me to
skip the computation here.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.900
I'm going to write out
the answer for you.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.040
So x_2 the eigenvector
corresponding

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.340
to the second
eigenvalue, is going

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.630
to be equal to 1, -1, and 1.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:23.190
And x_3 is going
to be 4, -2, and 1.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.030
Now we've got everything
we need in order

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.130
to create the general
solutions for u(t)

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.720
So we have eigenvalues, we have
the corresponding eigenvectors.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.660
What should be u(t)?

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:45.550
The general solution for u(t)
is equal to some constant C_1

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.280
times e to the power
lambda_1*t-- so in this case,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.890
e to the power t.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:56.250
Then times the first
eigenvector, x_1.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.160
Plus some other constant
C_2 times e to the power

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.140
lambda_2*t--

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:07.750
so e to the power
negative t-- times x_2.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.840
That's the second eigenvector.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.870
Then plus some other constant,
C_3 times e to the power

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:22.190
lambda_3t-- so negative
2t-- times x_3.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.740
That gives you the
general solution for u.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.080
As we just said, if
you know what u is,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.030
you have all the
information you need for y.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.340
Just in case you're
curious about what y is,

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.850
you can just read
the last coordinate

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.160
of x_1, x_2, and x_3.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.920
And you can see that
all of them are 1.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:57.986
So y(t) is simply equal to C_1
e to the power lambda t plus C_2

00:10:57.986 --> 00:11:06.290
e to the power negative t plus
C_3 e to the power negative 2t.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:12.300
And the choice of C_1, C_2, and
C_3 is completely arbitrary.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.030
So that completes the first
part of this question.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.490
In the second part, we
want to say something about

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.840
the exponential of A*t.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.180
So let me first give you
the recipe to cook up

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.680
the exponential of A*t.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:36.320
The exponential of A*t is
equal to the product of three

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.050
matrices.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.990
So you usually we
denote them by S times e

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:49.140
to the power capital
lambda t times S inverse.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.320
And you may ask what S is,
and what this matrix is.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:12:00.370
So S is the matrix that has x_1,
x_2, and x_3 being its column

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.560
vectors.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:09.270
So S is x_1, x_2, and x_3.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.600
Let me copy it down here.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:19.870
So that's 1, 1, 1;
1 -1, 1; 4, -2, 1.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.780
And the matrix in the middle,
e to the power lambda*t is

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.610
a diagonal matrix.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:34.060
So e to the power lambda*t,
it's a diagonal matrix,

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:39.300
and its diagonal entries
are given by e to the power

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.532
lambda_1*t-- so that's
e to the power t--

00:12:42.532 --> 00:12:45.770
then e to the power
lambda_2*t-- negative t--

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.330
and e to the power
lambda_3*t-- negative 2t.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.190
0 everywhere else.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.850
So that's e to the
power lambda*t.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.860
Then the exponential
of this At is

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.490
given by the product of
these three matrices.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.310
It looks a bit complicated
because it involves

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.010
the inverse of S.
But luckily, we only

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.400
want the first
column of the result.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:22.710
So if we consider this
product, we can see:

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.370
the product of the
first two matrices

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.220
is relatively easy, because
this is a diagonal matrix,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.730
and we know that S is
given by these columns.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.510
So the result of the
product of these two

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.130
is simply multiplying
the columns

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.220
of S by these
coefficients respectively.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.610
So you expect to get e
to the power lambda_t

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:52.230
x_1 times e to
the power-- sorry.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.220
The second column should be e
to the power negative t, x_2.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.556
The third column should be e
to the power negative 2t, x_3.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.570
And here, what we
should put is S inverse.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.680
But we don't need
everything from S inverse,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.770
because as we just
said, we only need

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.660
the first column of this
result. And the first column

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.050
of this product is
going to be given

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.940
by linear combinations
of these columns,

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.790
and the coefficients are going
to be given by the first column

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.430
S inverse.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.720
So our goal should
be just to get

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.320
the first column of S inverse.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.290
Then what is the first
column of S inverse?

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.040
Well, the formula
for S inverse is

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.510
S inverse is going to be the
reciprocal of the determinant

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.770
of S, so 1 over
determinant of S,

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:57.130
times the transpose of a
matrix C. This matrix C,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:02.680
the entries of this matrix C are
given by cofactors of matrix S.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.660
And then you take transpose,
you divide everything

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:11.270
by the determinant of S. The
result will be S inverse.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.700
And we only need the first
column of this matrix.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.220
Let's try to write
the first column out.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.930
Well again, do it
in your favorite way

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.830
to compute the determinant of S.
The result should be 1 over 6.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.650
So the determinant of S is 6.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:32.080
Then what is the first
column of C transpose?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.360
Well we can read it from here.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.600
This spot, the (1,
1) spot, should be

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.560
the cofactor of this spot here.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.800
That negative 1 minus
negative 2, which is 1,

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.390
so we put 1 here.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:03.660
Now this spot will be the
cofactor of this entry here.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.390
so that's 1 minus
negative 2, that's 3.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.940
But this is (1, 2) entry, so
you should put a negative sign

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.700
in the front.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:22.590
Then the last spot should be
the cofactor of this entry here,

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.520
which is 1 minus
negative 1, that's 2.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.360
Something else here.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.710
Two warnings.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.700
First, don't forget
this transpose sign.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.430
Second, don't forget
this negative sign.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.360
We've got the first
column of S inverse,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.320
and that's all we need.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.720
So we put it here.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:57.780
That's 1 over 6, -1/2, and 1/3.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.210
That's good enough for me.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.700
Now I can read out the first
column of exponential of A*t.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.050
So the first column of
the exponential of A*t,

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.060
I'm going to write it here.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.690
That's going to be equal
to the linear combination

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.990
of these columns.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.154
So that's 1/6 of
the first column,

00:17:25.154 --> 00:17:30.580
that's e to the power
t over 6 times x_1.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:37.700
Plus this times this, so that's
going to be minus 1/2 of e

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.040
to the power
negative t times x_2.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:50.660
Then plus 1/3 of e to the
power negative 2t times x_3.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.940
That's the first column
of the exponential A*t.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.980
And then with the
other two columns.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.520
That's the answer.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.740
If you want more practice, you
can certainly complete this S

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.720
inverse, and then you can
also complete the exponential

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.280
of A*t.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.360
But I will leave
the rest to you.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.120
OK, I hope this
example shows you

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.160
that linear algebra can be
a powerful tool in solving

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.760
higher-order ordinary
differential equations

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.890
with constant coefficients.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.110
And we have demonstrated the
standard procedure to do it,

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.720
and we also practiced
how to calculate

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.140
the exponential of a matrix.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.140
Thanks for watching,
and see you next time.
