00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.100
OK.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.500
Uh this is the review
lecture for the first part

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.880
of the course, the Ax=b
part of the course.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.710
And the exam will
emphasize chapter three.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.890
Because those are
the --0 chapter

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.940
three was about the
rectangular matrices

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.750
where we had null spaces and
null spaces of A transpose,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.450
and ranks, and all
the things that

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.890
are so clear when the matrix
is square and invertible,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.080
they became things to think
about for rectangular matrices.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.590
So, and vector spaces and
subspaces and above all

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.400
those four subspaces.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.940
OK, I'm thinking to
start at least I'll

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.210
just look at old exams,
read out questions, write

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.320
on the board what
I need to and we

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.980
can see what the answers are.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.420
The first one I see is
one I can just read out.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.930
Well, I'll write a little.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:32.145
Suppose u, v and w are
nonzero vectors in R^7.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.190
What are the possible -- they
span a -- a vector space.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.510
They span a subspace of R^7,
and what are the possible

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.130
dimensions?

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.840
So that's a
straightforward question,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.610
what are the possible dimensions
of the subspace spanned

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.040
by u, v and w?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.430
OK, one, two, or three, right.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.320
One, two or three.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.930
Couldn't be more because
we've only got three vectors,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.430
and couldn't be zero because --

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.030
because I told you the
vectors were nonzero.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.020
Otherwise if I allowed the
possibility that those were all

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.319
the zero vector -- then the
zero-dimensional subspace would

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.110
have been in there.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.250
OK.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.970
Now can I jump to a
more serious question?

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.600
OK.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.850
We have a five by three matrix.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.860
And I'm calling it U.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.010
I'm saying it's in echelon form.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.600
And it has three pivots, r=3.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.810
Three pivots.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.140
Ok.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.820
First question what's
the null space?

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.865
What's the null
space of this matrix

00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:11.910
U, so this matrix is five by
three, and I find it helpful to

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.860
just see

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.750
visually what five by three
means, what that shape is.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.420
Three columns.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.810
Three columns in U,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.040
then five rows,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.430
three pivots,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.650
and what's the null space?

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.360
The null space of U is --

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.000
and it asks for a
spec-of course I'm

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.390
looking for an answer
that isn't just

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.340
the definition of
the null space,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.030
but is the null space of this
matrix, with this information.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.220
And what is it?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.110
It's only the zero vector.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.810
Because we're told
that the rank is three,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.840
so those three columns must be
independent, no combination --

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.890
of those columns is the
zero vector except --

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.671
so the only thing in this
null space is the zero vector,

00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:02.170
and I --

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.030
I could even say what that
vector is, zero, columns also?

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.200
zero, zero.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.870
That's OK.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.020
So that's what's
in the null space.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.015
All right? let me go on with
-- this question has multiple

00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:15.515
parts.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:24.950
What's the -- oh now it asks you
about a ten by three matrix, B,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.530
which is the matrix U and two U.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.340
It actually -- I would
probably be writing R --

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.630
and maybe I should be
writing R here now.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.800
This exam goes back a few
years when I emphasized U more

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.980
than R.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.630
Now, what's the echelon
form for that matrix?

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.150
So the echelon form,
what's the rank,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.125
Yes. and what's
the echelon form?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.270
Let's suppose this is
in reduced echelon form,

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.360
so that I could be
using the letter R.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.480
So I'll ask for the reduced row
echelon form so imagine that

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.610
So I'm seeing the same length
in b, three, and also in x.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.110
these are --

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.880
U is in reduced row
echelon form but now

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.500
I've doubled the
height of the matrix,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.720
So the (x)-s that it multiplies
have three components,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.150
what will happen when
we do row reduction?

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.950
What row reduction will
take us to what matrix here?

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.270
So you start doing elimination.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.590
You're doing elimination
on single rows.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.050
But of course we're
allowed to think of blocks.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.820
So what, well, what's
the answer look like?

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.921
U and z- or R --

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.170
let's -- I'll stay with this
letter U but I'm what was

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.660
the name of that --2 winning
a million dollars or really

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.030
thinking it's in
reduced form, and zero.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.710
OK.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.810
Fine.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:10.390
Then it asks oh, further,
it asks about this matrix.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.720
U, U, U, and zero.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.190
OK, what's the
echelon form of this?

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.050
So it's just like
practice in thinking

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.560
through what would
row elimination,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.790
what would row reduction do.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.450
Have I thought this through,
so what -- what are we --

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.920
if we start doing elimination,
basically we're going

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.030
to subtract these
rows from these --

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.080
In the column
space, because I do

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.190
know that it can so it's going
to take us to U, U, zero,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.090
and minus U, For example, I'm
going to ask you for a I guess,

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.590
right?

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.240
But is it a- is
it three by three?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.690
Take the thing all the way to R
-- let's suppose U is really R.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.660
Suppose that we're really going
for the reduced row echelon

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.930
doing linear
algebra of course --

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.390
but I didn't have
to do the form.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.090
Then would we stop there?

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.260
No.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.740
We would clean out, we would
-- we could use this to --

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.770
is that right, can I
so I took this row --

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.540
these rows away from
these to get there.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.885
Now I take these rows away from
these, so that gives me zero.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:25.030
There. there?1 And now what
more would I do if I'm really

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.460
shooting for R, the
reduced row echelon form?

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.200
I would -- then I want
plus ones in the pivot,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.750
so I would multiply through by
minus one to get plus there.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.170
So essentially I'm seeing
reduced row echelon form

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.180
there and there, and there's
just one little twist

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.040
still to go.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.324
Do you see what that
final twist might be?

00:07:51.324 --> 00:07:52.490
It certainly has three rows.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.790
To have if -- if U is in
reduced row echelon form and now

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.490
I'm looking at U, U, there's
one little step to take,

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.090
this isn't like a big
deal at all, but --

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.880
but if I really want this
to be in reduced form,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.050
what would I still --

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.740
might I still have to do?

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.750
I might have some
zero rows here,

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.720
I might have some zero
rows here that strictly

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.720
should move to the bottom.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.079
Well, I'm not going to
make a project out of that.

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:26.620
first of all?

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.760
OK.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.445
What's the rank of that matrix?

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:37.250
What's the rank
of this matrix C?

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.854
Given that I know that the
original U has rank three,

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:42.020
what's the rank of this guy?

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.080
Six, right.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.289
That has rank six, I can tell.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.030
What was -- what's the
rank of this B, while --

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.159
while we're at on TV for a
few weeks, did you see that,

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:43.659
it?

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:56.690
The rank of B, is
that six or three?

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.200
So A is a three by three matrix.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.300
Three is right.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:08:59.940
Three is right.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.520
Because we actually got it to
where we could just see three

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.330
pivots.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:08.230
OK, and oh, now
finally this easy one,

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:15.020
what's the dimension be solved
exactly when B is in the column

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.410
space, of the null space --

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.370
of the null space
of C transpose?

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.980
Oh, boy.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.260
OK, so what do I -- if I want
the dimension of a null space,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.240
I want to know the
size of the matrix --

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.450
so what's the size
of the matrix C?

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:38.200
It looks like it's
ten by six, is it?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:49.280
Ten by six, so C is ten by six,
so m is ten, so C has ten rows,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.190
C transpose has ten columns,
so there are ten columns there.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.950
So how many free variables
have I got, once I --

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.950
There's quite a few trues,
shall I take a poll,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.950
if I start with the ten
columns in C transpose,

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.050
that's the m for the original C.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.640
And what do I subtract off?

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.140
Six.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.240
Because we said
that was the rank.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.540
So I'm left with four.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.040
Thanks.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.540
OK.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.840
If b is in the -- and what
would -- what does the exam say

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.080
So I think that's
the right answer --

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.580
the dimension of the null space
of C transpose would be four.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.870
Right.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.870
OK.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.570
Yeah.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.650
OK.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:34.710
So that's one question, at
least it brought in some --

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.130
some of the dimension counts.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.630
OK.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.088
Here's another type of question.
think about, what's the --

00:10:40.088 --> 00:10:44.520
what's the shape of the matrix,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:52.870
I give you an equation,
Ax equals two four two.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.590
And I give you the
complete solution.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.992
And what's its rank?

00:10:57.992 --> 00:10:59.325
But I don't give you the matrix.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:10.810
And another -- there's another
vector, zero, zero, one.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.310
OK.

00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:16.450
All right.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:22.660
My first question is what's
the dimension of the row space?

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.160
Of the matrix A?

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:31.890
So the main thing that you
want to get from this question

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.130
is that a question
could start this way.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.770
exam, don't just tell me.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.890
Sort of backward way.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.130
so I guess I'm
asking you what is

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:50.420
the column space for this
basis for the null space.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:56.770
By giving you the answer and
not telling you what the problem

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:02.590
homework, so I was watching
it, so there were three --

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.650
the is.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:07.890
But we can get a
lot of information,

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.590
and sometimes we can
get complete information

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.710
about that matrix A.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.240
OK.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.530
So what's the dimension
of the row space of A?

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.120
What's the rank?

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:27.470
Tell me about what's the size
of the matrix, yeah, just --

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.230
These are the things
we want to matrix b

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.470
and I'll answer them
without multiplying it out.2

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.760
Its rank -- tell me something
about its null space,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.000
I heard the right
answer for the rank,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.700
the rank is one in this case.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.230
Why?

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.940
Because the dimension
of the null space,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:59.760
so the dimension of this
instant?3 the null space of A

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.050
is from knowing that that's the
complete solution, it's two.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.760
I'm seeing two vectors
here, and they're

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.460
independent in the
null space of A,

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.170
because they have to be in the

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.400
OK, which -- did
you watch that quiz,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:26.750
there was a quiz program null
space of A if I'm allowed

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.650
to throw into the solution
any amount of those vectors,

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.620
that tells me that's the
null space part then.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.400
So the dimension of the null
space is two, and then I --

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:44.010
of course I know the dimensions
of all the -- four subspaces.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.090
Now actually it asks
what's the matrix?

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:52.440
Well, what's the
matrix in this case?

00:13:52.440 --> 00:14:01.210
Do we want to -- shall I
try to figure that out?

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.790
Sure.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.290
Let's -- you'd like
me to do it, OK.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.164
Well, what's the ----

00:14:04.164 --> 00:14:05.590
I actually say in this in the

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.630
So what about the matrix,
or let me at least start it,

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.140
OK.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.720
If A times this x
gives two, four, two,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.300
what does that tell
me about the matrix A?

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:26.210
If A times that x solves that
equation then it tells me that

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.900
the first column is --

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:35.560
the first column of A is
-- one, two, one, right.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.580
The first column of A
has to be one, two, one,

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:37.650
because if I
multiply by x, that's

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:37.730
going to multiply just
matrix? the first column,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.790
and give me two, four, two.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.900
And then I've got two
more columns to find,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.000
and what information have
I got to find them with?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.070
A basis for the null space.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:38.130
I've got the null space.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.230
So the fact that this
is in the null space,

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.370
what does that tell So what
is if b has the form --

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.411
so I guess I'm asking
what's me about the matrix?

00:14:40.411 --> 00:14:59.047
A matrix that has zero,
zero, one in its null space?

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.840
That tells me that the last
column of the matrix is zeroes.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.880
so how many think true?

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.820
Because this is
in the null space,

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.897
the last column has to be

00:15:14.897 --> 00:15:16.230
When could it be solved? zeroes.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.510
And because this is in
the null space, what's

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.850
the second column?

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.880
Well, this in the
null space means

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.910
that if I multiply
A by that vector

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:32.530
I must be getting zeroes, so I
think that better be minus one,

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:44.370
minus two, and minus one.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.300
OK.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.340
That's a type of question
that just brings out

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.050
the information that's in
that complete solution.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.180
And then actually I go on to
ask what vectors -- for what

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:53.250
OK. vectors B can
Ax=b be solved?

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:53.380
Ax=b can be solved if what --
so I'm looking for a condition

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.460
Definitely not. on b,
if any. interesting --

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:53.550
the novel point was there
were three ways that

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.640
Can it be solved for
every right-hand side b?

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.140
No.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:16:07.315
And the answer is --

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:25.505
yes or no --

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:30.054
right.

00:16:34.097 --> 00:16:34.596
solvable?

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:44.920
the column space of this
matrix, and what is it?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.810
It's so the column space of
that matrix is all multiples b

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.490
Can you tell me something --

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.170
so I'll ask questions
about this --

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:04.609
b is a multiple
of one, two, one.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:05.290
Right?

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:14.140
I can solve the thing if it's
a multiple of one, two, one,

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.220
and of course sure enough --

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.140
yeah, that was a multiple
of one, two, one,

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.829
and so I had a solution.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:34.640
So this is a case where
we've got lots of null space.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:44.760
Let me just recall rank is
big, don't forget those cases,

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:57.390
don't forget the other cases
when r is as big as it can be,

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.580
OK. r equal m or r equal n.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.970
Those are -- we had a full
lecture on that, the full rank,

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.480
full lecture, and important
-- important case.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.471
I gave you every chance
to think about that.

00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:13.970
OK.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.760
I'll just move on.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.800
I think this is the
best type of review.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.380
So I'm going to
solve Bx equals zero.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.080
It's just brings
these ideas out.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.511
Apologies to the camera while
I recover glasses and exam.

00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:31.010
OK.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.700
How about a few true-false ones?

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.100
Actually there won't be
a true-false on the quiz.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.980
But it gives us a
moment of quick review.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.500
True or false, how do
you feel about it at

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.190
Here's one.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.930
If the null space --

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.400
I have a square matrix.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.740
If its null space is
just the zero vector,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.750
what about the null
space of A transpose?

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.840
If the null space of A
is just the zero vector,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.580
and the matrix is
square, what do I

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.430
know about the null
space of A transpose?

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.420
Also the zero vector.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:07.960
Good.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.270
And that's a very
very important fact.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:11.630
OK.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.000
How about this?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.450
These -- look at the space
of five by five matrices

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.280
as a vector space.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.690
So it's actually a
twenty-five-dimensional vector

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.190
space.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.990
All five by five matrices.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.770
Look at the invertible matrices.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:35.430
Do they form a subspace?

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:40.430
So I have this five by --
a space of all five by five

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.580
matrices.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.180
I can add them, I can
multiply by numbers.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.110
But now I narrow down
to the invertible ones.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.700
And I ask are they a subspace?

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.600
And you -- your answer is --

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.418
quiet, but nevertheless
definite, no.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:00.800
Right?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.040
Because if I add two invertible
matrices I have no idea if the

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.570
No. answer is invertible.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.340
If I multiply that
invertible -- well,

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.600
it doesn't even have
the zero matrix in it,

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.630
it couldn't be a subspace.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.020
I have to be able to
multiply by zero --

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:21.010
and stay in my subspace, and the
invertible ones wouldn't work.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.210
Well, the singular ones
wouldn't work either.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.540
They have zero -- the zero
matrix is in the singular

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.720
matrices, but if I add two
singular matrices I don't know

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.410
if the answer is
singular or not.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.340
OK.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.420
So another true-false.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.510
If b squared equals
zero then b equals zero.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.580
columns then the
question is does Ax=b,

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.904
is it always True or false?

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.320
If b squared equals zero, true,
false? you could get help,

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:40.820
right --

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:54.590
b squared equals zero, b has to
be a square -- square matrix,

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.960
so that I can
multiply it by itself,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.910
does that imply that B is zero?

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.470
Are there matrices whose square
could be the zero matrix?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.630
Yes or no?

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.830
Yes there are.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.350
There are matrices whose
square is the zero matrix.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.725
So this statement is false.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.980
If b squared is zero, we
don't know that b is zero.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.290
For example -- the best
example is that matrix.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:35.510
That matrix is a
dangerous matrix.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:42.580
It will come up in later parts
of this course as an example

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.890
of what can go wrong.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.720
And here is a real
simple -- so this --

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.010
so if I square that without
doing the multiplication

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.940
and finding the
matrix b. matrix,

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:04.770
I do get the zero
matrix,and it shows --

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.270
OK.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:16.220
A system of m
equations in m unknowns

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:30.620
is solvable for
every right-hand side

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:36.490
if the columns are independent.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.870
So can I say that again, I'm --

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.750
I'll write it down then

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.440
OK.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.820
for short.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.270
m by m matrix independent

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:52.110
So give me a basis for --

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.250
for the null space of B.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.630
Let's see.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:03.150
but you could only
use each way once,

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:09.370
so you couldn't like
use them all the time.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.440
So remember that?

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:17.650
You could -- so you
could poll the audience,

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.800
and that was a very --

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.630
that was a hundred
percent successful way,

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:31.460
so I'll poll the
audience on this.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.920
If the other possibility --

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:40.440
another possibility you could
call your friend, right,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:48.030
or he's your friend until he
gives you the wrong answer,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.410
which --

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:57.010
that turned out subspaces,
then A is some multiple of B.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:01.840
to be very unreliable,
you know, you'd

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.990
call up your
brother or something

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:12.200
and ask him for the capital
of whatever, Bosnia.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.940
What does he know,
he makes some guess,

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:29.560
So what -- I would just take
extreme cases if it was me,

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.602
matrix, independent columns,
is Ax=b always solvable?

00:24:32.602 --> 00:24:33.810
Maybe just hands up for that?

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:34.310
A few.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.420
And who says no?

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.730
Oh, gosh, this audience
is not reliable.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:47.230
Fifty fifty.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:51.070
I guess I'd say, I'd vote yes.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.120
Because independent
columns, that

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.190
means that the rank
is the full size m,

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.890
I have a matrix of rank m.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:01.530
That means it's --

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.710
I mean it's square, so
it's an invertible matrix,

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.330
and nothing could go wrong.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.090
Yes.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.070
So that's the good case and
we always expect it in chapter

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:18.130
two, but of course
chapter three is --

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:24.990
only one of the possibilities.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.360
OK.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:41.460
Let me move on to another
question from an old quiz.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.840
OK.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.210
OK.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.960
Let's see.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:26:07.550
I'm going to give you a matrix,
but I'm going to give it to you

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.920
OK.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:19.910
as a product of a
couple of matrices,

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:32.260
one, one, zero, zero,
one, zero, one, zero, one,

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:39.130
times another matrix, one, zero,

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:52.860
I would like to ask you
questions about that matrix

00:26:52.860 --> 00:27:07.960
minus one, two, zero, one,
one, minus one, and all zeroes.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.330
OK.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.070
Let's see, what
dimension I in --

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:17.210
the null space of B
is a subspace of R.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.110
What size vectors
I looking for here?

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:24.124
Because if we don't
know the size,

00:27:24.124 --> 00:27:26.040
we aren't going to find
it, right? the null --

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:33.530
this matrix is three
by four obviously.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:37.950
So if we're looking for the null
space we're looking for those

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.870
vectors x in R^4.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:40.830
OK.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.490
So the null space of B is
certainly a subspace of R^4.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.490
What do you think
its dimension is?

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.930
Of course once we
find the basis we

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.010
would know the dimension
immediately, but let's

00:27:55.010 --> 00:28:00.590
stop first, what's the
rank of this matrix B?

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:05.010
Let's see, what -- is
that matrix invertible,

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.306
that square one there?

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.110
Let's say sure, I
think it is, yes,

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.330
that matrix B looks invertible.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.230
Is that pretty clear?

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.090
Yeah.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.180
Yeah.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.450
So I've gone wrong in
this course already,

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:33.210
but I'll still hope that
that matrix is invertible.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.650
Yeah, yeah, because if I look
for a combination of those

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:41.600
three columns -- well, I
couldn't use this middle column

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.890
because it would have a one
and in a position that I --

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.370
column is otherwise all zero,
so a combination that gives zero

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:56.180
can't give us that problem, and
then the other two are clearly

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.090
independent sets -- so
that matrix is invertible.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.600
Later we could take a
determinant or other things.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.100
OK.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.500
What's the setup?

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:11.850
If I have an invertible matrix,
a nice invertible square

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.620
matrix, times this guy,
times this second factor,

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.840
and I'm looking
for the null space,

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.305
does this have any effect?

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.490
Is the null -- so what I'm
asking is is the null space

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:33.500
of B the same as the null
space of just this part?

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.950
I think so.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:36.820
I think so.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:41.470
If Bx is zero, then
multiplying by that guy

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:42.870
I'll still have zero.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:47.970
But also if this times
some x give zero,

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.550
I could always multiply on the
left by the inverse of that,

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:55.100
because it is invertible,
and I would discover

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.040
that this kind of Bx is zero.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.700
You want me to write
some of that down --

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.730
if I have a product
here, C times --

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:14.040
times D, say, and
if C is invertible,

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.660
the null space of CD,
well, it will the same

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.880
as the null space of D.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.770
If C is invertible.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.570
Multiplying by an invertible
matrix on the left

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.520
can't change the null space.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.050
OK.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.550
So basically I'm asking you
for the null space of this.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.920
so when do I know -- well, I
would say suppose the matrix

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.540
I don't have to do
the multiplication

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.210
because I have C is invertible.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.220
That first factor
C is invertible.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.550
It's not going to
change the null space.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.320
OK.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:55.430
So can we just write down a
basis now for the null space?

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:59.060
So what's the basis for the
null space of -- of that?

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:06.080
So basis for the null space
I'm looking for the two --

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.330
there are two pivot
columns obviously.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.200
It clearly has rank two.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:15.450
If -- so true or false, if
A and B have the same four

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.070
I'm looking for the
two special solutions.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.070
They'll come from the
third and the fourth.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:22.200
The free variables.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.940
OK. so if the third
free variable is a one,

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.690
then I think probably I
need a minus one there

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:32.320
and a one there, it looks like.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.690
Do you agree that if I then do
that multiplication I'll get

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.190
zero?

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.940
And if I have one in the
fourth variable, then

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:46.190
maybe I need a one in the second
variable and maybe a minus two

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:47.970
in the third.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:51.310
So I just reasoned that through
and then if I look back I see

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:55.450
sure enough that the free
variable part that I sometimes

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.410
call F, that up --
that two by two corner,

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:06.250
is sitting here with
all its signs reversed.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.720
So that's -- here
I'm seeing minus F,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.110
and here I'm seeing the identity
in the null space matrix.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.460
OK, so that's the null space.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:23.980
Another question is solve
Bx equal one, zero, one.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.190
OK.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:34.890
So that's one question, now
solve complete solutions.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:39.090
To Bx equal one, zero, one.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.200
OK.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.020
Yeah, so I guess I'm
seeing if I wanted

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:54.790
to get one, zero, one - What's
our particular solution?

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.460
So I'm looking for a
particular solution

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.720
and then the null space

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.390
part.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.090
OK.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:05.360
I-- actually the
first column of B,

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.840
so what's the first
column of our matrix B?

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.770
It's the vector one, zero, one.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:14.140
The first column of
our matrix agrees

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.430
with the right-hand side.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.670
So I guess I'm
thinking x particular

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:22.570
plus x null space will be
the particular solution,

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:27.814
since the first column of B is
exactly right, that's great.

00:33:27.814 --> 00:33:29.980
And then I have C times
that first null space vector

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:37.881
and D times the other
null space vector.

00:33:37.881 --> 00:33:38.380
Right?

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.700
The two -- the null space
part of the solution,

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:48.060
as always has the
arbitrary constants,

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.380
the particular solution doesn't
have any arbitrary constants,

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.840
it's one particular solution,
and in this case it'll --

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.160
that one would do.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.070
OK.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.750
Fine.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:03.030
so those are questions
taken from old quizzes,

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:09.781
any questions coming to mind?

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:10.280
Yeah.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:10.780
Q: value.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.300
OK.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.000
Well, so that
particular x particular,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.330
it says that let's see,
when I multiply by this guy,

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.850
I'm going to get the
first column of B.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:30.050
That -- if that's a
solution, I multiply B,

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:34.060
B times this x will be
the first column of B,

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:39.480
and so I'm saying that the first
column of this B agrees with

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.300
the right-hand side.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:47.340
So I'm saying that look at the
first column of that matrix B.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.780
If you do the
multiplication, it's --

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.659
so what's the first
column of that matrix?

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.370
Is that how you do
that multiplication?

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.203
I multiply that matrix
by that first column.

00:34:56.203 --> 00:34:59.400
And it picks out one, zero, one.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:11.020
So the first column
of B is exactly that.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:18.650
And therefore a particular
solution will be this guy.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:19.960
So I'll repeat that question.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.150
Yeah.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.650
OK.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:22.150
Yes.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.170
Q: particular solution.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.320
Any of the solutions can
be the particular one

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.180
that we pick out.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.940
So like this plus -- plus this
would be another particular

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.610
OK.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.110
solution.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:48.260
It would be another solution.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:53.040
The particular is just
telling us only take one.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.370
But it's not telling us
which one we have to take.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.850
We take the most convenient one.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:02.560
I guess in this -- in this
problem that was that one.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.480
Good.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.750
Other questions?

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:06.250
Yes.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.550
And this pattern
of particular plus

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:15.370
null space, of course, that's
going throughout mathematics

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.770
of linear systems.

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.970
We're really doing mathematics
of linear systems here.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.070
Our systems are discrete and
they're finite-dimensional --

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:31.860
and so it's linear algebra, but
this particular plus null space

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:37.850
goes -- that doesn't depend
on having finite matrices --

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:42.990
that spreads much --
that spreads everywhere.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.280
OK, I'm going to just
like to encourage

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.370
you to take problems
out of the book,

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.250
let me do the same myself.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:54.160
OK well here's some
easy true or falses.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:58.440
I don't know why the
author put these in here.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.530
OK.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:03.720
If m=n, then the row space
equals the column space.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.390
is invertible -- suppose
A is an invertible

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:09.790
So these are true or falses.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:13.230
If m equals n, so that
means the matrix is square,

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:17.410
then the row space
equals the column space?

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:18.760
False, good.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.260
Good, what is equal there?

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:25.830
What can I say is
equal, if M -- well,

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.440
yeah.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.610
Yeah it -- so that's
definitely false --

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.160
the row space and
the column space,

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:37.550
and this matrix is like always
a good example to consider.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.530
So there's a square
matrix but it's row

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:44.200
space is the multiples
of zero, one,

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.310
and its column space is
the multiples of one, zero.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:50.240
Very different.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.680
The row space and
the column space

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.230
are totally different
for that matrix.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.730
Now of course if the
matrix was symmetric,

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:01.780
well, then clearly the row
space equals the column space.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.280
OK.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.930
How about this question?

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:08.910
The matrices A and minus A
share the same four subspaces?

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:15.230
Do the matrices A and minus
A have the same column space,

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.100
do they have the
same null space,

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.480
do they have the same row

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.050
space?

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.960
What's the answer on that?

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:31.120
Yes or no.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:31.620
Yes.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.310
Good.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.100
OK.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:33.900
How about this?

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:40.020
If A and B have the
same four subspaces,

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.470
then A is a multiple of B.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.261
If -- suppose those
subspaces are the same.

00:38:43.261 --> 00:38:44.680
Then is A a multiple of B?

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.510
OK.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:53.000
How how do you answer
a question like that?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.500
Of course if you want to
answer it yes, then I would --

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.460
then they'd have to
think of a reason why.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.050
If you want to answer no
way, then you would --

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:06.410
and I would sort of like
first I would try to think no,

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:10.540
I would say can I come up with
an example where it isn't true?

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:17.680
Let me repeat the question.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:24.810
And then write the answer.

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:30.520
matrix, then what --

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:40.510
suppose it's six by
six invertible matrix,

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:59.070
then what's its row space, and
its column space is all of R^6,

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:17.620
and the null space, and the null
space of A transpose would be

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.900
the zero vector.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:36.170
So every invertible matrix
is going to give that answer.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:49.020
If I have a six by
six invertible matrix,

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.602
I know what those subspaces are.

00:40:51.602 --> 00:40:53.060
Heck, that was back
in chapter two,

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.720
when I didn't even know
what subspaces were.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:01.890
The row space and column space
are both all six-dimensional

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:05.470
space -- the whole space,
and the rank is six,

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:10.280
in other words, and the null
spaces have zero dimension.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.870
So do you see now the answer?

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:13.060
So A and B could be.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.970
So A and B could be for example
any -- so I'm going to say

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:17.470
false.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:21.070
Because A and B for example --

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:34.230
So an example: A and B any
invertible six by six, six

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.730
by six.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:39.230
So those would have
the same four subspaces

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.480
but they wouldn't be the same.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.890
Of course th- there should be
something about those matrices

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:45.930
that would be the same.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:50.070
It's sort of a natural
problem, so now actually we're

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:52.120
getting to a math question.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.390
The answer is this is not true.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:59.300
One matrix doesn't have to
be a multiple of the other.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.420
But there must be
something that's true.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.770
And that would be sort of like
a natural question to ask.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:15.850
If they have the same
subspaces, same four subspaces,

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:29.700
then what -- what could you --

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.480
instinct wasn't
necessarily right.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.700
But I hope you now see that
the correct answer is false.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.550
And then you might think
OK, well, they certainly

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:43.530
do have the same rank.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:51.860
But do -- obviously if they
have the same four subspaces,

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.460
they have the same rank.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:58.620
I might say if
they have the well,

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:03.820
I could extend that question and
think about other possibilities

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:08.500
and finally come up with
something that was true.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.620
But I won't press that one.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:15.270
Let me keep going with
practice questions.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:19.430
And these practice questions
are quite appropriate I

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.510
think for the exam.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:22.030
OK.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:23.070
let's see.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:29.310
If I exchange two rows of A
which subspaces stay the same?

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.950
So I'm trying to
take out questions

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:38.670
that we can answer without you
know we can answer quickly.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:45.560
If I have a matrix A, and I
exchange two of its rows, which

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.570
subspaces stay the same?

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.560
The row space does
stay the same.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.440
And the null space
stays the same.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.270
Good.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:55.200
Good.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.690
Correct.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.170
Column space would
be a wrong answer.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.280
OK.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.140
all right, here's a question.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.730
Oh, this leads into
the next chapter.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:08.990
Why can the vector
one, two, three not

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:12.280
be a row and also
in the null space?

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.040
Fitting we close
with this question.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.860
Close is -- so V
equal this one, two,

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:33.900
three can't be in the null space
of a matrix and the row space.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:40.690
And my question is why not?

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:41.378
Why not?

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.950
So this is a
question that we can

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:51.360
because it's sort of asked
in a straightforward way,

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.410
we can figure out an answer.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:57.460
Well, actually yeah --

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:00.550
I'll even pin it down, it
can't be in the null space --

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:04.420
and be a row.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.050
I'll even pin it down further.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:12.550
Ask it to be a row of A.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:15.000
Why not?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.820
So I'm -- we know the
dimensions of these spaces.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:26.330
But now I'm asking you sort
of like the overlap between --

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:30.320
so the null space
and the row space,

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.210
those are in the same
n-dimensional space.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:41.410
Those are -- well, those are
both subspaces of n-dimensional

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:45.060
space, and I'm basically
saying they can't overlap.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:49.040
I can't have a vector like
this, a typical vector, that's

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:53.110
in the null space and it's
also a row of the matrix.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:54.580
Why is that?

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.350
So that's a new sort of idea.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.320
Let's just see
what it would mean.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:04.860
I mean that A times this V,
why can this A times this

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.770
V it can't be zero.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:12.410
Oh well, if it's
zero, so this is --

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:16.830
I'm getting it into
the null space here.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:20.750
So this is -- now let's put
that vector's in the null space,

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:27.600
why can't the first row of
a matrix be one, two, three?

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:35.470
I can fill out the
matrix as I like.

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:37.010
Why is that impossible?

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.310
Well, you're seeing
it's impossible, right?

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:44.690
That if that was a row of the
matrix and in the null space,

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:48.421
that number would not be
zero, it would be fourteen.

00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:48.920
Right.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.960
So now we actually are beginning
to get a more complete picture

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.170
of these four subspaces.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:47:00.220
The two that are over
in n-dimensional space,

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:04.450
they actually only
share the zero vector.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:08.110
The intersection of the
null space and the row space

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:09.310
is only the zero vector.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:14.970
And in fact the null space is
perpendicular to the row space.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:18.920
That'll be the first
topic let's see,

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.940
we have a holiday Monday --

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:29.800
and I'll see you Wednesday
with perpendiculars.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.980
And I'll see you Friday.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:39.710
So good luck on the quiz.
