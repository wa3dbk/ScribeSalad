00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.660
Okay.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.950
This is lecture six
in linear algebra,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.790
and we're at the start of this
new chapter, chapter three

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.500
in the text, which
is really getting

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.930
to the center of linear algebra.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.460
And I had time to make
a first start on it

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.690
at the end of lecture five.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.430
But now is lecture
six is officially

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.610
the lecture on vector
spaces and subspaces.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.070
And then especially --
there are two subspaces that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.840
we're specially interested in.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.680
One is the column
space of a matrix,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.630
the other is the null
space of the matrix.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.050
So, I got to tell
you what those are.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.140
Okay.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.140
So, first to remember
from lecture five,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.350
what is a vector space?

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.410
It's a bunch of vectors
that -- where I'm allowed --

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.970
where I can add --

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.690
I can add any two
vectors in the space

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.300
and the answer
stays in the space.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.610
Or I can multiply any vector
in the space by any constant

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.870
and the result
stays in the space.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.950
So that's -- in fact if I
combine those two into one,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.710
you can see that -- if I can add
and I can multiply by numbers,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.750
that really means that I can
take linear combinations.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.220
So the quick way to say it is
that all linear combinations,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.250
C -- any multiple of V
plus any multiple of W stay

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.220
in the space.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.070
So, can I give you examples
that are vector spaces and also

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.850
some examples that are not,
to make that point clear?

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.220
So, suppose I'm in
three dimensions.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.950
Then one way to get us one space
is the whole three dimensional

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.200
space.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.770
So the whole space R^3,
three dimensional space,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.100
would be a vector space, because
if I have a couple of vectors I

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.040
can add them and I'm certainly
okay and they follow all

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.240
the rules.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.600
So R^3 is easy.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.320
Now I'm interested
also in subspaces.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.370
So there's this key
word, subspaces.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.530
That's a space -- that's some
vectors inside the given space,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.940
inside R three that still make
up a vector space of their own.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.990
It's a vector space
inside a vector space.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.030
And the simplest
example was a plane.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.070
So, like, can I just sketch
it -- there is a plane.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.280
It's got to go
through the origin,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.390
and of course it
goes infinitely far.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.620
That's of that's a subspace now.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.190
Do you see that if I have
two vectors on the plane

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.920
and I add them, the
result stays in the plane.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.770
If I take a vector in the plane
and I multiply by minus two,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.520
I'm still in the plane.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.240
So that plane is a subspace.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.120
So let me just make that point.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:44.120
Plane through zero, through that
zero zero zero is a subspace.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.060
Okay.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.710
And also, another
subspace would be a line.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.230
A line through zero
zero zero -- yeah,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.240
the line has to go
through the origin.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.390
All subspaces have got
to contain the origin,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.910
contain zero -- the zero vector.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.015
So this line is a subspace.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.910
Really, if I want to
say it really correctly,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.899
I should say a subspace of R^3.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:23.710
That of R^3 was, like,
understood there.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.730
Now -- so let me call this plane
P. And let me call this line L.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:40.540
And let me ask you about
other sets of vectors.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.210
Suppose I took --

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.310
yeah -- so here's
a first question.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.030
Suppose I take two
subspaces, like P and L.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.610
And I just put them
together, take their union,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.890
take all the vectors --

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.880
so now you've got P
and L in mind, here.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.870
So I have two subspaces.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.960
I have two subspaces
and, for example, P --

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.070
a plane and L a line.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.410
Okay.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.970
Now I want to ask you
about the union of those.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.190
So P union L.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:29.990
This is all vectors
in P or L or both.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.240
Is that a subspace?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.040
Is this a subspace?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:48.380
This is or is not a subspace?

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.690
Because we're -- I just want
to be sure that I've got

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.340
the central idea.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.200
Suppose I take the
vectors in the plane

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.230
and also the vectors
on that line,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.930
put them together, so I've
got a bunch of vectors,

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.030
is it a subspace?

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.210
Can you give me,
like, so the camera

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.700
can hear it or maybe the tape.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.650
Can you say yes or no?

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.770
Do I have a subspace if I put
-- if I take all the vectors

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.660
on the plane plus all -- and all
the ones on the line and just

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.520
join them together -- but I'm
not taking this guy that's --

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.240
actually, I'm not
taking most of them,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.680
because most vectors are not
on the line or the plane,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.590
they're off somewhere else.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.970
Do I have a subspace?

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.697
STUDENTS: No.

00:06:40.697 --> 00:06:41.280
STRANG: Right.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.790
Thank you.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.510
No.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.980
Because -- why not?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.130
Because I can't add.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.090
Because if I that
requirement isn't satisfied.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.050
If I take one vector like
this guy and another vector

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.100
that happens to come from L and
add, I'm off somewhere else.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.870
You see that I've gone outside
the union if I just add

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.070
something from P and
something from L,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:15.550
then normally what'll happen
is I'm outside the union --

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.770
and I don't have a subspace.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.120
So the correct answer is --

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.270
is not.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.850
Okay.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.630
Now let me ask you about --
the other thing we do is take

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.240
the intersection.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.410
So what does intersection mean?

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:43.830
Intersection means all vectors
that are in both P and L.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.970
Is this a subspace.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.730
Yeah, so I guess I want to go
back up to the same question.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.360
This is or is not a subspace?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.910
And you can answer me -- answer
the question first for this

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.640
particular example,
this picture I drew.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.780
What is P intersect
L for this case?

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.280
STUDENT: It's only zero.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.810
STRANG: It's only zero.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.240
At least, sort of this was the
artist's idea as he drew it

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:17.250
that, that that line L was
not in the plane and, went off

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.120
somewhere else -- and then the
only point that was in common

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.770
was the zero vector.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.430
Is the zero vector
by itself a subspace?

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.000
STUDENT: Yes.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.740
STRANG: Yes, absolutely.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:34.049
And what about, if I don't
have this plane and this line

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:38.789
but any subspace and
any other subspace?

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:43.740
So now -- can I ask that
question for any two subspaces?

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.800
So maybe I'll write it up here.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.240
If I'm strong enough.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.000
Okay.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.510
So this is the general question.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:09:00.350
I have subspaces, say S and T.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:08.640
And I want to ask you about
their intersection S intersect

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.300
T and I want --

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.220
it is a subspace.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.430
Do you see why?

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:24.610
Do you see why if I take the
vectors that are in both one-

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.930
th- that are in both
of the subspaces --

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.490
so that's like a smaller
set of vectors, probably,

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.540
because it's -- we've
added requirements.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.370
It has to be in S and in T.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.100
How do I know that's a subspace?

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.560
Can we just think through
that abstract stuff

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.640
and then I get to the examples.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.870
Okay.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.940
So why?

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.490
Suppose I take a
couple of vectors

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.040
that are in the intersection.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.500
Why is the sum also
in the intersection?

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.900
Okay, so let me give a name
to these vectors, say V and W.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.280
They're in the intersection.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.310
So that means they're both in S.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.370
Also means they're both in T.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.960
So what can I say
about V plus W?

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.350
Is it in S?

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.040
Yes.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.480
Right?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.300
If I take two vectors, V
and W that are both in S,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.900
then the sum is in S,
because S was a subspace.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.830
And if they're both
in T and I add them,

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.990
then the result is also in
T, because T was a subspace.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:37.100
So the result V plus W
is in the intersection.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:42.690
It's in both and requirement
one is satisfied.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.480
Requirement two's the same.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.080
If I take a vector that's in
both, I multiply by seven.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.470
Seven times that vector is in
S, because the vector was in S.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.290
Seven times that vector's in T
because the original one was in

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.080
T. So seven times that vector
is in the intersection.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.740
In other words, when you
take the intersection of two

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.830
subspaces, you get probably
a smaller subspace,

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.440
but it is a subspace.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.780
Okay.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:17.270
So that's like sort of
just emphasizing what

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.080
these two requirements mean.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.700
Again -- Let me circle those,
because those are so important.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:30.490
The sum and the scale of
multiplication which combines

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.850
into linear combinations.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.130
That's what you have to
do inside the subspace.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.980
Okay.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.530
On to the column space.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.030
Okay.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.690
So my lecture last time started
that and I want to continue it.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:47.190
Okay.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.680
Column space of a matrix.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.190
Of A.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.060
Okay.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.240
Can I take an example?

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.030
Say one two three four.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.410
One one one one.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.570
Two three four five.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.370
Okay.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.610
That's my matrix A.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:25.900
So, it's got columns,
three columns.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.700
Those columns are vectors, so
the column space of this A,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.700
of this A --

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.970
let's stay with this
example for a while.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:40.520
The column space of this
matrix is a subspace of R --

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.600
R what?

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.990
So what space are
we in if I'm looking

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.730
at the columns of this matrix?

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.770
R^4 , right?

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.680
These are vectors in R^4,
they're four dimensional

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.800
vectors.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:04.010
So it's this column space of
A is a subspace of R^4 here,

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.030
because A was four by --

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.190
A is a four by three matrix.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.080
This tells me how
many rows there are,

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.020
how many components in a
column, and so we're in R^4.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.030
Okay, now what's
in that subspace?

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:24.300
So the column space of A,
it's a subspace of R^4.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.790
I call it the column
space of A, like that.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:34.670
So that's my little symbol
for some subspace of R^4.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.480
What's in that subspace?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.010
Well, that column certainly is.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.350
One two three four.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.460
This column is in.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.750
This column is
in, and what else?

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.480
So it's got the
columns of A in it,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.671
but that's not
enough, certainly.

00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:52.170
Right?

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.700
I don't have a subspace if
I just put in three vectors.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.210
So how do I fill that
out to be a subspace?

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:06.000
I take their linear
combinations.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:15.110
So the column space of A is
all linear combinations --

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.710
combinations of the columns.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.890
And that does give
me a subspace.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.890
It does give me a vector
space, because if I

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.040
have one linear combination
and I multiply by eleven,

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.680
I've got another
linear combination.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.190
If I have a linear
combination, I

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:33.730
add to another
linear combination

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.970
I get a third combination.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:40.260
So that -- this is like
the smallest space --

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.040
like, it's got to have
those three columns in it,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.270
and it has to have
their combinations

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.110
and that's where we stop.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.680
Okay.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:54.120
Now I'm going to be
interested in that space.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.930
So I, like -- get some idea
of what's in that space.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.450
How big is that space?

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.880
Is that space the whole
four dimensional space?

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.290
Or is it a subspace inside?

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:13.870
Can you -- let me just see if
we can get a yes or no answer

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:19.930
sometimes without being
ready for the complete proof.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.540
What do you think?

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.590
Is the subspace that
I'm talking about here,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.700
the combinations of
those three guys,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.250
does that fill the full
four dimensional space?

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.900
Maybe yes or no on that one.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.560
No.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.060
No.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.640
Somehow our feeling
is, and it happens

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.730
to be right, that if we
start with three vectors

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.660
and take their combinations,
we can't get the whole four

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.680
dimensional space.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.590
Now -- so somehow we
get a smaller space.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.010
But how much smaller?

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.280
That's going to come up here.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.970
That's not so immediate.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:07.950
Let me first make this
critical connection with --

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:15.980
with, linear equations, because
behind our abstract definition,

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.360
we have a purpose.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.750
And that is to understand Ax=b.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.950
So suppose I make
the connection --

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:33.330
w- w- does A x=b always
have a solution for every b?

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:47.850
Have a solution for
every right-hand side?

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.880
I guess that's going to
be a yes or no question.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:59.580
And then I'm going to ask which
right-hand sides are okay?

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.050
That's really the
question I'm after,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:08.900
is which right-hand
sides (b) do make up --

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.210
you can see from the way I'm
speaking what the question --

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.839
As it is.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.020
The answer is no.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:21.710
A x=b does not have a
solution for every b.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.069
Why do I say no?

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:34.660
Because A x=b is -- like,
this is four equations,

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.940
and only three unknowns.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.860
Right?

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.057
X is -- let me right
out that whole --

00:17:46.057 --> 00:17:47.390
what the whole thing looks like.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.600
Yeah.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.680
Let me write out A x=b.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:59.310
A x is --

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.260
these columns are
one two three four.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:07.050
One one one one and
two three four five.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:12.410
Then x, of course, has three
components, x1, x2, x3.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.610
And I'm trying to get the --

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.257
hit the right-hand
side, b1,b2,b3 and b4.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.850
So my first point is,
I can't always do it.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.140
In a way, that just says again
what you told me five minutes

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.220
ago --

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.540
that the combinations
of these columns

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.630
don't fill the whole
four dimensional space.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.190
There's going to be some
vectors b, a lot of vectors b,

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:50.530
that are not combinations
of these three columns,

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.200
because the combinations
of those columns are, like,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.130
going to be just a little
plane or something inside --

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.050
inside R^4.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:03.990
Now, so and you see that I do
have four equations and only

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.210
three unknowns.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.110
So, like anybody is going
to say, no you dope,

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.650
you can't usually
solve four equations

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.330
with only three unknowns.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:17.710
But now I want to say
sometimes you can.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:22.330
For some right-hand
sides, I can solve this.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.900
So that's the bunch
of right-hand sides

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.710
that I'm interested
in right now.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:34.860
Which right-hand sides
allow me to solve this?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.740
This is the question for today.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.240
It's going to have, like,
a nice clear answer.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:50.800
So my question is -- is
which bs, which vectors b,

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.200
allow this system to be solved?

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.150
And I want to ask you --

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:08.090
so that's, like, gets two
question marks to indicate

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.350
that's -- this is the
important question.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.030
Okay, first, before we
give a total answer,

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.000
give me just a partial answer.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.910
Tell me one right-hand
side that I know

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.160
I can solve this thing for.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.910
So -- all zeroes.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:25.410
Okay.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.000
That's the, like, guaranteed.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.990
If these were all zero,
then I know I can solve it,

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.550
let the x-s all be
zero, no problem.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.890
So that's always a -- okay.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:39.660
Okay.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.460
A x=0 I can always solve.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.040
Now tell me another
right-hand side,

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:52.740
just a specific set of numbers
for which I can solve these

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.700
three -- these four equations
with only three unknowns,

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.130
but if you give me a good
right-hand side, I can do it.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.842
So tell me one?

00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:01.550
STUDENT: 1 2 3 4.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.740
STRANG: 1 2 3 4?

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.575
If I -- can I solve -- is
that a good right-hand side?

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.340
Can you solve -- can you
find a solution that --

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.630
X one plus X two plus
two X three is one,

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.630
two X one plus X two plus three
X three is two and two more

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.858
equations --

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.220
so I'm asking you to
solve in your head in --

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.750
within five seconds, four
equations and three unknowns,

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:41.310
but you can do it, because
the right-hand side is, like,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.610
showing up here is --
it's one of the columns.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.330
So tell me what's the
X that does solve it?

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.140
One zero zero.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:55.960
One zero zero solves
it, because --

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:01.450
well, so you can multiply
this out by rows, but oh God,

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:06.360
it's much nicer to say -- okay,
this is one of this column,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.190
zero of this, zero of this,
so it's one of that column,

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.730
which is exactly what we wanted.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.290
Okay.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.280
So there is a b that's okay.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.250
Now tell me another
B that's okay,

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.030
another right-hand side
that would be all right?

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.055
Well -- all ones?

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.450
Actually -- and then what's
the solution in that case?

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.080
0 1 0, thanks.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.190
And, in fact, it's
much e- like, one way

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:44.230
to do it is think of a
solution first, right,

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:50.380
and then just see what
b turns out to be.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.030
What b turns out to be, right.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.790
Okay.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.220
So I think of a solution
-- so I think of an x,

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.380
I think of any --

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.810
x1, x2, x3, I do
this multiplication

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:04.980
and what have I got?

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.920
Now I'm ready to answer
the big question.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:20.830
I can solve A x=b exactly
when the right-hand side B is

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.920
a vector in the column space.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.900
Good.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:33.140
I can solve A x=b when b is
a combination of the columns,

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.130
when it's in the column space --

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.730
so let me write
that answer down.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:57.910
I can solve Ax=b exactly when
B is in the column space.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:02.210
Let me just say
again why that is.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:07.030
Because it -- the column space
by its definition contains all

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:07.870
the combinations.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.710
It contains all the Ax-s.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:17.360
The column space really consists
of all vectors A times any X.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.900
So those are the bs
that I can deal with.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.130
If b is a combination
of the columns,

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:32.080
then that combination
tells me what X should be.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.630
If b is not a combination of
the columns, then there is no x.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.650
There's no way to
solve A x equal b.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.420
Okay.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.700
So the column space --

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.510
that's really why we're
interested in this column

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.170
space, because it's
the central guy.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:56.390
It says when we can
solve, and that --

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.880
we got to understand
this column space better.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.000
Let's see.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.260
Do I want to think --

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.600
yeah, somehow -- oh,
well, let's just --

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.360
as long as we've got it
here, what do I get for this

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.550
particular example?

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:24.670
If I take combinations of
this and this and this,

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:28.230
I'll tell you the question
that's in my mind.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.930
It's not even proper
to use this word yet,

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.280
but you'll know what it means.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.060
Are those three
columns independent?

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:44.370
If I take the combinations
of the three columns --

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:50.550
does each column contribute
something new or now?

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.360
So that if I take the
combinations of those three

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.160
columns, do I, like, get some
three dimensional subspace --

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.630
do I have three vectors
that are, like, you know,

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:07.440
independent,
whatever that means?

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.080
Or do I -- is one of
those columns, like,

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.370
contributing nothing new --

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:15.630
So that actually only
two of the columns

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:19.040
would have given the
same column space?

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.080
Yeah -- that's a good
way to ask the question.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.550
Finally I think of it.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.340
Can I throw away any columns --

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.339
and have the same column space?

00:26:27.339 --> 00:26:27.880
STUDENT: Yes.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.100
STRANG: Yes.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.290
And which one do you
suggest I throw away?

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.670
STUDENT: Column three -- three.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:37.350
STRANG: Well, three is the
natural, like, guy to target.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.490
So if I -- and why?

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:44.750
Because -- what's so
bad about three here?

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.240
Column three?

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.310
It's the sum of these, right?

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:52.370
So it's not -- if I'm taking --
if I have combinations of these

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.510
two and I put in
this one, actually,

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.780
I don't get anything more.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:02.460
So later on I will call
these pivot columns.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.780
And the third guy will not
be a pivot column in this --

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.760
with those numbers.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.940
Now actually -- honesty makes
me ask you this question.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.350
Could I have thrown
away column one?

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.940
Yes, I could.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.920
I could.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.910
So when I say pivot
columns, my convention

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.710
is, okay, I'll keep the first
ones as long as they're not

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:27.590
dependent.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.930
So I keep this guy,
he's fine, he's a line.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.100
I keep the second guy.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.810
It's in a second direction.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:39.220
But the third one, which is in
the same plane as the first two

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.790
gives me nothing new.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.560
It's dependent in the
language that we will use

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.990
and I don't need it.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:48.160
Okay.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.570
So I would describe the column
space of this matrix as a two

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.040
dimensional subspace of R^4.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.070
A two dimensional
subspace of R^4.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.990
Okay.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.430
So you're seeing how these
vector spaces work and you --

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.760
you're seeing that we --
some idea of dependence

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.780
or independence
is in our future.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.400
Okay.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.590
Now I want to speak
about another vector

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.460
space, the null space.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.890
So again I'm getting
a little ahead

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:28.191
because it's in section three
point two, but that's okay.

00:28:28.191 --> 00:28:28.690
All right.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.870
Now I'm ready for
the null space.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.340
Let me keep the same matrix.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.370
And this is going
to be a different --

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.500
totally different subspace.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.270
Totally different.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.930
Okay.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.370
Now -- so let me
make space for it.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.190
Now -- here comes a
completely different subspace,

00:28:50.190 --> 00:29:00.120
the null space of A.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:00.935
What's in it?

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:10.070
It contains not
right-hand sides b.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.750
It contains x-s.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.570
It contains all
x-s that solve --

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.040
this word null is going to --

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.580
I mean, that's the key
word here, meaning zero.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:30.670
So this contains --
this is all solutions x,

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:36.450
and of course x is our
vectors, x1, x2 and x3,

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:41.220
to the equation A x=0.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.800
Well, four equations,
because we've got --

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.230
so, do you see what I'm doing?

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.890
I'm now saying, okay,
columns were great,

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.010
the column space we understood.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:59.260
Now I'm interested in x-s.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.860
I'm not -- the only b I'm
interested in now is the b

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:03.670
of all zeroes.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.300
The right-hand
side is now zeroes.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.550
And I'm interested in solutions.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.810
x-s.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:18.740
So t- where is this null
space for this example?

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:23.600
These x-s are -- have
three components.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.310
So the null space
is a subspace --

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:31.390
we still have to show it
is a subspace -- of R^3.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.590
So this is -- and
we will show --

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:46.220
these vectors x, this is in
R^3, where the column space was

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.910
in R^4 in our example.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:58.340
For an m by n matrix,
this is m and this is n,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.570
because the number
of columns, n,

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.000
tells me how many
unknowns, how many x-s

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.950
multiply those
columns, so it tells me

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:10.480
the big space, in this
case R three that I'm in.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.300
Now tell me -- why don't we
figure out what the null space

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:20.310
is for this example,
just by looking at it.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:24.740
I mean, that's the
beauty of small examples,

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:30.500
that my official way to find
null spaces and column spaces

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:36.200
and get all the facts
straight would be elimination,

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.340
and we'll do that.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.120
But with a small example,
we can see that --

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.150
see what's going on without
going through the mechanics

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:43.950
of elimination.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.670
So this null space --

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.540
so I'm talking about --
again, the null space,

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.520
and let me copy
again the matrix.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:04.190
One two three four, one one one
one and two three four five.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.330
What's in the null space?

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:11.410
So I'm taking A times x,
so let me right it again,

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:16.015
and I want you to solve
those four equations.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.490
In fact, I want you
to find all solutions

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.350
to those four equations.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:26.870
Well, actually, just
first of all find one.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.420
Why should I ask
you for all of them?

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.020
Tell me one -- well, tell
me one solution that y-

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.660
you don't even have to look at
the matrix to know one solution

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.030
to this set of equations.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:41.430
It is zero vector.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:46.810
Whatever that matrix is, its
null space contains zero --

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:51.020
because A times the zero vector
sure gives the zero right-hand

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.660
side.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.700
So the null space
certainly contains zero.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.220
A- so it's got a chance
to be a vector space now,

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.200
and it will turn out it is.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.880
Okay.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.180
Tell me another solution.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.800
So this particular null space --
and of course I'm going to call

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.110
it N(A) for null space --

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:17.160
this contains-- well we've
already located the zero

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.970
vector, and now you're going
to tell me another vector

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.550
that's in the null space,
another solution, another x,

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.340
another --

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.140
you see what I'm
asking you for is

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.950
a combination of those columns.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:33.150
That's what I'm always looking
at combinations of columns,

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:40.800
but now I'm looking at the
weights, the coefficients

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.710
in the combination.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:46.620
So tell me a good set of
numbers to put in there.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.420
One one -- STUDENTS: Minus one.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.530
STRANG: One one minus one.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.340
Thanks.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.280
One one minus one.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.730
So there's a vector
that's in it.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.250
Okay.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.600
But have I got a
subspace at this point?

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.690
Certainly not, right?

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.850
I've got just a
couple of vectors.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.860
No way they make a subspace.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.940
Tell me -- actually, why don't
I jump the whole way now?

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.840
Tell me -- well, tell
me one more solution,

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.460
one more X that would work.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.199
Student: 2 2 -2.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:22.520
STRANG: 2 2 -2?

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.750
Oh, well, tell me all of them,
that would have been easier.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.370
Tell me the whole lot, now.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:34.389
What is the null
space for this matrix?

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:38.670
It's all vectors of the
form -- what could this be?

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:44.900
It could be one one minus one,
it could be it could be any

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:50.880
number C, any number -- the
same number again and --

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.010
STUDENTS: Minus.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.420
STRANG: Minus C.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.010
In other words --

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:59.910
actually, any
multiple of this guy.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.270
Oh, that's the
perfect description,

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:08.050
because now the zero vector's
automatically included

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.040
because C could be zero.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.810
The vector I had is included,
because C could be one.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.750
But now any vector.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.860
And that's actually it.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:24.450
And do I have a subspace?

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.060
And what does it look like?

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:30.620
It's in -- how would you
describe this, the null space,

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.810
this -- all these vectors of
this form C C minus C, like,

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.730
seven seven minus seven.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.080
Minus eleven minus
eleven plus eleven.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.810
What have I got here?

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.120
If -- describe that whole
null space of -- what --

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.550
if I drew it, what do I draw?

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.840
A line, right?

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.350
The null space is a line.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:36:02.724
It's the line through -- in R^3
and the vector one one negative

00:36:02.724 --> 00:36:05.140
one maybe goes down here, I
don't know where it goes, say,

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.530
down here.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:12.660
There's the vector one one
negative one that you gave me.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.610
And where is the
vector C C negative C?

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.050
It's on this line.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.800
Of course, there's zero
zero zero that we had.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.720
And what we've got is that whole
-- oops -- that whole line,

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:28.640
going both ways,
through the origin.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.030
The null space is a line in R^3.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.930
Okay.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:43.040
For that example, we could
find all the combinations

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.590
of the columns that
gave zero at sight.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:51.600
Now, can I just
take one more time,

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:57.860
to go back to the definition
of subspace, vector space,

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:01.060
and ask you --

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.400
how do I know that the null
space is a vector space?

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.610
How I entitled to
use this word space?

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:13.070
I'll never use that word space
without meaning that the two

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:15.800
requirements are satisfied.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.250
Can we just check that they are?

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:20.810
So I'm going to check that --

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.660
can I just continue here?

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:39.240
Check that -- that the
solutions to A x=0 always give

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.740
a subspace.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.700
And, of course, the key
word is that= "Space."

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.840
So what do I have to check?

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:57.340
I have to show that if I
have one solution, call it x,

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.240
and another
solution, call it x*,

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.970
that their sum is also
a solution, right?

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.290
That's a requirement.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:10.010
To use that word
space, I have to say --

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:18.650
I have to convince myself that
if A x is zero and also --

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:25.140
and A x* is zero, or maybe I
should have said if A v is zero

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:30.130
and A w is zero, then
what about v plus w?

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:32.630
Shall I -- let me
use those letters.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:47.300
If A v is zero and A w is zero,
then what -- if that and that,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.240
then what's my point here?

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:55.170
That A times (v+w) must be zero.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:59.590
That says that if v is in the
null space and w's in the null

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.680
space, then their sum
v+w is in the null space.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.250
And of course, now that
I've written it down,

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:11.460
it's totally absurd,
ridiculously simple --

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:17.290
because matrix multiplication
allows me to separate that out

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.460
into A v plus A w.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.560
I shouldn't say absurdly simple.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.840
That was a dumb thing to say.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.960
Could -- we've used, here,
a basic law of matrix

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.580
multiplication.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.070
Actually, we've used it without
proving it, but that's okay.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:39.340
We only live so long,
we just skip that proof.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.820
I think it's called the
distributive law that I can

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.770
split these -- split
this into two pieces.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:52.150
But now you see the point, that
A v is zero and A w is zero

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.520
so I have zero plus
zero and I do get zero.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.430
It checks.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:02.070
And, similarly, I have to
show that if A v is zero,

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:10.130
then A times any multiple,
say 12v is also zero.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:11.590
And how do I know that?

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.900
Because I'm allowed to s-
bring that twelve outside.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:20.640
A number, a scaler can move
outside, so I have twelve A vs,

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.740
twelve zeroes --

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.960
I have zero.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.550
Okay.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:33.070
Just to -- it's really
critical to understand the --

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:34.390
oh yeah.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:38.220
Here -- I was going to say,
understand what's the point

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.470
of a vector space?

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:44.790
Let me make that point by
changing the right-hand side.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:45.920
Oops.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.420
Okay.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.740
Let me change the right-hand
side to one two three four.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.632
Oh, okay.

00:40:51.632 --> 00:40:53.840
Why don't we do all of linear
algebra in one lecture,

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.890
then we --

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:55.900
okay.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.500
I would like to know the
solutions to this equation.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.670
For those four equations.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.660
So I have four equations.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.039
I have only three
unknowns, so if I

00:41:09.039 --> 00:41:10.830
don't have a pretty
special right-hand side

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.640
there won't be any
solution at all.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.070
But that is a very
special right-hand side.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:21.450
And we know that there is
a solution, one zero zero.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.730
Were there any more solutions?

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.320
And did they form
a vector space?

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.600
Okay.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.550
So I'm asking two
questions there.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:35.530
One is, do -- so my right-hand
side now is not zero anymore.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.100
I'm not looking
at the null space

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.070
because I changed from zeroes.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:45.930
So my first question is, do
the solutions, if there are any

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:50.610
and there are, do
they form a subspace?

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.270
Let's answer that
question first.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.210
Yes or no.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:59.640
Do I get a subspace if I
look at the solutions to --

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.300
let me go back to x1 x2 x3.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:08.910
I'm looking at all the x-s, at
all those vectors in R^3 that

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:10.380
solve A x -b.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.400
The only thing I've changed
is b isn't zero anymore.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.045
Do the x-s, the solutions,
form a vector space?

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:32.670
The solutions to this
do not form a subspace.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:36.150
The solutions don't, because --

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.460
how shall I see that?

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:42.950
The zero vector is not a
solution, so I never even got

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:43.700
started.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.090
The zero vector doesn't
solve this system.

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:51.940
I can't -- solutions
can't be a vector space.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.480
Now what are they like?

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.810
Well, we'll see this, but
let's do it for this example.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:02.200
So one zero zero was a solution.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.690
You saw that right away.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.310
Are there any other solutions?

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.730
Can you tell me
a second solution

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.430
to this system of equations?

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:14.970
STUDENTS: 0 -1 1 STRANG: 0 -1 1.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:19.560
Boy, that's -- 0 -1 1.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.680
Yes.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.090
Because that says I take minus
this column plus this one

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:24.790
and sure enough.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.730
That's right.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:30.750
So there are -- there's a
bunch of solutions here.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.300
But they're not a subspace.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.540
I'll tell you what it's like.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.460
It's like a plane that
doesn't go through the origin,

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.930
or a line that doesn't
go through the origin.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.870
Maybe in this case
it's a line that

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.870
doesn't go through
the origin, if I graft

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.570
the solutions to A x equal B.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.550
So you -- I think
you've got the idea.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:56.780
Subspaces have to go
through the origin.

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.590
If I'm looking at x-s, then
they'd better solve Ax=0.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.690
In a way I've got --

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:10.800
my two subspaces that I --
talking about today are kind

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.340
of the two ways I can tell
you what a -- about subspace.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.100
If I want to tell you
about the column space,

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:24.780
I tell you a few columns and
I say take their combinations.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.330
Like I build up this subspace.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:31.440
I put in a few vectors, their
combinations make a subspace.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.010
Now, when I went to -- let me
come back to the one that is

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.180
a subspace here.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.430
Here, when I talked
about the null space,

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:46.960
I didn't tell you what's in it.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.350
We had to figure
out what was in it.

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:53.290
What I told you was the
equations that I'm --

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.180
that has to be satisfied.

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.680
You see those --

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.890
like, those are the two
natural ways to tell you

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:02.460
what's in a subspace.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.730
I can either give you a few
vectors and say fill it out,

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:08.660
take combinations --

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.800
or I can give you a system of
equations, the requirements

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.390
that the x-s have to satisfy.

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:20.400
And both of those
ways produce subspaces

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:25.080
and they're the important
ways to construct subspaces.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.730
Okay, so today's
lecture actually got,

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:33.260
the essentials of
three point two,

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.250
the idea of the null space.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.740
Now we have to
tackle, Wednesday,

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.490
the job of how do
we actually get hold

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.530
of that subspace in an
example that's bigger

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.960
and we can't see it just by eye.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.770
Okay.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:57.190
See you Wednesday.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.740
Thanks.
