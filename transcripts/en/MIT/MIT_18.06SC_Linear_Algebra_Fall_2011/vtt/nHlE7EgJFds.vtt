00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.450
OK, here is lecture
ten in linear algebra.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.400
Two important things
to do in this lecture.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.840
One is to correct an
error from lecture nine.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.250
So the blackboard with that
awful error is still with us.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.580
And the second,
the big thing to do

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.200
is to tell you about
the four subspaces that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930
come with a matrix.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.030
We've seen two subspaces,
the column space

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.900
and the null space.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.490
There's two to go.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.760
First of all, and
this is a great way to

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.690
OK. recap and correct
the previous lecture --

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.190
so you remember I
was just doing R^3.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.620
I couldn't have taken a
simpler example than R^3.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.230
And I wrote down
the standard basis.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.945
That's the standard basis.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.750
The basis -- the obvious basis
for the whole three dimensional

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.820
space.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.500
And then I wanted
to make the point

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.940
that there was nothing special,
nothing about that basis

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.130
that another basis
couldn't have.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.970
It could have
linear independence,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.530
it could span a space.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350
There's lots of other bases.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.280
So I started with these vectors,
one one two and two two five,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.710
and those were independent.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.200
And then I said
three three seven

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.990
wouldn't do, because three
three seven is the sum of those.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.920
So in my innocence, I
put in three three eight.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.150
I figured probably if three
three seven is on the plane,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.210
is -- which I know, it's in
the plane with these two,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.100
then probably three three
eight sticks a little bit out

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.010
of the plane and it's
independent and it gives

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.530
a basis.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.810
But after class, to my
sorrow, a student tells me,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.620
"Wait a minute, that ba- that
third vector, three three

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.690
eight, is not independent."

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.620
And why did she say that?

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.560
She didn't actually take
the time, didn't have to,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.890
to find w- w- what combination
of this one and this one

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.040
gives three three eight.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.170
She did something else.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.090
In other words,
she looked ahead,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.080
because she said, wait a minute,
if I look at that matrix,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.430
it's not invertible.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.530
That third column can't be
independent of the first two,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.270
because when I look
at that matrix,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.110
it's got two identical rows.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.490
I have a square matrix.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.240
Its rows are
obviously dependent.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.670
And that makes the
columns dependent.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.620
So there's my error.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.800
When I look at the matrix A
that has those three columns,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.090
those three columns
can't be independent

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.170
because that matrix
is not invertible

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.920
because it's got two equal rows.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.260
And today's lecture will
reach the conclusion,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.110
the great conclusion,
that connects the column

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.305
space with the row space.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.020
So those are -- the row space
is now going to be another one

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.510
of my fundamental subspaces.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.430
The row space of this matrix,
or of this one -- well,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.880
the row space of this one is OK,
but the row space of this one,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.240
I'm looking at the rows of
the matrix -- oh, anyway,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.620
I'll have two equal rows and
the row space will be only two

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.060
dimensional.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.320
The rank of the matrix with
these columns will only be two.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.730
So only two of those columns,
columns can be independent too.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.730
The rows tell me something about
the columns, in other words,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.560
something that I should
have noticed and I didn't.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.500
OK.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.470
So now let me pin down these
four fundamental subspaces.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.500
So here are the four
fundamental subspaces.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.470
This is really the heart of
this approach to linear algebra,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.520
to see these four subspaces,
how they're related.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.830
So what are they?

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:53.540
The column space, C of A.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.420
The null space, N of A.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.190
And now comes the row
space, something new.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.700
The row space, what's in that?

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.190
It's all combinations
of the rows.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.620
That's natural.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.440
We want a space, so we have
to take all combinations,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.240
and we start with the rows.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.450
So the rows span the row space.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.200
Are the rows a basis
for the row space?

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.140
Maybe so, maybe no.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.080
The rows are a basis for the row
space when they're independent,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.250
but if they're dependent,
as in this example,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.500
my error from last
time, they're not --

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.440
those three rows
are not a basis.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.280
The row space wouldn't --
would only be two dimensional.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.280
I only need two
rows for a basis.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.990
So the row space,
now what's in it?

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.610
It's all combinations
of the rows of A.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.330
All combinations
of the rows of A.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.610
But I don't like working
with row vectors.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.680
All my vectors have
been column vectors.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.710
I'd like to stay
with column vectors.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.530
How can I get to column
vectors out of these rows?

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.800
I transpose the matrix.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.020
So if that's OK with you,
I'm going to transpose the

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.590
matrix.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.450
I'm, I'm going to
say all combinations

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:31.875
of the columns of A transpose.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.750
And that allows me to use the
convenient notation, the column

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.755
space of A transpose.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.320
Nothing, no mathematics
went on there.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.130
We just got some vectors that
were lying down to stand up.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.730
But it means that we
can use this column

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.120
space of A transpose, that's
telling me in a nice matrix

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.950
notation what the row space is.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:09.470
OK.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:15.900
And finally is
another null space.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.900
The fourth fundamental
space will be

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.120
the null space of A transpose.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:30.140
The fourth guy is the
null space of A transpose.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.395
And of course my notation
is N of A transpose.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.010
That's the null
space of A transpose.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:46.250
Eh, we don't have a perfect
name for this space as a --

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:51.770
connecting with A, but our usual
name is the left null space,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.120
and I'll show you
why in a moment.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.480
So often I call this the --

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:10.570
just to write that word --
the left null space of A.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.420
So just the way we
have the row space of A

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.810
and we switch it to the
column space of A transpose,

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.590
so we have this space
of guys l- that I

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.040
call the left null space
of A, but the good notation

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.910
is it's the null
space of A transpose.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.410
OK.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.770
Those are four spaces.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.280
Where are those spaces?

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.059
What, what big space are they
in for -- when A is m by n?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.370
In that case, the
null space of A,

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.100
what's in the null space of A?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.850
Vectors with n components,
solutions to A x equals zero.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.663
So the null space
of A is in R^n.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.480
What's in the column space of A?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.220
Well, columns.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.320
How many components
dothose columns have?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.350
m.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.840
So this column space is in R^m.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.010
What about the column
space of A transpose,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.960
which are just a disguised
way of saying the rows of A?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.040
The rows of A, in this
three by six matrix,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.680
have six components,
n components.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.420
The column space is in R^n.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.950
And the null space
of A transpose,

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:51.800
I see that this fourth space
is already getting second,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.640
you know, second class
citizen treatment

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.550
and it doesn't deserve it.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.830
It's, it should be
there, it is there,

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.430
and shouldn't be squeezed.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.650
The null space of A transpose --

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.520
well, if the null space of A
had vectors with n components,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.970
the null space of A
transpose will be in R^m.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.260
I want to draw a picture
of the four spaces.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:19.760
OK.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.130
OK.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.380
Here are the four spaces.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:38.580
OK, Let me put n dimensional
space over on this side.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.760
Then which were the
subspaces in R^n?

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.490
The null space was
and the row space was.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:53.471
So here we have the -- can I
make that picture of the row

00:10:53.471 --> 00:10:53.970
space?

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.880
And can I make this kind of
picture of the null space?

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.880
That's just meant
to be a sketch,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.800
to remind you that they're in
this -- which you know, how --

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.420
what type of vectors are in it?

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.560
Vectors with n components.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:25.560
Over here, inside, consisting
of vectors with m components,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:33.890
is the column space
and what I'm calling

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:39.600
the null space of A transpose.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.610
Those are the ones
with m components.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.820
OK.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.760
To understand these spaces
is our, is our job now.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.880
Because by understanding
those spaces,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.730
we know everything about
this half of linear algebra.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.640
What do I mean by
understanding those spaces?

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.250
I would like to know a
basis for those spaces.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.090
For each one of those
spaces, how would I create --

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.440
construct a basis?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.260
What systematic way
would produce a basis?

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.180
And what's their dimension?

00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:25.110
OK.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.070
So for each of
the four spaces, I

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.500
have to answer those questions.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.780
How do I produce a basis?

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.620
And then -- which has
a somewhat long answer.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.210
And what's the dimension,
which is just a number,

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.030
so it has a real short answer.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.250
Can I give you the
short answer first?

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.930
I shouldn't do it,
but here it is.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:56.206
I can tell you the dimension
of the column space.

00:12:56.206 --> 00:12:57.330
Let me start with this guy.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.590
What's its dimension?

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.360
I have an m by n matrix.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:09.041
The dimension of the
column space is the rank,

00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:09.540
r.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.210
We actually got to that at
the end of the last lecture,

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.570
but only for an example.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.520
So I really have to say,
OK, what's going on there.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.340
I should produce
a basis and then I

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.260
just look to see how many
vectors I needed in that basis,

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.360
and the answer will be r.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.980
Actually, I'll do that,
before I get on to the others.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.050
What's a basis for
the columns space?

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.980
We've done all the
work of row reduction,

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.810
identifying the pivot
columns, the ones that

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.940
have pivots, the ones
that end up with pivots.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.500
But now I -- the pivot columns
I'm interested in are columns

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.530
of A, the original A.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.610
And those pivot columns,
there are r of them.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.840
The rank r counts those.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.550
Those are a basis.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.520
So if I answer this question
for the column space,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:18.100
the answer will be a
basis is the pivot columns

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:23.790
and the dimension is the rank
r, and there are r pivot columns

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.360
and everything great.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.950
OK.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.920
So that space we
pretty well understand.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.090
I probably have a little
going back to see that --

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.750
to prove that this
is a right answer,

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.460
but you know it's
the right answer.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.255
Now let me look
at the row space.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.830
OK.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.190
Shall I tell you the
dimension of the row space?

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:55.830
Yes.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.180
Before we do even an
example, let me tell you

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.220
the dimension of the row space.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.650
Its dimension is also r.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.830
The row space and the column
space have the same dimension.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.440
That's a wonderful fact.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.950
The dimension of the column
space of A transpose --

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.170
that's the row space -- is r.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.430
That, that space
is r dimensional.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.790
Snd so is this one.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.570
OK.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:35.430
That's the sort of insight
that got used in this example.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:40.990
If those -- are the three
columns of a matrix --

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.720
let me make them the three
columns of a matrix by just

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.000
erasing some brackets.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.320
OK, those are the three
columns of a matrix.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.130
The rank of that matrix,
if I look at the columns,

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.560
it wasn't obvious to me anyway.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.250
But if I look at the
rows, now it's obvious.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.860
The row space of
that matrix obviously

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.380
is two dimensional, because
I see a basis for the row

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.650
space, this row and that row.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.370
And of course,
strictly speaking,

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.290
I'm supposed to transpose
those guys, make them stand up.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.270
But the rank is two, and
therefore the column space

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.940
is two dimensional by
this wonderful fact

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.100
that the row space and column
space have the same dimension.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.130
And therefore there are only
two pivot columns, not three,

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:34.310
and, those, the three
columns are dependent.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.430
OK.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:45.470
Now let me bury that error
and talk about the row space.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.690
Well, I'm going to give you the
dimensions of all the spaces.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.480
Because that's
such a nice answer.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.100
OK.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.460
So let me come back here.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.640
So we have this great
fact to establish,

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:06.790
that the row space, its
dimension is also the rank.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:07.910
What about the null space?

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.020
OK.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.630
What's a basis for
the null space?

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.970
What's the dimension
of the null space?

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.274
Let me, I'll put that answer
up here for the null space.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.849
Well, how have we
constructed the null space?

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:32.260
We took the matrix A, we
did those row operations

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.170
to get it into a form
U or, or even further.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.730
We got it into the
reduced form R.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.490
And then we read off
special solutions.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:44.580
Special solutions.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.110
And every special solution
came from a free variable.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.720
And those special solutions
are in the null space,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.360
and the great thing is
they're a basis for it.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.445
So for the null space, a basis
will be the special solutions.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.250
And there's one for every
free variable, right?

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.190
For each free variable, we give
that variable the value one,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.350
the other free variables zero.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.840
We get the pivot variables,
we get a vector in the --

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.680
we get a special solution.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.140
So we get altogether
n-r of them,

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:30.340
because that's the
number of free variables.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.890
If we have r --

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:38.490
this is the dimension is r, is
the number of pivot variables.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.810
This is the number
of free variables.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.180
So the beauty is that those
special solutions do form

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:51.380
a basis and tell us immediately
that the dimension of the null

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.570
space is n --

00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:00.590
I better write this well,
because it's so nice -- n-r.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.910
And do you see the nice thing?

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.320
That the two dimensions in
this n dimensional space,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.300
one subspace is r dimensional --

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.400
to be proved, that's
the row space.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.680
The other subspace
is n-r dimensional,

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.150
that's the null space.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.550
And the two dimensions
like together give n.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.870
The sum of r and n-R is n.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.270
And that's just great.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.720
It's really copying the fact
that we have n variables,

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.750
r of them are pivot variables
and n-r are free variables,

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.380
and n altogether.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:41.880
OK.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:47.090
And now what's the dimension
of this poor misbegotten fourth

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.500
subspace?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:53.700
It's got to be m-r.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:00.110
The dimension of this left null
space, left out practically,

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.540
is m-r.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.690
Well, that's really just
saying that this -- again,

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:15.140
the sum of that plus that
is m, and m is correct,

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:21.180
it's the number of
columns in A transpose.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.810
A transpose is just
as good a matrix as A.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.590
It just happens to be n by m.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:38.360
It happens to have m columns,
so it will have m variables

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.990
when I go to A x
equals 0 and m of them,

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.950
and r of them will be pivot
variables and m-r will

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.920
be free variables.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.650
A transpose is as
good a matrix as A.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.410
It follows the same rule that
the this plus the dimension --

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.830
this dimension plus this
dimension adds up to the number

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.130
of columns.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.770
And over here, A
transpose has m columns.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.290
OK.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:09.790
OK.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.580
So I gave you the easy
answer, the dimensions.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:21.160
Now can I go back
to check on a basis?

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.540
We would like to think
that -- say the row space,

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.280
because we've got a basis
for the column space.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.570
The pivot columns give a
basis for the column space.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.840
Now I'm asking you to
look at the row space.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.790
And I -- you could say, OK, I
can produce a basis for the row

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:45.540
space by transposing my
matrix, making those columns,

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.670
then doing elimination,
row reduction,

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:54.690
and checking out the pivot
columns in this transposed

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:55.350
matrix.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.760
But that means you
had to do all that row

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.750
reduction on A transpose.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.590
It ought to be possible,
if we take a matrix A --

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.620
let me take the matrix -- maybe
we had this matrix in the last

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.120
lecture.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:15.530
1 1 1, 2 1 2, 3 2 3, 1 1 1.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:22.670
OK.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.770
That, that matrix was so easy.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:29.100
We spotted its pivot columns,
one and two, without actually

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.930
doing row reduction.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:35.070
But now let's do
the job properly.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.980
So I subtract this away
from this to produce a zero.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.810
So one 2 3 1 is fine.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.419
Subtracting that away leaves
me minus 1 -1 0, right?

00:22:47.419 --> 00:22:49.960
And subtracting that from the
last row, oh, well that's easy.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:53.690
OK?

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.680
I'm doing row reduction.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.700
Now I've -- the first
column is all set.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.230
The second column I
now see the pivot.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.800
And I can clean up, if I --

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.480
actually,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.860
OK.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.070
Why don't I make
the pivot into a 1.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:18.805
I'll multiply that row through
by by -1, and then I have 1 1.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.370
That was an elementary
operation I'm allowed,

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.790
multiply a row by a number.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.150
And now I'll do elimination.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.300
Two of those away from that
will knock this guy out

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.120
and make this into a 1.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.560
So that's now a 0 and that's a

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.620
OK.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.230
Done.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.470
That's R.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.930
I'm seeing the
identity matrix here.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.530
I'm seeing zeros below.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.990
And I'm seeing F there.

00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:53.650
OK.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.110
What about its row space?

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.650
What happened to its row space
-- well, what happened --

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.610
let me first ask, just
because this is, is --

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.780
sometimes something does happen.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.010
Its column space changed.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:18.820
The column space of R is not
the column space of A, right?

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.000
Because 1 1 1 is certainly
in the column space of A

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.460
and certainly not in
the column space of R.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.770
I did row operations.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:33.750
Those row operations
preserve the row space.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.640
So the row, so the column
spaces are different.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.550
Different column spaces,
different column spaces.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.480
But I believe that they
have the same row space.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.880
Same row space.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:04.040
I believe that the row space of
that matrix and the row space

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.210
of this matrix are identical.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.640
They have exactly the
same vectors in them.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.400
Those vectors are vectors
with four components, right?

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.940
They're all combinations
of those rows.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.800
Or I believe you
get the same thing

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.030
by taking all combinations
of these rows.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:29.960
And if true, what's a basis?

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.430
What's a basis for
the row space of R,

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:42.450
and it'll be a basis for the
row space of the original A,

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.120
but it's obviously a basis
for the row space of R.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.840
What's a basis for the
row space of that matrix?

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.820
The first two rows.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:57.550
So a basis for the
row -- so a basis is,

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:15.500
for the row space of A or of R,
is, is the first R rows of R.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.050
Not of A.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.960
Sometimes it's true for
A, but not necessarily.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:29.280
But R, we definitely have a
matrix here whose row space we

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.060
can, we can identify.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.790
The row space is spanned
by the three rows,

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.580
but if we want a basis
we want independence.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.380
So out goes row three.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.820
The row space is also spanned
by the first two rows.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.920
This guy didn't
contribute anything.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.706
And of course over here
this 1 2 3 1 in the bottom

00:26:52.706 --> 00:26:53.830
didn't contribute anything.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.510
We had it already.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.260
So this, here is a basis.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.260
1 0 1 1 and 0 1 1 0.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.860
I believe those are
in the row space.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.090
I know they're independent.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.680
Why are they in the row space?

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.720
Why are those two
vectors in the row space?

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.440
Because all those
operations we did,

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.680
which started with these rows
and took combinations of them

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.900
--

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.910
I took this row minus this
row, that gave me something

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.780
that's still in the row space.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.400
That's the point.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.760
When I took a row minus a
multiple of another row,

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.380
I'm staying in the row space.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.330
The row space is not changing.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.240
My little basis
for it is changing,

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.680
and I've ended up with,
sort of the best basis.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.240
If the columns of the identity
matrix are the best basis

00:27:53.240 --> 00:28:00.490
for R^3 or R^n, the rows of
this matrix are the best basis

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.510
for the row space.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.250
Best in the sense of being
as clean as I can make it.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.310
Starting off with the
identity and then finishing up

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.420
with whatever has
to be in there.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.730
OK.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.720
Do you see then that
the dimension is r?

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:23.330
For sure, because we've got
r pivots, r non-zero rows.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.420
We've got the right
number of vectors, r.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.080
They're in the row space,
they're independent.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.600
That's it.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.160
They are a basis
for the row space.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.220
And we can even pin
that down further.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:41.340
How do I know that every
row of A is a combination?

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.110
How do I know they
span the row space?

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.110
Well, somebody says, I've
got the right number of them,

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.740
so they must.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.870
But -- and that's true.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.400
But let me just say, how
do I know that this row is

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.300
a combination of these?

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.870
By just reversing the
steps of row reduction.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:07.760
If I just reverse the steps and
go from A -- from R back to A,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.010
then what do I, what I doing?

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.030
I'm starting with
these rows, I'm

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.730
taking combinations of them.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:19.670
After a couple of steps,
undoing the subtractions

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.710
that I did before, I'm
back to these rows.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.500
So these rows are
combinations of those rows.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.020
Those rows are
combinations of those rows.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.740
The two row spaces are the same.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.830
The bases are the same.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.540
And the natural
basis is this guy.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.530
Is that all right
for the row space?

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:45.030
The row space is
sitting there in R

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.750
in its cleanest possible form.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:48.800
OK.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:56.875
Now what about the fourth guy,
the null space of A transpose?

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:03.440
First of all, why do I call
that the left null space?

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:11.610
So let me save that
and bring that down.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.050
OK.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:20.940
So the fourth space is the
null space of A transpose.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.200
So it has in it vectors,
let me call them y,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.470
so that A transpose y equals 0.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:35.360
If A transpose y
equals 0, then y

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.890
is in the null space of
A transpose, of course.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:47.770
So this is a matrix times
a column equaling zero.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:56.550
And now, because I want
y to sit on the left

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:00.200
and I want A instead
of A transpose,

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.380
I'll just transpose
that equation.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.180
Can I just transpose that?

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.705
On the right, it makes
the zero vector lie down.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:21.510
And on the left, it's a
product, A, A transpose times y.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.510
If I take the transpose, then
they come in opposite order,

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.540
right?

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:30.156
So that's y transpose times
A transpose transpose.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.540
But nobody's going to
leave it like that.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:39.620
That's -- A transpose
transpose is just A, of course.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.360
When I transposed A
transpose I got back to A.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.870
Now do you see what I have now?

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:51.820
I have a row
vector, y transpose,

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:58.540
multiplying A, and
multiplying from the left.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:02.180
That's why I call it
the left null space.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.590
But by making it --
putting it on the left,

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.720
I had to make it into a row
instead of a column vector,

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:15.250
and so my convention is
I usually don't do that.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.960
I usually stay with A
transpose y equals 0.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.290
OK.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:27.990
And you might ask, how do we
get a basis -- or I might ask,

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:31.470
how do we get a basis
for this fourth space,

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.610
this left null space?

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:36.720
OK.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.050
I'll do it in the example.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.350
As always -- not that one.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.310
The left null space is not
jumping out at me here.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.220
I know which are the
free variables --

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.890
the special solutions, but those
are special solutions to A x

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.230
equals zero, and now I'm
looking at A transpose,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.420
and I'm not seeing it here.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.760
So -- but somehow you feel that
the work that you did which

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:19.310
simplified A to R should have
revealed the left null space

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.760
too.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.970
And it's slightly less
immediate, but it's there.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:31.010
So from A to R, I
took some steps,

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.880
and I guess I'm interested
in what were those steps,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.600
or what were all
of them together.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:43.160
I don't -- I'm not interested in
what particular ones they were.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.910
I'm interested in what
was the whole matrix that

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:51.620
took me from A to R.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.880
How would you find that?

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.970
Do you remember
Gauss-Jordan, where you

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:02.260
tack on the identity matrix?

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.810
Let's do that again.

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.640
So I, I'll do it above, here.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:13.620
So this is now, this
is now the idea of --

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.570
I take the matrix
A, which is m by n.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:22.639
In Gauss-Jordan, when
we saw him before --

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.150
A was a square
invertible matrix and we

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.900
were finding its inverse.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.409
Now the matrix isn't square.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:32.360
It's probably rectangular.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.989
But I'll still tack on the
identity matrix, and of course

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:42.179
since these have length
m it better be m by m.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:49.374
And now I'll do the reduced row
echelon form of this matrix.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.120
And what do I get?

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.950
The reduced row echelon form
starts with these columns,

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:11.680
starts with the first columns,
works like mad, and produces R.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.920
Of course, still that
same size, m by n.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.700
And we did it before.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.140
And then whatever
it did to get R,

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.520
something else is
going to show up here.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.690
Let me call it E, m by m.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:30.170
It's whatever -- do you see
that E is just going to contain

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.640
a record of what we did?

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:38.780
We did whatever it took
to get A to become R.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.930
And at the same time,
we were doing it

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:44.410
to the identity matrix.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:48.590
So we started with the identity
matrix, we buzzed along.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.190
So we took some --

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:55.860
all this row reduction amounted
to multiplying on the left

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.040
by some matrix, some series
of elementary matrices

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:05.780
that altogether gave us one
matrix, and that matrix is E.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:11.450
So all this row reduction stuff
amounted to multiplying by E.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.120
How do I know that?

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.680
It certainly amounted to
multiply it by something.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.660
And that something took I to
E, so that something was E.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:29.790
So now look at the
first part, E A is R.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.520
No big deal.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:38.710
All I've said is that the row
reduction steps that we all

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:45.680
know -- well, taking A to
R, are in a, in some matrix,

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.340
and I can find out what that
matrix is by just tacking I

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.810
on and seeing what comes out.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.570
What comes out is E.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.400
Let's just review the
invertible square case.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.860
What happened then?

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.350
Because I was interested
in it in chapter two also.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:08.260
When A was square and
invertible, I took A I,

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.480
I did row, row elimination.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.210
And what was the
R that came out?

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.770
It was I.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:24.530
So in chapter two, in
chapter two, R was I.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.310
The row the, the
reduced row echelon

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:31.730
form of a nice invertible
square matrix is the identity.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:41.510
So if R was I in that case, then
E was -- then E was A inverse,

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.430
because E A is I.

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:45.200
Good.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.540
That's, that was good and easy.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.990
Now what I'm saying is
that there still is an E.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.740
It's not A inverse any more,
because A is rectangular.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.730
It hasn't got an inverse.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:05.010
But there is still some matrix
E that connected this to this --

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.260
oh, I should have figured
out in advanced what it was.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.810
Shoot.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:12.800
I didn't --

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.620
I did those steps and sort
of erased as I went --

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.370
and, I should have done
them to the identity too.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.500
Can I do that?

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.460
Can I do that?

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.140
I'll keep the identity matrix,
like I'm supposed to do,

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.750
and I'll do the same operations
on it, and see what I end up

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.340
with.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.300
OK.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.810
So I'm starting
with the identity --

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:40.511
which I'll write in light,
light enough, but --

00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:41.010
OK.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.520
What did I do?

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.950
I subtracted that row from that
one and that row from that one.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.950
OK, I'll do that
to the identity.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:52.990
So I subtract that first row
from row two and row three.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:55.310
Good.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:56.950
Then I think I multiplied --

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:57.620
Do you remember?

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.890
I multiplied row
two by minus one.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:05.270
Let me just do that.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:06.610
Then what did I do?

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:14.880
I subtracted two of row
two away from row one.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.770
I better do that.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.720
Subtract two of
this away from this.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:24.180
That's minus one, two of these
away leaves a plus 2 and 0.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:28.440
I believe that's E.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:35.870
The way to check is to see,
multiply that E by this A,

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:37.420
just to see did I do it right.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:49.285
So I believe E was -1 2
0, 1 -1 0, and -1 0 1.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.520
OK.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.030
That's my E, that's
my A, and that's R.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.110
All right.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.950
All I'm struggling
to do is right,

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:09.660
the reason I wanted this blasted
E was so that I could figure

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.570
out the left null space,
not only its dimension,

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:17.020
which I know --

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.427
actually, what is the dimension
of the left null space?

00:40:19.427 --> 00:40:20.260
So here's my matrix.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.465
What's the rank of the matrix?

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.640
And the dimension of the null
-- of the left null space is

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.470
supposed to be m-r.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.930
It's 3 -2, 1.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.090
I believe that the left null
space is one dimensional.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:42.990
There is one combination
of those three rows

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:46.840
that produces the zero row.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:52.270
There's a basis -- a basis for
the left null space has only

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.200
got one vector in it.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.790
And what is that vector?

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.710
It's here in the last row of E.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:01.400
But we could have
seen it earlier.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.220
What combination of those
rows gives the zero row?

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.110
-1 of that plus one of that.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:14.460
So a basis for the left
null space of this matrix --

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.350
I'm looking for combinations
of rows that give the zero row

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:22.080
if I'm looking at
the left null space.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.980
For the null space, I'm looking
at combinations of columns

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.780
to get the zero column.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.760
Now I'm looking at combinations
of these three rows

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.370
to get the zero row, and of
course there is my zero row,

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:37.160
and here is my vector
that produced it.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.010
-1 of that row and one of that

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.510
row.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.650
Obvious.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:42.210
OK.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.940
So in that example -- and
actually in all examples,

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:51.310
we have seen how to produce a
basis for the left null space.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.800
I won't ask you that
all the time, because --

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.790
it didn't come out
immediately from R.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:03.850
We had to keep track of E
for that left null space.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.520
But at least it didn't require
us to transpose the matrix

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.220
and start all over again.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.390
OK, those are the
four subspaces.

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:15.520
Can I review them?

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.950
The row space and the
null space are in R^n.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:22.220
Their dimensions add to n.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:27.470
The column space and the
left null space are in R^m,

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.900
and their dimensions add to m.

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.700
OK.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:39.080
So let me close
these last minutes

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:49.620
by pushing you a little bit more
to a new type of vector space.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.230
All our vector spaces, all the
ones that we took seriously,

00:42:53.230 --> 00:43:01.570
have been subspaces of some real
three or n dimensional space.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.880
Now I'm going to write
down another vector

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.720
space, a new vector space.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.610
Say all three by three matrices.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.990
My matrices are the vectors.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.240
Is that all right?

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.130
I'm just naming them.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.570
You can put quotes
around vectors.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.050
Every three by three matrix
is one of my vectors.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.060
Now how I entitled to
call those things vectors?

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.380
I mean, they look very
much like matrices.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.980
But they are vectors in my
vector space because they obey

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.640
the rules.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.850
All I'm supposed to be able to
do with vectors is add them --

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:58.190
I can add matrices --

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.580
I'm supposed to be able to
multiply them by scalar numbers

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:09.290
like seven -- well, I can
multiply a matrix by And that

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.960
-- and I can take
combinations of matrices,

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:15.060
I can take three of one
matrix minus five of another

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:15.990
matrix.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:21.260
And those combinations, there's
a zero matrix, the matrix

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.570
that has all zeros in it.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.050
If I add that to another
matrix, it doesn't change it.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:26.960
All the good stuff.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.270
If I multiply a matrix by
one it doesn't change it.

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.800
All those eight rules
for a vector space

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:37.460
that we never wrote down,
all easily satisfied.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:41.150
So now we have a different --

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:46.450
now of course you can say you
can multiply those matrices.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:47.240
I don't care.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.070
For the moment, I'm only
thinking of these matrices

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:57.960
as forming a vector space --
so I only doing A plus B and c

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.350
times A.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:03.050
I'm not interested
in A B for now.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.340
The fact that I
can multiply is not

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.721
relevant to th-
to a vector space.

00:45:13.721 --> 00:45:14.220
OK.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.636
So I have three
by three matrices.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.600
And how about subspaces?

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.420
What's -- tell me a subspace
of this matrix space.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:30.270
Let me call this matrix space M.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:34.270
That's my matrix space, my space
of all three by three matrices.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:37.730
Tell me a subspace of it.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:40.670
What about the upper
triangular matrices?

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:41.260
OK.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.330
So subspaces.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:50.660
Subspaces of M.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.675
All, all upper
triangular matrices.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:01.750
Another subspace.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:03.085
All symmetric matrices.

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:13.730
The intersection
of two subspaces

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.090
is supposed to be a subspace.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:20.310
We gave a little effort
to the proof of that fact.

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.150
If I look at the matrices
that are in this subspace --

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:26.420
they're symmetric, and
they're also in this subspace,

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:31.280
they're upper triangular,
what do they look like?

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.550
Well, if they're
symmetric but they

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.660
have zeros below the
diagonal, they better

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.650
have zeros above the
diagonal, so the intersection

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:40.285
would be diagonal matrices.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.430
That's another subspace,
smaller than those.

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:53.740
How can I use the word smaller?

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.390
Well, I'm now entitled
to use the word smaller.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:47:00.410
I mean, well, one way
to say is, OK, these

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:02.570
are contained in those.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:05.210
These are contained in those.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:09.205
But more precisely, I could give
the dimension of these spaces.

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:14.740
So I could -- we can compute
-- let's compute it next time,

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.870
the dimension of all upper
-- of the subspace of upper

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:20.490
triangular three
by three matrices.

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.790
The dimension of symmetric
three by three matrices.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:27.630
The dimension of diagonal
three by three matrices.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:29.690
Well, to produce
dimension, that means

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:33.370
I'm supposed to produce
a basis, and then

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:37.230
I just count how many vecto-
how many I needed in the basis.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.880
Let me give you the
answer for this one.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.430
What's the dimension?

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:44.610
The dimension of this
-- say, this subspace,

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.520
let me call it D, all
diagonal matrices.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:54.610
The dimension of
this subspace is --

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.610
as I write you're
working it out --

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:58.970
three.

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:09.150
Because here's a matrix in
this -- it's a diagonal matrix.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:10.040
Here's another one.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.610
Here's another one.

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.755
Better make it diagonal,
let me put a seven there.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.130
That was not a
very great choice,

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:31.020
but it's three
diagonal matrices,

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.950
and I believe that
they're a basis.

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:37.190
I believe that those three
matrices are independent

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:40.680
and I believe that
any diagonal matrix is

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.220
a combination of those three.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:47.310
So they span the subspace
of diagonal matrices.

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.040
Do you see that idea?

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:55.170
It's like stretching the
idea from R^n to R^(n by n),

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.360
three by three.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.310
But the -- we can still add, we
can still multiply by numbers,

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:06.370
and we just ignore the fact that
we can multiply two matrices

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.550
together.

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:09.380
OK, thank you.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.930
That's lecture ten.
