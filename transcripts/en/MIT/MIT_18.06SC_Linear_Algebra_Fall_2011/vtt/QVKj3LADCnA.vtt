00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.050
2 times this equation, Okay.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.510
This is it.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.360
The second lecture
in linear algebra,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.860
and I've put below my
main topics for today.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.270
I put right there a
system of equations

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.780
that's going to be our
example to work with.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.150
But what are we
going to do with it?

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.540
We're going to solve it.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.900
And the method of solution
will not be determinants.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.560
Determinants are something
that will come later.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.930
The method we'll use
is called elimination.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.630
And it's the way every software
package solves equations.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.360
And elimination, well, if it
succeeds, it gets the answer.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.870
And normally it does succeed.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.790
If the matrix A that's
coming into that system

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.460
is a good matrix, and
I think this one is,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.770
then elimination will work.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.290
We'll get the answer
in an efficient way.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.310
But why don't we, as long
as we're sort of seeing how

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.120
elimination works -- it's
always good to ask how could it

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.010
fail?

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.180
So at the same
time, we'll see how

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.570
elimination decides whether
the matrix is a good one

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.040
or has problems.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.030
Then to complete
the answer, there's

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.780
an obvious step of
back substitution.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.600
In fact, the idea
of elimination is --

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.750
you would have
thought of it, right?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.090
I mean Gauss thought
of it before we did,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.140
but only because he
was born earlier.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.070
It's a natural idea...

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.020
and died earlier, too.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.020
Okay, and you've seen the idea.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.870
But now, the part that I want
to show you is elimination

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.040
expressed in matrix language,
because the whole course --

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.740
all the key ideas get expressed
as matrix operations, not as

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.420
words.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.080
And one of the operations,
of course, that we'll meet

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.500
is how do we multiply
matrices and why?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.150
Okay, so there's a
system of equations.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.270
Three equations
and three unknowns.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.700
And there's the matrix, the
three by three matrix --

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.860
so this is the system Ax = b.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.260
This is our system
to solve, Ax equal --

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.260
and the right-hand side
is that vector 2, 12, 2.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.970
Okay.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.640
Now, when I describe
elimination --

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.300
it gets to be a pain to
keep writing the equal signs

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.330
and the pluses and so on.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.220
It's that matrix
that totally matters.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.340
Everything is in that matrix.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.820
But behind it is
those equations.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.384
So what does elimination do?

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:18.925
What's the first
step of elimination?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.110
We accept the first
equation, it's okay.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.220
I'm going to multiply that
equation by the right number,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.980
the right multiplier and
I'm going to subtract it

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.220
from the second equation.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.400
With what purpose?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.530
So that will decide what
the multiplier should be.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:50.180
Our purpose is to knock out
the x part of equation two.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.980
So our purpose is
to eliminate x.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.820
So what do I multiply --

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.650
and again, I'll do
it with this matrix,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.590
because I can do it short.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.340
What's the multiplier here?

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.770
What do I multiply --
equation one and subtract.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.810
Notice I'm saying
that word subtract.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.870
I'd like to stick
to that convention.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.890
I'll do a subtraction.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.790
First of all this is the key
number that I'm starting with.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.170
And that's called the pivot.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.270
I'll put a box around it
and write its name down.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.800
That's the first pivot.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.641
The first pivot.

00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:31.140
Okay.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.130
So I'm going to use --

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.710
that's sort of like the key
number in that equation.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.260
And now what's the multiplier?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.720
So I'm going to --

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.950
my first row won't change,
that's the pivot row.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.680
But I'm going to use it --

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.700
and now, finally, let me ask
you what the multiplier is.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.680
Yes?

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.170
3 times that first equation
will knock out that 3.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.110
Okay.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.220
So what will it leave?

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.000
So the multiplier is 3.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.220
3 times that will make that 0.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.720
That was our purpose.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.490
3 2s away from the 8 will leave
a 2 and three 1s away from 1

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.960
will leave a minus 2.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.400
And this guy didn't change.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.530
Now the next step -- this is
forward elimination and that

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.802
Okay. step's completed.

00:05:23.802 --> 00:05:26.260
Oh, well, you could say wait
a minute, what about the right

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.280
hand side?

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.610
Shall I carry -- the right-hand
side gets carried along.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.410
Actually MatLab finishes up
with the left side before --

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.330
and then just goes back
to do the right side.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.340
Maybe I'll be MatLab for
a moment and do that.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.610
Okay.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.470
I'm leaving a room for a column
of b, the right-hand side.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.310
But I'll fill it in later.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.360
Okay.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.680
Now the next step of
elimination is what?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.850
Well, strictly speaking...

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:05.250
this position that I cleaned
up was like the 2, 1 position,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.470
row 2, column 1.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.310
So I got a 0 in
the 2, 1 position.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.990
I'll use 2,1 as the
index of that step.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.050
The next step should
be to finish the column

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.770
and get a 0 in that position.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.350
So the next step is really
the 3,1 step, row three,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.330
column one.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.390
But of course, I already have 0.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.070
Okay.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.930
So the multiplier is 0.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:39.390
I take 0 of this equation away
from this one and I'm all set.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.940
So I won't repeat that, but
there was a step there which,

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.750
MatLab would have to look --
it would look at this number

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.370
and, do that step, unless you
told it in advance that it was

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.870
0.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.590
Okay.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.530
Now what?

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.920
Now we can see the second
pivot, which is what?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.700
The second pivot --
see, we've eliminated --

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.870
x is now gone from
this equation, right?

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.570
We're down to two
equations in y and z.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.260
And so now I just do it again.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.270
Like, everything's very cursive
at this -- this is like --

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.240
such a basic algorithm
and you've seen it,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.670
but carry me through
one last step.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.490
So this is still
the first pivot.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.060
Now the second pivot is this
guy, who has appeared there.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.620
And what's the multiplier, the
appropriate multiplier now?

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.130
And what's my purpose?

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:44.560
Is it to wipe out the
3, 2 position, right?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.640
This was the 2, 1 step.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.010
And now I'm going to
take the 3, 2 step.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:08:00.350
So this all stays the
same, 1 2 1, 0 2 -1

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.340
and the pivots are there.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.510
Now I'm using this pivot,
so what's the multiplier?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.630
this row, gets subtracted from
this row and makes that a 0.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:20.770
So it's 0, 0 and is it a 5?

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.200
Yeah, I guess it's
a 5, is that right?

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.560
Because I have a
one there and I'm

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.330
subtracting twice of twice
this, so I think it's a 5 there.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.370
There's the third pivot.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.874
So let me put a box
around all three pivots.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:48.900
Is there a -- oh, did I
just invent a negative one?

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.800
I'm sorry that the tape
can't, correct that

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.220
as easily as I can.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:55.750
Okay.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.683
Thank you very much.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.610
You get an A in the course now.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.570
Is that correct?

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.790
Is it correct now?

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.810
Okay.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:15.830
So the three pivots are there --

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.840
I know right away a
lot about this matrix.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.400
This elimination step from A --
this matrix I'm going to call

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.830
U. U for upper triangular.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.690
So the whole purpose
of elimination

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.060
was to get from A to U.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.830
And, literally, that's the
most common calculation

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.580
in scientific computing.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.790
And people think of how
could I do that faster?

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.210
Because it's a
major, major thing.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.560
But we're doing it the
straightforward way.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.000
We found three pivots, and by
the way, I didn't say this,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.410
pivots can't be 0.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.160
I don't accept 0 as a pivot.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.750
And I didn't get 0.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.650
So this matrix is great.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.150
It gave me three
pivots, I didn't

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.450
have to do anything special,
I just followed the rules and,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.130
and the pivots are 1, 2 and 5.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.880
By the way, just because I
always anticipate stuff from

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.120
a later day, if I wanted to know
the determinant of this matrix

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.010
-- which I never
do want to know,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.990
but I would just
multiply the pivots.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.540
The determinant is 10.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:32.820
So even things like the
determinant are here.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.960
Okay.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.410
Now -- oh, let me talk
about failure for a moment,

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.510
and then --

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.370
and then come back to success.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.700
How could this have failed?

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:54.525
How could -- by fail, I mean
to come up with three pivots.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.800
I mean, there are
a couple of points.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.530
I would have already
been in trouble

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.520
if this very first
number here was 0.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.610
If it was a 0 there --
suppose that had been a 0,

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.760
there were no Xs in that
equation -- first equation.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.040
Does that mean I can't
solve the problem?

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.180
Does that mean I quit?

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.700
No.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.860
What do I do?

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.570
I switch rows.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.010
I exchange rows.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.210
So in case of a 0, I
will not say 0 pivot.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.680
I will never be heard to
utter those words, 0 pivot.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.270
But if there's a 0 in
the pivot position,

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.930
maybe I can say
that, I would try

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:45.400
to exchange for a lower equation
and get a proper pivot up

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.140
there.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.640
Okay.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.020
Now, for example, this
second pivot came out two.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.510
Could it have come out 0?

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.110
What -- actually, if I
change that 8 a little bit,

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:01.650
I would have got
a little trouble.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:08.210
What should I change that 8
to so that I run into trouble?

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.070
A 6.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:14.840
If that had been a 6, then
this would have been 0

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.320
and I couldn't have
used that as the pivot.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.230
But I could have
exchanged again.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.960
In this case.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.840
In this case, because when
can I get out of trouble?

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.490
I can get out of
trouble if there's

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.580
a non-0 below this
troublesome 0.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.350
And there is here.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.890
So I would be okay in this case.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.080
If this was a 6, I
would survive by a row

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.290
exchange.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:46.430
Now -- of course, it might have
happened that I couldn't do

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.280
the row, that -- that
there was 0s below it,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.780
but here there wasn't.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.370
Now, I could also have got in
trouble if this number 1 was

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.540
a little different.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.260
See, that 1 became a
5, I guess, by the end.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.940
So can you see what
number there would

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:14.130
have got me trouble that I
really couldn't get out of?

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.710
Trouble that I
couldn't get out of

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:22.810
would mean if 0 is
in the pivot position

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.270
and I've got no
place to exchange.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:31.970
So there must be some number
which if I had had here

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.460
it would have meant failure.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.590
Negative 4, good.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.670
If it was a negative 4 here --
if it happened to be a negative

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.900
4, I'll temporarily
put it up here.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.800
If this had been a
negative 4 z, then I

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.264
would have gone
through the same steps.

00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:52.680
This would have been a minus
4, it still would have been a

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.750
minus 4.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.610
But at the last minute
it would have become 0.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.080
And there wouldn't have
been a third pivot.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.790
The matrix would have
not been invertible.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.860
Well, of course, the inverse of
a matrix is coming next week,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.850
but, you've heard these words

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:12.590
before.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.940
So, that's how we
identify failure.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.680
There's temporary failure when
we can do a row exchange --

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.350
and get out of it, or there's
complete failure when we get

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.020
a 0 and --

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.280
and there's nothing
below that we can use.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.400
Okay.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.240
Let's stay with --

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.380
back to success now.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.020
In fact, I guess the next
topic is back substitution.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.430
So what's back substitution?

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:46.690
Well, now I'd better bring
the right-hand side in.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:52.040
So what would MatLab do
and what should we do?

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.540
Let me bring in the right-hand
side as an extra column.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.720
So there comes B.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:05.650
So it's 2, 12, I would call
this the augmented matrix.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.270
"Augment" means you've
tacked something on.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.810
I've tacked on
this extra column.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.870
Because, when I'm
working with equations,

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.990
I do the same thing
to both sides.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.940
So, at this step, I subtracted 2
of the first equation away from

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.910
the second equation so
that this augmented --

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.960
I even brought some colored
chalk, but I don't know if it

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.550
shows up.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.920
So this is like the augmented --

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.580
no!

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.060
Damn, circled the wrong thing.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.020
Okay.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.020
Here is b.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.090
Okay, that's the extra column.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:46.590
Okay.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.380
So what happened to
that extra column,

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.170
the right-hand side
of the equations,

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.160
when I did the first step?

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.320
So that was 3 of this away
from this, so it took --

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.210
the 2 stayed the same, but
three 2s got taken away from 12,

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.900
leaving 6, and that
2 stayed the same.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:09.050
So this is how it's
looking halfway along.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.310
And let me just
carry to the end.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:16.350
The 2 and the 6 stay
the same, but --

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.110
what do I have here?

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.790
Oh, gosh.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.880
Help me out, now.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.410
What -- so now I'm --

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.560
This is still like
forward elimination.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.430
I got to this point,
which I think is right,

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.420
and now what did
I do at this step?

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.250
I multiplied that pivot by 2
or that whole equation by 2

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.430
and subtracted from
that, so I think

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.620
I take two 6s, which
is 12, away from the 2.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:49.630
Do you think minus 10 is
my final right-hand side --

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.940
the right-hand side that
goes with U, and let me

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.820
call that once and
forever the vector c.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:04.060
So c is what happens to b,
and U is what happens to A.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.640
Okay.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.050
There you've seen
elimination clean.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.319
Okay.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.300
Oh, what's back substitution?

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.810
So what are my final
equations, then?

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.200
Can I copy these equations?

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:34.650
x+2y+z=2 is still there and
2y-2z=6 is there, and 5z=-10.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.250
Okay.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.120
Those are the equations
that these numbers

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.000
are telling me about.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.960
Those are the
equations U x equals c.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.390
Okay, how do I solve them?

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.780
What one do I solve for first?

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.280
z.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.550
I see immediately that the
correct value of z is negative

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.860
And what do I do next?

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.020
I go back upwards.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.100
I now know z here.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:12.360
So, if z is negative 2,
that's 4 there, is that right?

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:17.910
And so 2 y plus a 4
is 6, maybe y is 1.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.070
Going -- this is
back substitution.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.660
We're doing it on the
fly because it's so easy.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.120
And then x is --

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.810
so x -- 2y is 2 minus
2, maybe x is 2?

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.580
So you see what back
substitution is.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.160
It's the simple step solving
the equations in reverse order

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.350
because the system
is triangular.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.340
Okay.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.010
Good.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.860
So that's elimination
and back substitution,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.620
and I kept the
right-hand side along.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.360
Okay, now what do I --

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.060
that, like, is
first piece of the

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.330
lecture.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.780
What's the second piece?

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.530
Matrices are going to get in.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:17.640
So I wrote stuff with x, y-s
and z-s in there, then I really,

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:24.060
got the right shorthand, just
writing the matrix entries,

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.980
and now I want to
write the operations

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:32.080
that I did in matrices, right?

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.190
I've carried the
matrices along, but I

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:42.860
haven't said the operation
those elimination steps,

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.251
I now want to
express as matrices.

00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:45.750
Okay.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.460
Here they come.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.466
So now this is
elimination matrices.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.500
Okay.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.700
Let me take that first step,
which took me from 1 2 1 3 8 1

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.140
0 4 1.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.310
I want to operate on that --

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:16.260
I want to do
elimination on that.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.380
Okay.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.170
Okay, now I'm
remembering a point

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:29.390
I want to single out as
especially important.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.953
Let me move the
board up for that.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.020
Because when we do matrix
operations, we've got to, like,

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.860
be able to see the big picture.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.360
Okay.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.290
Last time, I spoke about
the big picture of --

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.380
when I multiply a matrix
by a right-hand side.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.690
If I have some matrix there
and I multiply it by 3 4 5,

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.920
let's say --

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.520
so here's a matrix --

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.120
what did I say -- well,
I guess I only said it

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.500
on the videotape, but -- do
you remember how I look at that

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.480
matrix multiplication?

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.410
The result of multiplying
a matrix by some vector

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:21.830
is a combination of the
columns of the matrix.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.640
It's 3 times the first column.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:33.630
It's 3 times column one plus 4
times column two plus 5 times

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.450
column three.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.370
Okay.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.970
I'm going to come back
to that multiple times.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:51.430
What I wanted to do now was to
emphasize the parallel thing

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.390
with rows.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:55.050
Why?

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.620
Because all our operations
here for this two weeks

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:04.150
of the course are
row operations.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:10.270
So this isn't what I
need for row operations.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.040
Let me do a row operation.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:20.380
Suppose I have my matrix
again and suppose I multiply

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.520
on the left by some
-- let's say 1 2 7.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.860
Again, I'm just, like,
saying what the result is.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.240
And then we'll say how
matrix multiplication works

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.470
and we'll see that it's true.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.260
Okay.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.600
But maybe already I'm making --

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.960
I'm sort of bringing up -- the
central idea of linear algebra

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:55.490
is how these matrices work by
rows as well as by columns.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.990
Okay.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.730
How does it work by rows?

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:05.310
What -- so that's a row vector.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.860
I could say that's a one
by three matrix, a row

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.335
vector multiplying a
three by three matrix.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.300
What's the output?

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:23.440
What's the product of
a row times a matrix?

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.260
And -- okay, it's a row.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.080
A row -- a column --

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:29.580
I'm sorry.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.690
A matrix times a
column is a column.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.350
So matrix times a -- yeah.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:41.760
Matrix times a
column is a column.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.080
And we know what column it is.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.400
Over here, I'm doing
a row times a matrix.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.500
And what's the answer?

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.260
It's one of that first
row, so it's 1 times --

00:23:53.260 --> 00:24:05.000
1 times row one, plus 2 times
row two plus 7 times row three.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.810
When -- as we do
matrix multiplication,

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:13.650
keep your eye on what it's
doing with whole vectors.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:18.140
And what it's doing -- what
it's doing in this case is

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.520
it's combining the rows.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.750
And we have a combination, a
linear combination of the rows.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.130
Okay, I want to use that.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.190
Okay, so my question is what's
the matrix that does this first

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:44.180
step, that takes -- subtracts
3 of equation one from equation

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:44.680
two?

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.550
That's what I want to do.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.800
So this is going to
be a matrix that's

00:24:48.800 --> 00:25:03.780
going to subtract 3 times
row one from row two,

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.160
and leaves the other rows the

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.670
same.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.150
Just in -- I mean, the
answer is going to be that.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.600
So whatever matrix this is --

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.450
and you're going to, like,
tell me what matrix will do it,

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:19.820
it's the matrix that leaves
the first row unchanged,

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.680
leaves the last row unchanged,
but takes 3 of these

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.740
away from this so it puts a 0
there, a 2 there and a minus 2.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.470
Good.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.420
What matrix will do it?

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.010
It's these.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.880
It should be a
pretty simple matrix,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.360
because we're doing
a very simple step.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.840
We're just doing this
step that changes row two.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.060
So actually, row
one is not changing.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.490
So tell me how the
matrix should begin.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:26:01.130
One -- the first row of
the matrix will be 1 0 0,

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:05.050
because that's just the right
thing that takes one of that

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.030
row and none of the other
rows, and that's what we want.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.160
What's the last
row of the matrix?

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:17.090
0 0 1, because that takes
one of the third row

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.030
and none of the other
rows, that's great.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.370
Okay.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:24.420
Now, suppose I didn't want
to do anything at all.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.340
Suppose my row -- well, I guess
maybe I had a case here when I

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:33.080
already had a 0 and,
didn't have to do anything.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:40.540
What matrix does nothing, like,
just leaves you where you were?

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.420
If I put in --

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:49.280
if I put in 0 1 0, that
would be -- that would be --

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.390
that's the matrix -- what's
the name of that matrix?

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.140
The identity matrix, right.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.720
So it does absolutely nothing.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.240
It just multiplies everything
and leaves it where it is.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.120
It's like a one, like the
number one, for matrices.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.360
But that's not what we want,
because we want to change this

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.100
row to --

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.060
so what's the correct --

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:16.610
what should I put in
here now to do it right?

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.280
I want to get -- what do I want?

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.660
What I -- I'm after --

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.360
I want 3 of row one
to get subtracted

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.210
off.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:32.620
So what's the right matrix,
finish that matrix for me.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.390
Negative 3 goes here?

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.560
And what goes here?

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.720
That 1.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.610
And what goes here?

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:40.740
The 0.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.230
That's the good matrix.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.700
That's the matrix
that takes minus 3

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.800
of row one plus the row two
and gives the new row 2.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:57.350
Should we just, like,
check some particular

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.130
entry?

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.380
How do I check a
particular entry

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.640
of a matrix in matrix
multiplication?

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:09.050
Like, suppose I wanted to check
the entry here that's in row

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.850
two, column three.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:16.400
So where does the entry in row
two, column three come from?

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.660
I would look at
row two of this guy

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:26.230
and column three of this
one to get that number.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.950
That number comes from the
second row and the third column

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:34.120
and I just take this
dot product minus 3 --

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:39.360
I'm multiplying -- minus 3
plus 1 and 0 gives the minus 2.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.010
Yeah.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.640
It works.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:46.840
So we got various ways
to multiply matrices now.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.870
We're sort of,
like -- informally.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.600
We've got by columns,
we've got -- well,

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.670
we will have by columns,
by rows, by each entry at a

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:57.370
time.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:01.360
But it's good to see that
matrix multiplication when one

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.030
of the matrices is so simple.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:08.180
So this guy is our
elementary matrix.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.530
Let's call it E for
elementary or elimination.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:18.130
And let me put the indexes 2 1,
because it's the matrix that we

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:22.380
needed to fix the 2 1 position.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.790
It's the matrix that we
needed to get this 2 1

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.340
position to be Okay.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.000
Good enough.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.140
So what do I do next?

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.550
I need another matrix, right?

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.610
I need to --

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.420
there's another step here.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.330
And I want to express
the whole elimination

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.780
process in matrix language.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:54.510
So tell me what -- so next
step, step two, which was what?

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:59.970
Subtract -- what was -- what
was the actual step that we did?

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:03.670
I think I subtracted
-- do you remember?

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.730
I had a 2 in the pivot
and a 4 below it,

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:11.700
so I subtracted two times --

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.690
times row two from row three.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.870
From row three.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.040
Tell me the matrix
that will do that.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.600
And tell me its name.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.390
Okay, it's going to be E,
for elementary or elimination

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:36.080
matrix and what's the index
number that I used to tell me

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.590
what E --

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.750
3, 2, right?

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:43.690
Because it's fixing
this 3 2 position.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.550
And what's the matrix, now?

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:52.200
Okay, you remember -- so E 3 2
is supposed to multiply my guy

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:58.840
that I have and it's supposed
to produce the right result,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.320
which was -- it leaves -- it's
supposed to leave the first

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:05.420
row, it's supposed to leave the
second row and it's supposed

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.490
to straighten out that
third row to this.

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.775
And what's the matrix
that does that?

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.820
1 0 0, right?

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.350
Because we don't change the
first row and the next row

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.190
we don't change either,
and the last row

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.240
is the one we do change.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.730
And what do I do?

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:33.540
Let's see, I
subtract two times --

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.120
so what's this row?

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.100
What's this here?

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.530
0, right, because the
first row's not involved.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:44.520
It's just in the 3 2
position, isn't it?

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:49.980
This the key number is this
minus the multiplier that goes

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.430
-- sitting there in
that 3 2 position.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:59.233
Is it a minus 2 to subtract 2
and then this is a 1 so that --

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:06.660
the overall effect is to take
minus 2 of this row plus 1 of

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.200
that.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.700
Okay.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:15.280
So, I've now given you the
pieces, the elimination

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.720
matrices, the elementary
matrices that take each step.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.890
So now what?

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.510
Now the next point
in the lecture

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:32.450
is to put those steps together
into a matrix that does it all

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.930
and see how it all happens.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.220
So now I'm going to
express the whole --

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:46.530
everything we did today so
far on A was to start with A,

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:53.150
we multiplied it by E 2 1,
that was the first step --

00:32:53.150 --> 00:33:01.080
and then we multiplied that
result by E 3 2 and that led us

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.970
to this thing and
what was that matrix?

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:10.890
U.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.840
You see why I like
matrix notation,

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.750
because there in,
like, little space --

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:23.460
a few bits when its compressed
on the web -- is everything --

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.490
is this whole lecture.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.550
Okay.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:33.720
Now there -- there are
important facts about matrix

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.940
multiplication.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.440
And we're close to maybe
the most important.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.320
And that is this.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.470
Suppose I ask you this question.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:49.140
Suppose I start with
a matrix A and I

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.410
want to end with
a matrix U and I

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:55.230
want to say what matrix
does the whole job?

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:05.240
What matrix takes me from A to
U, using the letters I've got?

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.969
And the answer is simple.

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:13.275
I'm not asking this as --
but it's highly important.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:19.429
How would I create
the matrix that

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.639
does the whole job
at once, that does

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:24.840
all of elimination in one shot?

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.810
It would be --

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:29.489
I would just put
these together, right?

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:34.310
In other words, this is the
thing I'm struggling to say.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.810
I can move those parentheses.

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:41.050
If I keep the
matrices in order --

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:45.030
I can't mess around with
the order of the matrices,

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:49.460
but I can change the order
that I do the multiplications.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.004
I can multiply
these two first --

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.490
in other words, you see what
those parentheses are doing?

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:04.910
It's saying -- multiply the
Es first and that gives you

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.660
the matrix that does
everything at once.

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.370
Okay.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.920
So this fact, that this is
automatically the same as this

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.870
--

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:20.590
for every matrix multiplication,
which I'm conscious of still

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.600
not telling you in
every detail, but, like,

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.910
you're seeing how it works --
and this is highly important --

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:32.150
and maybe tell me the long
word that describes this law

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:37.620
for matrices, that you
can move the parentheses?

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.670
It's called the associative law.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.551
I think you can now forget that.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.320
But don't forget the law.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.450
I mean, like, forget
the word associative.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:50.240
I don't know.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.950
But don't forget the law.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:59.540
Because actually, we'll see so
many steps in linear algebra,

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.220
so many proofs,
even, of main fact

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.495
come from just moving
the parentheses.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:15.400
And it's not that easy to
prove that this is correct,

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.240
you have to go into the
gory details of matrix

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.700
multiplication, do
it both ways and see

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.360
that you come out the same.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.360
Maybe I'll leave the
author to do that.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.160
Okay.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.650
So there we go.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:40.160
So there's a single matrix,
I could call it E --

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.780
while we're talking about these
matrices, tell me one other --

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.140
there's another type
of elementary matrix,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.510
and we already said
why we might need it.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.520
We didn't need it in this case.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.580
But it's the matrix
that exchanges two rows.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.990
It's called a
permutation matrix.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:06.500
Can you just, like, tell me what
that would So I'm just -- like,

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.260
this is a slight digression
and be? we'll -- yes,

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.600
so let me get some -- let me
figure out where I'm going

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.970
to put a permutation matrix.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.120
You'll see I'm always
squeezing stuff in.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.840
So permutation.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:33.530
Or, in fact this one you'll,
like, exchange rows --

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.920
shall I exchange rows one and
two, just to make life easy?

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.450
So if I had my matrix -- no, let
-- let me just do two by two.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.330
|a b; c d|.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:49.610
Suppose I want to find
the matrix that exchanges

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.330
those rows.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.350
What is it?

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.260
So the matrix that
exchanges those rows --

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.640
the row I want is
c d and it's there.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.100
So I better take one of it.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:11.010
And the row I want here is up
top, so I'll take one of that.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:13.180
So actually, I'm just --

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.850
the easy way -- this is my
matrix that I'll call P,

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:17.750
for permutation.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.650
It's the matrix -- actually, the
easy way to find it is just do

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:30.500
the thing to the
identity matrix.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.650
Exchange the rows of
the identity matrix

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:38.830
and then that's the matrix that
will do row exchanges for you.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:43.000
Suppose I wanted to
exchange columns instead.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.290
Columns have hardly got
into today's lecture,

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.430
but they certainly are
going to be around.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:53.010
How could I -- if I started
with this matrix |a b; c d|

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.740
then I wouldn't --

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.480
I'm not even going
to write this down,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:03.460
I'm just going to ask you,
because in elimination, we're

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.240
doing rows.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.090
But suppose we
wanted to exchange

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:10.225
the columns of a matrix.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.450
How would I do that?

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:19.110
What matrix multiplication
would do that job?

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:19.980
Actually, why not?

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.020
I'll write it down.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.840
So this is --

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.220
I'll write it under here
and then hide it again.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:28.740
Okay.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.580
Suppose I had my
matrix |a b; c d|

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:38.160
and I want to get to a c
over here and b d here.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.620
What matrix does that job?

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:58.520
Can I multiply -- can I cook up
some matrix that produces that

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.800
answer?

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.200
You can see from where I
put my hand I was really

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.660
asking can I put a matrix
here on the left that

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.850
will exchange columns?

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:16.260
And the answer is no.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.000
I'm just bringing
out again this point

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.940
that when I multiply on the
left, I'm doing row operations.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.790
So if I want to do
a column operation,

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:29.260
where do I put that
permutation matrix?

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.970
On the right.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:35.220
If I put it here, where I just
barely left room for it --

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:40.230
so I'll exchange the two
columns of the identity.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.410
Then it comes out
right, because now I'm

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.980
multiplying a column at a time.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.230
This is the first column
and says take one --

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:52.500
take none of that column,
one of this one and then you

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.500
got it.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.240
Over here, take one
of this one, none

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.420
of this one and you've got a c.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.990
So, in short, to do
column operations,

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.310
the matrix multiplies
on the right.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.660
To do row operations, it
multiplies on the left.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.990
Okay, okay, and it's row
operations that we're really

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.535
doing.

00:41:12.535 --> 00:41:13.035
Okay.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:23.230
And of course, I
mentioned in passing,

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:30.840
but I better say it very
clearly that you can't exchange

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.120
the orders of matrices.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.340
And that's just the point
I was making again here.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.520
A times B is not the
same as B times A.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:46.030
You have to keep these matrices
in their Gauss given order

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:49.750
here, right?

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.930
But you can move
the parentheses,

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:57.310
so that, in other words,
the commutative law, which

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:03.850
would allow you to take it
in the other order is false.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.930
So we have to keep
it in that order.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:06.690
Okay.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:10.915
So what next?

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:16.670
I could do this multiplication.

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.110
I could do E 32.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.525
So let me come back
to see what that was.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:28.470
Here was E 2 1.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:33.020
And here is E 3 2.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:39.320
And if I multiply those
two matrices together --

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.064
E 3 2 and then E 2 1,
I'll get a single matrix

00:42:43.064 --> 00:42:43.980
that does elimination.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.110
I don't want to do it that --

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.350
if I do that multiplication --

00:42:55.350 --> 00:43:00.790
there -- there's a
better way to do this.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.520
And so in this last few
minutes of today's lecture,

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.540
can I anticipate
that better way?

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:15.260
The better way is to think
not how do I get from A to U,

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.310
but how do I get
from U back to A?

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:24.730
So reversing steps
is going to come in.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.950
Inverse -- I'll use
the word inverse here.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:29.630
Okay.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:37.250
So let me make the first step
at what's the inverse matrix?

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:40.560
All the matrices you've seen
on this board have inverses.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.910
I didn't write any
bad matrices down.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:50.770
We spoke about possible
failure, and for a moment,

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:53.400
we put in a matrix
that would fail.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.260
But right now, all
these matrices are good,

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.720
they're all invertible.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.010
And let's take the
inverse -- well,

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:04.800
let me say first what does
the inverse mean and find it?

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.300
Okay.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:10.850
So we're getting a little
leg up on inverses.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:16.172
Okay, so this is the
final moments of today.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:22.870
Sorry, he's still there.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:23.382
Okay.

00:44:23.382 --> 00:44:23.882
Inverses.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.320
Okay, and I'm just going
to take one example

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.870
and then we're done.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:39.480
The example I'll take will
be that E. So my matrix

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:45.640
is 1 0 0 minus 3 1 0 0 0 1.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:55.870
And I want to find the
matrix that undoes that step.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:57.720
So what was that step?

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:03.600
The step was subtract 3
times row one from row two.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:10.670
So what matrix will get me back?

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:14.540
What matrix will bring back --

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:19.530
you know, if I started with a 2
12 2 and I changed it to a 2 6

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:25.580
2 because of this guy, I want
to get back to the 2 12 I want

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:30.150
to find the matrix which --
which undoes elimination,

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:33.240
the matrix which multiplies
this to give the identity.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.940
And you can tell me what I
should do in words first,

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.570
and then we'll write down
the matrix that does it.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:50.130
If this step subtracted
3 times row 1 from row 2,

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.500
what's the inverse step?

00:45:51.500 --> 00:46:02.120
I add 3 times row one
to row two, right?

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.080
I add it back.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.610
The -- what I subtracted
away, I add back.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:08.770
So the inverse matrix
in this case is --

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:12.660
I now want to add 3
times row one to row two,

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.020
so I won't change row one,
I won't change row three

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:23.000
and I'll add 3 times
row one to row two.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.740
That's a case where
the inverse is clear.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:33.530
It's clear in words what to
do, because what this did

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:37.330
was simple to express.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:43.290
It just changed row two by
subtracting 3 of row one.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.670
So to invert it, I go that way.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.940
And if you -- if we
do that calculation,

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:51.240
3 times this row plus
1 times this row,

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.980
comes out the right
row of the identity.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.050
Okay, so inverses are an --

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:05.020
so if this matrix was E and this
matrix is I for identity, then

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:08.370
what's the notation
for this guy?

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:11.010
E to the minus one.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.710
E inverse.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:13.950
Okay.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.040
Let's stop there for today.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.660
That's a little jump on
what's coming on Monday.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.050
So, see you Monday.
