00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.380
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.520
Welcome back.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.390
So today, I'd like to tackle
a problem in Markov matrices.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.220
Specifically, we're going to
start with this problem which

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.540
almost has a physics origin.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.240
If we have a particle that
jumps between positions A and B

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.470
with the following
probabilities--

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.910
I'll just state it-- if
it starts at A and jumps

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.110
to B with probability
0.4 or starts at A

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.300
and stays at A with probability
0.6, or if it starts at B

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.870
then it goes to A
with probability 0.2

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.010
or stays at B with
probability 0.8,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.660
we'd like to know the
evolution of the probability

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.690
of this particle over
a long period of time.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.110
So specifically
the problem we're

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.830
interested today is:
if we have a particle

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.040
and we know that it
starts at position A,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.940
what is the
probability that it is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.150
at position A and
the probability

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.890
that it's at position B after
one step, after n steps,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.112
and then finally after an
infinite number of steps?

00:01:04.112 --> 00:01:06.320
So I'll let you think about
this problem for a moment

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.028
and I'll be back.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.580
Hi everyone.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.370
Welcome back.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.630
So the main difficulty
with this problem

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.646
is that it's phrased
as a physics problem.

00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:28.020
And we need to convert it into
some mathematical language

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.899
to get a handle on it.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.440
So specifically,
what we'd like to do

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.670
is to convert this into
a matrix formalism.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.120
So what we can do is we can
write this little graph down

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.990
and describe everything in
this graph using a matrix.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.860
So I'm going to
call this matrix A,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.700
and I'm going to associate
the first row of A

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.580
with particle position A
and particle position B.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.320
And I'll associate the
first and second columns

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.990
with particles
positions A and B.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.490
And then what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.040
going to fill in this
matrix with the probability

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.270
distributions.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.490
So, specifically what's going
to go in this top left corner?

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.350
Well, the number 0.6, which
represents the probability

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.870
that I stay at position
A, given that I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.780
start at position A.
What's going to go here

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.060
in the bottom left-hand corner?

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.890
Well, we're going to put 0.4,
because this is the probability

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.230
that I wind up at B, given that
I start at A. And then lastly,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.490
we'll fill in these other two
columns or the second column

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.690
with 0.8 and 0.2.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.340
So I'll just state
briefly this is

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.210
what's called a Markov matrix.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.600
And it's called Markov, because
first off, every element

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.460
is positive or 0.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.840
And secondly, the sum of the
elements in each column is 1.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.520
So if we note 0.4 plus 0.6
is 1, 0.8 plus 0.2 is 1.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.490
And these matrices
come up all the time

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.890
when we're talking about
probabilities and the evolution

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.530
of probability distributions.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.110
OK.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.250
So now, once we've encoded
this graph using this matrix A,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.480
we now want to
tackle this problem.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.394
So I'm going to
introduce the vector p,

00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:36.810
and I'm going to
use a subscript 0

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.630
is to denote the probability
that the particle is at time 0.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:50.400
So we're told that the
particle starts at position A.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.190
So at time 0, I'm going
to use the vector [1, 0].

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:03.810
Again, I'm going to match the
top component of this vector

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.310
with the top component
of this matrix

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.700
and the first column
of this matrix.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.120
And then likewise, the second
component of this vector

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.480
with the second row and
second column of this matrix.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.670
And we're interested
in: how does

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.620
this probability evolve as
the particle takes many steps?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:35.610
So for one step, what's the
probability of the particle

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.770
going to be?

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.150
Well, this is the beauty of
introducing matrix notation.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.510
I'm going to denote p_1
to be the probability

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.160
of the particle after one step.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.080
And we see that we can write
this as the matrix A multiplied

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.160
by p_0.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:07.570
So the answer is 0.6 and 0.4.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.680
And I achieve this just
by multiplying this matrix

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.291
by this vector.

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:11.790
OK?

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.050
So this concludes part one.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.240
Now part two is a
little trickier.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.435
So part two is n steps.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.340
And to tackle this
problem, we need

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.750
to use a little more machinery.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.550
So first off, I'm going to
note that p_1 is A times p_0.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.302
Likewise, p_2-- so
this is the position

00:05:42.302 --> 00:05:44.510
of the-- the probability
distribution of the particle

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.940
after two steps.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.860
This is A times p_0, which
is A squared times p_0.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.000
And we note that
there's a general trend.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.070
After n steps-- so
P_n-- the general trend

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.970
is, it's going to be this matrix
A raised to the n-th power,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.230
multiply the vector P0.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.920
So how do we take the
n-th power of a matrix?

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.760
Well, this is where we use
eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:27.320
So recall, that we can take any
matrix A that's diagonalizable

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:35.360
and write it as U D U inverse,
where D is a diagonal matrix

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.180
and this matrix U is a matrix
whose columns correspond

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.242
to the eigenvectors of A.

00:06:41.242 --> 00:06:42.700
So for this problem,
I'm just going

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.830
to state what the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors are.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.050
And I'll let you work them out.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.800
So because it's a
Markov matrix, we always

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.780
have an eigenvalue which is 1.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.130
And in this case, we have an
eigenvector u which is 1 and 2.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.440
In addition, the second
eigenvalue is 0.4.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.520
And the eigenvector
corresponding to this one

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.070
is [1, -1].

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.750
And I'll just call these
u_1 and u_2, like that.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:37.420
OK, we can now write this
big matrix U as 1, 2; 1, -1.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.452
D is going to be-- now I
have to match things up.

00:07:44.452 --> 00:07:46.160
If I'm going to put
the first eigenvector

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.750
in the first column, we have
to stick 1 in the first column

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.620
as well and then 0.4 like this.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.410
And then lastly, we also have
U inverse which I can just

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:16.670
work out to be minus 1/3,
one over the determinant,

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:29.740
times -1, -1; -2, and 1,
which simplifies to this.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:40.860
OK, so now if we take A and
raise it to the power of n,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.809
we have this nice identity
that all the U and U inverses

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.040
collapse in the middle.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.900
And we're left with U, D
to the n, U inverse, p_0.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.810
Now raising the a diagonal
matrix to the power of n

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.400
is a relatively
simple thing to do.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.655
We just take the eigenvalues and
raise them to the power of n.

00:09:03.655 --> 00:09:05.780
So when we compute this
product, there's a question

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.720
of what order do we do things?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.930
Now these are 2 by 2
matrices, so in theory we

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.830
could just multiply
out, 2 by 2 matrix, 2

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.050
by 2 matrix, 2 by 2 matrix, and
then on a vector which is a 2

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.540
by 1 matrix.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.030
But if you're in a test and
you're cramped for time,

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.574
you want to do as little
computations as possible.

00:09:21.574 --> 00:09:22.990
So what you want
to do is you want

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:28.170
to start on the right-hand
side and then work backwards.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:40.170
So if we do this, we
end up obtaining 1, 2,

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:47.795
this is going to be to the
power of n, 1/3, [1, 2].

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.520
OK, so for this
last part, I'm just

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.570
going to write down
the final answer.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.890
And I'll let you work out the
multiplication of matrices.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:15.650
So we have for p_n: 1/3, 2 times
0.4 to the n plus 1, -2 0.4

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:21.430
to the n plus 2.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:26.160
And this is the final
vector for p of n.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.980
So this finishes up Part 2.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.620
And then lastly,
for Part 3, what

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.930
happens when n goes to infinity?

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.740
Well, we have the
answer for any n.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.410
So we can just take the
limit as n goes to infinity.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.950
Now, specifically as
n goes to infinity,

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.040
0.4 raised to some very
large power vanishes.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.150
So these two terms drop off.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.550
And at the end of the day,
we're left with p_infinity

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:58.130
is 1/3 [1, 2].

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.240
OK?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.430
So just to recap, we started off
with a particle starting at A,

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.550
and then after a very
long time, the particle

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.560
winds up with a
probability distribution

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.030
which is 1/3, 1 and 2.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:20.290
And this is quite characteristic
of Markov matrix chains.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.290
Specifically, we note
that 1/3 * [1, 2]

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:31.340
is a multiple of the eigenvector
corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.667
So even though the particle
started at position A,

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:36.250
after a long period
of time, it tended

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.130
to forget where it started
and approached, diffused

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.130
into this uniform distribution.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.860
OK.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.470
I'd like to finish up here.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.680
And I'll see you next time.
