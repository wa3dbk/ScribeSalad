DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi everyone.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.060
I'm Dave.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.840
Now today, I'd like
to tackle a problem

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.990
in orthogonal subspaces.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.260
So the problem we'd like to
tackle: given a subspace S,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.220
and suppose S is spanned by
two vectors, [1, 2, 2, 3]

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.530
and [1, 3, 3, 2].

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.630
We have a question here which
is to find a basis for S perp--

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.409
S perp is another subspace
which is orthogonal to S.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.870
And then secondly, can every
vector in R^4 be uniquely

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.260
written in terms
of S and S perp.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.282
So I'll let you think
about this for now,

00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:42.573
and I'll come back in a minute.

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:54.620
Hi everyone.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.060
Welcome back.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.180
OK, so why don't we
tackle this problem?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.440
OK, so first off,
what does it mean

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.760
for a vector to be in S perp?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:16.530
Well, if I have a
vector x, and S perp,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.540
and x is in S perp,
what this means is

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.450
x is going to be orthogonal
to every vector in S. Now

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.640
specifically, S is spanned
by these two vectors.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.660
So it's sufficient that x be
perpendicular to the two basis

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.250
vectors in S.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:45.720
So specifically, I can take
[1,  2, 2, 3] and dot it with x,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.230
and it's going to be 0.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.210
So I'm treating x as
a column vector here.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.340
In addition, x must also be
orthogonal to [1, 3, 2, 2].

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.880
So any vector x
that's an S perp must

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.750
be orthogonal to both
of these vectors.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.280
So what we can do
is we can write

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.680
this as a matrix equation.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.790
And we do this by
combining these two vectors

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.720
as rows of the matrix.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.700
So if we step back and take
a look at this equation,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.200
we see that what
we're really asking

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.410
is to find all x that are in
the null space of this matrix.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.990
So how do we find x in the
null space of a matrix?

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.330
Well what we can do is we
can row reduce this matrix

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.270
and try and find a basis
for the null space.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.660
So I'm going to just
row reduce this matrix.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.160
And notice that
by row reduction,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.850
we don't actually change
the null space of a matrix.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.619
So if I'm only interested
in the null space,

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.160
this system is going
to be equivalent

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.530
to-- I can keep the
top row the same.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.120
And then just to
simplify our lives,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.597
we can take the second
row and subtract

00:03:13.597 --> 00:03:14.680
one copy of the first row.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.080
Now, if I do that, I
obtain 0, 1, 1, -1.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.210
Now, to parameterize the null
space, what I'm going to do

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.640
is I'm going to write
x out as components.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:48.550
So if I write x with components
x_1, x_2, x_3 and x_4,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.790
we see here that this
matrix has a rank of 2.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.970
Now, we're looking at
vectors which live in R^4,

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.610
so we know that the null space
is going to have a dimension

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.362
which is 4 minus 2.

00:04:02.362 --> 00:04:04.820
So that means there should be
two vectors in the null space

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.610
of this matrix.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.350
To parameterize these
two-dimensional vectors, what

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.040
I'm going to do is I'm going
to let x_4 equal some constant,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.250
and x_3 equal another constant.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.020
So specifically, I'm going
to let x_4 equal b, and x_3

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.838
equal a.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.160
Now what we do is we take a
look at these two equations,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.990
and this bottom
equation will say

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.030
that x_2 is equal
to negative x_3 plus

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:51.230
x_4, which is going to equal
negative a-- x_4-- plus b.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.210
And then the top equation says
that x_1 is equal to negative

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:07.700
2*x_2 minus 2*x_3 minus 3*x_4.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.252
And if I substitute
in, x_2 is -a plus b.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.608
x_3 is a.

00:05:25.608 --> 00:05:26.780
And x_4 is b.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.220
So when the dust
settles, the a's cancel

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.930
and I'm left with minus 5b.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.560
So we can combine
everything together

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:56.290
and we end up obtaining [x_1,
 x_2, x_3, x_4] equals -5b,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:09.759
x_2 is minus a plus b,
x_3 is a, and x_4 is b.

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.800
And now what we can do is
we can take this vector

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.780
and we can decompose
it into pieces

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.190
which are a multiplied
by a vector,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.630
and b multiplied by a vector.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:29.610
So you'll note that this is
actually a times [0, -1, 1, 0]

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:40.110
plus b times [-5, 1, 0, 1].

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.100
OK?

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.260
So we have successfully
achieved a parameterization

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.000
of the null space of this
matrix as some constant a

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.980
times a vector
[0, -1, 1, 0] plus b

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.700
times a vector [-5, 1, 0, 1].

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.170
And now we claim that this
is the entire space, S perp.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:10.060
So S perp is going to be spanned
by this vector and this vector.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.870
Now notice how, if I were
to take either of these two

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:20.230
vectors in S and dot it with
any vector in the null space,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.425
by construction, it
automatically vanishes.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.190
So this concludes part one.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.330
Now for part two.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.510
Can every vector v in R^4 be
written uniquely in terms of S

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.020
and S perp?

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.800
The answer is yes.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.460
So how do we see this?

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.670
Well, if I have a
vector v, what I can do

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.500
is I can try and write
it as some constant c_1

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:02.880
times the vector [1, 2, 2, 3]
plus c_2 times the vector [1,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:21.880
3, 3, 2] plus the vector
c_3 [0,  -1, 1, 0] plus c4

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.810
[-5, 1, 0, 1].

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.870
OK?

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.360
So c_1 and c_2 are
multiplying the vectors in S,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.450
and c_3 and c_4 are multiplying
the vectors in S perp.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.090
So the question is,
given any v, can I

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.600
find constants c_1,
c_2, c_3, c_4, such

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.370
that this equation holds?

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.540
And the answer is yes.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.050
Just to see why it's
yes, what we can do

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.660
is we can rewrite this
in matrix notation,

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.175
and there's kind
of a handy trick.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.684
What I can do is I
can take these columns

00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:18.350
and write them as
columns of the matrix.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.020
And this whole
expression is actually

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.510
equivalent to this
matrix multiplied

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:32.100
by the constant,
c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.760
And on the right-hand
side, we have the vector v.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.930
Now, by construction,
these vectors

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.540
are linearly independent.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.370
And we know from linear
algebra that if we

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.880
have a matrix with linearly
independent columns,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.280
the matrix is invertible.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.330
What this means is, for any
v on the right-hand side,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.730
we can invert this matrix and
obtain unique coefficients,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.590
c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.640
This then gives us a
unique decomposition for v

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.180
in terms of a
piece which is in S

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.690
and a piece which is in S perp.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.630
And in general this can be
done for any vector space.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.250
Well I'd like to
conclude this problem now

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.360
and I hope you had a good time.
