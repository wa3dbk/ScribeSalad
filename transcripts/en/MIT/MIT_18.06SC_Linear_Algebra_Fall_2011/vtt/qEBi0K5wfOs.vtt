LINAN CHEN: Hello.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.870
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.050
I'm sure you are
becoming more and more

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.220
familiar with the
determinants of matrices.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.880
In the lecture, we also learned
the geometric interpretation

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.780
of the determinant.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.660
The absolute value of the
determinant of a matrix

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.730
is simply equal to the volume
of the parallelepiped spanned

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.040
by the row vectors
of that matrix.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.600
So today, we're going
to apply this fact

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.420
to solve the following problem.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.990
I have a tetrahedron,
T, in this 3D space.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.840
And the vertices of T are given
by O, which is the origin, A_1,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.040
A_2, and A_3.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.940
So I have highlighted
this tetrahedron

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.190
using the blue chalk.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.270
So this is T.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.120
And our first goal is to
compute the volume of T

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.330
using the determinant.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.260
And the second part is:
if I fix A_1 and A_2,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.130
but move A_3 to another
point, A_3 prime, which

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.380
is given by this
coordinate, I ask you

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.370
to compute the volume again.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.130
OK.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.120
So since we want to use the fact
that the determinant is related

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.280
to the volume, we have to
figure out which volume

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.680
we should be looking at.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.660
We know that the
determinant is related

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.060
to the volume of
a parallelepiped.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.220
But here, we only
have a tetrahedron.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.010
So the first goal should be to
find out which parallelepiped

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.230
you should be working with.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.810
OK, why don't you hit pause and
try to work it out yourself.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.510
You can sketch the
parallelepiped on this picture.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.780
And I will return in a while
and continue working with you.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.640
All right.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.990
How did your computation go?

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.520
Now let's complete
this picture together.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.930
As we were saying, we
need a parallelepiped

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.800
so that we can use the fact
that the determinant is

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.790
related to the volume.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.700
Here, I have a tetrahedron.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.230
And let's look at these three
edges, OA_1, OA_2, and OA_3.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.640
All of them meet at the origin.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.720
So why don't we just consider
the parallelepiped spanned

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.430
by those same three edges?

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.870
It's a natural choice,
because at least it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.116
shares three edges with T.

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:58.500
OK, now let's move on
to this picture here.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.930
As you can see, I have
drawn this parallelepiped

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.180
in red chalk.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.080
So the blue part
is my original T.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.710
And the red part,
let me call it P.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.830
It's the parallelepiped spanned
by edges OA_1, OA_2, and OA_3.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.870
So that's the parallelepiped
that I'm going to work with.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.230
Now the next step is to
relate the volume of T

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.510
to the volume of P. OK,
let's recall together

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.820
what is the volume
of a tetrahedron.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.100
We note that the
volume of a tetrahedron

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.470
is going to be equal to
1/3 of the area of the base

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.260
times the height, right?

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.800
Of course, you can choose any
side, any face to be the base.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.770
But for convenience, we're going
to choose the triangle OA_1A_2

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.540
to be the base of T.
So the volume of T

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.810
is going to be equal to 1/3
times the area of triangle

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.310
OA_1A_2.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.540
So I use this A to
indicate the area.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.430
Then times the height.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.760
Well, if I choose
this to be my base,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.560
then this A_3 becomes the apex.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.820
Then the height is simply
equal to the distance from A_3

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.000
to the triangle OA_1A_2.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.220
Let me use letter h to
denote this quantity.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.910
So that's the height.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.950
And the volume of
T is equal to 1/3

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.390
of the product of the area
of the base times the height.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:59.960
OK, this is the volume of T. Now
let's see what the volume of P

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.250
is.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.790
So P is a parallelepiped.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.760
The volume of a
parallelepiped is simply

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.800
equal to the area of the
base times its height.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.020
This time, which face would
you choose to be the base?

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.320
Well, of course, you would like
to choose this parallelogram

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.200
to be the base because it
contains the base of T.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.570
If we do so, so we want to
choose this parallelogram

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.920
to be the base, then
what is the area of this?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.590
Well, it clearly contains two
copies of the triangle OA_1A_2.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.550
So the area of the
parallelogram is simply

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.115
equal to twice the area
of the triangle OA_1A_2.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.600
Then what is the height of P?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.570
Again, if you choose
this face to be the base,

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.360
then A_3 becomes the apex again.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.210
Then the height of
the parallelepiped

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.240
is equal to the
distance from A_3

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.760
to the base, which is the
same as the distance from A_3

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.930
to triangle OA_1A_2.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.050
So here, the height
is also equal to h.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.860
Now you can compare
these two formulae.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.800
You see that volume
of T is simply

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:44.640
equal to 1/6 of
volume of P. That's

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.080
the connection
between the volume

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.170
of the tetrahedron with the
volume of the parallelepiped.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.690
In order to compute
the volume of T,

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.530
we only need to compute
the volume of P.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.380
Now let's compute the volume
of this parallelepiped.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:10.280
We know that it's related to
the determinant of a matrix.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.150
And the row vectors
of that matrix

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.850
are given by these three edges.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.910
So because all of
them start from 0,

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.090
we only need the coordinate
of A_1, A_2, and A_3.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.730
So here, volume of P is
equal to the absolute value.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.320
So don't forget the
absolute value sign.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.590
Absolute value of the
determinant of a three

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.180
by three matrix.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.020
So we just need to copy the
coordinates of the vertices

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.340
down here.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:49.280
The first one is [2, 2, -1].

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.400
These two are too close.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.240
-1.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.084
And A_2 is [1, 3, 0].

00:08:01.084 --> 00:08:07.070
A3 is [-1, 1, 4].

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.440
The absolute value
of this determinant.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.290
And if you compute this, this
is a three by three matrix.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.010
The determinant should
be easy to compute.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:25.900
And the result should be 12.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.780
So that's the volume
of P, which means

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:35.370
the volume of the tetrahedron
T is equal to 12 over 6,

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.659
which is 2.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.240
Did you get the correct answer?

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.120
OK, so in order to
compute the volume of T,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.990
we have related to
a parallelepiped, P,

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.010
which contains T. All right.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.300
Now let's look at
the second part.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.400
The second part says that if
I keep A_1 and A_2 unchanged,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.750
but I move A_3 to
a new point-- so A3

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.630
is going to be moved to a
point given by A_3 prime,

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:23.310
and the coordinate is
-201, -199, and 104.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.490
And I'm asking you
to compute the volume

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.180
of the new tetrahedron.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.280
Well as you can see,
this point seems

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.590
to be far away from the origin.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.610
I'm not even able to
draw this point here.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.770
But you can imagine, as
this point goes far away

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.440
from the origin,
this spike is going

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.480
to become more and more pointy.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.770
In other words, the entire
tetrahedron looks more and more

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.010
like a needle.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.610
But nonetheless, we
can use the same method

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.670
to compute the volume.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:03.180
So we follow the same
idea, the volume of T

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.420
is going to be equal to
1/6 of the volume of P.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.350
And in this case,
that's going to become

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.950
the absolute value of the
determinant of a three

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.010
by three matrix
whose row vectors are

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.250
given by these three edges.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.030
So in this case, we again
copy down the coordinates

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.070
of three vertices.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.250
The first one is [2, 2, -1].

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.300
The second one is [1, 3, 0].

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:48.850
The third one should become
this, so [-201, 199, 104].

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:49.870
OK.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.840
That should give me the
volume of the new tetrahedron.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.480
Let me call it T prime
just to differentiate it

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.980
from the previous tetrahedron.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.950
And of course, you can compute
this determinant explicitly.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:12.330
If you do so, you will see
the answer should be 2 again.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.400
But in fact, there is
a way that you can just

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.390
read out the answer directly
without any real computation.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.620
Let's pay attention
to the last row.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.660
In other words, let's pay
attention to this new A_3,

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.700
well, A_3 prime.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.430
What do you observe here?

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.940
A_3 prime, if you consider the
difference between A_3 and A_3

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.990
prime, in other words, if you
consider how much you have

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:48.150
moved your apex, you will
see that's equal to -100*A_1.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.870
Right?

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.690
So A_3 is [-1, 1, 4].

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.690
A_3 prime is this.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:04.720
That's exactly equal
to -100 times A_1.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.650
What does that mean?

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.080
Well from the point
of view of the matrix,

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:16.620
you are subtracting from the
original third row 100 times

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.190
the first row.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:22.470
But this row operation does
not change the determinant.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.090
In other words, you know that
this determinant should be

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.790
the same as the previous one.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.980
So you can write out 2 directly.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.080
From this picture, we
can also see that fact.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.610
So from this picture, we
know that this section

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:46.520
is saying that I need to move
A_3 in the inverse direction

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.730
of A_1 by 100 times A_1.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.500
So you're moving
A_3 parallel to A_1.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.410
But it doesn't matter how
far you've moved your apex.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.800
You're moving in a way
that remains parallel

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.160
to the base, which is saying
that this movement does not

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.210
change the height.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:12.780
Since A_1 and A_2 are
fixed, your base is fixed,

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.730
and you're not
changing the height.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.660
So of course, the
volume is not changing.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.450
That's also a
reason, another way

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.700
to see that the
volume of T prime

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.208
is simply equal to
the volume of T.

00:13:26.208 --> 00:13:29.580
OK, this completes this problem.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.450
I hope this example
was helpful to you.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.850
And we should keep in mind that
the fact that the determinant

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.090
is related to
volume sometimes can

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.620
become very handy in
computing the volume

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.210
of certain geometric objects.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.290
Thank you for watching,
and I'm looking forward

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.390
to seeing you soon.
