00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.000
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.530
So for the first
part of this course,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.250
we've learned basically
the ins and outs

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.990
of solving linear
systems of equations.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.760
Today we're going to do a little
review of the basic concepts.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.520
Hopefully we'll see a few of
them in the following problem.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.660
We're given a square
matrix A-- a three

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.040
by three square matrix A-- where
the last entry is a parameter

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.570
k.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.200
And this parameter will vary.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.620
And we'll see what happens to
the system of equations A*x

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.180
equal to [2, 3, 7], for which
k it has a unique solution,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.260
for which k it has
infinitely many solutions.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710
Then we'll find the
LU decomposition.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.800
And finally, we'll write
down the complete solution,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.087
the system.

00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:12.670
So I'll give you a
few minutes to work

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.630
this problem on your own.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.710
And then please come
back and see how I do it.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.980
All right, welcome back.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.510
So let's start with part A.
For which k does this system,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.720
A*x equal [2, 3, 7],
have a unique solution?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:46.310
So what do we know about square
systems of linear equations?

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.630
They have a unique solution
when the matrix A is invertible.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.230
So now, when is A invertible?

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.590
It is invertible when
it is of full rank.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.240
And how do we figure this out?

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.770
We do it by performing
row operations.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.245
We do it by doing
eliminations on the matrix.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.360
But since we want to
simulate an exam setting,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.910
it always pays off to see
what tasks lie ahead of us.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.000
So in part C, we're asked to
find the LU decomposition.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.540
This means that when
we do row operations,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.020
we'd better keep track what row
operations we're doing exactly.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.660
In particular, we'll write them
down as elementary matrices.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.070
And in part D, we'll be asked to
compute the complete solution.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.520
And therefore it's good
to do row operations

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.985
on the augmented matrix
A. So let's do this.

00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:00.330
I'm going to write this.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:12.210
The augmented matrix A is the
following beast, 1, 1, 1; 1 2,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:21.440
3; 3, 4, k; and then 2, 3, 7.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.430
So first thing, we subtract
a multiple of row one

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.400
from row two.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.540
And it's exactly
negative 1 times

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.360
the first row plus the second.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.990
Let me write down the
corresponding elementary matrix

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.340
that does this.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.300
It's E_(2,1).

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.730
And it's lower diagonal
with 1's on the diagonal.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.670
And it's going to
be exactly minus 1

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.300
in the first entry
of the second row.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.850
So we get 1, 1,
1, 2; 0, 1, 2, 1.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.620
And we copy down the third row.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.660
Now we subtract a
multiple of the first row

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.550
from the third one.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.790
And let me write this here.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.640
Yeah, we'll multiply the
first row by negative 3,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.800
and add it to the third one.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.740
This is accomplished by the
elementary matrix E_(3,1) which

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.530
is 1, 1, 1, negative
three, and then 0, 0.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.030
OK, 1, 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 2, 1.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.250
We copy the first two rows.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:10.630
And then the third one
will be 0, 1, k minus 3,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.750
and 7 minus 3 times
2, 7 minus 6, 1.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.413
We have essentially one last
row operation to perform.

00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:23.560
Let me do it here.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.970
So we'll subtract the second
row from the third one.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:48.450
And we'll get 1, 1, 1, 2;
0, 1, 2, 1; 0, 0, k minus 5,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.300
and then 0.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.150
And this was achieved by the
elementary matrix E_(3,2),

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.780
which was 1, 1, 1,
and then negative 1.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.040
Because we multiplied the
second row by negative 1

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.410
and added it to the third one.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:24.410
So we got to a matrix,
which is upper triangular.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.920
And we want to figure out: for
which value of the parameter k

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.730
is this matrix of full rank.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.320
This is a pivot.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.440
This is a pivot.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.200
And we want this one
to be a pivot as well.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:51.410
And that happens when
k minus 5 is not 0.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:58.000
So when k is different from 5,
the matrix A is of full rank.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.330
And therefore the system
A*x equals to [2, 3,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.220
7] has a unique solution.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:14.960
Now part B. For which k do we
have infinitely many solutions?

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.160
So when are we in
such a situation?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.750
We are in such a situation when
the null space of the matrix A

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.990
is nontrivial.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.450
So the null space
will be nontrivial

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:38.230
when this k minus 5
number here, which

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.760
is what's the pivot in
the first case, is 0.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:50.030
So k minus 5 equals to 0.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.260
You see there's a
little caveat here.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.990
When k is equal to 5,
we get the third row

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.760
of the augmented matrix,
0, 0, 0, equal to 0.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.250
This means that the matrix
is actually consistent,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.090
and we indeed have a solution
But if this entry were nonzero,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.000
then we would get no solutions.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:24.850
Now off to part C. We want to
compute the LU decomposition.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:30.040
Well, we already got
what the matrix U

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.470
is through performing
row operations.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:35.870
It's this guy here.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:47.284
Let me write it down-- 1, 1,
1; 0 1, 2; 0, 0, k minus 5.

00:08:47.284 --> 00:08:52.370
And when k is equal to 4,
this entry's negative 1.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.330
And now what about the matrix L?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.710
Well, how did we get to this U?

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.460
We had the matrix A.
We got the matrix U.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.670
And what we did was
first we applied E_(2,1).

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.840
Then we applied E_(3,1)
and then E_(3,2).

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.170
We get A by inverting
this equation.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:38.860
So it's going to be E_(2,1)
inverse E_(3,1) inverse E_(3,2)

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:48.120
inverse times U. And
this is our matrix L.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.710
And we know it's fairly easy
to invert these elementary

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:56.755
matrices E. We flip the signs
of the off-diagonal entries.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.400
I'm not going to
write down again

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.570
the inverses of these guys.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.780
I'm just going to write the
product of the inverses.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.480
And that's also very
easy to compute.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.380
Because one, we
invert the signs.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:28.060
We just send the numbers in
their corresponding entry of L.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.280
I mean the following thing.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.390
So minus 1 becomes a 1.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:38.945
And it comes here, in
its respective entry.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:50.720
For E_(3,1), we flip
the sign, first 3,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.350
and we plug it in here.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:59.570
And for E_(3,2), we flip the
sign of this guy, becomes 1,

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.030
and we plug it in here.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.120
So give me a few moments
to erase the board,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.500
and then I'll do part four.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.650
We're back, and we're
going to do part D now.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.640
So we need to find
the complete solution

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.130
of the system for all k.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.950
And we saw that
for k equal to 5,

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.650
the system had many,
many solutions.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.280
And for k not equal
to 5, it had only one.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.410
So first let's look
at the case k not

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.225
equal to 5, when the
matrix A was invertible.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.830
It's not hard to see what the
solution of the system then is.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.960
It's going to be-- let
me just write it down.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:05.690
So when k is not equal
to 5, this was nonzero.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:11.520
Therefore, x_3 needs to be 0.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.370
When x_3 is 0, we have
x_2 plus 2 times x_3.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:20.250
So x_2 plus 0 equals 1.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.050
Therefore x_2 is 1.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.380
And then we go back
to the first row.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:32.810
We have x_1 plus x_2
plus x_3 equals 2.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:38.880
So x_1 plus 1 plus 0 equals 2.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.810
So x_1 plus 1 equals 2.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.860
And therefore x_1 is 1.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.600
Good.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.580
Now what about k equal to 5?

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:58.480
Then we see that x_3
is a free variable.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.125
So the solution will
be [x 1,  x 2, x 3].

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:13.800
x_3 can be any number c.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.420
From the second row, we'll
get the value of x_2.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.190
It's 1 minus 2 times x_3.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.430
So 1 minus 2 times c.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:37.384
And x_1 is 2 minus
x_2 minus x_3.

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:39.480
So let me rewrite this.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.670
It's 2 minus x_2
is 1 minus-- aah,

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:53.051
chalk-- 2c, minus
c, 1 minus 2c, c.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.400
So we'll decompose
this vector here

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.615
into a component which
is independent of c

00:14:02.615 --> 00:14:06.440
and a component which
is a multiple of c.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.840
So this is 2 minus 1.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:20.790
It should be [1, 1, 0]
plus c times--

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:25.830
we'll have two c minus
c, c, so c times 1.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.692
Here we'll have minus
2c so negative 2.

00:14:29.692 --> 00:14:33.290
And here we'll have 1.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:38.470
And thus we get the particular
solution for the system

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:43.160
and the special
solution for the system.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.420
We're kind of done here.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.770
If you're at an exam,
you should immediately

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.100
start the next problem.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.530
Good luck, and
Ill see you later.
