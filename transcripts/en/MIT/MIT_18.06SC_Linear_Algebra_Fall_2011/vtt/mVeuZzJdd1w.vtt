00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.540
PROFESSOR: Hi guys.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.700
Today, we are going
to play around

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.040
with the basics of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.940
We're going to do the
following problem,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.450
we're given this
invertible matrix A,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.350
and we'll find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:33.630
not of A, but of A squared and
A inverse minus the identity.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.250
So, this problem might seem
daunting at first, squaring a 3

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.690
by 3 matrix, or taking an
inverse of a 3 by 3 matrix

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.880
is a fairly computationally
intensive task,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.530
but if you've seen
Professor Strang's lecture

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.540
on eigenvalues and
eigenvectors you

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.910
shouldn't be all too worried.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.440
So I'll give you a
few moments to think

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.650
of your own line of attack
and then you'll see mine.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:19.160
Hi again, OK, so the observation
that makes our life really easy

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.480
is the following one.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.170
So say v is an eigenvector with
associated eigenvalue lambda

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:39.070
to the matrix A. Then, if we
hit v with A squared, well,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.621
this we can write it as A
times A*v, but A*v is lambda*v,

00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:46.120
right?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.150
So we have A*lambda*v.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.965
Lambda is a scalar, so we
can move it in front and get

00:01:55.965 --> 00:02:03.670
lambda*A*v, and lambda*A*v is,
when we plug in A*v, lambda*v,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.235
is just lambda squared v. So,
what we've find out is that

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:14.370
if v is an eigenvector for A
then it's also an eigenvector

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.450
for A squared.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.840
Just that the eigenvalue
is the eigenvalue squared.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.070
Similarly, if we hit A inverse--
if you hit v with A inverse.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:36.760
So in this case we can
write v as A*v over lambda,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.150
given that of course,
lambda is non-zero.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.870
But the eigenvalues of
an invertible matrix

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.065
are always non-zero,
which is an exercise

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:52.560
you should do yourselves.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.210
So if we just,
then, take out the A

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.830
and combine it with A
inverse, this is the identity,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.210
and so we get 1
over lambda v. So v

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.020
is also an eigenvector
for a inverse,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.060
with eigenvalue the
reciprocal of lambda.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.350
OK, and from here, of course,
A inverse minus the identity

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:38.640
is lambda inverse minus
1 v, so the eigenvalue

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.920
of A inverse minus the identity
is 1 over lambda minus 1.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.120
OK, so, what we've
figured out is:

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.340
we just need to find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.350
of A and then we have a way of
finding what the eigenvalues

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.740
and eigenvectors of A
squared and A inverse

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.290
minus the identity will be.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.570
OK so, how do we
find the eigenvalues?

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.089
Well, what does
it mean for lambda

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.180
to be an eigenvalue of A?

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.355
It means that the matrix A
minus lambda the identity

00:04:22.355 --> 00:04:28.500
is singular, which is
precisely the case when

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.220
its determinant is 0, OK?

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:49.760
So we need to solve
the following equation:

00:04:49.760 --> 00:05:06.230
1 minus lambda, 2, 3; 0, 1
minus lambda, -2; and 0, 1,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.420
4 minus lambda.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:17.050
OK, it's fairly obvious
which column we should

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.190
use to expand this determinant.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.490
We should use the first
column, because we

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.800
have only one non-zero
entry, and so this

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:36.000
is equal to 1 minus lambda
times the determinant of the two

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.050
by two matrix 1 minus
lambda, -2; 1, 4

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.090
minus lambda, which is, I'm
going to do the computation up

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.590
here.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:08.260
1 minus lambda, lambda
squared minus 5 lambda plus 6.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.580
Which is a fairly
familiar quadratic,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.140
and we can write it as the
product of linear factors,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.230
as lambda minus 2,
lambda minus three.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:33.000
So the three eigenvalues
of A are 1, 2, and 3.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.990
OK so, first half of
our problem is done,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.830
now we just need to find what
the eigenvectors associated

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.740
with each of these
eigenvalues are.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.690
How we do that?

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.562
Well, let's see.

00:06:51.562 --> 00:06:54.960
Let's figure out what the
eigenvector associated

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.380
with lambda equals 1 is.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.610
So, we know that the
eigenvector needs

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.990
to be in the null
space of A minus lambda

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:13.270
the identity, so A
minus the identity, v,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:37.740
so-- write this out-- it's,
0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0, -2, 0, 1.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.130
And we see that the
first column is 0,

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:52.630
so the first variable
will be our free variable

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.840
if we want to solve this
linear system of equations.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.970
And you can just set
it to 1 and it's not

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:09.950
hard to see that the other
two entries should be 0.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.930
So we can do the same procedure
with the other two eigenvalues

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:24.540
and we'll get an eigenvector
for each eigenvalue.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.280
And in the end--
let me go back here.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:36.010
So I'm going to put our
results in a little table.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:46.830
So A squared, inverse minus
the identity, so the first row

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.560
will be eigenvalues.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.800
So it's going to be: if
lambda is an eigenvalue for A,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.150
then we saw that
lambda squared will

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:08.250
be the eigenvalue for A squared
and lambda inverse minus 1

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.940
will be the eigenvalue for A
inverse minus the identity.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:19.630
And the eigenvectors
will be the same.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.483
OK, we're done.
