00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.650
Okay.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.450
This lecture is mostly about
the idea of similar matrixes.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.520
I'm going to tell you what
that word similar means

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.990
and in what way two
matrixes are called similar.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.870
But before I do that,
I have a little more

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.310
to say about positive
definite matrixes.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.880
You can tell this is a subject I
think is really important and I

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.170
told you what positive
definite meant --

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.430
it means that this --

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.490
this expression, this
quadratic form, x transpose I

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.010
x is always positive.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.710
But the direct way to test
it was with eigenvalues

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.940
or pivots or determinants.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.730
So I -- we know what it
means, we know how to test it,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.820
but I didn't really say where
positive definite matrixes come

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.140
from.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.470
And so one thing I want to say
is that they come from least

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.780
squares in -- and all sorts of
physical problems start with

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.520
a rectangular matrix -- well,
you remember in least squares

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.810
the crucial combination
was A transpose A.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.970
So I want to show that that's
a positive definite matrix.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.727
Can -- so I --

00:01:28.727 --> 00:01:31.060
I'm going to speak a little
more about positive definite

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.730
matrixes, just recapping --

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.400
so let me ask a question.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.910
It may be on the homework.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.330
Suppose a matrix A
is positive definite.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.360
I mean by that it's all --

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.100
I'm assuming it's symmetric.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.760
That's always built
into the definition.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.440
So we have a symmetric
positive definite matrix.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.610
What about its inverse?

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.180
Is the inverse of a symmetric
positive definite matrix also

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.310
symmetric positive definite?

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.789
So you quickly think,
okay, what do I

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.240
know about the pivots
of the inverse matrix?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.390
Not much.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.620
What do I know about
the eigenvalues

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.540
of the inverse matrix?

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.480
Everything, right?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.310
The eigenvalues
of the inverse are

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.290
one over the eigenvalues
of the matrix.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.680
So if my matrix starts
out positive definite,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.490
then right away I know that its
inverse is positive definite,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.440
because those positive
eigenvalues --

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.560
then one over the
eigenvalue is also positive.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.820
What if I know that A -- a
matrix A and a matrix B are

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.280
both positive definite?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.780
But let me ask you this.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:04.140
Suppose if A and B are positive
definite, what about --

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.940
what about A plus B?

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.600
In some way, you hope
that that would be true.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.730
It's -- positive definite for a
matrix is kind of like positive

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.540
for a real number.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.300
But we don't know the
eigenvalues of A plus B.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.860
We don't know the
pivots of A plus B.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.870
So we just, like, have to go
down this list of, all right,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.130
which approach to
positive definite

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.050
can we get a handle on?

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.570
And this is a good one.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.670
This is a good one.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.190
Can we -- how would
we decide that --

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.610
if A was like this and
if B was like this,

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.410
then we would look at
x transpose A plus B x.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.280
I'm sure this is
in the homework.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.320
Now -- so we have x transpose
A x bigger than zero,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.940
x transpose B x positive
for all -- for all x,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.180
so now I ask you about this

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.090
guy.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.800
And of course, you
just add that and that

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.940
and we get what we want.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.320
If A and B are positive
definites, so is A plus B.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.810
So that's what I've shown.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.910
So is A plus B.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.310
Just -- be sort of ready for
all the approaches through

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.260
eigenvalues and through
this expression.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.500
And now, finally, one more
thought about positive definite

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.020
is this combination that
came up in least squares.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.260
Can I do that?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.290
So now -- now suppose A
is rectangular, m by n.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.380
I -- so I'm sorry that
I've used the same letter A

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.730
for the positive definite
matrixes in the eigenvalue

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.660
chapter that I used way back
in earlier chapters when

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.620
the matrix was rectangular.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.750
Now, that matrix --
a rectangular matrix,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.569
no way its positive definite.

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:15.360
It's not symmetric.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.450
It's not even square in general.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.540
But you remember that the key
for these rectangular ones

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.147
was A transpose A.

00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:28.730
That's square.

00:05:34.922 --> 00:05:35.630
That's symmetric.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.310
Those are things we knew --

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.890
we knew back when
we met this thing

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.020
in the least square stuff,
in the projection stuff.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.340
But now we know
something more --

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.450
we can ask a more important
question, a deeper question --

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.920
is it positive definite?

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.770
And we sort of hope so.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.730
Like, we -- we might --

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.200
in analogy with
numbers, this is like --

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.360
sort of like the square of a
number, and that's positive.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.930
So now I want to ask
the matrix question.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.350
Is A transpose A
positive definite?

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.740
Okay, now it's -- so again,
it's a rectangular A that

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.790
I'm starting with, but it's
the combination A transpose A

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.150
that's the square, symmetric
and hopefully positive definite

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.780
matrix.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.700
So how -- how do I see that
it is positive definite,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.750
or at least positive
semi-definite?

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.440
You'll see that.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.280
Well, I don't know the
eigenvalues of this product.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.250
I don't want to work
with the pivots.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.060
The right thing -- the right
quantity to look at is this,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.800
x transpose Ax --

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.450
A -- x transpose times
my matrix times x.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.280
I'd like to see
that this thing --

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.450
that that expression
is always positive.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.310
I'm not doing it with numbers,
I'm doing it with symbols.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.890
Do you see -- how do I see
that that expression comes out

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.620
positive?

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.260
I'm taking a rectangular
matrix A and an A transpose --

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.270
that gives me something
square symmetric,

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.030
but now I want to see
that if I multiply --

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.970
that if I do this --

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.140
I form this quadratic
expression that I

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.160
get this positive thing that
goes upwards when I graph it.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.210
How do I see that
that's positive,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.860
or absolutely it
isn't negative anyway?

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.990
We'll have to, like, spend
a minute on the question

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.620
could it be zero, but
it can't be negative.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.310
Why can this never be negative?

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.590
The argument is --

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:08.930
like the one key idea in so
many steps in linear algebra --

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.960
put those parentheses
in a good way.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.560
Put the parentheses around
Ax and what's the first part?

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.280
What's this x
transpose A transpose?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.540
That is Ax transpose.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.810
So what do we have?

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.650
We have the length
squared of Ax.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.909
We have -- that's the column
vector Ax that's the row vector

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:48.380
Ax, its length squared,
certainly greater than

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.310
or possibly equal to zero.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.860
So we have to deal with
this little possibility.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.070
Could it be equal?

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.970
Well, when could the
length squared be zero?

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.320
Only if the vector
is zero, right?

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.340
That's the only vector that
has length squared zero.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.080
So we have -- we
would like to --

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.230
I would like to get that
possibility out of there.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.920
So I want to have Ax
never -- never be zero,

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.340
except of course
for the zero vector.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.280
How do I assure that
Ax is never zero?

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.650
The -- in other words, how do I
show that there's no null space

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.370
of A?

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:33.420
The rank should be --

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:39.830
so now remember -- what's
the rank when there's no null

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.600
space?

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.680
By no null space,
you know what I mean.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.370
Only the zero vector
in the null space.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:52.850
So if I have a -- if I
have an 11 by 5 matrix --

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:59.230
so it's got 11 rows, 5 columns,
when is there no null space?

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:04.380
So the columns should be
independent -- what's the rank?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.810
n 5 -- rank n.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:12.170
Independent columns,
when -- so if I --

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.830
then I conclude yes,
positive definite.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.020
And this was the assumption
-- then A transpose A is

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.210
invertible --

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.330
the least squares
equations all work fine.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:33.870
And more than that -- the matrix
is even positive definite.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.150
And I just to say one comment
about numerical things,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.770
with a positive definite
matrix, you never

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.010
have to do row exchanges.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:50.230
You never run into unsuitably
small numbers or zeroes

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.560
in the pivot position.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.960
They're the right -- they're the
great matrixes to compute with,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.250
and they're the great
matrixes to study.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:05.900
So that's -- I wanted to take
this first ten minutes of grab

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:12.150
the first ten minutes away from
similar matrixes and continue

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.710
a -- this much more
with positive definite.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.270
I'm really at this
point, now, coming close

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:24.300
to the end of the heart
of linear algebra.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.160
The positive definiteness
brought everything together.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.920
Similar matrixes, which is
coming the rest of this hour

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:38.400
is a key topic, and
please come on Monday.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.690
Monday is about what's called
the SVD, singular values.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:49.340
It's the -- has become
a central fact in --

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.530
a central part of
linear algebra.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.940
I mean, you can come
after Monday also, but --

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:04.800
Monday is, -- that singular
value thing has made it

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.990
into this course.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.870
Ten years ago, five years
ago it wasn't in the course,

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.640
now it has to be.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.490
Okay.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:16.560
So can I begin today's
lecture proper with this idea

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.610
of similar matrixes.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.220
This is what similar
matrixes mean.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.680
So here -- let's start again.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.720
I'll write it again.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.690
So A and B are similar.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:33.550
A and B are -- now I'm
-- these matrixes --

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.720
I'm no longer talking about
symmetric matrixes, in --

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.750
at least no longer expecting
symmetric matrixes.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.960
I'm talking about two
square matrixes n by n.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.790
A and B, they're
n by n matrixes.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.110
And I'm introducing
this word similar.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.880
So I'm going to say
what does it mean?

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:08.520
It means that they're
connected in the way --

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.920
well, in the way I've written
here, so let me rewrite it.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:24.260
That means that for some matrix
M, which has to be invertible,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.140
because you'll see that --

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.680
this one matrix is --

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.980
take the other matrix,
multiply on the right

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:39.700
by M and on the
left by M inverse.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.810
So the question is,
why that combination?

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.890
But part of the answer
you know already.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:52.070
You remember -- we've done this
-- we've taken a matrix A --

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:58.620
so let's do an
example of similar.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:06.340
Suppose A -- the matrix A
-- suppose it has a full set

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.090
of eigenvectors.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.910
They go in this
eigenvector matrix S.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.220
Then what was the main
point of the whole --

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.960
the main calculation of the
whole chapter was -- is --

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.380
use that eigenvector
matrix S and its inverse

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:33.720
comes over there to produce the
nicest possible matrix lambda.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.160
Nicest possible
because it's diagonal.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:47.615
So in our new language, this is
saying A is similar to lambda.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.440
A is similar to lambda,
because there is a matrix,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.970
and this particular --

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.140
there is an M and
this particular M

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:05.220
is this important guy,
this eigenvector matrix.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:13.040
But if I take a different matrix
M and I look at M inverse A M,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.350
the result won't
come out diagonal,

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:21.140
but it will come out a
matrix B that's similar to A.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.870
Do you see that I'm --
what I'm doing is, like --

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.700
I'm putting these
matrixes into families.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:34.060
All the matrixes in one -- in
the family are similar to each

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.070
other.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.080
They're all -- each one in this
family is connected to each

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.550
other one by some
matrix M and the --

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:47.660
like the outstanding member of
the family is the diagonal guy.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.700
I mean, that's the
simplest, neatest matrix

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.680
in this family of all the
matrixes that are similar to A,

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.530
the best one is lambda.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.720
But there are lots of others,
because I can take different --

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.870
instead of S, I can
take any old matrix M,

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.440
any old invertible
matrix and -- and do it.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.020
I'd better do an example.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:10.520
Okay.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:16.901
Suppose I take A as the
matrix two one one two.

00:16:16.901 --> 00:16:17.400
Okay.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.470
Do you know the eigenvalue
matrix for that?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.630
The eigenvalues of
that matrix are --

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.040
well, three and one.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.430
So that -- and the eigenvectors
would be easy to find.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.780
So this matrix is
similar to this one.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.080
But my point is --

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:49.410
but also, I can also take
my matrix, two one one two,

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.090
I could multiply it by
-- let's see, what --

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.580
I'm just going to cook
up a matrix M here.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:00.350
I'm -- I'll -- let me just
invent -- one four one zero.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.710
And over here I'll
put M inverse,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.839
and because I happened
to make that triangular,

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:09.940
I know that its
inverse is that, right?

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.819
So there's M inverse A M, that's
going to produce some matrix --

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:17.200
oh, well, I've got to
do the multiplication,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.380
so hang on a second, let --

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.880
I'll just copy that
one minus four zero one

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:33.930
and multiply these guys so I'm
getting two nine one and six,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.010
I think.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.680
Can you check it as I go,
because you -- see I'm just --

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.850
so that's two minus four,
I'm getting a minus two nine

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.550
minus 24 is a minus 15, my
God, how did I get this?

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.935
And that's probably one and six.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.810
So there's my matrix B.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.180
And there's my matrix
lambda, there's my matrix A

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.715
and my point is these
are all similar matrixes.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.880
They all have
something in common,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.130
besides being just two by two.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:17.190
They have something in common.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.310
And that's -- and what is it?

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:26.540
What's the point about two
matrixes that are built out

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.840
of --

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.440
the B is built out
of M inverse A M.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.840
What is it that A
and B have in common?

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.127
That's the main -- now I'm
telling you the main fact about

00:18:38.127 --> 00:18:38.835
similar matrixes.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.910
They have the same eigenvalues.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.550
This is -- this chapter
is about eigenvalues,

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:51.350
and that's why we're interested
in this family of matrixes that

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.140
have the same eigenvalues.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.640
What are the eigenvalues
in this example?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.570
Lambda.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.070
The eigenvalues of
that I could compute.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:06.370
The eigenvalues of that I
can compute really fast.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:10.330
So the eigenvalues
are three and one --

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.940
for this for sure.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.520
Now did we -- do you see why the
eigenvalues are three and one

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.930
for that one?

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.870
If I tell you the eigenvalues
are three and one, you prick --

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:26.190
quickly process the trace,
which is -- and four --

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.510
agrees with four and you
process the determinant,

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.990
three times one --

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.930
the determinant is three
and you say yes, it's right.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.540
Now I'm hoping that the
eigenvalues of this thing

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.770
are three and one.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.450
May I process the trace and
the determinant for that one?

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.830
What's the trace here?

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.510
The trace of this matrix
is four minus two and six,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.320
and that's what it should be.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.210
What's the determinant minus
twelve plus fifteen is three.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.390
The determinant is three.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.190
The eigenvalues of that
matrix are also three and one.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.460
And you see I created
this matrix just like --

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.600
I just took any M, like,
one that popped into my head

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.030
and computed M inverse
A M, got that matrix,

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:22.980
it didn't look anything
special but it's --

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.290
like A itself, it has those
eigenvalues three and one.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:31.370
So that's the main fact
and let me write it down.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:45.290
Similar matrixes have
the same eigenvalues.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:51.590
So I'll just put that
as an important point.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.890
And think why.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.430
Why is that?

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:01.120
So that's what that
family of matrixes is.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.940
The matrixes that
are similar to this A

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.610
here are all the matrixes with
eigenvalues three and one.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.450
Every matrix with
eigenvalues three and one,

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.870
there's some M that
connects this guy

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.810
to the one you think of.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.840
And then of course, the most
special guy in the whole family

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.690
is the diagonal one with
eigenvalues three and one

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.630
sitting there on the diagonal.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.590
But also, I could find --

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:34.130
I mean, tell me just a couple
more members of the family.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:38.070
Another -- tell me another
matrix that has eigenvalues

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.680
three and one.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.740
Well, let's see, I -- oh,
I'll just make it triangular.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.180
That's in the family.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.840
There is some M that --
that connects to this one.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.310
And -- and also this.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.630
There's some matrix M -- so that
M inverse A M comes out to be

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:03.180
that.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.290
There's a whole family here.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:11.710
And they all share
the same eigenvalues.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.320
So why is that?

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:14.930
Okay.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:21.880
I'm going to start -- the only
possibility is to start with Ax

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.180
equal lambda x.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.790
Okay, so suppose A has
the eigenvalue lambda.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.880
Now I want to get B into
the picture here somehow.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.930
You remember B is M inverse A M.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.910
Let's just remember
that over here.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:44.390
B is M inverse A M.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.030
And I want to see
its eigenvalues.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.520
How I going to get M inverse
A M into this equation?

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.830
Let me just sort of do it.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:59.970
I'll put an M times an M
inverse in there, right?

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.870
That was --

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.100
I haven't changed
the left-hand side,

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.420
so I better not change
the right-hand side.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.850
So everybody's okay so far,
I just put in there -- see,

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.240
I want to get a -- so now
I'll multiply on the left by M

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.870
inverse --

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.200
I have to do the
same to this side

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.880
and that number
lambda's just a number,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.380
so it factors out in the front.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:32.370
So what I have here
is this was safe.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.760
I did the same
thing to both sides.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.090
And now I've got B.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.270
There's B.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:42.210
That's B times this
vector M inverse

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:47.670
x is equal to lambda times
this vector M inverse x.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.920
So what have I learned?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.980
I've learned that
B times some vector

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.600
is lambda times that vector.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.910
I've learned that lambda
is an eigenvalue of B also.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.370
So this is -- if
-- so this is --

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:05.600
if lambda's an eigenvalue of
A, then I can write it this way

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.110
and I discover that
lambda's an eigenvalue of B.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.240
That's the end of the proof.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.670
The eigenvector
didn't stay the same.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.410
Of course I don't expect the
eigenvectors to stay the same.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.240
If all the eigenvalues are the
same and all the eigenvectors

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.120
are the same, then probably
the matrix is the same.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.260
Here the eigenvector changes,
so the eigenvector --

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:38.370
so the point is then
the eigenvector of B --

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:44.880
of B is M inverse times
the eigenvector of A.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.380
Okay.

00:24:51.989 --> 00:24:53.280
That's all that this says here.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.940
The eigenvector of A was
X, and so the M inverse --

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.930
similar matrixes, then
have the same eigenvalues

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.070
and their eigenvectors
are just moved around.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.790
Of course, that's what we --
that's what happened way back

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.580
--

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:15.070
and the most important similar
matrixes are to diagonalize.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.140
So what was the point
when we diagonalized?

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.830
The eigenvalues stayed
the same, of course.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.380
Three and one.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.150
What about the eigenvectors?

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:29.190
The eigenvectors were whatever
they were for the matrix A,

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.340
but then what were
the eigenvectors

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.630
for the diagonal matrix?

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.370
They're just -- what are the
eigenvectors of a diagonal

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.900
matrix?

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.130
They're just one
zero and zero one.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.290
So this step made the
eigenvectors nice,

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:49.750
didn't change the
eigenvalues, and every time we

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.580
don't change the eigenvalues.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.021
Same eigenvalues.

00:25:53.021 --> 00:25:53.520
Okay.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:01.100
Now -- so I've got all
these matrixes in --

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:07.380
I've got this family of matrixes
with eigenvalues three and one.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.610
Fine.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.270
That's a nice family.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:15.520
It's nice because those two
eigenvalues are different.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.280
I now have to --

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.460
to get into that --

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:25.320
the -- into the less happy
possibility that the two

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.960
eigenvalues could be the

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.680
same.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.940
And then it's a little
trickier, because you remember

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.360
when two eigenvalues
are the same,

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.400
what's the bad possibility?

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.030
That there might
not be enough --

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.730
a full set of eigenvectors
and we might not be able

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.080
to diagonalize.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.550
So I need to discuss
the bad case.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.070
So the bad -- can
I just say bad?

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:03.707
If lambda one equals
lambda two, then the matrix

00:27:03.707 --> 00:27:04.873
might not be diagonalizable.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.010
Suppose lambda one equals
lambda two equals four,

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:11.510
say.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:20.990
Now if I look at the family of
matrixes with eigenvalues four

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:25.840
and four, well, one
possibility occurs to me.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:38.120
One family with eigenvalues four
and four has this matrix in it,

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.420
four times the identity.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:46.400
Then another -- but now I want
to ask also about the matrix

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.930
four four one zero.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.290
And my point -- here's
the whole point of this --

00:27:55.290 --> 00:28:00.107
of this bad stuff, is that this
guy is not in the same family

00:28:00.107 --> 00:28:00.690
with that one.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:05.310
The family of a -- of matrixes
that have eigenvalues four

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.760
and four is two families.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:16.081
There's this total loner
here who's in a family off --

00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:16.580
right?

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.890
Just by himself.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.070
And all the others
are in with this guy.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:35.090
So the big family
includes this one.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:39.720
And it includes a whole lot
of other matrixes, all --

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.310
in fact, in this two by two
case, it -- you see where --

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:48.290
what do I mean -- so what I
using, this word family --

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.980
in a family, I mean
they're similar.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.570
So my point is that the only
matrix that's similar to this

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.840
is itself.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.240
The only matrix that's similar
to four times the identity

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.650
is four times the identity.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.320
It's off by itself.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.360
Why is that?

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.750
The -- if this is my matrix,
four times the identity,

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:17.150
and I take it, I multiply on
the right by any matrix M,

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:22.430
I multiply on the left by
M inverse, what do I get?

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:28.720
This is any M, but
what's the result?

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.930
Well, factoring
out a four, that's

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.710
just the identity
matrix in there.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.250
So then the M inverse
cancels the M,

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.420
so I've just got this
matrix back again.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.310
So whatever the M
is, I'm not getting

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.610
any more members of the family.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:57.680
So this is one small family,
because it only has one person.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.610
One matrix, excuse me.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.200
I think of these matrixes
as people by this point,

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.110
in eighteen oh six.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.990
Okay, the other family
includes all the rest --

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:13.930
all other matrixes that have
eigenvalues four and four.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:20.290
This is somehow the
best one in that family.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.870
See, I can't make it diagonal.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.580
If I -- if it's
diagonal, it's this one.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.020
It's in its own, by itself.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.250
So I have to think, okay,
what's the nearest I

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.480
can get to diagonal?

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.380
But it will not
be diagonalizable.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.670
That -- do you know that that
matrix is not diagonalizable?

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.050
Of course, because if
it was diagonalizable,

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:46.150
it would be similar to
that, which it isn't.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.540
The eigenvalues of
this are four and four,

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:52.960
but what's the catch
with that matrix?

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.430
It's only got one eigenvector.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.560
That's a
non-diagonalizable matrix.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.340
Only one eigenvector.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:06.700
And somehow, if I made that
one into a ten or to a million,

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.540
I could find an M, it's in
the family, it's similar.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.570
But the best -- so the best
guy in this family is this one.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:19.810
And this is called the Jordan --

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:24.800
so this guy Jordan picked
out -- so he, like, studied,

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.250
these families of
matrixes, and each family,

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:34.740
he picked out the nicest,
most diagonal one.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.960
But not completely diagonal,
because there's nobody --

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.430
there isn't a diagonal
matrix in this family,

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:44.780
so there's a one up
there in the Jordan form.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.010
Okay.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:50.699
I think we've got to see some
more matrixes in that family.

00:31:50.699 --> 00:31:52.990
So, all right, let me --
let's just think of some other

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:58.570
matrixes whose eigenvalues are
four and four but they're not

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.220
four times the identity.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.130
So -- and I believe that --

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:06.660
that this -- that all the
examples we pick up will be

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:13.320
similar to each other
and -- do you see why --

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.340
in this topic of
similar matrixes,

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.820
the climax is the Jordan form.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.910
So it says that every matrix --

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:29.310
I'll write down what the Jordan
form -- what Jordan discovered.

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:35.030
He found the best looking
matrix in each family.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:41.080
And that's -- then we've got --
then we've covered all matrixes

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.540
including the
non-diagonalizable one.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.060
That -- that's the
point, that in some way,

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.430
Jordan completed the
diagonalization by coming

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.890
as near as he could,
which is his Jordan form.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.340
And therefore, if you want
to cover all matrixes,

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.720
you've got to get
him in the picture.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.030
It used to be -- when
I took eighteen oh six,

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:07.530
that was the climax of the
course, this Jordan form stuff.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:11.490
I think it's not the climax
of linear algebra anymore,

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:15.930
because --

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:20.590
it's not easy to
find this Jordan form

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:25.340
for a general matrix, because
it depends on these eigenvalues

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.900
being exactly the same.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.620
You'd have to know exactly
the eigenvalues and it --

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:35.270
and you'd have to know exactly
the rank and the slightest

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:39.180
change in numbers will
change those eigenvalues,

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.320
change the rank and therefore
the whole thing is numerically

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.970
not an -- a good thing.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:51.180
But for algebra,
it's the right thing

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.660
to understand this family.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.600
So just tell me another matrix
-- a few more matrixes --

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:03.380
so more members of the family.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:11.380
Let me put down again
what the best one is.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.400
Okay.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.409
All right.

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:14.690
Some more matrixes.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.659
Let's see, what I looking for?

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:22.750
I'm looking for matrixes
whose trace is what?

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.190
So if I'm looking for more
matrixes in the family,

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:28.290
they'll all have the same
eigenvalues, four and four.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.449
So their trace will be eight.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:34.120
So why don't I just take,
like, five and three --

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:40.540
I've got the trace right, now
the determinant should be what?

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.469
Sixteen.

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:45.370
So I just fix this up -- shall I
put maybe a one and a minus one

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:46.771
there?

00:34:46.771 --> 00:34:47.270
Okay.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:52.139
There's a matrix with
eigenvalues four and four,

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:56.719
because the trace is eight and
the determinant is sixteen.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:00.670
And I don't think
it's diagonalizable.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.800
Do you know why it's
not diagonalizable?

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.470
Because if it was
diagonalizable,

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.505
the diagonal form
would have to be this.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.980
But I can't get to that
form, because whatever

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.880
I do with any M inverse and
M I stay with that form.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.320
I could never get
-- connect those.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.470
So I can put down more
members -- here --

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:23.810
here's another easy one.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.960
I could put the four and
the four and a seventeen

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.580
down there.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.080
All these matrixes are similar.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.350
If I'm -- I could find an M
that would show that that one is

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.350
similar to that one.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:40.420
And in -- you can see the
general picture is I can take

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:45.710
any a and any 8-a here and
any -- oh, I don't know,

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.200
whatever you put it'd be
-- anyway, you can see.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:54.890
I can fill this in, fill this in
to make the trace equal eight,

00:35:54.890 --> 00:36:01.160
the determinant equal 16, I
get all that family of matrixes

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.635
and they're all similar.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.250
So we see what eigenvalues do.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:13.020
They're all similar and they
all have only one eigenvector.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.610
So I -- if I'm -- if
you were going to --

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.780
allow me to add to this picture,
they have the same lambdas

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.799
and they also have the
same number of independent

00:36:25.799 --> 00:36:26.340
eigenvectors.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.910
Because if I get an eigenvector
for x I get one for -- for A,

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:36.260
I get one for B also.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:43.170
So -- and same number
of eigenvectors.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.740
But even more than that --

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.048
even more than that --

00:36:47.048 --> 00:36:49.173
I mean, it's not enough
just to count eigenvectors.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.450
Yes, let me give you an
example why it's not even

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:58.460
enough to count eigenvectors.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.170
So another example.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:04.210
So here are some matrixes --

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:07.600
oh, let me make
them four by four --

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.260
okay, here -- here's a matrix.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.570
I mean, like if you
want nightmares,

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.480
think about matrixes like these.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:21.670
Uh, so a one off the diagonal
-- say a one there, how many --

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.600
what are the eigenvalues
of that matrix?

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.040
Oh, I mean --

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.480
okay.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.550
What are the eigenvalues
of that matrix?

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.910
Please.

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.160
Four 0s, right?

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:44.930
So we're really getting
bad matrixes now.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.080
So I mean, this is, like --

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:53.190
Jordan was a good guy, but he
had to think about matrixes

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:58.590
that all -- that had, like -- an
eigenvalue repeated four times.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.140
How many eigenvectors
does that matrix have?

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:07.980
Well, I'm --
eigenvectors will be --

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.710
since the eigenvalue is
zero, eigenvectors will be

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:13.350
in the null space, right?

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:17.870
I'm -- eigenvectors have
got to be A x equal zero x.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.340
So what's the dimension
of the null space?

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.110
Two.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.920
Somebody said two.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.680
And that's right.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.690
How -- why?

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:29.390
Because you ask what's
the rank of that matrix,

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:32.410
the rank is obviously two.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:35.050
The number of
independent rows is two,

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.880
the number of independent
columns is two,

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.430
the rank is two so the null --
the dimension of the null space

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:45.950
is four minus two, so
it's got two eigenvectors.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.500
Two eigenvectors.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.441
Two independent eigenvectors.

00:38:49.441 --> 00:38:49.940
All right.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:55.260
The dimension of the
null space is two.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:03.905
Now, suppose I change
this zero to a seven.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.840
The eigenvalues are all still
zero, how -- what about --

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.756
how many eigenvectors?

00:39:15.449 --> 00:39:17.990
What's the dimension of the --
what's the rank of this matrix

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.160
now?

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.890
Still two, right?

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.820
So it's okay.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:26.370
And actually, this would
be similar to the one that

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.800
had a zero in there.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.740
But it's not as beautiful,
Jordan picked this one.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.850
He picked -- he put ones --

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:39.000
we have a one on the -- above
the diagonal for every missing

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.330
eigenvector, and here we're
missing two because we've got

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:45.550
two, so we've got two
eigenvectors and two are

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:53.860
missing, because it's
a four by four matrix.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.910
Okay, now -- but I was going to
give you this second example.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:05.145
0 1 0 0, let me
just move the one.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.500
Oop, not there.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.710
Off the diagonal and
zero zero zero zero zero.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.210
Okay.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.570
So now tell me
about this matrix.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:27.460
Its eigenvalues are
four zeroes again.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.910
Its rank is two again.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:36.670
So it has two eigenvectors
and two missing.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:40.890
But the darn thing is
not similar to that one.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:44.430
A -- a count of eigenvectors
looks like these could be

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.130
similar, but they're not.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:52.720
Jordan -- see, this is like --
a little three by three block

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.880
and a little one by one block.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.770
And this one is like a
two by two block and a two

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:03.080
by two block, and those blocks
are called Jordan blocks.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.770
So let me say what
is a Jordan block?

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:17.400
J block number I has --

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.660
so a Jordan block has a repeated
eigenvalue, lambda I, lambda I

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.530
on the diagonal.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.905
Zeroes below and ones above.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.160
So there's a block
with this guy repeated,

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.070
but it only has one eigenvector.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.900
So a Jordan block has
one eigenvector only.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:47.720
This one has one eigenvector,
this block has one eigenvector

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.580
and we get two.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.170
This block has one
eigenvector and that block has

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.980
one eigenvector and we get two.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:02.020
So -- but the blocks
are different sizes.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:05.540
And that -- it turns
out Jordan worked out --

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:14.190
then this is not similar,
not similar to this one.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.140
So the -- so I'm, like,
giving you the whole story --

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.780
well, not the whole story, but
the main themes of the story --

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.700
is here's Jordan's theorem.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:49.060
Every square matrix A is
similar to A Jordan matrix J.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.890
And what's a Jordan matrix J?

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:56.670
It's a matrix with
these blocks, block --

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:03.850
Jordan block number one, Jordan
block number two and so on.

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:07.950
And let's say Jordan
block number d.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.760
And those Jordan
blocks look like that,

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.760
so the eigenvalues are
sitting on the diagonal,

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.750
but we've got some of these
ones above the diagonal.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.010
We've got the number of --

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:27.530
so the number of blocks --

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:37.510
the number of blocks is
the number of eigenvectors,

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:42.510
because we get one
eigenvector per block.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:47.250
So what I'm -- so if I
summarize Jordan's idea --

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.570
start with any A.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:54.080
If its eigenvalues are
distinct, then what's it similar

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:54.700
to?

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.430
This is the good case.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:00.710
if I start with a matrix A and
it has different eigenvalues --

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.450
it's n eigenvalues, none
of them are repeated,

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:09.350
then that's a diagonal --
diagonalizable matrix --

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:13.990
the Jordan blocks is -- has --
the Jordan matrix is diagonal.

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:15.900
It's lambda.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.840
So the good case --

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:22.590
the good case, J is lambda.

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.400
All -- there are --

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:29.900
d=n.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.830
There are n eigenvectors, n
blocks, diagonal, everything

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:35.640
great.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:40.990
But Jordan covered
all cases by including

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:44.460
these cases of repeated
eigenvalues and missing

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.100
eigenvectors.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:47.810
Okay.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.640
That's a description of Jordan.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.030
That -- that's --

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.300
I haven't told you how
to compute this thing,

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.500
and it isn't easy.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.920
Whereas the good case is the --
the good case is what 18.06 is

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.660
about.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:07.040
The -- this case is what
18.06 was about 20 years ago.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:12.220
So you can see you probably
won't have on the final exam

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:18.540
the computation of a Jordan
matrix for some horrible thing

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.720
with four repeated eigenvalues.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:28.730
I'm not that crazy
about the Jordan form.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:34.950
But I'm very positive about
positive definite matrixes

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:38.880
and about the idea
that's coming Monday,

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.964
the singular value
decomposition.

00:45:40.964 --> 00:45:43.130
So I'll see you on Monday,
and have a great weekend.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:44.680
Bye.
