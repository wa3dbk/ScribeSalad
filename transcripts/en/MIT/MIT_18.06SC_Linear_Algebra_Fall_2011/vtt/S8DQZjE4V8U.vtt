NIKOLA KAMBUROV: Hi everyone.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.750
In this video, we're
going to explore briefly

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.270
the concept of a
vector subspace.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.450
This is the problem
we're going to do.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.040
We're given these four
different subsets of R^3,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.630
and we are asked to figure out
which of these is, in fact,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.020
a subspace.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.110
So I'll give you a few moments
to try to do this on your own,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.510
and then please come back to
see whether you were right.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.790
So hi again.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.330
So before we start,
let's briefly recall

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.500
what a vector subspace is.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.190
Well vector subspace, of
course, it's a subset.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.600
In this case, a subset of R^3.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.349
But it behaves like a
vector space itself,

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:09.590
meaning that if we take
linear combination of elements

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.920
in the subset, what we get is
still something in that subset.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.170
And in class, Professor
Strang showed you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.080
a few specific
examples of subspaces,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.010
which are related to matrices.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.090
One of them was the
null space of a matrix,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.980
all the vectors that
the matrix sends to 0,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.120
and the column space
of a matrix, which

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.300
is the span of the
column of a matrix.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.390
So let's see if we can
apply what we've learned

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.350
in lecture to our problem.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.360
Number one: we are given
a linear equation relation

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.600
between b_1, b_2, and b_3.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.886
Once we have something
linear-- this is a philosophy

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:04.260
that you'll learn
in this class--

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.470
we can always write this
as a matrix equation.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.890
So in particular, b_1 plus
b_2 minus b_3 equals 0,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.210
we can just write
it as the matrix 1,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:25.420
1, negative 1, times
[b 1, b 2,  b 3] equal to 0.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.290
So therefore, b_1,
b_2, and b_3 precisely

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.560
describe the null space
of 1, 1 negative 1.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.120
And thus, what we are
given in the first question

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.750
is a subspace.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.450
What about the second one?

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.740
Again, we are given the
relation between b_1, b_2, b_3.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.510
but it's not linear.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.050
b_3 is the product
of b_1 and b_2.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.420
So right, your guts
tell you that this

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.635
shouldn't be a vector space.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.550
But we need to prove why.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:14.200
Well, see that the vector [1, 1,
 1] is inside this subset,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.710
because the third entry is
the product-- 1 is the product

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.530
1 and 1.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.020
If the subset were
a subspace itself,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.600
then we would have 2,
2, and 2 in it as well.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.010
Right, because any multiple
of a vector in the subspace

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.620
is inside the subspace.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.730
But is [2, 2, 2] described
by this equation?

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.720
Well no, because
the third entry, 2,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.930
is not equal to 2 times 2.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.395
So the example in number
2 is not a subspace.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.770
Let's try 3.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.050
And first-- so we are given--
so the subset in question 3

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.120
is given as the linear span of
these two vectors, [1, 0, -1]

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.920
and [1, 0, 1].

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.800
Plus the vector [1, 0, 0].

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.160
So let's think about
this geometrically.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.450
We know that the linear span
of two linear independent

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.270
vectors-- and these
are obviously linearly

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.100
independent-- is a plane in R^3.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.140
So we have the plane,
and we add a vector

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.720
to the point on this plane.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.730
So what if the vector
were lying on the plane?

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.550
Well we're not going
to change the plane.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.270
We're still going to
remain in the plane.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.320
What I'm hinting at is
the following thing.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.450
That, in fact, [1, 0, 0] is a
linear combination of [1, 0,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.840
-1] and [1, 0, 1], and
it's fairly obvious

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.010
to see which linear combination
of these two vectors it is.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.625
It's 1/2 [1, 0, -1] plus
1/2 times [1, 0, 1].

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.050
So we can write the
whole relation here

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.020
in the following way.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:37.230
[b 1, b 2, b 3] is
[1, 0, 0], which

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:48.980
we can write this, plus c_1
[1,  0, -1], and c_2 [1 0, 1].

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.160
Let me continue this here.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.300
So b_1, b_2, and
b_3 is precisely

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:14.840
c_1 plus 1/2 of [1, 0, -1]
plus c_2 plus 1/2 of [1, 0, 1].

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.870
So indeed, the points
b_1, b_2, and b_3

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:29.280
are described by the linear
span [1, 0, -1] and [1, 0, 1].

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.680
So it is a vector
subspace itself.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.585
And finally, let's
look at number 4.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.410
So we have a similar situation.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.190
I mean, it's almost
the same situation.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.520
We again have the linear span
of precisely the same vectors

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.610
as in question 3.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.260
But this time we add the
vector [0, 1, 0] to them.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.880
Now, [0, 1, 0] is not in the
span of these two vectors.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.270
So the argument that we just
showed for 3 doesn't work.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.310
But what we know
about vector subspaces

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.820
is the following thing.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.190
I follows almost
trivially from the axioms

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.550
that 0 needs to be inside
the subset in order

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.450
for it to be a subspace.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.060
It's a necessary condition.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.720
Well is 0 inside this subset?

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:55.250
Meaning can we find coefficients
c_1 and c_2, plus [0, 1, 0]

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.300
to equal zero vector?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.430
And the answer is no.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.960
And why is this?

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.230
There's a very
easy way to see it.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:13.460
Well we just look at the
second entry of the vectors,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.360
and we see that any multiple--
so the linear span of these two

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.220
vectors will have as
its second entry 0.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.270
And when we add it to 1, we can
never get a zero entry here.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:33.870
So the subset in 4
is not a subspace.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:39.230
So I hope this was useful in
just getting an intuition which

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.380
subsets of R^3 are subspaces.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.550
I'll see you guys later.
