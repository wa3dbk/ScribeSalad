MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.500
Welcome.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.180
Today's problem is
about finding solutions

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.830
of this non-homogeneous linear
system: x minus 2y minus 2z

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.920
equals b_1, 2x minus
5y minus 4z equals b_2,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.179
and 4x minus 9y
minus 8z equals b_3.

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.970
And as you can see,
the system doesn't only

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.630
have numbers and
unknowns, it also

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.220
has parameters,
b_1, b_2, and b_3,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.670
and the solution will
depend on these parameters,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.390
but also the existence
of the solution

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.090
will depend on these parameters.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.570
And we're asked
to find a solution

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.280
and find when it exists,
depending on the values

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.640
of b_1, b_2, and b_3.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.130
So now you should pause the
video, solve the problem,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.306
and come back and compare
your solution with mine.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.420
And we're back.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.310
Let's try it.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.870
Let's start by solving this
system as though b_1, b_2,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.900
and b_3 were numbers.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:13.030
So we write the matrix of the
system, which is 1, minus 2,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:28.510
minus 2, b_1; and then 2,
minus 5, minus 4, b_2; and 4,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.430
minus 9 minus 8, b_3.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880
And we do elimination.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.340
So we multiply the
first row by minus 2

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.500
and add it to the second row.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.620
And we multiply it by minus 4
and add it to the third row.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:06.210
And we get 1, minus 2, minus 2,
b_1; 0, 4 minus 5 is minus 1,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.010
4 minus 4 is 0, and minus
2 times b_1 plus b_2.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:26.660
And here we get 0, 8 minus 9
is minus 1, and 8 minus 8 is 0.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.590
Finally, on the right-hand
side, minus 4*b_1 plus b_3.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.310
And you can already
see that something's

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.750
going to happen here.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.800
But let's do one more step.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:53.740
So eliminating further, we get
1, minus 2, minus 2, b_1; 0,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:03.200
minus 1, 0, minus
2*b_1 plus b_2.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.160
And in the last row we replace
it with the last row minus

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:18.410
the second row, and we get
0, 0, 0, minus 4*b_1 plus 2--

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:30.670
so minus minus 2*b_2 is minus
2*b_1 minus b_2 and plus b_3.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.720
I hope I did this right.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.720
So now let's think of
it as a system again.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.790
The last equation says 0 equals
this expression in b_1, b_2,

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.870
and b_3.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.450
So this is something
to note down.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:58.307
If minus 2*b_1 minus b_2 plus
b_3 is some number that's not

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:02.400
0, then the last equation is
going to say 0 equals nonzero.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.860
It's never going
to be satisfied,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.630
and the entire system is never
going to have a solution.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.030
So in this case, we
have no solutions.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:31.400
If this is equal to 0, so minus
2*b_1 minus b_2 plus b_3 is

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.880
equal to 0, then let's do one
more step on this matrix here.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.570
Let's turn this number into
1 by multiplying this row

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.060
by negative 1.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.160
And let's use it to eliminate
this number here as well.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.290
So in this case, we
get-- let me write it

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.070
from the last row,
which now becomes 0,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.950
0, 0, equals 0, which is fine.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:07.670
The second row becomes
0, 1, 0, 2*b_1 minus b_2.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.500
And the first one, to
get rid of this minus 2,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.960
we multiply this row by negative
2 and add it to the first one.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:27.580
We get 1, 0, negative 2, and
here we get b_1 plus 4*b_1

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.390
which is 5*b_1, minus 2*b_2.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.550
The reason why we did it was to
get the identity matrix here.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.890
And now let's solve this.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.110
These two columns, corresponding
to variables x and y,

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.610
have pivots in them.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.985
So these are the
pivot variables.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.100
This column here has no pivot
in it, so it's a free variable.

00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:06.050
And now we're going to
calculate the solutions,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.720
but by picking
particular values for z,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.180
and then calculating
the values for x and y.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.350
We have two kinds of solution.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.915
One kind is the
particular solution.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.390
So this one solves A*x equals b.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.920
There's only one of them.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.250
And we get it by setting the
free variable equal to 0.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.870
Setting the free
variable equal to 0,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:46.540
we get, well this is equal to 0.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.375
The second equation says
y equals this thing here,

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:55.870
so 2*b_1 minus b_2.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.500
And the first equation
says x minus 2 times 0

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.100
equals this expression here.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.320
So 5*b_1 minus 2*b_2.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.010
That's our particular solution.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.650
The next kind is the
special solution.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.470
So remember, those
solve A*x equals 0.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.370
There's as many of them as
there are free variables.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.430
In our case, there's only one.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.430
And we get it by setting all
free variables equal to 0,

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.450
except one equal to 1.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.620
And do it for every
free variable.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.900
So in our case there's
only one free variable

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.750
and we set z equal to 1.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.680
The solution that
we get in this case,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.280
and remember we're
solving Ax equals

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.105
0-- we don't care about the
right-hand side anymore-- so z

00:07:58.105 --> 00:07:59.420
is 1.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:06.180
This second equation
says y equals 0,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:12.540
and the first equation says
x minus 2 times 1 equals 0.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.220
In other words, x equals 2.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.200
So the special
solution is [2,  0, 1].

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.850
And now all solutions
are of the form

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:35.970
x equals the particular
solution plus any multiple

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.460
of the special solution.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.799
Let me recap.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.929
In case this particular
combination of parameters

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.150
is not 0, there's no solutions.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.010
In case this particular
combination of parameters

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.190
is equal to 0,
there are solutions,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.900
there are as many of them
as there are real numbers c,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.420
and they're all of this
form for these two vectors.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.130
And that's all I
wanted to say today.
