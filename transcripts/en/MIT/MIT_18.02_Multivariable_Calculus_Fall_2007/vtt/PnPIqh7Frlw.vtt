00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And, well let's see.
So, before we actually start

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
reviewing for the test,
I still have to tell you a few

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
small things because I promised
to say a few words about what's

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the difference,
or precisely,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
what's the difference between
curl being zero and a field

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
being a gradient field,
and why we have this assumption

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that our vector field had to be
defined everywhere for a field

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
with curl zero to actually be
conservative for our test for

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.000
gradient fields to be valid?
So -- More about validity of

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Green's theorem and things like
that.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So, we've seen the statement of
Green's theorem in two forms.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Both of them have to do with
comparing a line integral along

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
a closed curve to a double
integral over the region inside

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
enclosed by the curve.
So,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
one of them says the line
integral for the work done by a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
vector field along a closed
curve counterclockwise is equal

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to the double integral of a curl
of a field over the enclosed

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
region.
And, the other one says the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
total flux out of the region,
so, the flux through the curve

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is equal to the double integral
of divergence of a field in the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
region.
So, in both cases,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we need the vector field to be
defined not only,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I mean, the left hand side
makes sense if a vector field is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
just defined on the curve
because it's just a line

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
integral on C.
We don't care what happens

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
inside.
But, for the right-hand side to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
make sense,
and therefore for the equality

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to make sense,
we need the vector field to be

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
defined everywhere inside the
region.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So, I said, if there is a point
somewhere in here where my

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
vector field is not defined,
then it doesn't work.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And actually,
we've seen that example.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So, this only works if F and
its derivatives are defined

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
everywhere in the region,
R.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Otherwise, we are in trouble.
OK,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
so we've seen for example that
if I gave you the vector field

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
minus yi xj over x squared plus
y squared,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
so that's the same vector field
that was on that problem set a

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
couple of weeks ago.
Then, well, f is not defined at

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
the origin, but it's defined
everywhere else.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And, wherever it's defined,
it's curl is zero.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I should say everywhere it's --
And so, if we have a closed

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:24.000
curve in the plane,
well, there's two situations.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
One is if it does not enclose
the origin.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Then,
yes,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
we can apply Green's theorem
and it will tell us that it's

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
equal to the double integral in
here of curl F dA,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
which will be zero because this
is zero.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
However,
if I have a curve that encloses

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the origin,
let's say like this,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000
for example,
then,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
well, I cannot use the same
method because the vector field

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and its curl are not defined at
the origin.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And, in fact,
you know that ignoring the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
problem and saying,
well, the curl is still zero

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
everywhere,
will give you the wrong answer

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
because we've seen an example.
We've seen that along the unit

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
circle the total work is 2 pi
not zero.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So, we can't use Green.
However, we can't use it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
directly.
So, there is an extended

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
version of Green's theorem that
tells you the following thing.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Well,
it tells me that even though I

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
can't do things for just this
region enclosed by C prime,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I can still do things for the
region in between two different

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
curves.
OK, so let me show you what I

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
have in mind.
So, let's say that I have my

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
curve C'.
Where's my yellow chalk?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Oh, here.
So, I have this curve C'.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I can't apply Green's theorem
inside it, but let's get out the

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
smaller thing.
So, that one I'm going to make

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
going clockwise.
You will see why.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Then, I could say,
well, let me change my mind.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
This picture is not very well
prepared.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
That's because my writer is on
strike.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000
OK, so let's say we have C' and
C'' both going counterclockwise.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Then,
I claim that Green's theorem

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
still applies,
and tells me that the line

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
integral along C prime minus the
line integral along C double

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
prime is equal to the double
integral over the region in

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
between.
So here, now,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:35.000
it's this region with the hole
of the curve.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And, well, in our case,
that will turn out to be zero

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
because curl is zero.
OK, so this doesn't tell us

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
what each of these two line
integrals is.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But actually,
it tells us that they are equal

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
to each other.
And so, by computing one,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
you can see actually that for
this vector field,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
if you take any curve that goes
counterclockwise around the

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
origin,
you would get two pi no matter

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
what the curve is.
So how do you get to this?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Why is this not like
conceptually a new theorem?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Well, just think of the
following thing.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I'm not going to do it on top
of that because it's going to be

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
messy if I draw too many things.
But, so here I have my C''.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Here, I have C'.
Let me actually make a slit

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that will connect them to each
other like this.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So now if I take,
see,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I can form a single closed
curve that will enclose all of

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
this region with kind of an
infinitely thin slit here

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
counterclockwise.
And so, if I go

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
counterclockwise around this
region, basically I go

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
counterclockwise along the outer
curve.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Then I go along the slit.
Then I go clockwise along the

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
inside curve,
then back along the slit.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And then I'm done.
So,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
if I take the line integral
along this big curve consisting

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
of all these pieces,
now I can apply Green's theorem

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
to that because it is the usual
counterclockwise curve that goes

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
around a region where my field
is well-defined.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
See, I've eliminated the origin
from the picture.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And, so the total line integral
for this thing is equal to the

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:46.000
integral along C prime,
I guess the outer one.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Then, I also need to have what
I do along the inner side.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And, the inner side is going to
be C double prime,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
but going backwards because now
I'm going clockwise on C prime

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
so that I'm going
counterclockwise around the

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
shaded region.
Well, of course there will be

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
contributions from the line
integral along this wide

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
segment.
But, I do it twice,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000
once each way.
So, they cancel out.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So, the white segments cancel
out.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You probably shouldn't,
in your notes,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
write down white segments
because probably they are not

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
white on your paper.
But, hopefully you get the

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
meaning of what I'm trying to
say.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
OK, so basically that tells
you, you can still play tricks

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
with Green's theorem when the
region has holes in it.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You just had to be careful and
somehow subtract some other

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
curve so that together things
will work out.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
There is a similar thing with
the divergence theorem,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
of course, with flux and double
integral of div f,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
you can apply exactly the same
argument.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
OK, so basically you can apply
Green's theorem for a region

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that has several boundary
curves.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
You just have to be careful
that the outer boundary must go

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
counterclockwise.
The inner boundary either goes

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
clockwise, or you put a minus
sign.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
OK,
and the last cultural note,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000
so, the definition,
we say that a region in the

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
plane,
sorry, I should say a connected

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000
region in the plane,
so that means -- So,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
connected means it consists of
a single piece.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
OK, so, connected,
there is a single piece.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
These two guys together are not
connected.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
But, if I join them,
then this is a connected

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:08.000
region.
We say it's simply connected --

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.000
-- if any closed curve in it,
OK,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
so I need to gave a name to my
region,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
let's say R,
any closed curve in R,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
bounds,
no,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000
sorry.
If the interior of any closed

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:49.000
curve in R -- -- is also
contained in R.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So, concretely,
what does that mean?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
That means the region,
R, does not have any holes

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
inside it.
Maybe I should draw two

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
pictures to explain what I mean.
So,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000
this guy here is simply
connected while -- -- this guy

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:29.000
here is not simply connected
because if I take this curve,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that's a curve inside my region.
But, the piece that it bounds

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is not actually entirely
contained in my origin.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And, so why is that relevant?
Well,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
if you know that your vector
field is defined everywhere in a

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
simply connected region,
then you don't have to worry

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
about this question of,
can I apply Green's theorem to

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
the inside?
You know it's automatically OK

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
because if you have a closed
curve,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
then the vector field is,
I mean, if a vector field is

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
defined on the curve it will
also be defined inside.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000
OK,
so if the domain of definition

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:25.000
-- -- of a vector field is
defined and differentiable -- --

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:38.000
is simply connected -- -- then
we can always apply -- --

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Green's theorem -- -- and,
of course,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
provided that we do it on a
curve where the vector field is

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
defined.
I mean, your line integral

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
doesn't make sense so there's
nothing to compute.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
But, if you have,
so, again, the argument would

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
be, well, if a vector field is
defined on the curve,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
it's also defined inside.
So,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
see,
the problem with that vector

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
field here is precisely that its
domain of definition is not

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
simply connected because there
is a hole,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000
namely the origin.
OK, so for this guy,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:28.000
domain of definition,
which is plane minus the origin

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:39.000
with the origin removed is not
simply connected.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And so that's why you have this
line integral that makes perfect

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
sense, but you can't apply
Green's theorem to it.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So now, what does that mean a
particular?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Well, we've seen this criterion
that if a curl of the vector

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
field is zero and it's defined
in the entire plane,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
then the vector field is
conservative,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and it's a gradient field.
And, the argument to prove that

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
is basically to use Green's
theorem.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So, in fact,
the actual optimal statement

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
you can make is if a vector
field is defined in a simply

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
connected region,
and its curl is zero,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:26.000
then it's a gradient field.
So, let me just write that down.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So, the correct statement,
I mean, the previous one we've

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
seen is also correct.
But this one is somehow better

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and closer to what exactly is
needed if curl F is zero and the

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:55.000
domain of definition where F is
defined is simply connected --

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000
-- then F is conservative.
And that means also it's a

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000
gradient field.
It's the same thing.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:23.000
OK, any questions on this?
No?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
OK, some good news.
What I've just said here won't

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
come up on the test on Thursday.
OK.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
(APPLAUSE) Still,
it's stuff that you should be

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
aware of generally speaking
because it will be useful,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
say, on the next week's problem
set.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And,
maybe on the final it would be,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
there won't be any really,
really complicated things

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
probably,
but you might need to be at

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.000
least vaguely aware of this
issue of things being simply

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
connected.
And by the way,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I mean, this is also somehow
the starting point of topology,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
which is the branch of math
that studies the shapes of

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
regions.
So,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
in particular,
you can try to distinguish

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
domains in the plains by looking
at whether they're simply

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
connected or not,
and what kinds of features they

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
have in terms of how you can
joint point what kinds of curves

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
exist in them.
And, since that's the branch of

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
math in which I work,
I thought I should tell you a

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:41.000
bit about it.
OK, so now back to reviewing

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
for the exam.
So, I'm going to basically list

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
topics.
And, if time permits,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I will say a few things about
problems from practice exam 3B.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I'm hoping that you have it or
your neighbor has it,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
or you can somehow get it.
Anyway, given time,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I'm not sure how much I will
say about the problems in and of

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
themselves.
OK, so the main thing to know

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
about this exam is how to set up
and evaluate double integrals

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
and line integrals.
OK, if you know how to do these

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
two things, then you are in much
better shape than if you don't.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And -- So, the first thing
we've seen, just to write it

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:55.000
down, there's two main objects.
And, it's kind of important to

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
not confuse them with each
other.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
OK, there's double integrals of
our regions of some quantity,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
dA,
and the other one is the line

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
integral along a curve of a
vector field,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
F.dr or F.Mds depending on
whether it's work or flux that

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
we are trying to do.
And, so we should know how to

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
set up these things and how to
evaluate them.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
And, roughly speaking,
in this one you start by

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
drawing a picture of the region,
then deciding which way you

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
will integrate it.
It could be dx dy,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
dy dx,
r dr d theta,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
and then you will set up the
bound carefully by slicing it

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
and studying how the bounds for
the inner variable depend on the

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
outer variable.
So, the first topic will be

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
setting up double integrals.
And so, remember,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
OK, so maybe I should make this
more explicit.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:12.000
We want to draw a picture of R
and take slices in the chosen

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000
way so that we get an iterated
integral.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000
OK, so let's do just a quick
example.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:38.000
So, if I look at problem one on
the exam 3B,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
it says to look at the line
integral from zero to one,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
line integral from x to 2x of
possibly something,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
but dy dx.
And it says,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:58.000
let's look at how we would set
this up the other way around by

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
exchanging x and y.
So, we should get to something

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
that will be the same integral
dx dy.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I mean, if you have a function
of x and y, then it will be the

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
same function.
But, of course,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
the bounds change.
So, how do we exchange the

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
order of integration?
Well, the only way to do it

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
consistently is to draw a
picture.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
So, let's see,
what does this mean?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Here, it means we integrate
from y equals x to y equals 2x,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
x between zero and one.
So, we should draw a picture.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
The lower bound for y is y
equals x.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
So, let's draw y equals x.
That seems to be here.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
And, we'll go up to y equals
2x, which is a line also but

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
with bigger slope.
And then, all right,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000
so for each value of x,
my origin will go from x to 2x.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Well, and I do this for all
values of x that go to x equals

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
one.
So, I stop at x equals one,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
which is here.
And then, my region is

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
something like this.
OK, so this point here,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000
in case you are wondering,
well, when x equals one,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
y is one.
And that point here is one, two.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
OK, any questions about that so
far?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
OK, so somehow that's the first
kill, when you see an integral,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
how to figure out what it
means, how to draw the region.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
And then there's a converse
scale which is given the region,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
how to set up the integral for
it.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
So, if we want to set up
instead dx dy,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
then it means we are going to
actually look at the converse

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
question which is,
for a given value of y,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
what is the range of values of
x?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
OK, so if we fix y,
well, where do we enter the

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
region, and where do we leave
it?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
So, we seem to enter on this
side, and we seem to leave on

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
that side.
At least that seems to be true

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
for the first few values of y
that I choose.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
But, hey, if I take a larger
value of y, then I will enter on

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
the side, and I will leave on
this vertical side,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
not on that one.
So, I seem to have two

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
different things going on.
OK, the place where enter my

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:38.000
region is always y equals 2x,
which is the same as x equals y

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000
over two.
So, x seems to always start at

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
y over two.
But, where I leave to be either

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
x equals y, or here,
x equals y.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
And, that depends on the value
of y.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So, in fact,
I have to break this into two

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
different integrals.
I have to treat separately the

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
case where y is between zero and
one, and between one and two.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:15.000
So, what I do in that case is I
just make two integrals.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
So, I say, both of them start
at y over two.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
But, in the first case,
we'll stop at x equals y.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000
In the second case,
we'll stop at x equals one.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
OK, and now,
what are the values of y for

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
each case?
Well, the first case is when y

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
is between zero and one.
The second case is when y is

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
between one and two,
which I guess this picture now

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
is completely unreadable,
but hopefully you've been

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
following what's going on,
or else you can see it in the

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
solutions to the problem.
And, so that's our final answer.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:01.000
OK, any questions about how to
set up double integrals in xy

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
coordinates?
No?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
OK, who feels comfortable with
this kind of problem?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
OK, good.
I'm happy to see the vast

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
majority.
So, the bad news is we have to

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000
be able to do it not only in xy
coordinates, but also in polar

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
coordinates.
So, when you go to polar

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
coordinates, basically all you
have to remember on the side of

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
integrand is that x becomes r
cosine theta.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Y becomes r sine theta.
And, dx dy becomes r dr d theta.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
In terms of how you slice for
your region, well,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
you will be integrating first
over r.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
So, that means what you're
doing is you're fixing the value

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
of theta.
And, for that value of theta,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
you ask yourself,
for what range of values of r

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
am I going to be inside my
origin?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
So, if my origin looks like
this, then for this value of

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
theta, r would go from zero to
whatever this distance is.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
And of course I have to find
how this distance depends on

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
theta.
And then, I will find the

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
extreme values of theta.
Now, of course,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
is the origin is really looking
like this, then you're not going

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
to do it in polar coordinates.
But, if it's like a circle or a

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
half circle, or things like
that,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
then even if a problem doesn't
tell you to do it in polar

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
coordinates you might want to
seriously consider it.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
OK, so I'm not going to do it
but problem two in the practice

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
exam is a good example of doing
something in polar coordinates.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000
OK,
so in terms of things that we

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
do with double integrals,
there's a few formulas that I'd

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
like you to remember about
applications that we've seen of

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
double integrals.
So, quantities that we can

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
compute with double integrals
include things like the area of

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
region,
its mass if it has a density,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
the average value of some
function,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
for example,
the average value of the x and

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
y coordinates,
which we called the center of

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:31.000
mass or moments of inertia.
So, these are just formulas to

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
remember.
So, for example,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
the area of region is the
double integral of just dA,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
or if it helps you,
one dA if you want.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
You are integrating the
function 1.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
You have to remember formulas
for mass,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
for the average value of a
function is the F bar,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:05.000
in particular x bar y bar,
which is the center of mass,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:14.000
and the moment of inertia.
OK, so the polar moment of

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
inertia, which is moment of
inertia about the origin.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
OK, so that's double integral
of x squared plus y squared,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
density dA,
but also moments of inertia

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
about the x and y axis,
which are given by just taking

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
one of these guys.
Don't worry about moments of

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
inertia about an arbitrary line.
I will ask you for a moment of

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
inertia for some weird line or
something like that.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
OK, but these you should know.
Now, what if you somehow,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
on the spur of the moment,
you forget, what's the formula

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
for moment of inertia?
Well, I mean,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I prefer if you know,
but if you have a complete

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
blank in your memory,
there will still be partial

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
credit were setting up the
bounds and everything else.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
So,
the general rule for the exam

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
will be if you're stuck in a
calculation or you're missing a

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
little piece of the puzzle,
try to do as much as you can.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
In particular,
try to at least set up the

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
bounds of the integral.
There will be partial credit

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
for that always.
So, while we're at it about

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
grand rules, how about
evaluation?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
How about evaluating integrals?
So, once you've set it up,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
you have to sometimes compute
it.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
First of all,
check just in case the problem

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
says set up but do not evaluate.
Then, don't waste your time

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
evaluating it.
If a problem says to compute

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
it, then you have to compute it.
So, what kinds of integration

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
techniques do you need to know?
So, you need to know,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
you must know,
well, how to integrate the

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
usual functions like one over x
or x to the n,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
or exponential,
sine, cosine,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
things like that,
OK, so the usual integrals.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:16.000
You must know what I will call
easy trigonometry.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
OK, I don't want to give you a
complete list.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
And the more you ask me about
which ones are on the list,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
the more I will add to the
list.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
But, those that you know that
you should know,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
you should know.
Those that you think you

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
shouldn't know,
you don't have to know because

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
I will say what I will say soon.
You should know also

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
substitution,
how to set U equals something,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
and then see,
oh, this becomes u times du,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
and so substitution method.
What do I mean by easy

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
trigonometrics?
Well, certainly you should know

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
how to ingrate sine.
You should know how to

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
integrate cosine.
You should be aware that sine

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
squared plus cosine squared
simplifies to one.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
And, you should be aware of
general things like that.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
I would like you to know,
maybe, the double angles,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
sine 2x and cosine 2x.
Know what these are,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
and the kinds of the easy
things you can do with that,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
also things that involve
substitution setting like U

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
equals sine T or U equals cosine
T.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
I mean, let me,
instead, give an example of

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
hard trig that you don't need to
know, and then I will answer.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:34.000
OK, so, not needed on Thursday;
it doesn't mean that I don't

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
want you to know them.
I would love you to know every

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
single integral formula.
But, that shouldn't be your top

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
priority.
So, you don't need to know

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
things like hard trigonometric
ones.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
So, let me give you an example.
OK, so if I ask you to do this

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
one, then actually I will give
you maybe, you know,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
I will reprint the formula from
the notes or something like

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
that.
OK, so that one you don't need

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
to know.
I would love if you happen to

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
know it, but if you need it,
it will be given to you.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So, these kinds of things that
you cannot compute by any easy

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
method.
And, integration by parts,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
I believe that I successfully
test-solved all the problems

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
without doing any single
integration by parts.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Again, in general,
it's something that I would

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
like you to know,
but it shouldn't be a top

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.000
priority for this week.
OK, sorry, you had a question,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
or?
Inverse trigonometric

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
functions: let's say the most
easy ones.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
I would like you to know the
easiest inverse trig functions,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
but not much.
OK, OK, so be aware that these

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:04.000
functions exist,
but it's not a top priority.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
I should say,
the more I tell you I don't

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
need you to know,
the more your physics and other

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
teachers might complain that,
oh, these guys don't know how

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
to integrate.
So, try not to forget

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000
everything.
But, yes?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
No, no, here I just mean for
evaluating just a single

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
variable integral.
I will get to change variables

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
and Jacobian soon,
but I'm thinking of this as a

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
different topic.
What I mean by this one is if

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
I'm asking you to integrate,
I don't know,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
what's a good example?
Zero to one t dt over square

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
root of one plus t squared,
then you should think of maybe

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
substituting u equals one plus t
squared,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:55.000
and then it becomes easier.
OK, so this kind of trig,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
that's what I have in mind here
specifically.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And again,
if you're stuck,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
in particular,
if you hit this dreaded guy,

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
and you don't actually have a
formula giving you what it is,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
it means one of two things.
One is something's wrong with

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
your solution.
The other option is something

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
is wrong with my problem.
So, either way,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
check quickly what you've done
it if you can't find a mistake,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
then just move ahead to the
next problem.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Which one, this one?
Yeah,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
I mean if you can do it,
if you know how to do it,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
which everything is fair:
I mean,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
generally speaking,
give enough of it so that you

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
found the solution by yourself,
not like,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
you know, it didn't somehow
come to you by magic.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
But, yeah, if you know how to
integrate this without doing the

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
substitution,
that's absolutely fine by me.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Just show enough work.
The general rule is show enough

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
work that we see that you knew
what you are doing.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
OK, now another thing we've
seen with double integrals is

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
how to do more complicated
changes of variables.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
So, when you want to replace x
and y by some variables,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
u and v, given by some formulas
in terms of x and y.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
So, you need to remember
basically how to do them.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
So, you need to remember that
the method consists of three

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000
steps.
So, one is you have to find the

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Jacobian.
And, you can choose to do

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
either this Jacobian or the
inverse one depending on what's

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
easiest given what you're given.
You don't have to worry about

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
solving for things the other way
around.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Just compute one of these
Jacobians.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:06.000
And then, the rule is that du
dv is absolute value of the

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Jacobian dx dy.
So, that takes care of dx dy,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
how to convert that into du dv.
The second thing to know is

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
that,
well,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
you need to of course
substitute any x and y's in the

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000
integrand to convert them to u's
and v's so that you have a valid

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
integrand involving only u and
v.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:51.000
And then, the last part is
setting up the bounds.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
And you see that,
probably you seen on P-sets and

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
an example we did in the lecture
that this can be complicated.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
But now, in real life,
you do this actually to

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
simplify the integrals.
So,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
probably the one that will be
there on Thursday,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
if there's a problem about that
on Thursday,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
it will be a situation where
the bounds that you get after

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
changing variables are
reasonably easy.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
OK, I'm not saying that it will
be completely obvious

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
necessarily, but it will be a
fairly easy situation.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
So, the general method is you
look at your region,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
R, and it might have various
sides.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Well, on each side you ask
yourself, what do I know about x

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
and y, and how to convert that
in terms of u and v?

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
And maybe you'll find that the
equation might be just u equals

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
zero for example,
or u equals v,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
or something like that.
And then, it's up to you to

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
decide what you want to do.
But, maybe the easiest usually

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
is to draw a new picture in
terms of u and v coordinates of

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
what your region will look like
in the new coordinates.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
It might be that it will
actually much easier.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
It should be easier looking
than what you started with.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
OK, so that's the general idea.
There is one change of variable

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
problem on each of the two
practice exams to give you a

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
feeling for what's realistic.
The problem that's on practice

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
exam 3B actually is on the hard
side of things because the

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
question is kind of hidden in a
way.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
So, if you look at problem six,
you might find that it's not

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
telling you very clearly what
you have to do.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
That's because it was meant to
be the hardest problem on that

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
test.
But, once you've reduced it to

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
an actual change of variables
problem, I expect you to be able

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
to know how to do it.
And, on practice exam 3A,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
there's also,
I think it's problem five on

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
the other practice exam.
And, that one is actually

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
pretty standard and
straightforward.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
OK, time to move on, sorry.
So, we've also seen about line

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
integrals.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:30.000
OK,
so line integrals,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
so the main thing to know about
them,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
so the line integral for work,
which is line integral of F.dr,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
so let's say that your vector
field has components,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:49.000
M and N.
So, the line integral for work

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000
becomes in coordinates integral
of Mdx plus Ndy while we've also

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000
seen line integral for flux.
So, line integral of F.n ds

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000
becomes the integral along C
just to make sure that I give it

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
to you correctly.
So, remember that just,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
I don't want to make the
mistake in front of you.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:30.000
So, T ds is dx, dy.
And, the normal vector,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
so, T ds goes along the curve.
Nds goes clockwise

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
perpendicular to the curve.
So, it's going to be,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000
well, it's going to be dy and
negative dx.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:42:00.000
So, you will be integrating
negative Ndx plus Mdy.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
OK, see, if you are blanking
and don't remember the signs,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
then you can just draw this
picture and make sure that you

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
get it right.
So, you should know a little

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
bit about geometric
interpretation and how to see

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
easily that it's going to be
zero in some cases.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
But, mostly you should know how
to compute, set up and compute

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
these things.
So, what do we do when we are

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
here?
Well, it's year,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
we have both x and y together,
but we want to,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
because it's the line integral,
there should be only one

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
variable.
So, the important thing to know

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
is we want to reduce everything
to a single parameter.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:55.000
OK, so the evaluation method is
always by reducing to a single

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000
parameter.
So, for example,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
maybe x and y are both
functions of some variable,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
t,
and then express everything in

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:18.000
terms of some integral of,
some quantity involving t dt.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
It could be that you will just
express everything in terms of x

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
or in terms of y,
or in terms of some angle or

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
something.
It's up to you to choose how to

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
parameterize things.
And then, when you're there,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
it's a usual one variable
integral with a single variable

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
in there.
OK, so that's the general

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
method of calculation,
but we've seen a shortcut for

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
work when we can show that the
field is the gradient of

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
potential.
So,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:55.000
one thing to know is if the
curl of F,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
which is an x minus My happens
to be zero,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
well,
and now I can say,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
and the domain is simply
connected,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
or if the field is defined
everywhere,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:19.000
then F is actually a gradient
field.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
So, that means,
just to make it more concrete,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
that means we can find a
function little f called the

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
potential such that its
derivative respect to x is M,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
and its derivative with respect
to Y is N.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000
We can solve these two
conditions for the same

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000
function, f, simultaneously.
And, how do we find this

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
function, little f?
OK, so that's the same as

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
saying that the field,
big F, is the gradient of

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
little f.
And, how do we find this

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
function, little f?
Well, we've seen two methods.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
One of them involves computing
a line integral from the origin

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
to a point in the plane by going
first along the x axis,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
then vertically.
The other method was to first

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
figure out what this one tells
us by integrating it with

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
respect to x.
And then, we differentiate our

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
answer with respect to y,
and we compare with that to get

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
the complete answer.
OK, so I is that relevant?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Well,
first of all it's relevant in

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
physics,
but it's also relevant just to

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
calculation of line integrals
because we see the fundamental

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
theorem of calculus for line
integrals which says if we are

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
integrating a gradient field and
we know what the potential is.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Then, we just have to,
well, the line integral is just

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
the change in value of a
potential.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
OK, so we take the value of a
potential at the starting point,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
sorry, we take value potential
at the endpoint minus the value

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
at the starting point.
And, that will give us the line

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
integral, OK?
So, important:

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
this is only for work.
There's no statement like that

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
for flux, OK,
so don't tried to fly this in a

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
problem about flux.
I mean, usually,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
if you look at the practice
exams,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
you will see it's pretty clear
that there's one problem in

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
which you are supposed to do
things this way.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
It's kind of a dead giveaway,
but it's probably not too bad.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
OK, and the other thing we've
seen, so I mentioned it at the

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
beginning but let me mention it
again.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
To compute things,
Green's theorem,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
let's just compute,
well, let us forget,

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
sorry, find the value of a line
integral along the closed curve

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
by reducing it to double
integral.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000
So,
the one for work says -- --

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
this,
and you should remember that in

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
there,
so C is a closed curve that

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
goes counterclockwise,
and R is the region inside.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000
So, the way you would,
if you had to compute both

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
sides separately,
you would do them in extremely

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
different ways,
right?

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
This one is a line integral.
So, you use the method to

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
explain here,
namely, you express x and y in

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
terms of a single variable.
See that you're doing a circle.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
I want to see a theta.
I don't want to see an R.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
R is not a variable.
You are on the circle.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
This one is a double integral.
So, if you are doing it,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
say, on a disk,
you would have both R and theta

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
if you're using polar
coordinates.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
You would have both x and y.
Here, you have two variables of

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
integration.
Here, you should have only one

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
after you parameterize the
curve.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
And, the fact that it stays
curl F, I mean,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000
curl F is just Nx-My is just
like any function of x and y.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
OK, the fact that we called it
curl F doesn't change how you

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
compute it.
You have first to compute the

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
curl of F.
Say you find,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
I don't know,
xy minus x squared,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
well, it becomes just the usual
double integral of the usual

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
function xy minus x squared.
There's nothing special to it

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.000
because it's a curl.
And, the other one is the

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.000
counterpart for flux.
So, it says this,

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
and remember this is mx plus
ny.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
I mean, what's important about
these statements is not only

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
remembering, you know,
if you just know this formula

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
by heart,
you are still in trouble

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
because you need to know what
actually the symbols in here

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
mean.
So, you should remember,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
what is this line integral,
and what's the divergence of a

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.000
field?
So, just something to remember.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
And, so I guess I'll let you
figure out practice problems

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
because it's time,
but I think that's basically

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
the list of all we've seen.
And, well, that should be it.
