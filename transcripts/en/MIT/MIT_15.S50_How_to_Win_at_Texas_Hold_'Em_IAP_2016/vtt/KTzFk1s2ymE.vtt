00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:23.000
WILL MA: I guess
I'll get started.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.980
So all right, cool.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.500
OK, so before I
get into any hands,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.020
I wanted to-- this
is really loud.

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:33.350
Before I get to
any hands, I want

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.550
to talk about tournaments
versus cash games

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.250
since I haven't really
made the distinction yet.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.419
So essentially-- so
this is a big chart

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:42.460
with all the differences.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.500
So when you guys play
in the things online,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.840
those are called tournaments.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.750
So in the tournament, you
sort of buy-in for a fixed

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.310
amount of play chips.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.700
case, it's not that relevant.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400
It's like one play dollar.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.650
And then you get, for coming
in the top 20% a round,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.890
you're going to get some amount
of play chips paid out to you.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.630
And like, if you win,
you get the most.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.420
And if you just
barely make it, you'll

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.230
probably make back
like two play chips.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.140
So you'll profit one
play chip or something.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.431
So that's how tournaments work.

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:15.590
And that's sort of what,
throughout this class so far,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.970
I sort of assumed all the hands
are taken from tournaments.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.720
So there is a different
way to play poker.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.240
And a lot of you
might have actually

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.490
been introduced to
poker like this--

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.237
so, you have like
sort of a home game,

00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:27.820
where there's just
a bunch of friends,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.236
you're playing at
someone's house.

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:32.680
And you all buy in for
some amount of play chips.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.560
And basically, you
can play, and people

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.220
can join the stock any time.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.670
If you lose all your play chips,
you can just buy in for more.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.670
It's not like tournaments
where once you're out,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.420
you're eliminated.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.860
And you can never go
back into that tournament

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.380
and cash in to go
buy in whenever.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.550
You can hit and run people.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.200
You can come try to
make a bit of money

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.320
and then just leave as
soon as you make a bit.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.850
So what are the
main differences?

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.183
So I wanted to highlight the
differences between the two

00:02:00.183 --> 00:02:03.457
types of games and talk about
why we mostly choose students

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:04.540
tournaments in this class.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.889
So everyone knows the definition
of what a tournament is,

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.870
what a cash game is.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.580
So let me talk a bit more about,
what are some differences?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.190
In cash games, usually,
the stakes are fixed.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.047
So usually, it will say we're
playing for like one play

00:02:24.047 --> 00:02:25.630
dollar, two play
dollars, or something

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.700
like that, whereas
in tournaments, I'm

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.520
sure as you've noticed,
the blinds keep going up.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.660
The blinds start 10/20
in your tournaments.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.992
And then they become 20/40,
and then like 40/80, or 30/60.

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:39.700
Actually, there's a
15/30 level, I think.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.750
So it's 15/30 and
20/40, and then 25/50.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.172
And it keeps going up.

00:02:45.172 --> 00:02:47.380
and the reason this is the
case is so that eventually

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.671
the tournament ends, because
if the blinds don't go up,

00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:52.290
the tournament will
take forever to end.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.100
So what's a big factor about
tournaments versus cash games?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100
In tournaments, you have
no control over your table.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.820
You just join in the tournament,
and you're put at some table,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.550
and you've got to do your best
at the table you're placed at.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.340
And the fact that there's
not this much metagame,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.980
I think is one of the reasons
it's much easier to analyze

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.125
poker hands in terms
of tournaments,

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.795
because in cash games, if
you're at the cash game,

00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:16.270
and everyone's really, really
good, you could just choose,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.800
I don't want to play in
this cash game anymore.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.860
I'm just losing my money.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.930
And you could choose
to stand up and leave.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.830
And there's a lot of
decisions of this form.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.760
So there is more
metagame required.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.050
And in tournaments, the
general goal is to survive.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.640
You're just trying to get
eliminated as late as possible

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.030
to maximize your payout, whereas
in cash games, a lot of it

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.520
comes down to, if there's
one bad player at the table,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.404
you're trying to target
that specific player.

00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:42.820
You're trying to
do everything you

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.070
can to get in hands
against that player,

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.620
and exploit them, and win a
lot of money against them,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.170
and risk a lot and
stuff like that.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.810
There's less focus on the
math of poker and more focus

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.360
on specifically targeting
certain players.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.114
Tournaments-- there's
frequent but fixed losses.

00:04:01.114 --> 00:04:02.530
So if you were
playing tournaments

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.950
for real money, how it
works is most of the time,

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.980
like 80% of players don't
get paid anything back

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.940
from the tournament.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.870
So when you play tournaments
most of the time,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.490
you're going to lose, even
if you're really good.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.830
You're not going to win
more than 50% of the time.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.220
So you're going to lose,
lose, lose, lose lose.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.670
And then you're going to get
a big win and then win a lot.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.570
And then it's going to be
lose, lose, lose, lose,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.820
and you're going to win a lot.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.700
Sort of like playing the
lottery, whereas cash games,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.560
anything can happen.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.351
You can lose a lot.

00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:31.920
If you are having a bad day
and you decide not to quit,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.790
you could lose all your
money, buy back in,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.445
lose all your money,
by back in, eventually,

00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:37.111
lose all the money
in your bank account.

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.410
That could happen.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.580
You could also win a lot.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.770
So anything can happen.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.890
But in some sense,
tournaments is more variance.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.580
So like when I was talking in
the first class about the law

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.740
of large numbers and reaching
the long run, it does, overall,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.000
in some sense, take longer if
you're playing tournaments,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.690
because in tournaments, you
do need to occasionally get

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.610
the big score in
the tournament--

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.640
it's sort of like
winning the lottery--

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.870
to make back all your money.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.510
And if you don't, then you
won't make back all your money.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.830
I argue that tournaments,
I think, are more fun.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.812
They're more exciting.

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.270
If you make it far
in a tournament,

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.144
eventually, it comes
down to just two of you.

00:05:15.144 --> 00:05:16.660
It's pretty exciting.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.810
Also, tournaments have a
wider range of situations.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.530
So in cash games, usually,
it'll be a fixed number

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.000
of players at the table.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.460
And players will have a
similar number of big blinds,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.490
because whenever you lose
a bunch of big blinds,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.570
you can always buy back in
and get those big blinds back

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.185
by putting more
money on the table,

00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:37.560
whereas in tournaments, we
have to learn how to handle I,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.320
think interesting,
mathematical situations where

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.700
you have one big blind.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.140
How do I play it optimally?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.520
And stuff like that.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.430
The last thing is if
you play at a casino,

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.680
another good thing about
tournaments is relatively,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.890
the casino makes a lot less
from tournaments and cash games.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.090
Cash games, just as a fraction
of how much money you wager,

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.790
the casino takes way more
compared to tournaments.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.270
Tournaments-- what the with
the house takes is very small.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.510
OK so those are the
main differences.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.270
But I did want to
comprehensively

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.240
go through the
differences, because if you

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.880
do decide to play poker,
these are essentially

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.880
the two ways to play it.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.520
So I wanted to make
sure everyone is

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.880
well aware of the differences.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.900
So yeah, so why I chose
tournaments for the class--

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.430
I think there's less metagame.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.810
I think it's more exciting.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.490
I'm mostly a tournament
player, myself,

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.030
although I have played cash
games for extended periods

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.800
during my career.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.695
Yeah, there's a wider
range of scenarios.

00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:38.070
And I think it's
more applicable.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.780
I think the MIT Poker Club--

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.800
the event they're
running in January

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.420
is a tournament, because
tournaments are exciting.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.710
OK, so are there any
questions about this chart?

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.100
OK, cool.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.710
Yeah, our club
actually has both--

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.160
I mean the points-only
tournaments count.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.850
But if you look at this
thing above, then actually,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.710
the pen works now.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.560
I don't have to draw in here.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.710
OK.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.200
If you look there, then
these are the cash tables.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.240
And you could, in
theory, sit down there

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.590
and play for play money.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.250
And if you do lose all your
play money in those cash tables

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.812
to a shark in the class, and
you have no more play money,

00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:20.270
and you can't join
tournaments, you

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.785
can always refill your play
money and join the tournaments.

00:07:22.785 --> 00:07:24.410
So that's why it's
called "play money".

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.720
Only tournaments
count for standings.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.130
And if you want to see the
standings, you have to--

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.000
oh, I see.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.390
They annotate.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.042
So you see that you've got
to click the blue arrow,

00:07:41.042 --> 00:07:42.500
and then you can
see the standings.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.560
Some people ask me about this.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.768
So if you want to see your
standings, how many points

00:07:45.768 --> 00:07:48.500
everyone has, how many points
you have, you can click that.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.330
You can click there.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.774
OK, let's get into
some poker hands now.

00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:55.940
That being said, I highlighted
all these differences

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.875
about cash games
and tournaments.

00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:00.285
But good poker is
essentially good poker.

00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:02.660
If you're good at one, you're
probably good at the other.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.340
The difference is
still rather small.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.614
It's more based on, how
much risk do I want to take?

00:08:08.614 --> 00:08:10.280
What kind of schedule
do I want to play?

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.460
And that determines which one
you choose to play rather than,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.770
am I better at
tournaments or cash games?

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.360
At least once yours--

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.090
except at the very top
levels, there there really

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.380
is no difference between--

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.030
there's no such thing as
a cash game specialist,

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.030
except at the very, very
top where it's possible

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.199
the best cash game players are
good at cash games compared

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:33.490
to the best tournament players.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.865
But when you're just starting
out, if you're good at one,

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:37.904
you're good at the
other, essentially.

00:08:37.904 --> 00:08:38.570
All right, cool.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.770
So today, I'm going to talk
about some preflop play.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.990
Last class, I focused
on post-flop flight.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.150
The first class, I talked
a bit about what hands

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.640
you should open with
preflop But I didn't really

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.890
say that much about
playing preflop.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.980
But it's of the most
important parts of the hand,

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.250
because it determines
what cards are playing

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.720
for the rest of the hands.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.222
So first of all, I wanted
to run through some numbers.

00:09:04.222 --> 00:09:05.680
It's good to have
a sense of these.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.370
You don't have to
memorize all of these.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.090
But it's good to have a
reasonable idea of equities,

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.730
of specific hands versus
specific hands, when you get it

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.880
all in preflop.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.290
And I've classified
this to make this

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.240
roughly easier to memorize.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.250
So the first example, which is
sort of the dream situation,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.070
is you have a bigger pair
against a smaller pair.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.960
What's the best
situation that you

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.107
can be given preflop in poker?

00:09:32.107 --> 00:09:33.690
So, what's the best
hand you can have?

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.536
It's aces, right?

00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:36.410
But you don't want aces
and for everyone else

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.260
to have 3/2 offsuit, because
they're just going to fold.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.980
So you want aces, and you want
someone else to have kings.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.320
One of my screen names
is actually, please

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.780
give me ace ace against
king king or something,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.930
on a site, because it really is
the best situation you can hope

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.350
for, because
they're going to put

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.600
all their money in with kings.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.210
And so roughly, when you have
a bigger pair against a smaller

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.810
pair, your an 80/20 favorite.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:02.690
So you win 4/5 of the time.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.190
And the edge dwindles a bit as
you get to like, 33 versus 22,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.200
because there's a higher
chance both pairs will

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.040
be counterfeited.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.090
Like the board can come
66 77 8 or something.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.360
And then pocket threes
ties pocket deuces.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.210
And an equally good
situation is one pair

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.870
against zero overcards.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.600
So ace ace against
ace king off it's

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.920
also a very good situation.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.240
You're actually 93% there,
because you dominate their ace.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.360
So there's very few
ways for them to win.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.370
Pocket aces against 6-5 suited--

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.020
this is actually
the hand that's best

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.180
against aces, other than
aces itself, is 6-5 suited.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.500
And aces is only 77.5%.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.840
But it's still ludicrous.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.700
So pocket jacks against
10-9 suited, 81.7%--

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.970
so, some rough numbers.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.530
10-9 suited is pretty good.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.520
But pocket jacks crushes it
because having two jacks blocks

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.410
a lot of their straight-outs.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.630
Pocket queens against
7-4 is very good,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.330
because 7-4 off is not
suited, not connected.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.210
And the best you can
do preflop is actually

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.430
king king versus king two off.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.940
If you have pocket kings
against king deuce off,

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.700
I think that's the highest
equity you can possibly

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.720
get in preflop is 94.6%.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.710
And pocket kings against
king two suited is 89 points.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.540
So look how much
better king two suited

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.740
does than king two
off against king king.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.470
The fact it's easier to
make a flush is so relevant.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.380
We'll talk more
about this later.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.689
OK, the next few categories--
so a pair against one overcard.

00:11:37.689 --> 00:11:39.980
So you're still a favorite,
but less big of a favorite.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.450
Instead of an 80/20,
you're a 70/30.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.330
So queen queen against
ace jack off is 71.7%.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.350
Queen queen against ace
jack suited is a bit worse.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.540
Queen queen against
ace queen suited

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.420
is actually much worse than
queen queen against ace jack

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.230
suited.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.270
I think this is a bit
counterintuitive, because with,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.170
against ace jack
suited, I always

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.490
thought they have more outs.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.470
They can hit three jacks.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.390
But it actually
turns out, the fact

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.670
that they have a
queen to prevent you

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.190
from hitting three of
a kind in the situation

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.920
they've already had an ace, is
actually a lot more relevant.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.500
So queens is much worse
against ace queen than is jack.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.690
And pocket eights
against ace two off--

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.550
70.2%.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.172
Pocket threes
against ace two off

00:12:28.172 --> 00:12:29.630
is a bit worse,
because once again,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.160
small pairs can
get counterfeited

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.040
when you all-in preflop.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.200
OK, a similarly good
situation, which is the 70/30,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.610
is when you are, quote,
"dominating" the other person.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.137
So "dominating" means one
of your cards is the same.

00:12:41.137 --> 00:12:42.470
But the other card is different.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.390
And yours is higher.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.412
OK, so ace king off
against ace queen suited--

00:12:47.412 --> 00:12:49.120
pretty good situation
to get it in poker.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.210
You're at 70%.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.305
If you are suited, and they
are not, then you're 75%.

00:12:54.305 --> 00:12:58.140
If neither of you
are suited, it's 74%.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.410
Yeah, ace king off
versus king queen off.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.360
You're actually a bit better.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.270
So, ace king off against ace
queen off, you're at 74.4%.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.320
Ace king off is king
queen off, you're 74.8%.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.260
And you're a bit better,
because it's harder

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.274
to tie with the ace.

00:13:16.274 --> 00:13:17.690
So when you both
have an ace, it's

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.490
possible the board will come
with two pairs, so like 6,

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.880
6, 7, 7, 8.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.270
And then both of you will have
two pairs of sixes and sevens

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.380
with the ace kicker.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.960
But that's less likely to
happen if they don't have--

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.840
like if your bottom card
is their top card instead

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.560
of your top card
being their top card--

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.590
One thing to keep in mind is
ace five off against ace two off

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.270
is barely a favorite at all.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:46.790
So it's nowhere near as good as
ace queen off against jack off.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.120
Anyone have any
idea why that is?

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.370
Is it draw?

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:50.870
Right.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.411
Exactly, yes.

00:13:51.411 --> 00:13:54.210
So the five and two are
going to get counterfeited.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.810
The five kicker is going to
get counterfeited a lot more

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.260
often, because if four
cards on the board come,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.580
that's higher than five.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.220
The five is going
to be irrelevant.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.537
So that's a good
thing to remember.

00:14:07.537 --> 00:14:08.870
Let's look at some more numbers.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.430
This is one thing that I've
always thought is really cool.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.150
Two overcards versus
a pair is actually

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.490
very close to a 50/50
for the most part.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.752
Ace king suited against
pocket twos it's 49.9%.

00:14:20.752 --> 00:14:22.460
I actually showed you
in the first class,

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.520
if they don't have
a two of your suit,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.070
then it's actually like 50.1%.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:35.240
So ace king off versus
pocket twos is 47.4%.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.730
Note that 10/9 suited
against pocket twos

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.930
is actually a 54% favorite.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.840
It's much better than ace
king against pocket twos,

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.960
because 10/9 can make a lot
more straights and flushes.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.840
And the fact that you're
making a pair of tens instead

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.830
of a pair of aces,
is irrelevant when

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.070
the thing you're trying to
beat is a pair of deuces.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.095
Ace king off versus
pocket queen is only 43%.

00:15:01.095 --> 00:15:02.720
Even though people
call it a coin flip,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.670
it's actually much
worse than a coin flip.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.090
So yeah, this is actually one
of the first things that drew me

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:09.590
to Hold'em.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.810
When I found this
out, I was curious.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.900
I was wondering, the person
who invented the rules

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.670
of Hold'em, did they invent
it so that this is a 50/50?

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.670
Or was it just by coincidence
that is [INAUDIBLE] 50/50?

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.800
But I think it's very cool that
it turns out to be a 50/50.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.080
OK, so the last cases--

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.010
there's some weird cases where
all four cards are different.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.490
Roughly speaking, when all
four cards are different,

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.234
the guy with the highest
card is going to be a 60/40.

00:15:37.234 --> 00:15:38.900
I mean, this is very
rough, because it's

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.290
hard to encompass all the
different types of scenarios

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.820
under the same umbrella.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.320
But the thing that matters
is having the highest card.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.220
So let's see.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.620
So AB versus CD, which
means you have two cards

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.410
above their two cards.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.080
You can be as good
as 67.7% if it's

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.660
like ace king off
versus queen seven off,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.970
because queen seven off
has no straight-outs

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.490
and no flush-outs.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.960
AC versus BD, it's
about 60 versus 40.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.180
AD versus BC, it can
be as low as 50/50.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.920
So ace two off against
10-9 suited is only 51.6%.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:23.830
So that's sort of the worse
case for AD versus BC.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.080
You can look through those
numbers more on the slides.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.770
And you can also get it
yourself on PokerStove.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.979
Or a lot of websites, you
can compute the equities

00:16:31.979 --> 00:16:33.020
of a hand versus another.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.810
But it's good to have some
rough ideas of these categories.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.220
When is it an 80/20?

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.870
When am I a
[? four to one ?] favorite?

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.910
When am I a 70/30 favorite?

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.080
When am I a 50/50?

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.900
When am I a 60/40?

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.810
OK, so one thing that I hope you
sort of got from these numbers

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.320
is that suitness matters
a lot when you're behind,

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.520
and matters not that
much when you're ahead.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.870
So if you look at these
numbers, the gain in equity

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.641
of ace king suited when--

00:16:58.641 --> 00:16:59.140
sorry.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.040
The gain of equity of ace
king when ace king is suited,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.420
is only 1%.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.339
You only increase your
equity from 74.4 to 75.4.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.480
But if ace queen is suited,
then the equity of ace king

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.690
drops by 4% instead of 1%.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.530
And the reason, essentially,
is if your hand is bad,

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.180
you need as many ways as
possible to try to get lucky.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.349
And being suited is one of them.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.470
But if your hand is
already very good,

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.960
you just really need your
opponent to not get lucky.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.730
And you being
suited is only going

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.540
to be relevant if they first
hit a pair to beat you.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.670
And then you need to hit
a flush to beat them.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.312
So that's one thing
to keep in mind.

00:17:38.312 --> 00:17:39.853
So like with ace
king, the difference

00:17:39.853 --> 00:17:42.500
of being suited and unsuited
doesn't matter that much.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.320
But with a hand like
9-8, being suited

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.850
is way better than
being not suited.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.372
And shrewdness is also
important for implied odds,

00:17:50.372 --> 00:17:52.080
as I talked about last
class, because you

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.530
can make much better decisions
post-flop if your hand is

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:55.030
suited.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.960
So that's roughly some hand
[? equities ?] to remember.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.080
Now, we're going to talk
about some preflop all-ins,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.530
so going all-in preflop.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.880
OK so this class--

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.210
most of this class, this is
going to be a bit boring maybe.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.430
These are not really
highlight reel plays.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.270
And this is about routine,
making good decisions

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.690
that increase your preflop
equity by a couple percent that

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:25.200
will--

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.630
but it's really these
boring decisions, I think,

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.750
that make you win right, not
the occasional brilliant thing

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.980
that you see on TV.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.680
So if your goal is to get
on TV, then studying this

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.490
is maybe pointless.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.030
But if your goal is to
make expectancy, win money,

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.690
essentially, then it's really
the simple, boring decisions

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:46.495
that affect whether you win,
not the one-time crazy bluff

00:18:46.495 --> 00:18:48.870
you pulled off against Phil
Ivey that makes you a winner.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.760
Let's talk about this a bit.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.040
So the main thing is, don't be
afraid to go all in preflop.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.510
I didn't really stress this yet.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.090
But one thing I tend
to see people do

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.090
is, you are too afraid to
put all your money in preflop

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.230
because you would think
it's gambling or something.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.900
It is a lot of luck.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.060
You essentially put
your tournament life--

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.380
you let it ride on a coin flip.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.487
So it does seem scary.

00:19:16.487 --> 00:19:18.070
But the thing to
remember essentially,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:22.360
is late in the tournament, the
antes and blinds are so big.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.440
And if you ever can win
the blinds by going on,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.470
that's such a large gain
relative to what you risk,

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.480
and also, any two
cards of a chance

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.860
against any other preflop.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.260
So what was the rule I said?

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.450
So the rule I said
in the first class

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.520
is, when the
effective stack size

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.370
is less than 12 big blinds,
when there is antes,

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.510
then just go all in if you're
going to play the hand at all.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.040
And if there's no
antes, then you

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.390
need to be a bit
shorter, because you

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.210
don't want to risk 12 big
blinds when there's no antes.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.600
So you only want to risk like
10 big blinds without antes.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.390
But this is the rule that I
outlined in the first class,

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.750
roughly, and when you can go on.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.105
And one thing I wanted
to talk about, too,

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:08.790
before we get to
the first example,

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.000
is from the small blind--

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.840
in the first class, I said,
your button-opening range

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.450
is similar to your small
blind opening range.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.420
And why was this, even
though from the small blind--

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.300
so when it's folded to
you in the small blind,

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.884
you may have to get through one
more player, whereas when it's

00:20:26.884 --> 00:20:29.425
folded to you on the button,
you need to get through two more

00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:29.940
players.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.490
So it seems like you could
play a lot more hands

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:33.750
from the small blind.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.450
And another advantage of
playing from the small blind,

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.730
is you've already
put in half a blind.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.555
So the amount more
you're going to put in

00:20:41.555 --> 00:20:44.550
to play the pot is less,
is half [? blindless. ?]

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.376
But we said that
being in position--

00:20:46.376 --> 00:20:48.209
especially [? when we
sell this last class--

00:20:48.209 --> 00:20:50.770
?] being in position
is so important,

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.400
that the fact that you're in
position on the button and not

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.610
in position was the small
blind, meant about balanced-out

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.950
the advantages of playing
hands from the small blind.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.960
So we said, roughly
speaking, you

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.050
should be similarly willing
to raise hands from the button

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.120
and raise hands from
the small blind.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.890
But for all-ins,
position doesn't matter.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.290
If all the money goes
in the pot preflop, then

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.296
who gets the [? act ?]
last postflop?

00:21:15.296 --> 00:21:16.920
Doesn't matter,
because there's no more

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.420
actions to make postflop.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.360
So for all-ins, your
small blind all-in range

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.690
can be a lot wider than
your button-on range.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.300
And furthermore, I think the
threshold of how many bets

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.140
you can have to go all in is
a lot higher, because even

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.360
with like 15, even
with 20 big blinds,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.520
I often go all in
from the small blind

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.820
if I know the big blind
is a competent player.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.740
From the button, I
would pretty much very

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.920
rarely go on for 20 big
blinds, because I'm not

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.770
that sad if I just
raise it to 2.25

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.780
and then call, because
I play the rest

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.400
of the hand in position.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.460
But from the small blind,
when I know that if they call,

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.160
I'm playing the hand
out of position,

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.140
I really want to
avoid this situation.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.840
So going on for a huge
amount from the small blind

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.080
is usually OK since there's
only one player behind anyway.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.300
Let's look at a
sample situation.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.640
And I'm going to first
analyze it theoretically.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.440
And then I'll try to go
through a bunch of examples.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.590
So do we go all in or fold here?

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.520
And let's suppose we're
reasoning exploitatively.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.390
So this was level 2 thinking,
not level 3 thinking.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.030
So if we're reasoning
exploitatively, what

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.940
we're asking ourselves
is essentially,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.360
what's exploitative thinking?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.580
We model our opponent, give
them a probability distribution,

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.310
and then playing in a way
that maximizes our expectation

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.330
relative to the Bayesian
probability distribution we

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.640
put on our opponent.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.530
You can ask yourself,
is a blind a gambling

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.280
Player?

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.920
Is it likely he or she will
call with a wide range of hands?

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.990
How crazy have I been playing?

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.720
Will he give me any
credit if I go all in?

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.120
Suppose the pay
bubble doesn't matter.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.430
Suppose it's far
from having to try

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:04.202
to survive to make the next
pay increase or whatever.

00:23:04.202 --> 00:23:04.910
So let's do this.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.260
What do we think he's calling?

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.230
OK so I want to see
what you guys think.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.810
Does someone want
to give me a hand

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.840
that that you think he's
calling, or definitely calling,

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.520
or definitely not calling?

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.042
You give me a no-brainer.

00:23:21.042 --> 00:23:22.000
I just want people to--

00:23:24.294 --> 00:23:26.210
so what's the hand he's
obviously not calling?

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.114
AUDIENCE: 2-7 offsuit.

00:23:28.114 --> 00:23:28.816
OK, good.

00:23:28.816 --> 00:23:29.690
WILL MA: 2-7 offsuit.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.315
What's the hand he's
obviously calling?

00:23:31.315 --> 00:23:32.730
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.930
WILL MA: OK, so let's try
to zero in a bit more, OK,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:37.430
don't worry.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.040
It's OK.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.980
So tell me what
hands you think he

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.000
might be calling that are a
bit worse than pocket aces?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.170
What do you think is
the smallest pocket

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.960
pair he's calling?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.419
If you're not sure,
let me ask you.

00:23:49.419 --> 00:23:50.876
What's the smallest
pocket pair you

00:23:50.876 --> 00:23:53.410
would call if you don't know
anything about the small blind?

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.840
So it's 15 big blinds.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.470
It's a 15 big blinds all-in-one.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:06.230
OK, who would call pocket fives?

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:10.080
Who would call,
call pocket twos.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.890
Who would call ace seven suited?

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.240
Who would call a
queen jack offsuit?

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.790
OK, so I guess we
have a rough idea of--

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.490
so assuming you're playing
against someone in this class,

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.820
let's just say when you look at
that sample, just sort of guess

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.800
what they're calling.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.440
So I had this range.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.860
Maybe it's a bit more
ambitious than what

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.530
people put up their hands for.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:46.690
I said they would call with any
pocket pair, any ace, king ten

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.170
offsuit, king eight suited.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.780
So this is what I said they
would call with just 25%

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.370
of hands.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.380
Maybe in reality, they
call with even less.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.040
Maybe in reality, they only
call 20%, 15% of hands.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.250
But this just further
emphasizes my point.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.620
So we assume, they
call it 25%, let's say.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.610
OK, let's do the math.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.400
Let's now assume
we have 10 offsuit.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.621
OK, so let's do the
math against this.

00:25:13.621 --> 00:25:14.120
Oh, sorry.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.830
So what is the equity of ten
eight offsuit against their 25%

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.330
Range?

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.750
So when we get called, we're not
going so well, because they're

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.310
only calling 25% of hands.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.410
So their hand is going to
be good when they call.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.075
We're only 36%.

00:25:28.366 --> 00:25:29.240
So let's do the math.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.820
So 75% of the time,
they're going to fold.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.430
And we're going to
win 2.5 big blinds.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.700
Why is it 2.5 big blinds?

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.650
There's a big blind
that we're winning,

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.360
there's a small blind
that we're winning,

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.300
and then there's one
big blind from the antes

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.120
that we're winning.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:47.881
And it's 3.5.

00:25:47.881 --> 00:25:49.880
We count the small blind,
because even though we

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.774
put in the small blind, the fact
that you put it in the pot--

00:25:52.774 --> 00:25:54.440
it doesn't matter who
put it in the pot.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.120
The fact that it's
already in the pot

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.640
means we're winning the money.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.270
That make sense?

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.700
So 25% of the time,
he's going to call.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.250
And then when this
happens, 36% of the time,

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.630
we're going to win the all-in.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.190
And we're going to win
16.5 big big blinds.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.692
Because we're going
to win the 1.5--

00:26:09.692 --> 00:26:11.150
we're going to win
the small blind,

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.090
the antes plus his entire
15 Big Blind stack.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.830
64% of the time
we're going to lose,

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.360
and we're going to lose 14
and 1/2 Big Blinds, which

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.290
is how much we wagered
to do this all-in.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.000
So you can do the calculation.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.890
And it's actually very positive.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:28.280
We're making an expectation,
an entire Big Blind

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.430
by going all in.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:35.360
So now let's suppose
we had a worse hand.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.639
So let's suppose
we had 3-2 offsuit.

00:26:39.639 --> 00:26:41.180
We can do the same
calculation again.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.640
The only thing that
changed is, now

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.840
we only have 28% equity
instead of 36% equity.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.670
So 3-2 offsuit is
actually a worse hand

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.810
than 7-2 offsuit for a
lot of all-in purposes.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.120
Because 7-2 offsuit is,
like, the worst poker hand

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.720
against a range of strong hands.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.440
But against a range
of any two cards,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.680
3-2 off is actually
worse than 7-2 off

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.056
because seven high is
relevant if they had six high.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.740
Anyways, so you do
the calculation,

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.580
and you find that this is
still an excellent play.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.690
So going on with
3-2 offsuit, it's

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.130
actually not a crazy bad play.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.820
It looks like a crazy
bad play on paper.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.500
And I'll tell you, in reality,
it is a crazy bad play.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.800
But according to
this calculation,

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.550
it's actually not
a crazy bad play.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.980
You're actually
earning 0.42 Big Blind.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.069
OK, so what's wrong?

00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:35.610
What's wrong?

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:39.755
Why does our calculation
say 3-2 off is a good play?

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.350
And there's no mistake
in the calculation.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.880
It's not because of a
mistake in the calculation.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.588
AUDIENCE: Because of
the high probability

00:27:49.588 --> 00:27:51.070
that he's not going to call you.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.070
WILL MA: Right, exactly.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.640
OK, good.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.890
Yeah, so basically remember,
we did this calculation

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.890
using Level 2 reasoning,
exploitative thinking, right?

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.810
We built a model for him.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.350
And if our model is correct,
then actually 3-2 offsuit

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:07.730
is a good all-in.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.260
So what this is showing
us is actually--

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.660
the point is, if our
model is correct,

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.320
then they're making a mistake.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.380
Then he's making a mistake
by only calling 25% of hands.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.140
It's just too small a fraction.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.790
It's too small a fraction
of hands to call with.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.440
So I guess the
lesson sort of is--

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.450
so when I took the
poll around the class,

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.030
you guys wanted to call
even less than 25%, right?

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.430
25% still includes
Ace-2 offsuit,

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.234
and still includes hands like--

00:28:35.234 --> 00:28:35.900
let's see again.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.950
It still includes
hands like Queen,

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.430
King-10 offsuit, Queen-10
suited, King-8 suited.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.780
So even 25% is sort of
too low in the sense

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.650
that it allows a Small Blind
to shove any two cards--

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.850
shove means all-in, shove
any two cards profitably.

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.434
And in reality, it
might be the lower

00:28:55.434 --> 00:28:56.850
if people were
being truthful when

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.450
they put up their hand for what
they're calling with, right?

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.060
So basically my
point is, I think

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.760
people are too afraid
to go all-in preflop.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.380
Going all in preflop
is fine, basically.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.390
So let's suppose we're
the Big Blind now,

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.460
and we're considering
adding Queen-Jack off

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.970
to our calling range.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.680
So I'm saying, OK,
you're making the mistake

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.390
as a Big Blind of
only calling 25%.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.140
But what's wrong with
my reasoning, right?

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.806
The thing that's wrong
with my reasoning

00:29:27.806 --> 00:29:31.050
is, that's only mistake
from a Level 3 reasoning

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.220
point of view, right?

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.880
That's only a mistake in that
it's not theoretically optimal

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.220
because in theory, the Small
Blind could shove any two

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.570
cards profitably.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.630
But if the Small Blind isn't
actually shoving any two cards,

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.560
then maybe this is actually
the optimal range to call.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.080
If the Small Blind is shoving
too small, then maybe 25%

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.480
is the optimal
strategy for the Big

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.789
Blind from that point of view.

00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:56.580
So we can do a calculation
with Queen-Jack.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.270
So let's assume the Small
Blind only shoves top 25%

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.290
of hands instead of 100%.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.100
Then your equity is only 42%.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.320
And what equity do we
need to call all-in?

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.320
We need to call 14
Big Blinds, right?

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.690
We need to call 14 Big Blinds.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.980
And if we call,
the pot will be 31.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.420
So we need 14 over 31,
which is about 45% equity.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.170
We only have 42, so we actually
shouldn't call anymore.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.510
So it's possible the Big
Blinds play is correct.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:29.430
But the point is, someone's
play isn't correct.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.860
So I also wanted this
example to give you

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.900
another idea of what sort of
optimal Nash equilibrium play

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.050
is.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.630
So I'm going to--

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.540
so let's draw a chart of
what is in game theory called

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.990
an iterative best response.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.890
So how this works is, I fix
a strategy for one player.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.780
I take the best strategy
for the other player

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.340
at exploiting this strategy.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.260
And then I fix that
strategy, and I come back.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.480
So I fix the strategy
for the Big Blind, which

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.580
is only call 25% of hands.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.235
And then I ask myself, what's
the best way for the Small

00:30:59.235 --> 00:31:00.630
Blind to exploit this?

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.030
Well, it's to shove
100% of hands,

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.180
right, by the calculation.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.110
So now, if the Small Blind
is fixed on this strategy,

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.870
what's the best way for the
Big Blind to exploit this?

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.130
Well, it's to call with
anything basically,

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.880
because you know they're
shoving anything.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:23.340
So it's a call with a very
wide range, say, 67% of hands.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.680
So once the Big Blind
is calling too much,

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.900
how does the Small
Blind exploit this?

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.280
Well, now they
tighten up, right?

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.420
They only shove
their good hands.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.580
And that's fine, because
they're getting paid off

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.680
very often when they
shove their good hands.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.270
But once the Small
Blind realizes

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.992
they shove only
their good hands,

00:31:37.992 --> 00:31:39.450
then the Big Blind's
like, oh crap,

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.790
I shouldn't be
calling 67% anymore.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.450
I'm going to call less, 30%.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.297
So overall, let me
draw sort of a diagram

00:31:46.297 --> 00:31:47.380
of how it's going to work.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.120
So you can see, right?

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.180
0, 100 Small Blind.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:03.020
So essentially how it works is--

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.700
let me just put some markers.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.190
So how it's going
to start out is,

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:12.410
the Big Blind calls 25%,
right, which is here, 25%.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.860
And then the Small Blind, to
exploit this, shoves 100%.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.560
Then the Big Blind
goes to call 67%,

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.800
and then the Small Blind
will respond by shoving 40%.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.480
These numbers are
approximate, right?

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.180
Then the Small Blind
will shove too little,

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:29.330
and then the Big Blind will
sort of call too little.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:33.050
And then it'll essentially
go here, and then go here,

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.660
and then go here,
and then go here.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.850
So essentially, the point
is it's going to converge.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:43.250
It's going to zero in on this
blue line, on these blue lines.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.980
And the thing that
it zeroes in on

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.630
is basically what's called
the Nash equilibrium.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.630
So you can actually compute
the Nash equilibrium

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.940
with a computer in this
case, which is what I did.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.090
And this is what the
Nash equilibrium is.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.805
So the optimal thing to
do is for the Small Blind

00:32:58.805 --> 00:33:02.210
to shove about 66.8% of
hands, and the Big Bind

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:05.790
to call about 38.5% of hands.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:09.470
And I think if you
play reasonably,

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:12.110
reasonable stakes online
poker tournaments nowadays,

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.640
this is what most
people know how

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.760
to do because most people will
have a computer program that

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.760
can do this
calculation for them.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.500
But it's quite
loose, essentially.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.920
So remember, the situation was
15 Big Blinds, there are antes,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.170
and you're in the Small Blind.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.200
You should be shoving
2/3 of hands, roughly.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.130
And the Big Blind should be
calling almost 40% of hands.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.780
And this is the ranges.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.990
And as you can see, the Small
Blind can shove 4-3 suited.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.950
So suitedness is very important.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:46.780
But if your hand is unsuited,
then 7-6 offsuit is a shove.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.380
Oh, 6-5 offsuit it
as a shove, too.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.010
But 9-5 offsuit is not a
shove because it says 9-6

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:55.114
off plus, which means
9-5 off is not a shove.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.620
So it's always a good idea
to know the Nash thing just

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.460
for preflop.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.854
Because even if you're trying
to exploit your opponent,

00:34:03.854 --> 00:34:06.020
you want to make sure you're
never going too far off

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.239
from the optimal play.

00:34:07.239 --> 00:34:08.780
Because whenever
you get too far off,

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.904
you could potentially
be getting exploited.

00:34:13.904 --> 00:34:16.070
Yeah, but I mean, you don't
have to do exactly this.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.989
I'm not saying everyone
should do exactly this, right?

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.370
If you think you're
smarter than your opponent,

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.290
and you have a good
model than your opponent,

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:25.040
if you think the Big Blind is
calling way fewer than 38.5%

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.440
of hands, then you can go in
with a lot more than 66.8%

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.840
of hands.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.670
Just make sure if
you do decide to try

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.400
to exploit your opponent,
you do the exploitation

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.199
in the right direction.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:38.839
If they're calling too little,
then you need to shove a lot.

00:34:38.839 --> 00:34:40.380
If they're calling
too much, then you

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.463
need to shove very little.

00:34:41.463 --> 00:34:43.610
That makes sense
to everyone, right?

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.790
That's the right direction
to exploit your opponent.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.747
And similarly, if the
opponent is shoving too much,

00:34:49.747 --> 00:34:51.080
then you're going to call a lot.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.496
And if they're
shoving too little,

00:34:52.496 --> 00:34:54.210
then you call very
little as well.

00:34:57.089 --> 00:34:59.630
But Yeah, but what's good about
the Nash equilibrium strategy

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.170
is you can't be exploited.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:04.250
You know no matter what they
do-- the optimal, basically

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.390
the reason why this is
called the convergence point

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:11.630
is because if the Small
Blind is shoving 66.8%,

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.990
the best for the Big Blind
to do against that is 38.5%.

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:19.490
And the best you shove against
38.5% calling range is 66.8%.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.430
So it essentially
converges, that's why

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.500
it's called an equilibrium.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.190
So hopefully this gives you a
better, a more concrete example

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.950
for those of you who haven't
seen what a Nash equilibrium is

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:36.760
exactly, of what I mean by
optimal Level 3 reasoning play.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.330
OK, so that's enough of that.

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.600
So now let's go do
some concrete ranges.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.730
So now you can ask me, how do
we learn these ranges, right?

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.110
I showed you the Nash range
for one specific situation.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:50.275
But the situations
you can enumerate.

00:35:50.275 --> 00:35:51.650
There's going to
be a lot, right?

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.010
So I showed you the range for
Small Blind versus Big Blind,

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:58.099
and there's 15 Big Blinds.

00:35:58.099 --> 00:35:59.390
But what if it's 14 Big Blinds?

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.070
What if it's 13
Big Blinds, right?

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:04.730
What if it's 10 Big
Blinds with no ante?

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.590
So essentially
it's a combination

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:11.360
of memorization, understanding
theory, and then extrapolation

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.000
slash interpolation.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.525
So let me just show
you a few more.

00:36:16.525 --> 00:36:17.900
So just to give
you a rough idea,

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.690
this is where the memorization
slash interpretation comes in,

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:25.020
because if you have a few
baselines to go off of,

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.780
you can sort of use rules
that theoretically make sense

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.160
to extrapolate, right?

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.130
So here's button, 10 Big Blinds.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:38.390
43.9%, and this is
roughly the hands.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:43.400
Oh sorry, is it clear what
this range of hands means?

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.330
I guess I never
really explained.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:52.170
Basically s mean suited, o means
offsuit, and plus just means

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:58.050
any hand where the denominations
are strictly higher.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.680
If you don't know exactly what
it means, it's not a huge deal.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.180
But roughly, you want
to sort of know what

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.960
this is, what this is saying.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.700
So there's a few weird cases,
but roughly, if it says Ax+,

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.740
that means any Ace,
any hand with an Ace,

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.570
suited or unsuited
you can go all-in.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:24.360
So 43.9%-- So in
terms of extrapolation

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.195
and interpolation--

00:37:25.195 --> 00:37:26.570
I just want to
make sure everyone

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:27.750
gets the directions right.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.920
So if I move from
button to the cutoff,

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.680
does the fraction of
hands go up or down?

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.560
AUDIENCE: Down.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.880
WILL MA: Down, right?

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.880
So the fraction of hands goes
down because from the cutoff

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.760
there's more players
to get through, right?

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.140
So you need a better hand.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.430
You can't-- so the fraction of
hands you can shove goes down,

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.930
right?

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.096
That make sense to everyone?

00:37:50.096 --> 00:37:53.464
So make sure you get
the direction right.

00:37:53.464 --> 00:37:55.880
And then what if the number
of Big Blinds goes up or down?

00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.169
So let's say it's 15 Big Blinds.

00:38:00.169 --> 00:38:02.210
I guess 15 is sort of too
much to go all-in with,

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.059
but let's say it's
12 Big Blinds.

00:38:04.059 --> 00:38:06.350
Does someone have a guess
what the percentage might be?

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.320
You just have to get
the direction right.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:11.590
Someone?

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:12.215
Yeah?

00:38:12.215 --> 00:38:12.798
AUDIENCE: 40%.

00:38:12.798 --> 00:38:14.350
WILL MA: Yeah, 40%.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.550
That's about right.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.810
That's about right, basically.

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.300
So the percentage
will go down a bit.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.740
And what if you only
have 5 Big Blinds?

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.550
Does someone want to
guess the percentage?

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.140
AUDIENCE: 60%.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:24.931
WILL MA: 60%, yeah.

00:38:24.931 --> 00:38:26.360
That's about right.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.510
So try to get the
directions right.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:30.380
If you have a few
baseline points,

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.260
and if you can get
the directions right,

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.870
that's a very
important first step.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.020
So here's another data point.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.750
Cutoff, 7 Big Blinds.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.310
It's 38.8%.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.340
So notice that the cutoff,
this situation compared

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.000
to the first one, you're one
position worse because you're

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.350
cutoff instead of button.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.570
But you're risking a lot less,
so you only have 7 Big Blinds.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:55.880
But the percentage
is still going down.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.460
So I think I said
this first class

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.330
as well, the position matters a
lot more than the number of Big

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:04.142
Blinds because for the
number of Big Binds,

00:39:04.142 --> 00:39:05.600
even though you
are, in some sense,

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.620
risking a lot more as
you have more Big Blinds,

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.270
it's also harder to get called.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.040
If I go all in
for 10 Big Blinds,

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.810
they're going to fold
a lot more than if I

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.439
go all-in for 7 Big Blinds.

00:39:15.439 --> 00:39:17.230
So that's why the
position actually matters

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.130
a lot more than how many bets.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.530
OK, so lojack--

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:22.810
So that's hijack minus one.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:24.670
So that's two over
from the cutoff.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:25.620
It's only 28--

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:31.330
10 Big Blinds is only 23.4%,
but it's still nothing.

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:32.200
Not nothing.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.017
So under the gun nine
handed with 3 Big Blinds,

00:39:35.017 --> 00:39:36.100
it's actually pretty high.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:39.984
It's 24.1%.

00:39:39.984 --> 00:39:41.650
So you can go look
at those on your own.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:46.682
You can also calculate on
your own in certain websites.

00:39:46.682 --> 00:39:49.600
Yeah, so this will
roughly give you an idea

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.230
of the shape of the graph.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:53.230
So this is under
the gun all-ins.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.730
It's a bit approximated,
but with 15 Big Blinds--

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.352
I know I recommended with 15
Big Blinds not to go all-in.

00:39:59.352 --> 00:40:01.060
And I think that's a
good recommendation,

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.540
but let's say you told the
computer they were forced

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.340
to go all-in with 15
Big Blinds, and they

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.260
had to calculate the
Nash equilibrium,

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.770
this is what it would spit out.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.880
It would say, you go
all-in with this 6.2%.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.250
And with 10 Big
Blinds, it's 13.4%.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.380
With 5 Big Blinds, it's 33.3%.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.400
So it actually increases
quite a lot for under the gun.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.880
For under the gun, the amount
of the fraction of hands

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.300
you can wager as a function of
how many Big Blinds actually

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.809
goes up quite a lot.

00:40:29.809 --> 00:40:30.600
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.360
WILL MA: Yeah?

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.890
AUDIENCE: For example,
you have 15 Big Blinds,

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:43.420
and you get an Ace-Jack
offsuited, what would be--

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.490
how much would you raise?

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.339
WILL MA: Oh, I would raise to 2
Big Blinds, or 2.25 Big Blinds.

00:40:48.339 --> 00:40:49.172
AUDIENCE: That's it?

00:40:49.172 --> 00:40:49.671
Very little?

00:40:49.671 --> 00:40:51.030
WILL MA: Yeah.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.410
For all hands, I essentially
raise to 2.25 Big Blinds.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:57.130
AUDIENCE: But it goes from
2.25 Big Blinds to all-in?

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.254
There's no middle range?

00:40:58.254 --> 00:40:59.170
WILL MA: Right, right.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:00.336
There's no in between, yeah.

00:41:00.336 --> 00:41:03.580
So the reason
essentially is, there's--

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.690
so let's say you raise
to 5 Big Blinds, right?

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.060
This is essentially equivalent
to an all-in, except worse.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.640
So why is it equivalent
to an all-in?

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.370
Because if your opponent has
pocket Aces, or a good hand,

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.580
not necessarily pocket Aces,
they're going to go all-in.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.320
And pretty much,
you have to call.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.660
I mean, if you knew they
had exactly pocket Aces,

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.530
you could fold.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.110
But it's possible for them
to play a balanced strategy

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:28.230
where they could have
pocket Aces, or Ace-King,

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:32.860
or pocket 10s, or whatever, and
you're forced to call anyway.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.820
So essentially if you make it
any more than 2.25 Big Blinds,

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.270
you put in enough chips
that your opponent can just

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:43.880
play a strategy that forces you
to go all-in when they want to.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.150
And so it's basically
strictly worse than just

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.350
going all-in yourself.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.160
Yeah, good question.

00:41:51.724 --> 00:41:53.890
But yeah, with 15 Big Blinds,
I would recommend just

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:55.681
raising small, although
I don't think going

00:41:55.681 --> 00:41:58.450
all-in is the end of the world.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:01.640
OK, so this is roughly what the
shape of the curve looks like.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.610
So here's another example.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:07.330
So for hijack, from 15 Big
Blinds to 10 Big Blinds,

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:08.942
it actually changes very little.

00:42:08.942 --> 00:42:10.150
I guess it changes somewhat--

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.700
23.4% to 28%.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.920
And then with 5 Big Blinds,
it goes up very fast.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.490
So as the number of Big Blinds
goes down, it increases a lot.

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:22.540
But the difference-- but
the change from 15 to 10

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.386
isn't that much.

00:42:23.386 --> 00:42:24.760
I guess under the
gun it's a lot,

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.480
but for hijack,
it's not that much.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.690
So just give you some ideas.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:30.870
I don't expect anyone
to do this perfectly.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.190
I'm trying-- I gave you
a bit of data points.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.370
Just try your best
to extrapolate a lot,

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:40.410
try your best to extrapolate
slash interpolate.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.400
If you're off by a
lot, that's fine.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.100
The biggest thing is, just try
not to get the direction wrong.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.440
Don't think, if I'm
one position worse,

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.510
I can shove more
hands, or something.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:54.340
So a few more pointers
about going all-in preflop.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.270
So here, this is definitely
a good play, I think.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.510
So you have pocket
fours from hijack.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.410
You have 15 Big Blinds,
which is more than what I

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:03.880
said you should go all-in with.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.060
But I think-- but going
all-in is a good play,

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:10.370
instead of just raising to
two times the Big Blind.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.100
Because small pairs,
while having good

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:16.730
implied odds when very deep--

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.430
so in the last class, I talked
to you about set mining.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.670
I said small pairs are great
when you have 100 Big Blinds

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.470
because you can try to
hit three of a kind,

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.720
and just win a massive
amount of money when you do.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.460
But they actually have
terrible implied odds

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:34.040
when it's 20 Big Blinds
deep because you only

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.870
hit three of a kind
one eighth of the time.

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:38.530
When you do, the total
effective stack size

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.880
is not enough for you
to recoup your losses.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.962
And when you don't,
you're just always going

00:43:42.962 --> 00:43:44.670
to be sitting there
with a pair of fours,

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.044
and there's always going to
be higher cards on the board.

00:43:47.044 --> 00:43:49.100
It's going to be Ace,
Jack, 10, and you're always

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.099
playing a guessing game.

00:43:50.099 --> 00:43:51.710
Does my opponent
have a better pair?

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:54.540
And you just can't
make good decisions.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.500
So that's why with small
pairs, just going all-in, even

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.607
for a lot of Big
Blinds, is reasonable.

00:44:01.607 --> 00:44:02.690
So here's another example.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:03.551
Queen-8's good.

00:44:03.551 --> 00:44:05.300
Normally you wouldn't
go all-in with that.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.100
You normally would
just fold under the gun

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.183
if you had a lot of chips.

00:44:08.183 --> 00:44:13.340
But with only 5 Big Blinds,
going all-in is fine.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.280
Another factor that's actually
sort of relevant here is--

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.410
this is sort of a
higher level thing,

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.900
but it's good to keep in mind
is, when you're under the gun,

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.020
in some sense you
have the least to lose

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.970
by busting the tournament.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.589
So by going all-in, you're
risking busting the tournament.

00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:31.880
So this is not true in a cash
game, but in a tournament

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.065
it's true.

00:44:33.065 --> 00:44:34.940
You want to go all-in
from under the gun when

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.560
you're really, really short.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.800
You have very little to lose
by busting the tournament

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.920
because if you don't bust the
tournament, the next hand,

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.440
you're the Big Blind,
which really, really sucks.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.501
So even though you
busted the tournament,

00:44:47.501 --> 00:44:50.000
you busted the tournament in a
situation where the next hand

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.890
you would have had to
pay the blind, which

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:54.110
is one fifth that your
stack, in this case.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.140
So going all-in is OK.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:59.810
Ace-2 suited is another
example of a hand that's

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:01.220
pretty good to go all-in with.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.430
Because if they have a better
Ace, you're still suited,

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.470
so you have chances
of catching up.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:10.490
And the fact that
you remove an Ace,

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:12.550
there's less Aces out
there for them to have,

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.831
is quite relevant, actually.

00:45:14.831 --> 00:45:16.580
The fact that there's
three Aces out there

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:20.214
for them to make a good hand to
call you with, than being four.

00:45:20.214 --> 00:45:21.630
Everyone know what
I mean by that?

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:24.200
So if you have an Ace,
there's one less out there

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.420
to go around.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:30.480
Yeah, so we go all-in here.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.050
And yeah, here we have 17 and
1/2 Big Blinds from the button.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.227
But I think going all-in with
Ace-4 off is fine, basically.

00:45:39.227 --> 00:45:39.810
So it's a lot.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:45.820
It's 17 and 1/2 Big Blinds,
but once again, Ace-x offsuit

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.600
has terrible implied odds.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.970
It also protects your
small pair shoves a bit.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:55.670
So when I said this
pocket twos hand--

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.630
sorry, this pocket
fours hand, I said

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.120
you can go all in
for 15 Big Blinds.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.290
But what's one problem if you
follow this strategy exactly?

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.240
It's whenever you do
this, your opponent

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:09.226
knows you have pocket twos
or pocket threes, right?

00:46:09.226 --> 00:46:10.740
Then what can they do?

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.960
They can call with 10-9 suited,
which is not a good hand.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.480
Like 10 high against
a 15 Big Blind shove

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.370
shouldn't be possible,
but they can.

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:25.420
So if you also do this with
Ace-x, it protects you a bit.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.800
Yeah, with 7-6 suited,
I think it's also OK.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.440
This is a similar
story, pocket Deuces.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:34.310
7-6 suited has great implied
odds when you're 100 bets deep,

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:37.290
and making straights and
flushes is very relevant.

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:40.520
But when you're
only 20 bets deep,

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.350
and you're just trying
to make a big pair,

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.750
essentially, small
cards just aren't good

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.700
at making big pairs,
can't make big pairs.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:53.610
So once again, going
on is acceptable.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.800
So one thing to
watch out for is--

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.500
I actually swept
this under the rug

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.130
in the last couple of slides.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.330
But in all these
cases I showed you,

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:05.920
there's actually a pretty big
disincentive to go all-in.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.182
Does anyone see what it is by
looking at the stack sizes?

00:47:09.182 --> 00:47:10.890
So they've always been
the same actually,

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:14.077
but does someone see a
pretty big disincentive?

00:47:14.077 --> 00:47:14.660
Yeah, Vincent?

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:19.080
AUDIENCE: Other people have
much larger stacks than you.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.850
WILL MA: Right,
although actually I

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:23.141
should say this, other people
having much larger stacks

00:47:23.141 --> 00:47:25.950
than me is actually an
incentive to go all-in.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:29.340
The reason being,
it's possible--

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.640
let's say you go all-in and
then someone calls, and then

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.030
another guy re-raises all-in
and the first guy who called

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:37.430
folded.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:41.370
Then what would happen
is, you're still all-in.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.520
And if you win the pot, you now
triple up instead of double up,

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.852
and you still only
have to beat one hand.

00:47:46.852 --> 00:47:48.220
Did that make sense?

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.700
I can draw it if it
didn't make sense.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.370
So you go all-in for $5,400.

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.542
So let's say this
guy calls for $5,400.

00:47:56.542 --> 00:47:57.750
Let me use a different color.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.060
This guy calls for $5,400.

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:04.080
And then let's say this guy
goes all-in for $12,000.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.330
And then this guy folds--

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:06.810
which he shouldn't be doing
because he definitely has

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:08.790
odds to call, but
let's say he does fold.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.190
Then the situation is great
because how the rules work

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:12.870
is, now the pot--

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:17.820
so now this guy is going
to get back $6,600.

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:22.230
And the pot-- But $5,400 of
his is still in the middle.

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:24.780
And essentially, there's
this $5,400, this $5,400,

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.490
and your $5,400.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:28.747
And you're only
against his hand.

00:48:28.747 --> 00:48:30.330
And if you win, you
get all the money.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.860
So you actually triple
up instead of double up.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.080
So that's actually
a good incentive.

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.500
But yeah, that's a
good observation.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.624
Yeah?

00:48:38.624 --> 00:48:41.287
AUDIENCE: Because your
going all-in is profitable

00:48:41.287 --> 00:48:43.370
because there's a high
probability of other people

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.950
folding.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.866
But if two people call
or three people call,

00:48:45.866 --> 00:48:49.520
you get a lot of
people can call it,

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.832
and then your odds are not
very good when they call.

00:48:51.832 --> 00:48:52.810
WILL MA: Right, right.

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:54.018
Yeah, that is relevant, yeah.

00:48:54.018 --> 00:48:56.790
So multiple people
can call, but the Nash

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:59.350
ranges that I presented
do take that into account.

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:03.050
So the Nash ranges,
the Nash calculations

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.786
do take into account that
multiple people can call.

00:49:05.786 --> 00:49:07.770
You have to look carefully
at the stack sizes.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:08.682
Yeah?

00:49:08.682 --> 00:49:10.510
AUDIENCE: [? They now only ?]
have $2,100?

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.430
WILL MA: Right, good.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:12.390
Good.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:15.320
Damn, I wish I'd brought one
of those gift certificates.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.064
I still have some, but OK.

00:49:17.064 --> 00:49:18.480
So this is actually
very relevant.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.270
And I swept this
under the rug, but let

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:22.410
me clear the annotation.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:25.050
The Big Blind only
has four bets,

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:29.160
only has 4 Big Blinds
in this situation.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.100
And they're basically
guaranteed to call.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.600
That's not a terrible
result for you

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.485
because there's a good chance
that just have absolute trash,

00:49:35.485 --> 00:49:37.670
and Queen-7 suited
is better than them.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:41.190
But it's still worse than
being able to steal the Big

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:42.330
Blind for free.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:44.910
So the fact that the Big
Blind is so short here

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:47.310
that they're basically
almost guaranteed to call,

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:50.850
maybe they'll fold 3-2 offsuit
is really, really bad for you.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:53.400
Because your chances
of just winning down--

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.820
taking out the blinds without
having to win an all-in

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:59.340
is a lot lower.

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.139
That make sense to everyone?

00:50:01.139 --> 00:50:03.180
So it's hard to do when
you're just starting out,

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:04.770
but it's good to
pay attention to all

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:06.180
the different stack sizes.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:08.950
And if there's someone
behind, someone in the blinds

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:12.000
who is very short and who's
almost guaranteed to go all-in,

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.090
then you should be a lot
less incentivized to try

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:18.160
to steal the blinds.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:18.940
Yeah?

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.898
All right guys, I'm going
to get started again.

00:50:23.965 --> 00:50:28.770
So I'm going to give you a few
more examples of extrapolation.

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:32.100
I know this is a bit boring,
but to be honest, I think--

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.860
this is less exciting than
playing postflop, and reading

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:38.080
your opponent, and trying to
read what cards they have,

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.570
and trying to make
tricky bluffs.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:43.170
But really, in
tournaments, the best skill

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:45.840
you can have when just
learning, just starting out

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.090
is knowing when to go all-in.

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:51.960
Because even if you're pretty
good at it versus very good

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.810
at it, the fact that,
because most hands just

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:56.940
come down to going
all-in preflop,

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.790
if you can increase
your equity every time

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:05.580
you do this by even 1%, that's
a huge game in terms of how

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.790
profitable a player you'll be.

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:09.240
So yeah, it's a bit boring.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.840
But just try to bear with me.

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.250
This is, like, the
most important skill

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:16.290
in tournaments, essentially.

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:20.250
So I wrote down on this
graph the most number

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:23.580
of Big Blinds I'm
willing to risk all-in

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.590
for from each position.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.340
So I want to sort of
illustrate a concept.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.060
These numbers are actually
quite ambitious, by the way.

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.990
I think I made this
maybe four years ago

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:34.320
when I was trying to play
exploitatively against the fact

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.530
that the average
player was too tight,

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:41.130
the average player was not
willing to call often enough.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:45.300
So you would be shove
more hands than Nash

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.960
because most players
don't call enough.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.610
Nowadays, I think people
are getting closer to Nash,

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:52.275
so you can't really be
this ambitious anymore.

00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:53.900
All these numbers
should go down a bit.

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.941
You shouldn't be going
all-in for that many bets.

00:51:55.941 --> 00:51:58.730
But nonetheless, the graphs
illustrate the same point.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.410
So I roughly-- I
wrote down in black

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:03.480
how many bets I'm
willing to risk

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.390
from each position
with Ace-4 offsuit.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:10.500
So notice that from the
button it's huge, it's 22.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.170
But under the gun, it's a lot
smaller-- it's only seven.

00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:20.010
And roughly, it
decreases as a 1 over x,

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:22.260
curve as a inverse curve.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.110
And that's sort of
intuitive because if you

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:27.990
shove from the button, you need
to be the best out of three

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:29.580
hands, so it's like 1 over 3.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.163
And then you got to be the best
out of four, so it's 1 over 4,

00:52:32.163 --> 00:52:34.300
and then 1 over 5,
1 over 6, et cetera.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.970
So the graph is roughly--

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:38.670
I mean, I don't
know, let's say 88

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:40.590
over number of hands remaining.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.680
Or I don't know,
something like that.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.626
But I want to show a similar
curve with 7-6 suited.

00:52:47.626 --> 00:52:49.500
So what do you notice
about these two curves?

00:52:52.272 --> 00:52:54.230
AUDIENCE: Looks more
linear than the other one.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.855
WILL MA: Right.

00:52:54.855 --> 00:52:56.920
So this one is very curved.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.050
This one is like 1 of x.

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:00.940
This one is maybe there's like--

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.760
this one it's a
lot flatter, right?

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.830
It's 9.5 under the gun, which
is more than 7.7 for Ace-4.

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:14.310
But Ace-4, it's 22
from the button,

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:18.370
whereas for 7-6, it's only 19.

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:21.650
So the thing is, these two
hands are a bit different.

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:27.040
So essentially with
Ace-4 off, it's

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.730
a hand that does poorly
against good hands,

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:34.060
but well against bad hands
because against a bad hand,

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.629
your Ace high is
going to be good.

00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:38.170
And against a good hand, you're
always going to be dominated.

00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:41.650
Like, if they call with an
Ace-Jack, or a pair of 7s,

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.720
you're going to
be at 30/70, right

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.530
Whereas with 7-6, even if they
have Aces, I mean, it's bad,

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:49.330
but it's the best
hand against Aces.

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:53.291
But basically 7-6, you're
going to be better on average.

00:53:53.291 --> 00:53:55.540
If they call with Ace-King,
it's not a good situation,

00:53:55.540 --> 00:54:00.000
but it's much better
than if you had Ace-4,

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.250
whereas if they
have 8-2 offsuit,

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:05.500
which is a terrible hand,
that actually, theoretically

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.670
is ahead of yours.

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:10.375
So what's the most
important thing about 7-6

00:54:10.375 --> 00:54:12.310
suited and going on with it?

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:14.290
Essentially it's
having a lot of chips,

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:16.300
it's having a large stack.

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:21.820
Because you want them to fold
all of their trash hands.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.910
And it's good when they're not
going to call you very often.

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:26.600
So you want to
have a lot of bets.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.230
Whereas for Ace-4, the
most important thing is--

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:32.012
you don't mind if they call,
as they call with a bad hand.

00:54:32.012 --> 00:54:33.970
So the most important
thing you want with Ace-4

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:37.000
is, you want to be later
in position so that you're

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.210
against your hands so that
there's less of a chance

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:44.170
that someone behind is going to
pick up Ace-Jack or pocket 10s.

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:47.050
So when you're extrapolating
slash interpolating,

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:49.450
try to remember this principle.

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:52.270
So with a suited
connector hand, it

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:55.920
matters a lot more how
many bets you have.

00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:01.030
Whereas with a hand with two
unsuited but sort of big cards,

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:04.130
like Ace-4 offsuit,
King-8 offsuit,

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.340
I guess Queen-7
offsuit or whatever,

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.500
the thing that matters
most is having few players

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:09.400
left to act behind.

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:17.070
So I talked to you a lot about
how do you initiate all-ins

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:18.730
from preflop.

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:20.920
So what about calling
other people's all-ins?

00:55:26.702 --> 00:55:28.660
So another thing that I
sometimes see people do

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:32.500
is fold with ridiculously
good odds preflop.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:35.590
And similarly how you can
shove any two cards preflop,

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:39.490
you can also call a lot
preflop because you'll always

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:42.280
have some equity.

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.560
So yeah, it's difficult
to get less than 30%

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.070
equity preflop no matter
what your cards are,

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:51.160
unless your opponent has
a really strong range.

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.220
Like they're really tight, and
you know Jacks plus an Ace-King

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.580
or something.

00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:57.440
It's difficult. to
have less than 30%

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.610
equity if you have an
Ace in your hand, right?

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.720
Because if you have
an Ace, then you're

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.200
either going to have an over
card, at least, to their pair,

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.430
or be dominated.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:08.380
But both of those
are still 30/70s.

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.360
Only if they have
Aces are you actually

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.990
in a really bad situation.

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:16.330
So I wanted to show
you a hand here

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:19.000
that looks maybe a bit like
bad play to some of you,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.840
but I think it's
very reasonable play.

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.210
So we have 9-8 suited,
we have 15 Big Blinds

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:26.620
so we don't go all-in, right?

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:27.310
Which is fine.

00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:29.620
We may get $1.600.

00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.950
And then it's folded
to the Big Blind,

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:39.910
but the Big Blind goes
all-in for 10 Big Blinds.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.280
So normally, if the Big
Blind had covered us,

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.560
if they had 15 Big
Blinds, you would probably

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.570
fold because you have 9 high.

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:50.110
You probably-- you don't
have enough odds to call.

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.660
But in this specific case,
the effective stack size

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.400
is not 15 Big Blinds, right?

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.065
They only have 10 Big Blinds,
so the effective stack size

00:56:57.065 --> 00:56:58.580
is 10 Big Blinds.

00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:01.450
So if you do the math,
when the effective stack

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:05.440
size is only 10 Big
Blinds, basically you

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.530
have enough equity to call.

00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:11.860
Even if they had 12 Big Blinds,
maybe it's very borderline.

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:15.520
But even if they have 12 Big
Blinds, roughly speaking,

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.320
you have enough
equity to call, right?

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.180
This is sort of the
same calculation as me

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.820
saying, if you had
12 or less Big Blinds

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.070
and you raise, and
someone goes all-in,

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.547
you basically have to call.

00:57:25.547 --> 00:57:27.130
This is sort of a
similar calculation.

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:27.963
It's the same thing.

00:57:27.963 --> 00:57:31.540
You raised, someone went all-in,
it's effectively 12 Big Blinds,

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:32.320
and you can call.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.010
So this is a totally
reasonable play.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:36.870
And then you just call.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:39.700
If you do the math, you
need 37% equity to call.

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.970
It's possible in some corner
cases you can convince yourself

00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:46.450
that you don't have 37%
equity, but for the most part,

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:50.689
I see a lot more bigger mistakes
by people folding this spot.

00:57:50.689 --> 00:57:52.980
If you call, you're never
really making a huge mistake.

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:55.500
OK, fine, if they're
sort of tight,

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:59.109
maybe you only had 35%
equity, and you needed 37.

00:57:59.109 --> 00:58:00.150
You made a small mistake.

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.580
But there are situations
similar to this

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:07.940
where you might have 45%
equity and you only 37% equity.

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.840
So it's a huge mistake.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.210
Folding can be a big mistake,
but calling is rarely

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:17.460
a huge mistake when it's
12 Big Blinds or less.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.980
So any hand that we would
raise here in the first place,

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.320
we probably would have
enough equity to call.

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.950
If I had 7-2 offsuit here,
I probably would not call.

00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:28.890
But I would not raise
here with 7-2 offsuit.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.650
So any that you
would've chosen to open

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:35.850
here, which is about 30% of
hands, or 25% percent of hands

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:38.157
I think you can call.

00:58:38.157 --> 00:58:40.740
Here's another situation that
we sort of talked about already.

00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:43.920
You have 4 Big Blinds, and
you had to pay a Big Blind.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.160
Basically you pretty much have
to play close to any two cards

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.970
in this spot.

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:52.410
If you do the calculation,
right, you only need to call--

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:54.905
I mean, calling is equivalent
to going all-in, sort of.

00:58:54.905 --> 00:58:56.280
If you go all-in,
you know you're

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.062
getting called
because they're going

00:58:59.062 --> 00:59:04.200
to have almost four to one
odds, so they're going to call.

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.210
So essentially the
calculation is,

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:09.150
do I want to wager my
entire stack on this hand?

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:12.690
And you're risking 3 Big
Blinds for a total pot

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:14.760
of 9 and 1/2 Big Blinds.

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.000
So essentially, you only
need 30% equity to call.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:24.120
And 30% equity is very easy
to have preflop, essentially.

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:26.240
So basically you have
to play any two cards.

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.050
Queen-8 off is way
more than good enough.

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:32.400
Yeah, so this is
basically the calculation

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.410
I just went through.

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:37.890
And yeah, like here I
think I would probably

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:40.380
play 95% of hands.

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:43.350
I think I'll fold 3-2
offsuit, 4-2 offsuit,

00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:45.660
but I'll probably play any
hand with a card that's

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:49.470
10 or higher, and I'll probably
play every suited hand.

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.780
So let's talk a bit of
re-raising all-in preflop now.

00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.749
And all the situations I showed
you were just going all-in,

00:59:59.749 --> 01:00:00.915
and someone calling preflop.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:06.330
So I wanted to show you.

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:08.172
So don't do this,
don't call preflop.

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:09.630
I already talked
to you about this,

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:12.780
but especially when
you have 10 Big Blinds.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:15.450
So once again here, don't just
raise when you only have 10

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:16.350
Big Blinds.

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:19.800
That's less than 12,
so you can go all-in.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.800
Yeah, so you basically either
want to go all-in or fold.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.360
But I want to talk
about raising now.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.290
So why is this so
bad, but this is OK

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:32.780
when we have more Big Blinds?

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:40.530
So now everyone has
19 and 1/2 Big Blinds.

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:43.380
So why is this OK?

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:45.282
The main reason is because--

01:00:45.282 --> 01:00:47.490
so in the first case, right--
so I talked about this.

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:49.920
If you get caught, if
someone goes all-in,

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.460
basically you have
to call anyway.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.460
So you might as well
go all-in yourself

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.580
because you're not getting away
if they pick up a good hand.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.226
So that's the same calculation.

01:00:59.226 --> 01:01:00.600
I'm just going to
skip that part.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.860
It's the same calculation.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.660
Essentially it's just
saying there's no point

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:08.220
to not go all-in because if
someone else goes all-in,

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.752
we're essentially roped
into calling anyway.

01:01:10.752 --> 01:01:12.210
So the second case,
we can get out.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.764
We can fold.

01:01:13.764 --> 01:01:15.180
So let's keep this
in mind, right?

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.846
So in this case, we
can definitely fold.

01:01:16.846 --> 01:01:19.180
So we can do the calculation.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.930
In this case, we need
to call 17 Big Blinds

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:24.150
to win a total pot of 40.5.

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:26.140
We need 42% equity.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.960
And we almost certainly
don't have this

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.690
because we raised
from early position,

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:33.000
they went all-in against
an early position raise,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.070
so they probably
have a good hand.

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:37.790
We're almost certainly
going to be a 30/70.

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:44.220
So let's look at whether
we call or re-raise.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.420
So for re-raise
sizing, so now let's

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.180
put ourselves in his shoes.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.660
If he's re-raising-- sort
of the same principles

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.430
apply when you're re-raising.

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:56.250
So the advantage of
re-raising to a small size

01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:59.260
is that, what if it's deep
enough where he could re-raise,

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:03.110
and we could four bet,
re-raise again, and go all-in.

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:05.820
Then they could fold, if they
were intending to do that.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.710
The advantage of
re-raising to a large size

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:10.560
is you deny your opponent
the odds to call profitably.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.780
And once again, if
your re-raise size

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.000
would cause you to
commit a critical portion

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.920
of your stack such
that you can't escape,

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.420
you're going to
go all-in anyway,

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.980
then you might as well
just re-raise all-in.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.605
So it's essentially
the same principle,

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:25.190
but let's see this in action.

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:26.904
So this is what you
don't want to do.

01:02:26.904 --> 01:02:28.320
And I see some
players doing this,

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.340
which is fine because I've
is never really explained

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.040
this in class.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.800
But if someone raises,
let's say to $2,000,

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.237
you don't really want to
just click the raise button.

01:02:37.237 --> 01:02:39.570
This is what would happen if
you click the raise button.

01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:43.980
Because he raised $1,200--
from $800 to $2,000.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.460
So if you click
the raise button,

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.209
this is the minimum
amount you could lose.

01:02:47.209 --> 01:02:49.534
You can raise it to
$2,000 plus $1,200.

01:02:49.534 --> 01:02:51.450
But if you look at the
odds you're giving him,

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:53.060
it's actually ludicrous.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.600
They have to call $1,200.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.110
So they would have
to call $1,200,

01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:04.170
and the pot will be
$5,000, $5,200 $6,400--

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.844
essentially $7,200.

01:03:05.844 --> 01:03:06.870
So it's $6,100, right?

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:10.860
They got to call $1,200
into a pot of $7,200.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.090
So this size is
basically way too small.

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.492
So how big do you
want to make it?

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:22.700
So roughly speaking, you want
to make it 2.5 times their open.

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:25.830
I think that's a
reasonable rule.

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:28.350
There's a lot of factors
that can affect this,

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:30.200
but if you're not
sure what to do,

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.540
a reasonable rule for
re-raising preflop

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:36.020
is 2.5 times what the
original guy raised.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.520
If you're out of
position, you might

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.110
want to raise a bit
more because there's

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:40.790
more incentive for
them to call if they

01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:44.090
can play in position postflop.

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:46.340
But I think in this
specific spot, this $5,000

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.405
is a good size.

01:03:49.405 --> 01:03:52.270
I'm going to skip to this slide.

01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:55.870
But in this case actually--

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:57.550
can we see our stack size?

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:02.880
So our stack size
is only $20,000.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.450
So in this case, I think
going on, it's a bit big.

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:10.670
So the thing is, if
you're going to re-raise,

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:12.555
it's the same
principle again where

01:04:12.555 --> 01:04:17.220
if the amount you re-raise
to is more than a quarter

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.400
of your stack, which sort
of means you're committed

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.680
and you can't escape, then
you might as well just

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.900
go all-in yourself.

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.980
So I'd say in this hand, if
you had less than $18,000,

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.100
I would just go all-in.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.220
Because you can't really escape.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.310
Even in this specific case
where you have $20,000,

01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:38.160
I don't think it's terrible
to just go all-in instead

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.980
of making it only $5,000
because it's pretty hard to fold

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.250
a hand is good as Ace-King,
even if you make it $5,000,

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:48.210
and then he goes
all-in for $20,000.

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:51.360
But I think $20,000 is enough
that you can make it $5,000.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.130
And you can do this
with your good hands.

01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:54.838
You can also do this
with your bad hands,

01:04:54.838 --> 01:04:56.910
sometimes as a bluff
to balance it out.

01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:01.460
And you can fold when you do
have a bluff and he goes on.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.940
So that's roughly the sizing
you want to make at preflop.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.100
And another thing I
want to say is, why

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.360
is calling a preflop raise OK?

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.130
So I said in the first class,
if no one has entered the pot,

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:15.810
and you're just
attacking the Blinds,

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:17.227
you always want to raise.

01:05:17.227 --> 01:05:19.310
You always want to raise
to give yourself a chance

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:20.830
to win the Blinds for free.

01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:23.730
You don't want the Blinds to be
able to see the flop for free.

01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:26.340
But if someone has
already raised,

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.750
I think it's OK to call.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:30.030
I mean, a hand like Ace-King
is sort of too good,

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:32.820
but if you have an Ace-Jack
suited or Ace-Queen suited,

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:35.280
I think just calling is fine.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.210
So why is this?

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:42.270
So it's because-- the reason
why, in the first case,

01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:47.660
there's no real advantage
to not raising, just calling

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:51.510
is because if a Big
Blind has a good hand,

01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:53.520
they can still raise anyway.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.170
So it doesn't matter.

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:57.810
But in this case, there
isn't a huge incentive

01:05:57.810 --> 01:05:59.370
to not re-raise, right?

01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:02.280
What is the huge incentive here?

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.240
So let me go back here.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.120
What's the huge incentive
to just call for $2,000

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.740
instead of make it $5,000
is, if you make it $5,000,

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.770
then you give him the
option to go all-in, right?

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:15.495
This is a huge difference.

01:06:15.495 --> 01:06:18.146
In the case where you're
just raising the Big Blind,

01:06:18.146 --> 01:06:19.020
they can't go all-in.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.850
But here you're
giving him an option.

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:22.350
So that's why you just
want to call sometimes

01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:24.475
so that they can't have
the option of going all-in.

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.210
So this is a good example.

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:34.140
So this is now a different
scenario, but it's very--

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.910
the Blinds are only
25/50, and players

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:42.130
have $8,000, which is,
I guess, 160 Big Blinds.

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:46.590
And here, calling is definitely
a positive expectancy play

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:48.902
because you're in position,
it's very, very deep,

01:06:48.902 --> 01:06:50.610
there's a lot of money
still to play for,

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:53.026
and you're in position for all
the rest of the hand, which

01:06:53.026 --> 01:06:54.280
is great.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.730
This is a good play.

01:06:56.730 --> 01:07:01.380
So if you raise in this spot, it
could lead to disaster, right?

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.540
So what happens
here is you raise,

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.770
and then now hijack minus one,
the guy who originally raised,

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:09.130
they now have an option
to re-raise again,

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:10.300
which is what they do.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.840
And now it's just terrible.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.120
We basically have to fold.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.150
We could call if
we're feeling lucky,

01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:18.180
but we basically have to fold.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.660
And I think calling is actually,
in reality, a reasonable play.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.270
But basically, it's a
much worse situation

01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:27.047
than this one where
we just called.

01:07:27.047 --> 01:07:28.380
So yeah, that's a demonstration.

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.547
So if someone's already
raised, you can just call.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:32.380
I'm going to talk more
about this next class

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.220
as well, a preflop
strategy against someone

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.240
who's already raised.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.900
But that's one thing
to keep in mind.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.650
Another thing I want
to go through quickly

01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:42.570
is how do you deal with callers.

01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:44.310
So I've said that
you should never

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:47.200
be just calling a pot when
the pot hasn't been raised.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.320
But people will inevitably
make this mistake.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:53.190
And usually if it's folded to
someone, no intention to pot

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:55.440
yet, and someone
just calls, we call--

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.840
the term in poker
is a limper, which

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.220
is a bit of a derogatory term.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.146
Poker actually has a
lot of derogatory terms,

01:08:02.146 --> 01:08:03.270
which is a bit unfortunate.

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:07.290
But I sort of have the tough
decision of either making up

01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:10.590
my own terminology, but then
if you go into the poker world,

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:12.300
no one understands
what you're saying.

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.780
Or I use the same terminology,
which is derogatory.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.000
But OK.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.350
So we're just going
to call them limpers.

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:23.370
Either way, you need to be
prepared and raise their limps.

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:27.560
But you do need to change your
raise size if there's limpers.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.229
So let's say normally
when it's deep,

01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:33.399
you decide to raise to 3
Big Blinds, which is fine.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:35.193
I mean, I said raise
to 2.25, but I think

01:08:35.193 --> 01:08:36.359
it's fine if you raise to 3.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.490
It doesn't matter that
much when it's deep.

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:40.810
You can raise to 3
to play bigger pots.

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:42.660
But if there's a lot
of limpers ahead,

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.052
then you want to
make it more than 3

01:08:46.052 --> 01:08:47.760
because there's already
money in the pot.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.560
So if you only raise
it to 3, you're

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.047
actually giving them to
good of odds to call.

01:08:52.047 --> 01:08:53.880
So let's say in this
case, I only make it 3.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.930
If I only make it
$150, then by the time

01:08:57.930 --> 01:09:00.510
it's folded to the last
guy, their odds of calling

01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:06.420
are going to be-- they put in
$100 into a pot of #375, right?

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:10.260
So that's like 3.75 to 1
odds, so that's too good.

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.640
So roughly, the
odds-- the rule is,

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.569
take whatever size you
were going to raise to,

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:17.660
and then add a Big
Blind for each limper.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.410
This essentially makes
it so that the odds

01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:20.710
are the same as before.

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:23.399
So in this case, if you
were going to make it 3,

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:25.552
I would make it 3
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1

01:09:25.552 --> 01:09:26.802
because there's three limpers.

01:09:29.609 --> 01:09:32.880
And of course, if you
only have 15 Big Blinds,

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:36.060
then in this case, instead of
raising it to 6 Big Blinds,

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.370
you might as well
just go all-in, right?

01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:40.649
The fact that you only raise
to 6 Big Blinds instead

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:43.380
of going all-in is
predicated on you

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.310
having at least 25
[AUDIO OUT] to start the hand.

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:51.210
Or something where it's
enough to escape if something

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:54.180
weird happens after.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.270
I'm going to finish off showing
you some more simple preflop

01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:58.200
situations.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.010
I think-- so the theme
this is being boring.

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:04.350
Oh, I'm sorry about this slide.

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:07.360
So being boring, being
simple, just playing

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.700
on simple probabilities
and using calculators

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.770
can get you very far in poker.

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:16.624
And I will go
through crazy bluffs

01:10:16.624 --> 01:10:18.790
and exciting hand reads and
stuff like that as well.

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:21.914
But this class, I wanted
to stress the simple things

01:10:21.914 --> 01:10:22.830
that I think are good.

01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:29.540
So here, this is a situation.

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.215
So here you have 4-3 suited.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.630
You're too scared to go all-in.

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.580
Can I raise to 2 Big
Blinds as an alternative?

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.290
Oh, so you're the button.

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:42.510
So the button only
has 8 Big Blinds.

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:44.390
They started the
hand with $1,600,

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:50.040
and they make it $400
with only $1,200 behind.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.200
So I want to show you
why this can go wrong.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.150
Why is it bad if you don't
follow the all-in rule?

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:57.880
Because now let's say the
Big Blind has 4-3 suited.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.720
Well, if he went all
in for 8 Big Blinds,

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.340
they would have to
fold their 4 high.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.540
I'm not going to run through
the calculation again.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.230
But the problem is now, if
you make it 2 Big Blinds,

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:12.420
they could actually call your
small raise with 4-3 suited.

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.063
And they have 4.5 to 1
odds, and that's definitely

01:11:15.063 --> 01:11:16.146
good enough odds for them.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:26.130
So if our hand has 40%
equity against his range,

01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:27.600
then it's going to be +EV.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.870
So essentially
they're going to call,

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:34.110
and they're not going
to raise the 4-3 suited.

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:37.860
So basically they could-- so the
fact that we didn't go all-in

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.360
gives them an option, here.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.110
With their good hands,
they can go all-in,

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:45.330
and rope us into getting all-in
anyway when we're the button.

01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:46.860
And with their bad
hands, like 4-3

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.840
suited that they don't
want to go all-in with,

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.180
they can still call
and see a flop.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.411
But the point is, we're
essentially-- this

01:11:53.411 --> 01:11:54.660
is essentially their strategy.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:55.330
You can read it.

01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:57.204
I'm not going to read
through this slide now.

01:11:57.204 --> 01:12:01.290
But the point is, we're giving
them an opportunity to make

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:03.420
a better play than they
otherwise could've.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.880
If we just went all-in,
the choice is theirs.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.500
They either call or they fold.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:10.140
But here, essentially they
can take their best hands,

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.680
and they want to get all-in
with and go all-in, and we call.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.590
Or with their worst
hands, like 4-3 suited

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:18.300
that can still
call to see a flop,

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.132
they can call and see a flop.

01:12:20.132 --> 01:12:21.840
And we're just letting
them realize a lot

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.810
more equity than we need to.

01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.100
So let's say, OK, fine.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.650
If you want to get around
that, you can make it $800.

01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:31.994
And if we make it $800, it's
more or less equivalent.

01:12:31.994 --> 01:12:33.660
So if they were going
to fold, then they

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:34.747
were still going to fold.

01:12:34.747 --> 01:12:36.330
If they were going
to re-raise all-in,

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:37.920
then we're still going to call.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.090
And then-- it's
mostly equivalent.

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:42.700
I'd say in this exact
situation, making it--

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:45.000
if you raise to $800,
it's pretty much the same

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.410
as making it $1,600.

01:12:46.410 --> 01:12:48.960
But on some off
chance, it's still

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.740
possible you're giving
them a free option.

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.380
Like maybe their better
play with 4-3 suited

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.360
is still to just call.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.170
And then if the flop comes
really, really bad for them,

01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:01.879
like Ace-Ace-King.

01:13:01.879 --> 01:13:03.170
Maybe that's not even that bad.

01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:07.830
But 9-8-7 or something, I don't
know, they could maybe fold.

01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:11.520
So basically I think just
keeping it simple is good.

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:20.580
So one concept I'll finish
on is, there's this idea of--

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.730
so I have talked about-- all
this stuff I'm saying about

01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:25.080
letting them go all--

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.000
giving them the option is bad.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.100
But what if you think they're
so stupid that if you give them

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.050
the extra option,
they're actually

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:38.190
going to make a mistake,
and giving them strictly

01:13:38.190 --> 01:13:41.170
fewer options is actually bad?

01:13:41.170 --> 01:13:43.170
You actually just want
to give them more options

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.580
even though it's free
options because they

01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:45.454
might make a mistake.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.760
So this is slicing
in from a while ago,

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.380
but Bill Chen sort of gave a
very good theoretical example

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:53.980
of this.

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:56.632
So Bill Chen, he actually
might give a guest lecture.

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.340
The last lecture, we
haven't decided yet,

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:02.190
but he might come and speak for
the last lecture of the class

01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:02.910
this year.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:05.640
He wrote the book called
The Mathematics of Poker.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.170
He's one of the world experts
on the math behind poker.

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:11.160
He's a math PhD.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.190
He's currently a trader at
Susquehanna International

01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:14.890
Group.

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:17.760
Anyways, this is what Bill
Chen calls a sucker bet.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.401
And when you see your
opponent do this,

01:14:20.401 --> 01:14:21.900
you should almost
be a bit offended.

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.930
Like I sometimes-- this
occasionally, very rarely

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:25.590
happens.

01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:28.920
But when it does happen,
I'm sometimes very confused

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.040
because my opponents
shouldn't be doing this.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.257
So maybe they're stupid,
and they don't go all-in

01:14:35.257 --> 01:14:37.090
because they're stupid,
and they're actually

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:38.520
giving me a free option.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.980
But maybe I'm actually
the stupid one.

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:44.070
Maybe they think I'm so
stupid that if they gave me

01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:47.670
the free option, I'm
going to make a mistake.

01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:50.170
So if you do get in a
situation like this,

01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:52.170
it's actually sort of an
interesting theoretical

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:53.070
question, I think.

01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:56.476
If you're sitting in exactly
Big Blind's shoes, you saw.

01:14:56.476 --> 01:14:58.850
Let's say you know the button
is a competent player, too.

01:14:58.850 --> 01:14:59.975
This makes it worse, right?

01:14:59.975 --> 01:15:01.860
If you know the button
is a competent player,

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.610
then you're saying, I
guess this sort of reveals

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:08.360
what they think of me, if
they're giving me a free option

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.360
to see the flop here
here 4-3 suited.

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.068
They must I think I'm
going to mess it up

01:15:12.068 --> 01:15:16.342
so bad that they'd rather give
me this free option than not.

01:15:16.342 --> 01:15:18.300
But it's an interesting
concept to think about.

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.220
And sometimes it does happen.

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.860
Another sort of
example of a sucker bet

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:28.710
is, I guess I was talking
about last class on the flop,

01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:30.840
or even on the turn
or whatever, you never

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.170
really want to bet a very
small fraction of the pot.

01:15:34.170 --> 01:15:37.680
Like, if the pot is $100, and
then your opponent checks you,

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.270
and you bet $1 into $100, it
doesn't-- it's not a real bet.

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:43.530
It's $1 into 100.

01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:44.940
It's essentially an epsilon bet.

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.350
It's essentially a zero bet.

01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:47.217
But what does it do?

01:15:47.217 --> 01:15:49.050
It gives your opponent
a free option, right?

01:15:49.050 --> 01:15:50.430
Now they can check-raise you.

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:52.650
If they-- now it's
saying, OK, I bet $1.

01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:55.380
Now you have a second chance
to bet on the flop, right?

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:58.440
You check the flop, but I'm
going to bet $1 into $100.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.510
And now if you want
to make it $50,

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:03.840
you can re-raise
my $1 bet to $50.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.049
And now if you want, you can.

01:16:05.049 --> 01:16:07.381
And if you think your opponents
going to make a mistake,

01:16:07.381 --> 01:16:08.545
you can try to do this.

01:16:08.545 --> 01:16:11.940
It is a very specific
exploitative strategy,

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.980
but it's interesting
in that it's

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:16.860
so obvious as an
exploitative strategy.

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:23.174
Anyway, I think it's an
interesting theoretical thing.

01:16:23.174 --> 01:16:24.715
So I think one-- a
few more examples.

01:16:24.715 --> 01:16:27.120
So once again, these
are all simple hands,

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.640
but I just wanted to
show you there's--

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.520
the only way you can
mess up this hand

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.560
is by not going all-in.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.107
You only have 15 Big Blinds,
someone's already raised a lot.

01:16:37.107 --> 01:16:38.940
You don't really want
to try to do something

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:42.060
cute like slow playing,
especially-- if you had Aces,

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.290
maybe slow playing is OK.

01:16:43.290 --> 01:16:46.860
But with just Ace-King, any hand
is so much equity against you.

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:50.070
And you just want to go all-in.

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:54.360
Here's an example where someone
in lead position raises,

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.840
and you have a pocket pair.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.090
You can go all-in.

01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:58.570
And this is pretty
good because you

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.810
do pretty well against
their range that calls you.

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:05.850
So this is a pretty
good play often.

01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:08.040
I'll talk more about
this in future classes.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.460
But if you're defending your
Blinds often with small pairs,

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.220
re-raising all-in, even
if it's for a lot of bets,

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:18.660
is a reasonable play because
the hand-- they might even

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:20.160
fold pocket 3s, pocket 4s.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.070
I think it's quite likely.

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:24.630
Yeah, I think the
Nash equilibrium

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:28.410
is to fold pocket 3s, pocket
4s if you have enough chips.

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:30.720
But when they do call
you, even if they

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.680
have a hand like Ace-King, you
still have 50% equity, right?

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.260
So small pairs are pretty
good at just re-raising all-in

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:41.190
against late position steals.

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:44.540
So all-in here is good.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.020
So the last example
is also easy.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:49.420
It's essentially saying,
so under the gun raises,

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.880
hijack minus one calls.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:54.180
You have a great hand on the
button, and only 20 Big Blinds.

01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:55.170
You just go all-in.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:59.280
There's no reason to be
cute and make it $8,000,

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.850
I guess unless you were trying
to sucker your opponent.

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:06.730
I'm going to stop
here, and then--

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:09.540
so the next class,
I'll maybe run

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.430
through a tournament
history next class.

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:14.430
I'll show you guys a history
of me playing a tournament,

01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:16.690
and try to discuss
some of those decision.

01:18:16.690 --> 01:18:18.934
That will be one of
the next three classes.

01:18:18.934 --> 01:18:19.600
All right, cool.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.450
Thank you.
