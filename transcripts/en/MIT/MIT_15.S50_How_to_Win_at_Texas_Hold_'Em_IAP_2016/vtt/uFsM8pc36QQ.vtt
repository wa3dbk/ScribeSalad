00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.400
WILL MA: All right, guys.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.442
I'm going to get started.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:27.150
If you haven't done attendance
yet, you can do it at the break

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.275
or afterwards.

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:30.150
I think it will work.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.430
OK, so just a few
quick announcements.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.000
So, homework 1 is
posted and due Friday.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.312
I have it up on here.

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:40.020
Are there any questions
about homework 1,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.120
or anything about the procedure?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.350
So, Lee Marie's going to
have office hours shortly

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.934
after class, 4:30
to 5:30 in E51-145.

00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:52.184
So if you have any questions,
you can ask her as well.

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:53.720
Or you can ask me
now if you think

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.060
they're applicable
to the general class.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.040
OK, cool.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.380
So, OK, so I'm going
to proceed then.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.270
So I hope-- so
most of you I think

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.310
have started playing in
the online tournaments.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.340
I hope you guys--
if you haven't, I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.370
hope you plan on starting soon.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.880
Yeah, I hope they've
been fun so far.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.780
OK, so today, I'm going to
focus more specifically on poker

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.700
itself.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.500
I know last class, I talked
about a lot of general concepts

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.030
on decision making
and how to think

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.850
about exploiting your opponent
versus playing within a Nash

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.820
equilibrium way.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.200
Today, I'm going to
focus mostly on poker,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.450
and try to give a
lot of hand examples.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.450
And I'm going to
introduce post-flop play,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.160
which I didn't really
talk about last time--

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.690
so basically, what happens
after you see the flop.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.890
OK, so I'm going to just
start with an example hand.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.890
So, we get ace-queen
offsuit in hijack minus 1,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.780
so I think I called it
lojack in the earlier slide--

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.410
in last class, but basically,
it's four away from the button.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.690
So it's how many people--

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.780
the thing that matters is how
many people behind have cards

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.640
and could be left to act.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.550
So we raise a bit bigger
than 2.25 big blinds,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.400
but I'm not going to
nitpick that for now.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.570
So, we're a bit
deeper stacked, so we

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.640
want to build a bigger
pot because we think

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.430
we have an advantage, I guess.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.650
OK, so, it's folded
to both blinds.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.400
And both blinds call OK?

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.780
So, the flop comes on 9-8-deuce.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.950
So we sort of missed the flop.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.530
And the small blind checks,
and the big blind checks.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.580
OK, so what happened
is clear so far?

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.880
OK, so now, we have a
decision here, essentially.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.680
So first, I want to talk
about checking to the preflop

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.590
aggressor.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.560
So this is sort of-- this is
sort of a conventional way

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.100
to play.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.500
So, they both checked, so we
were the preflop aggressor.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.900
So in this case, I mean
by preflop aggressor,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.820
the person who put in
the last raise preflop.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.920
And the reason why
this is significant

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.060
is because in some sense, we
have a stronger range of hands

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.540
than they do because we
could potentially have pocket

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.110
aces, which is the best hand.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.170
And it's going to be good
hand on pretty much any flop.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.290
Whereas it's much harder-- it's
much more unlikely for them

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.900
to have pocket aces, because
if they had pocket aces,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.240
it would be a good play,
and a tempting play

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.010
to re-raise preflop.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.200
So basically,
they're sort of just

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.047
recognizing the fact
that on average, we're

00:03:22.047 --> 00:03:23.630
going to have a
better hand than them.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.260
So they're going
to check us and let

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.380
us bet because in general,
on average, they would

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.280
prefer if the pot was smaller.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.010
And we would prefer
if the pot was bigger

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.176
because our range is better.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.070
Yeah, so they both check to us.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.650
And right, so, like let's say
they had a pretty good hand.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.460
Like, let's say small blind
had 10, 9 suited or something,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.670
which is the top pair-- so the
highest pair on this board.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.500
That's a pretty good hand.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.740
But that's still a hand
that loses to pocket aces.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.370
And there's still the risk
if he bets out with 10, 9,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.630
we could just raise.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.460
And then he has to
be worried, you know,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.890
do we have pocket aces?

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.510
There's basically always going
to be this worry of pocket aces

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.910
and pocket kings,
and just big pairs

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.840
that he has to worry about that
we have to worry about less.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.940
Occasionally, someone
there probably

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.929
should slow play pocket
aces preflop and just call.

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.220
But most of the time, it will
be a better idea for them

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.950
to re-raise to get
more money in preflop.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.680
So that's why they
both check to us.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.110
So now, we have the opportunity
to bet or to check back.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.357
So, let me first
check what-- how big

00:04:28.357 --> 00:04:30.090
to bet if we decide to bet.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.680
So here, we bet 200 into 375,
which is about half the pot.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.070
And so, between betting
big and betting small,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.460
it's sort of the same principles
I talked about last class

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.940
between raising big and
raising small preflop.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.740
So the advantage
of betting small--

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.940
so, the disadvantage
of betting small

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.000
is that you give your
opponent better odds to call.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.814
So like let's say they have, I
don't know, like Jack, 10 here,

00:04:56.814 --> 00:04:57.980
a hand that's losing to you.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.150
They have the better odds
to call and a cheaper price

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.480
to call to see another
card to try and beat you.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.677
But on the other hand,
our hand isn't amazing.

00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:07.260
Our hand isn't good
here, essentially.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.176
We've missed the flop.

00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:09.510
We haven't paired our hand.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.570
And if we get raised, we're
probably going to have to fold.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.460
And the more we bet, the more
we lose when we get raised.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.340
So it's the same
sweet spot principles.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.650
If you bet too small,
you get called too often

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.352
by worse hands that just
have good odds to call.

00:05:22.352 --> 00:05:23.810
And if you get too
big, you're just

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.710
losing a lot when
you get raised.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.690
So a good rule of thumb is to
bet half the pot on the flop

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.180
and then like a slightly
bigger percentage on the turn,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.650
like 60%, and then an even
bigger percentage on the river,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.510
like 70% or something.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.250
Something like that
is about reasonable.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.920
You could bet up to like
100% of the pot on the river.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.830
So I'd say just somewhere
between 50% to 100% of the pot

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.690
is a good amount to bet.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.130
And the fraction should increase
as you get closer to the river.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.260
So this might seem
slightly contradictory,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.770
because what I
said last class was

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.312
you were able to--
last class, I said

00:05:59.312 --> 00:06:01.603
you want to give your opponent--
you don't want to give

00:06:01.603 --> 00:06:02.930
your opponent great odds.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.710
But in some sense, if
we get to the river,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.110
right, all the
cards have come out.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.280
There's no more unknown cards.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.680
So either they had
the better hand

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.450
or we have the better hand.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.080
But there's going to be no
uncertainty in what cards

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.100
could still come.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.110
So in some sense,
you might think

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.290
it's more intuitive to bet
smaller on the turn and river

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.360
and bigger on the flop,
because on the flop,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.660
they have more
chances to outdraw us,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.785
whereas on the turn and
river, they have fewer.

00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:35.089
But let me just find the--

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.880
all right, now I don't
have to stand there.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.740
OK, so this might seem
contradictory, right?

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.650
So I'm saying that bigger on
the river, but on the river,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.130
they actually have
in some sense--

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.580
on the river, there is--

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.920
it's more determined whether
their hand is good or not.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.910
So why is this?

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.700
Why do we want to bet bigger
on the turn than the flop,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.200
whereas on the flop, any hand
sort of has closer to 50%

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.780
equity, because anything can
still happen with two cards

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.690
to come?

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.460
So the main reason is because
when you bet the flop,

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.330
they're not just deciding
to call your flop

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.670
bet for the equity there.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.711
They also potentially have to
call a turn bet and a river

00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:11.210
bet.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.056
And essentially, this factor--
the fact that they have to, you

00:07:14.056 --> 00:07:16.180
can threaten to bet again
on the turn and bet again

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.510
on the river, and they have
to call all these bets,

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.015
is a bigger factor than
the fact that they have--

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:26.750
there's slightly better
odds to call on the flop.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.990
OK, so another important thing
to say is when I said bet

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.320
between 50% to 100% of the
pot, I mean I think that's--

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.250
it's very important to bet at
least some fraction of the pot,

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.170
especially when
they're checking you.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.670
Because in some
sense, betting small

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.412
is strictly worse than checking.

00:07:42.412 --> 00:07:44.870
Like in this case, you get 50,
which I guess isn't nothing.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.390
But imagine you bet $1 here.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.270
The issue with this is the
rules of betting safe, right,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.880
if anyone bets any
positive amount,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.700
then the guys who checked now
have a chance to check-raise.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.920
So if you're
betting small, which

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.350
is almost the same as
checking, all you're doing

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.910
is giving your
opponent a free option.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.060
You're allowing them
the opportunity to say,

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.070
OK, I couldn't just-- like if
you check, you see the turn,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.190
and the turn comes.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.860
But by betting, now they
have the opportunity--

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.940
a second chance to bet.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.910
Yeah?

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.895
AUDIENCE: How does this
change if you have the nuts?

00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:18.091
Should you bet?

00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:19.840
Like, you want calls
at that point, right?

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.220
WILL MA: Right, right.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.470
Exactly.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:20.720
Yes.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.710
So, I'm going to
get to that, yes.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.376
So if you have a good
hand, yeah, you'll

00:08:23.376 --> 00:08:25.370
bet too because you want calls.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.500
Right now, I'm just talking
about a general strategy

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.974
to play with your
entire range of hands.

00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:32.390
And in general, I
guess that's all

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.015
I'm trying to encourage
people to think

00:08:34.015 --> 00:08:35.310
about poker in this class.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.110
Like instead of thinking
about what cards do I have

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.659
and what cards do
my opponent have,

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.110
I try to talk in terms of
what is the probability

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.220
distribution over
my opponent's hands,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.650
and what's the probability
distribution over my hands

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.010
in his eyes, essentially.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:57.550
So I'm just talking about
a general scenario, yeah.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.500
OK, cool.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.070
So, right.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.070
So you never want to bet
too small, basically.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.480
It's better just to not bet.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.590
There's no point to bet.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.430
Really, it's not, because
you're giving away free option.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.270
OK, so yeah.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.350
So this is what I just
said, essentially.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.700
Because remember, just because
they checked doesn't mean

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.960
they have bad hands.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.420
They're often checking
regardless for the reasons

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.030
I described earlier.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.360
OK, so in this situation
with ace-queen offsuit,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.440
I think both betting 200 and
checking are reasonable plays.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.160
And let's analyze the advantages
and disadvantages of both.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.340
So the advantage
of betting 200 is

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.750
that you don't give some
garbage hand like king-jack

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.270
a chance to outdraw you.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.660
So in this situation,
if we bet 200,

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.700
probably if someone
had King, Jack,

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.180
they'll probably just fold
because it's almost one

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.420
of the worst hands
on this board.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.712
And if we bet 200, then
they're going to fold.

00:09:53.712 --> 00:09:55.670
And then we could just
win the pot right there.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.086
If we don't bet, maybe the
turn will come a king or a jack

00:09:58.086 --> 00:09:59.240
and they could beat us.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.920
So what's the
advantage of checking?

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.630
The advantage of
checking is we get

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.727
to see the turn card for sure.

00:10:04.727 --> 00:10:05.810
We can't get check-raised.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.800
Like right now if we
bet we get check-raised,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.040
we probably have to
fold with no pair.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.490
But if we check, we might
see a queen or an ace

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.660
on the turn that
should be great.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.067
And another advantage of
checking is, in some sense,

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:18.650
when you bet in this
spot, you're only

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.232
called by hands that beat you.

00:10:20.232 --> 00:10:22.690
You're going to get king-jack
to fold, which is still fine,

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.240
because they have six outs.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.300
But you are ahead of
them, so it's not the end

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.890
of the world to just check him.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.800
If the turn comes like a
deuce, you're still ahead.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.822
And if it checks all
the way to showdown,

00:10:33.822 --> 00:10:35.280
like all the way
to the point where

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.870
you have to flip
over your cards,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.944
you're going to beat king-jack.

00:10:39.944 --> 00:10:41.610
Whereas when you bet,
you're essentially

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.910
getting all the hands
you're ahead of to fold.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.100
Like if they have ace-7,
which you're also ahead of,

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.391
they're probably going to fold.

00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:49.590
And pretty much all the
hands that beat you probably

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.570
aren't going to fold.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.965
Like, maybe someone will
fold pocket 3's or something,

00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:55.340
but for the most part, you're
going to get called by a 9.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.850
You're going to
get called by an 8.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.980
So it's this idea sort
of adverse selection.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.250
You're getting called only
by hands that beat you,

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.350
and you're just folding
at everything else.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.350
So overall, I'd say these
about balance out and you can--

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.007
I think betting or
checking are both fine.

00:11:11.007 --> 00:11:12.840
OK, so now let's suppose
it's the same spot.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.930
And we had king-queen.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:18.060
We had king-queen
instead of ace-queen.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.920
So pretend all the
action was the same.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.530
All the preflop action, the
flop action-- everything

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.500
was same, except just
our cards change.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.670
So in this case, if we do
the same comparison again,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.940
we'll see that betting has
a bigger advantage now,

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.970
because we can get hands like
ace-jack and ace-7 to fold.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.640
Those hands previously we
were beating with ace-queen.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.600
But now, we don't want to risk
getting a situation where it's

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.220
checked to showdown and
everyone flips over their cards,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.360
and we lose to
ace-jack or ace-7.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.920
So I'd say in this case,
now with king-queen instead

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.550
of ace-queen, betting
has a lot more advantage

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.057
because we're getting
better hands to fold.

00:11:56.057 --> 00:11:57.890
OK, and this is what
you were talking about.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:58.850
Yeah, what if you have the nuts?

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.350
So in this case,
if-- so suppose now

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.750
we change our king to a queen.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.375
So we actually have
a really good hand.

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:05.790
We have pocket queens,
which is an overpair, a pair

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.900
above any card on the flop.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.820
So now, let's look
at the advantages

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.610
of betting versus checking.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.710
So now, one advantage
of betting that we never

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.180
had before because we
always had bad hands

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.940
is, now we can get
worse hands to call us.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.950
If they have 10-9 or ace-8
or pocket 5's, they're

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.420
probably going to call.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.570
And we're beating them, so we're
just going to win more money.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.260
And the advantages of
checking is essentially none.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.595
So the correct play,
I think, is clearly

00:12:34.595 --> 00:12:37.680
to bet in this situation.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.740
So, essentially what I'm
trying to get at is--

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.140
so I call this the
Fundamental Theorem of Poker.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.420
It's sort of a made-up term.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.430
But essentially-- so
one of the main things

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.560
you should realize when
you're betting postflop

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.650
is that a bet basically
accomplishes one of two things.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.510
So with your good
hands, you want bet

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.680
because you can get them to
call with worse, but still good

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.330
hands.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.940
And we call this value betting.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.940
So with the pocket
queens, this is--

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.170
what you're doing is value
betting when you bet.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.070
And then with the bottom
hands in your range,

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.310
you should bet to get them
to fold better but still

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.810
pretty weak hands.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.320
So in this case, when
we had king-queen,

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.630
we would be betting to
get them to fold ace-jack.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.210
So, this is called bluffing.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.784
So essentially,
the point of a bet

00:13:22.784 --> 00:13:24.450
should either be a
value bet because you

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.610
have a really good hand,
or a bluff because you

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.665
have a really bad hand.

00:13:27.665 --> 00:13:29.790
And you want to sort of
think in terms of that way.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.000
And if you ever find
yourself making a bet

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.880
and you're not sure whether
it's a value bet or a bluff,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.070
then chances are you maybe
shouldn't be betting.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.710
So with the middle
hands in your range,

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.270
you should check
because if you bet,

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.650
you fold out all
the weaker hands

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.790
and you keep in all
the stronger hands.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.250
OK, does that make sense?

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.230
So this is like the
fundamental concept in poker,

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:55.100
essentially, that we
should try to realize.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.020
OK, so I sort of
made this diagram.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.420
So, the best hands are at
the top of the rectangles.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.970
The worse cards-- the worst
hands are at the bottom.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.700
So once again, we're thinking
in terms of our entire range

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.910
of possibilities.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.630
So postflop, we
want it sort of--

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.950
so that's on the left.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.980
Postflop, we want to
bet the best hands,

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.650
bluff the worst hands, and then
check things in the middle.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.280
And then preflop, basically
we fold all the bad hands

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.250
and then we raise, or if
someone's already raised,

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.130
we re-raise the best
hands and we just

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.840
raise the pretty good hands.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.870
I'll talk more about preflop
playing in a future lecture.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.800
But I just wanted
to contrast this

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.800
because I don't want
someone to think, you know,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.180
if I have 7-2 offsuit
preflop, I should be bluffing.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.765
Because it's a
different scenario.

00:14:40.765 --> 00:14:43.140
Because preflop, you're choosing
what percentage of hands

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.070
to play.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.430
And it's strictly better to just
choose the best 30% or the best

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:52.792
40% instead of choosing the
best 10% and the worst 10%.

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:56.040
OK, so going back to
this principle, with 7-7,

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.684
so it's still the
same situation.

00:14:57.684 --> 00:14:59.850
So I'm analyzing the same
situation many, many times

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.200
with different cards.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.020
With 7-7, the right play
is definitely to check.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.110
Because so, with ace-queen, it's
in a similar spot to ace-queen

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.700
in that it's also you get
called only by better hands

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.920
and you mostly only
fold out worse hands.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.420
But with ace-queen, at least
there was the advantage that

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.760
if they called with like
an 8 or 9, we could turn--

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.320
we have more chances
to beat them.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.600
We could turn an ace or a
queen and win more money,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.050
or alternatively, we
could turn a jack which

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.769
gives us a straight draw,
and try to bluff them off

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:30.810
[INAUDIBLE] or something.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.390
Whereas with pocket 7's,
there's less room to play.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.730
So, I think with pocket
7's, you should definitely

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.340
check on this flop.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.040
So, OK, so some other stuff
about continuation betting on

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.550
flops.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.495
I wouldn't bluff
super scary flops.

00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:47.380
By super scary, I
essentially-- mathematically,

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.700
it just means there's
a lot of uncertainty

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.334
because so many
things are possible.

00:15:52.334 --> 00:15:54.000
And basically, this
happens when there's

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.040
three cards of the same suit
and they're all connected.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.640
So whenever the board is
like this, it looks scary.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.370
It looks very coordinated.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.040
But mathematically speaking,
it's essentially saying,

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.420
anything can happen.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.940
And no one should fold if
you have anything at all.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.665
Because you know,
if you have any 10,

00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:12.290
you have a chance of
making a straight.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.760
If you have a
reasonable heart, you

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.093
have a chance of making a flush.

00:16:15.093 --> 00:16:17.490
Just any hand is going to
have a reasonable chance.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.990
Same as, you know,
even if you have

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.965
like an ace, like
I guess as we do,

00:16:20.965 --> 00:16:24.810
you have a chance of
turning a higher pair.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.350
So I would just check, and
basically give up on this flop.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.240
Or check, and hope you hit
an ace or a queen, I guess.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.670
And another thing is
continuation betting

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.550
into too many people,
if you have nothing,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.900
it can be an advanced
play in certain situations

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.310
if everyone else also recognizes
that if you're continuation

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.004
betting into five
people, you just

00:16:46.004 --> 00:16:47.420
have such a good
hand that they're

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.940
going to fold a hand as good
as say, like, pocket 8's here.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.670
But for the most
part, in practice, I

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.940
would say if the pot has
like six or seven people,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.770
I wouldn't try to
bet on the flop

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.680
with overcards to try
to get everyone to fold,

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.970
because someone's going
to have two hearts,

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.220
or someone's getting have a 7.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.270
Someone's going to have a pair.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.089
OK, so I talked about sort of
when you want to bet postflop.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.579
So now, I'll talk a
bit more about when

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.500
you want to call bets postflop.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.630
And I'm going to try to give
a lot of different situations.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.770
So now, let's look
at calling bets.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.130
And I think newer
players especially

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.140
tend to call with hands
weaker than you need to.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.270
So the general rule of thumb
is, unless your opponent bets

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.070
extremely small,
which they should not

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.240
do by what I explained, you
should fold most of your hands

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.380
to a half-pot bet.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.190
So in some sense, most
hands miss most flops.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.020
And when you miss,
there's really

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.122
not a reason to do anything
other than to fold.

00:17:48.122 --> 00:17:49.330
There's a lot of tournaments.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.630
See I always play
the next tournament

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.921
and get dealt and new hand
and try to have a good hand,

00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:55.244
so, OK.

00:17:55.244 --> 00:17:57.410
So now, I'm going to change
this situation up a bit.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.618
But once again, I'm going
to analyze the same betting

00:17:59.618 --> 00:18:02.270
situation over different hands.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:06.410
So now, it's everyone folds
to-- is folds to the button.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.600
We're still 40 bets deep
because the blinds are 2,550

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.660
and we have--

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.040
we have 2,000.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.480
And so the button
makes it 125, and we

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.700
decide to call with our hand.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:23.100
OK, so let's say we have
queen-9 suited in this case.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.520
And, OK, let's say
the flop is 10-7-2.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.000
So, we check.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.070
We check as a form of respect
to the preflop raiser.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.170
And then they bet half-pot.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.970
So here this is
a situation where

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.964
we've got no pair, no draw.

00:18:37.964 --> 00:18:39.130
I guess we have an overcard.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.504
We have an overcard
in the queen,

00:18:40.504 --> 00:18:43.930
and we can turn a pair of queens
to beat a tier of 10's, but

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.870
that's only three
cards that help us.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.390
Basically, the correct
play is just to fold.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.160
You essentially
have nothing here.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.340
You know, you have some like,
speculative straight draws

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.930
where if you hit a
jack and then an 8,

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.599
like if you have two cards
that come for you, then

00:18:58.599 --> 00:18:59.390
you get a straight.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.098
But for the most part,
we've got nothing.

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:03.164
We just fold.

00:19:03.164 --> 00:19:05.580
Here are some other situations
where you should just fold.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.850
So here, we have
ace-high but the board

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.832
has three pretty big cards.

00:19:10.832 --> 00:19:13.290
And there's a decent chance
he's going to have one of them.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.390
And if he doesn't,
he's going to have

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.375
like queen-10, or
10-9, or something

00:19:17.375 --> 00:19:19.750
with straight [INAUDIBLE],,
or some kind of straight draw

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.675
with a lot of outs.

00:19:20.675 --> 00:19:22.800
So there's just no reason
to play hands like these.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.640
So it's totally fine if
you lose a lot of hands,

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.020
as long as you win more chips
on the hands that you do win.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.670
So, just fold this.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.140
Not much reason to play.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.262
Here, you have this.

00:19:35.262 --> 00:19:36.720
This board is a
bit better for you.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.610
You have ace-9 high
on a 6-high board,

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.260
but there's a lot
of straight draws,

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.970
and there is a flush draw, a
spade flush draw on this board,

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.900
so I would still fold.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.670
Here, we even have
a pair, but this

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.350
is an example where
I think I'd fold

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.720
even though you have a pair.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.600
So we have a pair of 9's
here which is decent,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.430
but once again,
there's three hearts.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.090
And it's easy for him to make
a flush or make a straight.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.830
And even if he
doesn't, we're going

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.037
to be-- we're going to have
to check to him on the turn,

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.120
check to him on the river.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.100
And then they can
bet, and then we

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.910
have to decide whether
we call it or not.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:14.910
So, just overall, there's a lot
of-- it's an [INAUDIBLE] play.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.410
And this is why what--

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.350
I'm talking about
being out of position.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.010
So where we have to act
first on every straight,

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.910
so it's going to be tougher
to make good decisions.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.080
OK, so now, we're getting
some better hands.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.240
But I think I would advocate
still folding these.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.490
So here, our hand is--

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.480
it's not bad.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.060
We basically got a four-out
straight draw, which

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.180
is usually called a gutshot.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.860
You hit an 8 to turn a straight.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.790
And also we've got diamonds.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.435
If we get two diamonds in
a row, we can make a flush.

00:20:48.435 --> 00:20:50.060
But overall on this
spot, I would still

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.650
fold just because
even though we've

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:57.500
got four outs to our gutshot,
we've got no combinations--

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.400
we've got no other
combinations to help us.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.100
Like, a 9 is essentially useless
when there's three higher

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.110
cards on the board.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.120
Turning a 9 doesn't
help us at all.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.970
Turning a 7 doesn't
help us at all.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.370
And furthermore, even if we
turn an 8, it's possible.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.900
So if we turn an 8, then
queen-9 makes a better

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.950
straight than us.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.452
And also, king-queen, which
already has a straight,

00:21:19.452 --> 00:21:20.660
is a better straight than us.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.880
So even when we hit
an 8, it's not even--

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.400
we're not even 100% sure
we're going to win the hand.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.220
And we could just put our
chips in after hitting an 8

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.450
and lose all our chips.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.210
So, I would fold this as well.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.390
A four-out gutshot
is bad unless you

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.540
have other stuff to go with it.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.600
OK, so in this case, we
have a better straight draw.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.065
So in this case, we have
an eight-out straight draw.

00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:46.585
Because an 8 gives
us a straight--

00:21:46.585 --> 00:21:47.950
8 through king.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.390
But a king also
gives us a straight.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.800
We have 9 through King.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.840
But in this case,
I would still--

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.340
I would still
recommend folding just

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.182
because if a king comes then--

00:21:58.182 --> 00:22:00.590
you know, we do have a
straight, but we lose to an ace.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.030
So, 10-jack-queen-king-ace
is going to just be a higher

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.530
straight than our 9
through king straight,

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.860
so even though we
have a lot of outs,

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.810
the outs aren't that good,
and it's possible we just once

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.650
again, we make a
second-best hand,

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.910
which is the worst
possible situation in poker

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.660
because you're going
to put a lot of money

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.260
in and you're going to lose.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.160
OK, so this is another
example I would fold.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.820
Pocket 5's on queen-jack-10.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.029
You have a small pair.

00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:29.570
You started with a small pair,
but you didn't improve at all.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.580
The flop did not help
your hand at all.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.170
And it most likely helped
your opponent's hand.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.745
OK, so, here's a
question you can ask.

00:22:37.745 --> 00:22:39.230
So in all these
spots, I say fold,

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.840
but what if I think
bluff-raising will work?

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.010
You know, what if I think I
can get him to fold if I raise?

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.980
So what I want to-
what I want to say

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.870
is, when you're
bluffing on the flop,

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.240
it's usually because you
have some kind of draw

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.310
or some kind of nice
speculative hand

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.680
that has a chance of
turning into a good hand.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.430
In all the examples I showed,
not only are our hands bad,

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.710
there's not that many
good cards for us,

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.170
with the exception of maybe
this 7-9 hand, where if you

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.890
turn an 8, it's pretty good.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:12.260
But yeah, even this--

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.920
even this hand, if you turn
an 8, it's not that good,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.130
because the board is then
going to be 8-10-jack-queen.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.220
So we're only playing with
one-card straight, which is

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.070
still fairly easy to put aside.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.460
OK, so before we get to spots,
or maybe we want to raise,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.100
potentially
bluff-raise, let me just

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.016
go-- let's go through
some spots where I think

00:23:33.016 --> 00:23:34.300
calling is a pretty good play.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:37.590
So here, I think calling
with ace-9 high on this board

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.667
is reasonable.

00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:40.500
In the example where I
said you should fold,

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.440
the flop was 6-5-4, and
there was a flush draw.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.390
So there were straight
draws and flush draws.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.600
In this case, the board is
paired, which really helps us

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.300
because there's just fewer
combinations of pairs

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.070
that he could make.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.170
And a 3 is a pretty
small card, so it's

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.500
pretty unlikely they have a 3.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.680
So ace-9-high is
pretty good here.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.190
You have two overcards.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.030
You even have a diamond
[? back your ?] flush draw.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.310
So I would call here.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.020
OK, so we would get--
so getting better,

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.740
here, this hand is even better.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.360
We have ace-3.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.010
We have bottom pair on this.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.240
Pretty safe flop.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.000
It is three different cards, and
they could have a jack or a 5,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.730
but just overall
against a range,

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.590
we have tremendous equity here.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.690
So I would call.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.770
So note, when I say
call, do not raise.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.830
I'll give you examples of
how good, roughly speaking,

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.500
our hand has to be to raise.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.110
All right, so
here, I would call.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.290
The board is very scary,
but we have second pair.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.180
And I think second
pair is just--

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.450
second pair with the
best kicker would be ace.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.590
So that's definitely
good enough to call.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.110
With ace-9, I think this
would be borderline,

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.880
whether you call.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.570
I think calling is
OK, but not mandatory.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.520
OK, here's another example--
second pair on a safer board.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.230
This is a pretty good hand.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.730
I mean, if they've
got an ace, we're

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.470
not drawing to that many outs.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.200
But if they don't
have an ace, they're

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.390
not drawing with that many outs.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.480
So it's because whenever
big cards come on the flop,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.640
like an ace and a
king, in some sense,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.850
even if there's flush and
straight draws, more of the--

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.070
more of who's going to
win has been decided.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.590
Because if you've
got a big pair,

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.390
like if you've got
an ace or a king,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.410
then there's not like an even
bigger card that can come in

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.600
to try and beat you.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.290
And if you don't have
it, then, you know,

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.600
it's like if you have 10-9,
even if you turn it's hand,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.560
you're not going to
outdraw an ace-7.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.180
So here, I would just call.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.830
Here, you have a pretty good
pair, pocket 8's on 9-3-3.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.800
Obviously, you have a
very good hand here,

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.200
but I just think,
in this case, where

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.910
there's no flush draws--
no straight draws,

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.940
there's not really
that much reason

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.966
to raise because
it's not like you're

00:25:44.966 --> 00:25:46.840
going to get called by
worse hands that often

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.000
that I would still only call.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.700
Even though in some sense, your
hand is very, very strong here.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.000
Like, I would expect you to have
the better hand more than 80%

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.910
of the time.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.070
But the problem
is when you raise,

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.190
they're only playing
the 20% that beats you,

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:05.760
which is hands 9's, hands with
3's, and pocket 10's plus.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.590
So here, I would also
recommend calling

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.140
even though we have top pair.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.250
So top pair, the highest
pair on the board.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.831
It's a pair of
aces, which seems--

00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:15.330
you know, it seems like we have
a good hand we should raise.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:19.110
But once again, our other
card, which is very relevant,

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.330
is very small in this case.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.090
So we're going to
lose to ace-queen--

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:23.520
any kind of big ace.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.680
And furthermore, there's
not that much reason

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.690
to raise because
we're not that scared

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.910
of letting them see a
turn card with, say, 10-9.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.410
Because even if he turns a 10 or
a 9, he's not going to beat us.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.480
So, right-- so, the
reason you raise

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.710
is essentially to not let
your opponent see more cards

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.640
and give them outs.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.110
But they don't have that many
outs if we're ahead of them.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.780
So I would-- so this is,
you can say this is like,

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.075
a way-ahead,
way-behind situation.

00:26:51.075 --> 00:26:53.130
That's some terminology
that you might hear,

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.620
which basically means you're
either way ahead because they

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.670
don't have an ace,
or you are way behind

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.280
because they've got ace-queen.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.290
And when you're way
ahead or way behind,

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.580
you don't really want to be
raising because he's just

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.560
going to call you when
you're way behind,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.690
and he's just going to
fold when you're way ahead.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.595
OK, so here we're getting
some pretty good hands.

00:27:12.595 --> 00:27:15.440
Ace-jack and jack-10-9
with a flush draw.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.840
I think if you raise, it's not--

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.550
it wouldn't be the
end of the world.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:25.040
The issue is I think 2,000 chips
when the blinds are only 2,550

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.030
is still a bit much to put in
your entire stack on this flop.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.880
And just because even though
you have top pair with the best

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.560
kicker, there is a
lot of straights.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.560
And even if he's--

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.905
like even if let's say they
have queen-9 of hearts--

00:27:38.905 --> 00:27:41.280
I think that's behind of you
currently because they only

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.650
have a pair of 9's.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.710
There is just going to be
so many straight and flush

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.660
outs they're going to have that
you're never really getting it

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.570
in ahead of equity by that much.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.290
So I would just call and
see what the turn is.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.330
But that's maybe the best--

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.310
one of the examples
of the strongest

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.430
hands you can have where I
would still recommend calling.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.700
In this case, we've
got a small overpair.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.040
But I would still call
even though, once again, we

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.040
have the best hand probably
80% plus of the time.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.660
But once again, when
you raise, you're

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.990
only getting played back at
by the 20% that beats you.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.680
So, OK.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.540
Yeah, so, and notice there, when
I went through these examples,

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.799
the stack size was
very important, right?

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:24.590
So in the first class,
the important things

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.080
are position, stack
size, and cards.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.230
In this case, the
position was the button.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.542
The cards-- I've showed
you what the cards are.

00:28:32.542 --> 00:28:34.250
But the stack size--
the fact that you're

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.740
playing for potentially 2,000
chips, is very important.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.530
And if you're playing
for fewer chips

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.360
then you can risk gambling a lot
more, as I'll show you later.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.860
OK, so another note
is you could argue

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.915
for check-raising in some
of these call situations

00:28:48.915 --> 00:28:50.540
especially the ones
where your hand was

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.580
more vulnerable to overcards.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.650
So let me just quickly
run through them again.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.842
So, I'll describe what they are.

00:28:56.842 --> 00:28:58.550
So this is one of
them, because here, you

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.100
could argue, OK, I want to
raise because if I call,

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.450
what if he has jack-10?

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.990
Then he has 6-7, right?

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.380
Here, this is another example.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.180
What if they have 10-9?

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.270
They can turn a 10
or 9 and beat us.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.140
Here, this is not an example.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.270
Here, I think calling
is clearly correct

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:18.374
because the only bad
cards are like a queen,

00:29:18.374 --> 00:29:19.790
because an ace
gives you two-pair.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.240
So, there's just
very few scary--

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.760
the board is already scary and
there's not that many overcards

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.400
that can come.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.710
This is another example
because in this case,

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.600
there's actually no
scary cards in subsets.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.100
No card is-- there's
no card that you're

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.032
afraid of giving him.

00:29:37.032 --> 00:29:39.240
This is an example where
you could argue for raising.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.390
You know, you don't want
jack-10 to see another card.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.240
That's reasonable, yeah.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.890
Here, there's no risk.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.250
It's completely safe,
so I would never raise.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:54.500
Here, I guess there are some
bad cards, but if you raise,

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.716
they can just call with your
draws anyway try to hit.

00:29:57.716 --> 00:29:59.090
So here, this is
an example where

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.830
you could argue for raising to
not let them see a turn card.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:03.580
OK, so, yeah.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.760
These are reasonable
arguments and I

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.390
think raising some
of these call hands

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.760
would not be a terrible play.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.620
But I think for most of these,
the advantages of calling still

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.250
outweigh the advantages
of raising, especially

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.680
if your opponent is also
capable of bluffing.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.150
Because let's say
you check-raise.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.760
So let's say they make it 150.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.500
You make it 400.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.810
And then let's say
they go all in.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.600
But they're going to go all
in not only with hands that

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.547
beat you, like pocket 7's plus.

00:30:31.547 --> 00:30:33.380
They'll also occasionally
do this with hands

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.610
like ace-3 or ace-4, hands that
have an overcard in the ace,

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.920
but also have a
gutshot straight draw.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.540
Like ace-3 or ace-4
can make a straight.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.340
Then you're just in
a very tough spot.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.700
Basically if you call, you're
not in a good situation

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.176
because you're often behind.

00:30:51.176 --> 00:30:52.550
But if you fold,
then you're also

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.040
folding to a lot
of weaker hands.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.790
So there's just a lot
of ways for the hand

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:59.450
to go badly if you raise
because your hand sort of--

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:03.200
it's too-- it's not good
enough to raise and call

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.190
if they re-raise.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:09.020
Yet, it's too good to sort of
waste as a check-raise bluff

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.970
and just fold if
they re-raise, right?

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.380
Like let's say my play
here with pocket 6's

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.940
is to check-raise and fold
if they do anything else.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.700
But then you could argue, why
am I doing this with a hand

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.170
as good as pocket 6's?

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.270
Why don't I do this with 10-9?

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.280
Because it's going to
be a similar result

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.070
most of the time.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.440
They're going to
either fold and I'm

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.840
going to win the pot with
10-9, or they're going to raise

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.970
and I'm going to have
the fold with 10-9.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.070
Occasionally, they'll call, but
you could argue in that case,

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:42.020
I would almost rather have 10-9
than pocket 6's because pocket

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:43.490
6's I'm going to always lose.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.660
And 10-9, who knows?

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.940
I can turn a 10.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:50.007
So, anyway, so the
long story short

00:31:50.007 --> 00:31:51.590
is I would just
recommend just calling

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.756
with most of those hands
although there's definitely

00:31:53.756 --> 00:31:57.568
lots of arguments you
can make for raising.

00:31:57.568 --> 00:31:59.002
Yeah?

00:31:59.002 --> 00:32:02.226
AUDIENCE: I didn't get
why we'd assume once--

00:32:02.226 --> 00:32:05.082
should re-raise if you have
the top pair, the top kicker

00:32:05.082 --> 00:32:10.790
of either because if
you give them the draws,

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.847
at least once you make
the shorts bigger,

00:32:12.847 --> 00:32:14.580
then it will turn out all right.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.750
WILL MA: You're talking
about this situation?

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it is.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.073
WILL MA: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:17.073 --> 00:32:18.450
OK, yeah, that's a good point.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:21.990
So, yeah, I think
that the main reason

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:26.490
is just your overall
equity against their range

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.650
is pretty low on
this board compared

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.500
to an average situation if you
have top pair or top kicker.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.270
Like if the board is jack-7-2,
your equity against their range

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.580
is probably something like 85%.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.196
Whereas on this
board, your equity

00:32:39.196 --> 00:32:40.320
is just overall a lot less.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.944
There's a lot more
hands that beat you.

00:32:41.944 --> 00:32:44.550
So there's a lot
higher probability

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:47.070
that if you raise and call
and put all your money in,

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.910
that you're behind, basically.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.700
So there's just a
huge risk of that.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.110
So, but yeah, I do agree.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.140
It does feel very
unsatisfying to only call

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.510
and let them see those cards.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.260
But I think it's sort
of the lesser of two

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.570
evils in this situation
between putting

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.940
all your money in with
his hand versus letting

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.850
them see some cards.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:04.350
Yeah.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.310
All right, cool.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.760
OK, so just how good does
my had have to be to raise?

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.410
And the question depends on
the effective stack size.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.460
But when the effective
stack size is fairly deep--

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.150
so let's say 40 big blinds,
I think it's about the cut--

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.210
40 big blinds or deeper So, you
know, you have a lot of chips.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.450
You're playing for a lot of
chips relative to the blinds.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.200
You need a pretty good hand to
want to put all your money in.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.230
So a general rule of thumb
is two-pair or bigger.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.200
And yeah, once again,
this is only applicable

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.970
when the effective
stack size is large.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.470
And a lot of the
online tournaments,

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.990
especially the ones where
the blinds go up quickly,

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.150
the effective stack size can
be around 10 or even lower

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.320
pretty quickly.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:46.820
Yeah?

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.705
AUDIENCE: How much do
all of these decisions

00:33:48.705 --> 00:33:51.510
depend on their position
or your position?

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.930
WILL MA: OK, that's a very
good question, actually.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.320
Right, so in this situation--

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.470
so the answer is essentially--
yeah, it depends a lot in this.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.470
The examples I gave are
specifically for the button.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.730
Yeah, so, I would say if they
were under the gun instead

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:11.090
of the button, you need to
play somewhat differently

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.880
because they're going to
have-- because on the button,

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.650
they're going to
have 55% of hands.

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:19.440
And let's say, here, like
10-9 is a possibility.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.845
But actually, maybe
a better example is--

00:34:21.845 --> 00:34:25.100
now, I think this is a board
where it's really different.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.969
Because against a-- if
they raise from the button,

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:31.040
you know they could
have 55% of hands.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.300
And ace-3 is a pretty
good hand here.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.050
But if they raise from under
the gun and they're pretty tight

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.230
and their range is-- pocket
8's are better and ace-queen,

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:43.096
ace-jack, ace-king, then
you're doing a lot worse.

00:34:43.096 --> 00:34:43.596
Yeah.

00:34:43.596 --> 00:34:45.480
So yeah, so it
definitely matters a lot.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.150
And yeah, I mean--

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:50.340
yeah, so I guess I can't
go through every single

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.199
possibility, right?

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:56.130
Like this position, this stack
size, with this [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.785
So yeah, so you do have to
do a bit of extrapolation.

00:34:58.785 --> 00:35:00.930
Like if they're-- right
now in these examples,

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:01.850
they're the button.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.308
If they're the
cut-off, their range

00:35:03.308 --> 00:35:04.660
is going to be a bit stronger.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.650
If they're the
hijack, their range

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.040
will be a bit stronger, yeah.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.456
Yeah, that's a
very good question.

00:35:08.456 --> 00:35:10.396
Yeah, very, very good point.

00:35:10.396 --> 00:35:12.270
Yeah, because in all
the analysis I just did,

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.885
I'm assuming their range
includes hands as bad

00:35:14.885 --> 00:35:17.610
as like, 8-7 suited
and stuff, which

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.860
isn't going to be the case if
they were an earlier position.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.610
OK, so-- all right, so
how good does my hand

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:27.470
have to be to raise?

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.220
So, two-pair or
better, but by two-pair

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.690
or better, I mean two-pair where
both of your cards make a pair.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.100
Here, where one
pair is on the flop,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.100
I wouldn't count
this as two-pair.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.120
And this two-pair
is complete trash

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.364
because any card beats you.

00:35:40.364 --> 00:35:43.220
So I wouldn't go on here.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.920
This one is also pretty bad.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.490
So, OK.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:47.810
So now, when would we raise?

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:51.470
OK, so I think this is what--
this is basically the best

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.160
thing that can happen to
you in poker, pretty much--

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.800
almost this exact situation.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.800
So here, we've got
three of a kind.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.474
And there's also a lot of draws.

00:36:02.474 --> 00:36:04.640
So we're going to get played
back at a decent amount

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.889
because you could have hearts.

00:36:05.889 --> 00:36:07.724
He'd have like queen-jack.

00:36:07.724 --> 00:36:09.890
There's just so much stuff
that isn't going to fold,

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:11.806
and we're always going
to be way ahead of him.

00:36:11.806 --> 00:36:14.810
Pretty much always
going to be way ahead.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:15.470
So, it's sweet.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.380
I actually think this is very
close to the dream situation.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.140
Does anyone have an idea of
why this situation is almost,

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:26.670
in some sense, even better
than say, we had pocket 10's?

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:27.170
Yeah?

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.450
AUDIENCE: If you have pocket
10s, that's why you tap a 10?

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.158
WILL MA: Exactly.

00:36:30.158 --> 00:36:32.510
OK, I'm going to
give you a $20 boost.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.510
[CHUCKLING]

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.874
No more playoffs today.

00:36:37.874 --> 00:36:38.874
So you're going to see--

00:36:38.874 --> 00:36:40.280
OK, right.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.990
So it's almost even
better in some sense

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:45.640
you have pocket 5's
because as Ben said,

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.352
if you have pocket
5's, he could have a 10

00:36:48.352 --> 00:36:49.600
and put in a lot of money.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.130
If you have pocket 10's even
though you're crushing even

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.844
harder, it's almost like you've
taken all the good cards away

00:36:54.844 --> 00:36:56.510
and then he's just
always going to fold.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.500
So, OK, here's another situation
where your hand's very good,

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.554
although I think you can make
a case for just calling here.

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.970
Yeah, I don't want
to say you have

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.640
to raise because your hand
is just so invulnerable.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.484
And even though
the chances that he

00:37:09.484 --> 00:37:11.900
has that the remaining ace and
a better card to go with it

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.870
is pretty small, there is
still a lot of, I guess,

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.830
adverse selection in this
case because there's no draws.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.990
When you raise, he will
fold a lot of stuff.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.959
And the stuff that
he does play--

00:37:23.959 --> 00:37:26.000
it's not going to only
include the remaining ace.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.430
Like, he will call with
pocket 7's almost certainly,

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.570
but it does include--

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.820
it does significantly
make his range

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.760
more likely to be the
ace that beats you.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.089
So, I think just calling is OK.

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:40.130
Here, obviously, you have
the best possible hand.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:41.780
Although, once
again, I think just

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.560
calling as a sort of
a trap is reasonable.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.120
Although I would
advocate just raising.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.580
I think it's the simpler play.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:50.600
You know, a calling--

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.254
I think you'll see a lot of high
stakes players do as a trap,

00:37:54.254 --> 00:37:55.670
but it's a very,
very tricky play.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.830
I think raising definitely
has lots of merits

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:01.847
because if they've got
king-- like even ace-king,

00:38:01.847 --> 00:38:02.930
they're not going to fold.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.614
They just want to
get all the money in.

00:38:04.614 --> 00:38:07.030
Because they're probably going
to think you're more likely

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:09.740
you have a single
heart than two hearts.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.360
So if they had
ace-king, especially

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.120
when it's only 40 big blinds,
they're probably just going

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.960
to be happy putting
all the money in,

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.530
and before you can
see a fourth heart.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.930
So, like in this
case, even though you

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.280
don't need a fourth
heart to make a flush,

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.110
a fourth card is a
really bad card for you,

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.818
because that sort of
kills all the action

00:38:26.818 --> 00:38:28.550
that you're getting
from a king--

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.450
from a pair of
kings or something.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:34.220
Yeah, OK, so this is
a similar situation.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:38.240
Although in this case, I would
say a raise is mandatory.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.910
In the previous case, I
think it's not mandatory

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:42.900
because your hand is so safe.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.310
If you decide to try
to trap your opponent,

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:48.200
you'll never end up
trapping yourself.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.110
Whereas here, if they just
have any heart higher than a 6,

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:55.040
if a fourth heart comes,
they are beating you now.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.890
And worst of all is,
let's say they have

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:59.972
10 of hearts, 9 of diamonds.

00:38:59.972 --> 00:39:01.430
If you raise, you
could have easily

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.526
gotten them to fold that
10 of hearts, probably.

00:39:04.526 --> 00:39:07.010
Although, that 10 of hearts,
9 of diamonds is a bit good.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.345
Let's say like 9 of
hearts, 8 of diamonds.

00:39:09.345 --> 00:39:11.720
They almost certainly would've
folded their higher heart,

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.490
and now you just lost an entire
pot because you didn't raise.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.897
So here, I would raise.

00:39:18.897 --> 00:39:19.730
You have a straight.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.680
You are drawing dead
if they have a flush.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.685
But with only 40 big blinds,
I think the chances of a flush

00:39:24.685 --> 00:39:27.290
is unlikely enough
that getting in is OK.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:30.380
With 100 big blinds, you could
still raise, but probably

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.580
not go all in.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.650
Two-pair-- the board
is sort of scary,

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.750
but two-pair is definitely
good enough here.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.955
So--

00:39:38.955 --> 00:39:40.580
All right, so, these
are examples where

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.840
you had really good hands.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.923
And I said you should just
raise and get the money

00:39:43.923 --> 00:39:46.080
and then be happy about it.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.790
So do I need such a good hand?

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:51.040
There's some other situations
where a one-pair hand

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.020
is sort of good enough.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.850
And so, coming back to the
ace-jack example, you asked.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:57.752
So, we'll see some of that.

00:39:57.752 --> 00:39:59.210
OK, so in this
case, I think if you

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.340
have pocket aces,
that's definitely

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.530
good enough to get it in.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.444
Although, you shouldn't
have pocket aces that often

00:40:05.444 --> 00:40:06.860
here because most
of the time, you

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.720
should be re-raising preflop.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.410
But if you decide not to
raise pocket aces preflop

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:16.630
and you end up with it here,
then I guess raising is good.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.380
You're going to be
having the better hand.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.772
Although, if you were
trapping them preflop,

00:40:20.772 --> 00:40:22.980
maybe you just want to trap
them again and call again

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.916
since there's not
that many scary cards.

00:40:25.916 --> 00:40:28.040
So here's an example of an
ace-jack situation where

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.977
I think getting in is fine just
because there's still draws

00:40:31.977 --> 00:40:34.310
and there's still lots of
worse hands that will give you

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:37.440
action, but overall, your
equity against their range

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.660
is much, much higher on
jack-7-deuce than jack-10-9.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.260
So I would just raise and be
happy getting in 40 big blinds

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.630
here.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.810
Here's a similar example--

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:48.790
king-jack.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.880
But we've also got the
second best flush draw,

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.580
so it's just very
hard to get in back.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.160
OK, so we'll see some examples
where we have fewer chips.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.470
So in the last
case, all the hands,

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.450
we essentially had 40
big blinds-- essentially

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.312
had a lot of chips.

00:41:04.312 --> 00:41:06.620
So, OK, so now, let's
look at a situation

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.610
where all the players--

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:11.090
so we only have 1,250
to start the hand,

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.720
so that's 25 big blinds.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.820
And, OK, so in this
case, even if you've

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.900
got top pair with
a mediocre kicker,

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.920
I would just be prepared
to go all in because we

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.980
risking a lot fewer chips.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.910
We're risking a lot fewer
chips relative to the blinds.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:31.857
So here, I would just go all in.

00:41:31.857 --> 00:41:34.190
So here are some-- yes, so
I'm showing you some examples

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.430
where if I'm 40 or
more big blinds deep,

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.380
I wouldn't be happy
getting all my money in.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.300
But when I'm only
25 big blinds deep,

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.780
I'm very happy to
get all my money in.

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.000
This is another example--
top pair, top kicker.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.770
It is a scary board
in some sense,

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:53.120
but you've just got to gamble
for it when the pot is already

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.670
so big on the flop
relative to your stack.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.850
Same thing again here.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.552
So earlier, I had some
examples of this on--

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:03.510
similar to this where I
said, you just call it,

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.710
but when you've only got--

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.390
when you've only got four
to five times the flop--

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.970
I'm sorry, 45 times
the pot on the flop,

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:14.420
I would just go for it.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.382
OK, I'll quickly run
through this section.

00:42:17.382 --> 00:42:21.740
This is a slightly more
advanced play where--

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.230
it's where you don't check
to the preflop raisers.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.850
So this whole time,
I've been talking

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:29.420
about checking to preflop
raiser as a form of respect--

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.510
respecting that the preflop
raiser's range contains aces

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:35.330
and yours probably doesn't.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.950
So when do we want to lead?

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.940
So from a theoretical
point of view,

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.910
so from a
trying-to-play-optimally point

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:45.470
of view, essentially we want to
lead flops that hit our range

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.550
better than his, even though
his range contains aces,

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:51.560
which is like a
universal best hand.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.750
So they're rare,
but they do exist.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.460
And I think it's OK
if you never lead,

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.150
but I'm going to run
through this section showing

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.190
some examples where I
think leading is fun.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.860
But I think it's an
advanced, unnecessary play.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.360
So, OK, so here's an example.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.510
I hope this is visible.

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.560
So we won't-- we're
pretty shallow here.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.430
So most of the situations
where leading is good,

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:16.160
you're fairly shallow.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.245
So a cut-off two [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:18.245 --> 00:43:21.970
So one from the button
makes it 1,200 at 300, 600.

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:23.000
And there's antes.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.600
So, we call with 9-deuce suited
with 4 and 1/2 to 1 odds.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.630
OK, so-- and so,
here, we flop 2-5-6.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:37.460
And I lead a third of
pot, planning essentially

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:41.240
to get all my money in
because we're so shallow.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.460
Like, I only started the
hand with 10 big blinds.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.620
Essentially any pair is
going to be good enough

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.660
to get all my money
in, although, maybe

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.160
not if you raise
from under the gun.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.700
But from cut-off, I'm
happy to put all my money

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.200
in against this.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.230
So what's the rationale?

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.680
So, our hand's good enough
to put all our money in.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.560
And it's essentially a
better flop for our range

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.630
because we're short enough
where the immediate equity

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.390
preflop means so much
to us what we're calling

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.190
a very wide range of hands.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:13.730
Basically, a lot of hands that
includes 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's,

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:17.270
and 6's, whereas his range,
he opened from button--

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.340
sorry, he opened from cut-off.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.730
You know, even though it
contains more monstrous hands

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.830
than ours, like pocket aces,
it also just contains a lot

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.800
of hands like
jack-10, queen-10--

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.230
basically, hands that don't
connect with this board.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.815
Because if he had 6-5, he
probably isn't going to open,

00:44:33.815 --> 00:44:35.690
at least, I don't think
by my recommendations

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:37.220
he should be opening 6-5.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.230
Whereas we could
have hands like 6-5,

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.500
we can have hands like 4-3.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.490
So I'll lead here.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:45.740
So it's basically
essentially saying,

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.420
you know, I'm no
longer respecting you

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.030
because the flop came
in a very specific way

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:52.370
where now my range of
hands is actually better

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:53.520
than your range of hands.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.280
So I'm essentially
the preflop aggressor.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.410
I'm going to bet and
try to make the pot big

00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:59.930
and force you into a tough
situation with your weaker

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.600
range.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.910
And yeah, and we can play
like this with our good hands

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:07.460
and with our bad
hands, like 7-3.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.780
We have a gutshot, but
we can bluff a bit.

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.310
So here's another example.

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.990
So, under the gun raises.

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.560
We call with ace-9
suited, which I

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.800
think is a bit
speculative, but whatever.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.960
We just had to call.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.450
And we lead a 10-7-5 flop
where we have a flush draw.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.620
And once again, I
think it's reasonable.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.290
So it's deep-- it's fairly
deep, but we can have--

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.780
even though they can have aces,
we can have more hands like--

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.800
we can have more
pocket 5's, pocket 7's.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.770
Tighter hands than him.

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:39.740
He might not open those.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.320
And also, he almost
certainly isn't ever

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.210
going to have 9-8 of
diamonds or jack-9

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:47.660
of diamonds-- hands that are
basically monstrous draws,

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:48.860
whereas we can.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.590
So once again, I'd bet
because I don't really

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:55.180
want him to check back ace-king
or pocket 8's or something,

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.580
which he probably will,
because if they have ace-king,

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.380
they're going to think
the board is fairly scary.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.880
They're probably not going to
fold that much because there's

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.110
so many draws if I bet.

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:07.120
So they're just going
to check back ace-king.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.400
And that essentially has--

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.430
that essentially
has two problems,

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.600
is we're not beating
ace-king unless we improve,

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.140
so by betting, we basically
we just make the pot bigger

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:21.190
against ace-king and 9's,
and we can get them to fold.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:25.570
Whereas if we check, it
might just checked down.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.090
And yeah, so-- so yeah.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:29.710
One caveat about
leading though is

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.590
if your opponent knows leading
is part of your strategy,

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:36.550
then your range is significantly
weaker when you actually check.

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:38.677
So as a result, if
your opponent knows

00:46:38.677 --> 00:46:40.385
you're the type of
player who, let's say,

00:46:40.385 --> 00:46:42.440
on a-- you know, so
this is really getting

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.220
higher-- next and next level.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.630
But if they know that
you're the type of player

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:48.880
you will lead a
lot of your hands

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.360
on a 2-5-6 flop in this
specific situation,

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.180
then when you check to them
with a hand like jack-10,

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.050
they can basically
just bet and know

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:00.400
you'll almost certainly
fold, because you're leading

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.570
a lot of your good hands.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.590
So that's another
caveat about leading.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:07.355
It's very tricky to
balance correctly

00:47:07.355 --> 00:47:09.840
because you need to-- you
know, if you're leading bluffs,

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.280
you need to also lead some
good hands to balance it out.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.276
But then you also need to check
some good hands occasionally

00:47:15.276 --> 00:47:16.900
to balance out all
the bad hands you're

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.660
checking so that your opponent
can't just bet for free.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.420
So it's a very tricky play.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.940
I wanted to quickly run through
it to just say it's out there,

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:28.332
and when you watch poker and
you see people not automatically

00:47:28.332 --> 00:47:30.040
check to the preflop
aggressor, just sort

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.510
of giving you an idea of why.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.390
But it is a fairly
advanced and tricky play.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:37.300
And it's easy to make mistakes
leading, which is why I think--

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.790
you know, I think it's fine
if throughout this course

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.570
you never lead.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:44.830
OK, so now we're going to
talk get some implied odds

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.570
and reverse implied odds.

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:48.730
So, OK, so here's a situation.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:52.540
So note that-- so we have
the worst hand in poker.

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:56.590
We've got-- we've only
got three big blinds, OK?

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:59.350
And hijack raises to 2,400.

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:02.690
So the question is, do we want
to call in this situation?

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.380
So we're putting in 1,600.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.990
So we can do a quick
equity calculation.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.220
So if we call, we're all in.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.530
So the only thing that
matters is the equity

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.946
of our hand against his range.

00:48:12.946 --> 00:48:14.320
That's essentially
the only thing

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.240
that matters because he
has no more decisions.

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.370
So optimal play doesn't
even matter in this case.

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:22.130
It's a strict mathematical
expectation calculation.

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:25.430
And we're actually--
so basically,

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:27.190
we need a call two big blinds.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:29.260
So 1,600-- that's
two big blinds.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.520
To win how much is already in
the pot is 5 and 1/2, right?

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.720
5 and 1/2 big blinds.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.010
So they made a big raise here.

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:39.650
They made it 3x.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:43.810
So we need 2 over 7.5,
which is 27% equity.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:45.970
And if we put him on
a reasonable range

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.130
for that position,
we have 28% equity,

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.317
which is enough to call.

00:48:49.317 --> 00:48:50.900
So I think calling
is a fine play, OK?

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.710
I'm not winning in
front of this person who

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:54.790
I think probably was me.

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:56.690
So, yeah, calling's a fine play.

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:00.220
And so, now, but I
want to emphasize, OK?

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.990
So if calling is a
good play because it's

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.660
positive expectancy,
why don't we

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.530
call when we have more chips?

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:12.100
So in this situation,
if someone called,

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.020
they would probably
be ridiculed, right?

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.019
Why are you calling with
2-7 offsuit against a hijack

00:49:18.019 --> 00:49:19.810
raise that isn't even
giving you good odds,

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.880
because they raised it
3x, which is a big raise.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.320
So why is it bad in this case,
when you have more chips?

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.180
And the reason is
essentially what's

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:30.280
called reverse implied odds.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.140
So in the first situation, we
called because we were all in,

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.560
and the equity
calculations said we could.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.510
But in the second
situation, even

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.400
though the equity
calculation is the same

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.400
and we do have the right
odds to call preflop,

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.750
the hand isn't over.

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:47.320
There is still potentially
46,000 more chips

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.970
to be put in postflop.

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:52.075
And with a hand like
7-deuce offsuit,

00:49:52.075 --> 00:49:54.850
not only is it a weak hand,
it's very hard to play.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:57.050
When we hit a pair,
we hit a small pair.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.680
We're often not going to be
sure whether we have the better

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.440
hand.

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.061
We're going to have to decide
whether to fold or call them

00:50:03.061 --> 00:50:03.560
down.

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.410
And we're often
going to be wrong.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.140
So, it's a very, very easy
fold in this situation

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:11.200
even though you have the odds,
because these reverse implied

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.890
odds hurt you so much when
there is still potentially

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:19.000
46,000 to play for postflop.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.820
OK, so here, let's say
instead of 7-2 offsuit,

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.620
I had ace-2 offsuit.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.100
I would still fold.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.430
So if you do the same
equity calculation,

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:32.420
we actually have 43% against
his range, which is tremendous.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:37.270
But you only need 27%
equity to all in, right?

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:40.195
So, why would we fold
when we have 43% equity

00:50:40.195 --> 00:50:42.220
and we only need 27% equity?

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:46.780
That reason is because, once
again, reverse implied odds.

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:48.700
So, there used to be
actually be this way you

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:50.690
could cheat in online poker.

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.360
So they had this thing
called disconnect

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.530
protection which is
someone disconnects-- this

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:57.130
is really stupid.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.490
I got cheated by
this so many times.

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:02.370
Basically, if you disconnected,
instead of your hand

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:05.370
getting folded, essentially
there's no more betting

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:08.460
and all the cards are dealt.
And the person who wins the hand

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.390
just wins the pot.

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.512
OK, so essentially
by disconnecting,

00:51:11.512 --> 00:51:12.720
you could say, OK, screw you.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.860
There's no more betting.

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.120
We're just going to
see until the river,

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.453
and whoever wins the hand is
going to win the whole pot.

00:51:17.453 --> 00:51:19.770
So basically, you could
cheat in this situation

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:23.170
even if you had 7-2 offsuit,
by just calling and then

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:24.450
disconnecting immediately.

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:27.510
And then none of this
reverse implied odds exist.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.340
But you can't cheat
like this anymore,

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.164
so don't try to make that play.

00:51:32.164 --> 00:51:34.580
So yeah, so in this case, even
though you have 43% equity,

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.050
I would fold.

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:39.560
Here, with 9-8 suited, it's
a whole different story.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.440
We only have 37% equity,
which is worse than 43%.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.510
But I would call.

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:48.360
With 9-8 suited,
you can make a flush

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.800
and make a better hand than him.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.300
You can make a straight and get
him to put in a lot of money

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:54.025
with a good pair.

00:51:54.025 --> 00:51:55.650
And yeah, you're
still out of position.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:57.730
You still have to act second.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:02.680
But overall, it's just
a much better situation.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.130
OK, so now, I want to
talk about implied odds.

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:10.720
So with the 9-8 suited, you
know, I sort of talked about--

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.560
the implied odds, the
fact that you still

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:16.017
have to play for more chips
after on the turn and river

00:52:16.017 --> 00:52:17.600
almost works in your
favor because you

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.390
can make straights and flushes
and have a very good hand

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.100
and be fairly certain
you're winning,

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:25.760
and get him to put in more
money with a worse hand.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.560
So implied odds is
basically, yeah,

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:31.340
it's when the odds
are in your favor

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.260
because you're playing a hand
that plays well postflop.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:39.177
OK, so-- OK, so let's
look at an example

00:52:39.177 --> 00:52:40.760
where implied odds,
I think, are good.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.230
So this is called set mining.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.240
This is a play that's, I think--

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.090
so, I'm going to go through it
even though it's a play that's

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:48.310
sort of dying in poker.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:51.050
I think it's a play that
no longer works that

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:55.310
well in practice nowadays,
at least at like, at fairly

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.490
high stakes.

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:59.390
But it's in theory, I think it
teaches you a very good thing

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:01.400
about implied odds.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.760
So, in this case, under
the gun raises to 3x--

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.810
2,400 when the
blinds are 400, 800.

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.480
And we decide to call.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:14.570
So if you do the calculation,
we don't have enough equity

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.670
to call, but why do we call?

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:19.100
So essentially,
we're in a position

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.200
because we have the button.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.050
And also, we can win
essentially a huge pot

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.000
when we hit a third deuce.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.990
So now, this only happens a
small percent of the time.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:31.660
And if you do the calculation,
this happens roughly 1/8

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:32.560
of the time.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.790
You're going to hit a third
deuce 1/8 of the time.

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.157
And essentially when
you don't hit a deuce,

00:53:37.157 --> 00:53:38.740
you're against an
under-the-gun raise,

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.090
so he's going to have
a really strong range.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:43.580
You're going to lose
the pot 7/8 of the time,

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:45.374
essentially, roughly speaking.

00:53:45.374 --> 00:53:46.790
So what this is
essentially saying

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:50.660
is if I'm only winning
the pot 1/8 of the time,

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:54.380
I need to win on average 8
times as much as I lose for it

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.700
to be worth it, right?

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:58.200
But the point is, at least
back in the day in poker,

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.040
you essentially do, because
when you do hit the deuce,

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:04.220
they just-- they're going to
have pocket aces or pocket

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.960
kings or, you know, the
flop will come ace-6-2

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.231
and they'll have ace-king.

00:54:08.231 --> 00:54:09.980
They'll just have a
tremendously good hand

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.450
that's still
crushed by your hand

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:16.250
so often that you definitely,
essentially, 1/8 of the time,

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.710
you lose 2,400 chips, and--

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:21.830
I'm sorry, 7/8 of the
time, you lose 2,400 chips,

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:23.950
and 1/8 of the time, you
win their whole stack

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:25.280
of 80,000 chips.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.450
Essentially, it's what
the best situation is.

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:34.970
So, yeah, so you need
a lot of chips for this

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:36.157
to be a good play.

00:54:36.157 --> 00:54:38.240
You know, even if you have
40 big blinds which is,

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.900
by our standards, fairly
deep, it's still not that good

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.190
because, once again, you
only win 1/8 of the time.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:47.570
So, you really need to
win a lot when you win.

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:51.064
And like when you hit
a 2, it's not 100% sure

00:54:51.064 --> 00:54:52.730
that he's going to
put in all his money.

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:55.550
So the fact-- so
basically, you're

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:57.490
only winning a huge
pot even less than 1/8.

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.490
Like you need to hit a
2, and you need to have--

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.770
you have aces or kings.

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:04.295
So you know, that's going
to be like 1/20 or whatever.

00:55:04.295 --> 00:55:09.920
But the point is if
the stack is so deep,

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.474
then it's still worth
it, essentially.

00:55:12.474 --> 00:55:14.390
And the reason why it's
sort of dying in poker

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.000
is because I think
nowadays, players

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.820
are good enough where even if
they have aces under the gun,

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:22.200
they realize the
optimal strategy isn't

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:26.147
to always put all your
money in on a 7-5-2 flop.

00:55:26.147 --> 00:55:28.480
But yeah, long story short,
I think this is a fine play.

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.688
I think it's fine if you do
it in the current league.

00:55:30.688 --> 00:55:34.190
Because it's tough to fold
aces on a 7-5-deuce flop.

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:38.420
And yeah, I think it's a good
play to know about at least.

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:40.900
So, here is another hand.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.980
So, cut-off raises to 2,000.

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.060
We have jack-10
suited on the button.

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:48.200
So once again, we don't
have direct odds to call.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.930
But we have good implied odds
because we're in position

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:54.006
and we've got a
suited connected hand.

00:55:54.006 --> 00:55:55.880
OK, so I'm going to go
through the whole hand

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:58.680
because there's going to be more
examples of implied odds here.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:03.020
So both blinds fold, and
the preflop aggressor,

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:06.590
the cut-off continuation--
that's about a bit less

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:08.300
than half of pot.

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.980
And we have a flush draw here.

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.070
So, what is the
effective stack size?

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:16.060
Even though we started
the hand with 80,000,

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.770
they only have-- they only
started the hand with 30,000.

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:21.740
So the effective stack
size is only 30,000.

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.390
So we're definitely not folding.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:25.520
We could call or we could raise.

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.030
The problem with raising is when
we raise and they go all in,

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:31.760
we're sort in a really
crappy situation where

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.090
our hand's too good to
really want to fold,

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:37.880
but too weak to have the
odds to call his all-in.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:44.230
So I think just calling
is the right play.

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:47.470
And yeah, and raising gives him
the opportunity to re-raise on.

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:50.022
If we call, he can't say,
oh, because right now, I'm

00:56:50.022 --> 00:56:51.230
putting in more chips, right?

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:54.520
So, OK, so we miss on the
turn, which kind of sucks.

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.530
And they bet fairly big.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:59.170
They bet 8,000 into 12,000.

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:02.470
So let's do an analysis.

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.930
So, OK, so if I'm
simplifying an assumption,

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:07.660
let's assume they have it, OK?

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.330
Let's assume we modeled
them most fairly tight.

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:12.790
When they're making this
bet, they've got us beat.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:15.910
We're not going to win the hand
by rivering a jack or a 10.

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.650
We need to river a diamond.

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:21.550
So essentially, let's assume
they just have ace-king,

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:24.280
or they're going to have
a pair of aces, at least.

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.950
So we need to call 8,000
to win 20,000 in the pot,

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:30.520
so we need 8 over
28, or 29% equity.

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.150
And if you count, there's
9 diamonds out of 46 cards,

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:39.830
so we only have 20% equity,
and we need 29% equity.

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:41.410
But I would still call.

00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:44.860
So, because when we call
and we hit our flush, we can

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:47.380
actually-- we can
bet on the river,

00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:50.200
and there's a decent chance
that we're going to get called.

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.600
Whereas if we call
and we miss our flush,

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.765
we can just happily fold.

00:57:54.765 --> 00:57:56.140
Does that make
sense to everyone?

00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.450
So we don't really have
the odds to call here.

00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:02.080
But we call because
if we hit our diamond,

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.730
we can go all in on the river.

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:06.010
And there's a decent chance
they're going to call us,

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.050
and we're going
to win more money.

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:09.950
So we actually do have
the odds, essentially.

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:11.210
We have the implied odds.

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:15.397
OK, so here's a
similar scenario.

00:58:15.397 --> 00:58:17.230
So pretend the same
thing happened, but this

00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:18.740
was the situation instead.

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:21.460
In this case, I think we
should definitely fold.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:23.560
So what changed was
instead of having

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.266
two diamonds on the board
and two diamonds in our hand,

00:58:26.266 --> 00:58:27.890
now there's three
diamonds on the board

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:29.720
and one diamond in our hand.

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.730
So it's worse for
many, many reasons.

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:36.865
So one is when you only have
one diamond in your hand

00:58:36.865 --> 00:58:40.600
and there's three
diamonds on the board,

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.080
if they have
ace-king, it's going

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:44.416
to be more obvious that
we probably have a flush

00:58:44.416 --> 00:58:46.540
if we bet on the river and
they have like ace-king.

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.581
So they're probably just
going to fold this king.

00:58:48.581 --> 00:58:51.670
So, we're not going to get paid
off when we hit the diamond.

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:55.900
And even worse, we're not
even drawing to the best hand.

00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.550
Like, what if they have ace-king
with the king of diamonds?

00:58:58.550 --> 00:58:59.549
Then we're just crushed.

00:58:59.549 --> 00:59:01.400
We're drawing dead
in this situation.

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.010
There's no cards
that can help us win.

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:06.650
So that's just such a huge risk.

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:10.780
So, yeah, and also, a small
thing, but the board is paired.

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:14.290
So it's possible they have
like pocket aces, or ace-5.

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.640
They already have a full house.

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:20.094
And even if we hit the best
flush, we're not going to win.

00:59:20.094 --> 00:59:23.950
OK, so-- OK, so, that was
a good example, I think,

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:26.170
of when you have
the implied odds

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:28.030
to call with your
draw to try to hit.

00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:30.220
When you don't have the
implied odds to try to hit.

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.510
But we can also
bluff with draws.

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:34.090
So in all the
examples I gave you

00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:36.040
before where you
check-raised the flop,

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.480
we had a good hand, right?

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.010
But obviously, this
is predictable.

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:41.050
If they know that we only
check-raise their flop

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.760
that with two-pair
or better, they

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.690
can just fold whenever they
have one-pair or worse, right?

00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:49.660
So draws, not only are they good
for implied odds purposes where

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.530
you call and then only put
in more money when you hit,

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:55.570
they're also very good for
bluffing in certain situations.

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.700
So essentially,
what you'll realize

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.696
is bluffing sort of
equivalent to having a draw,

01:00:03.696 --> 01:00:04.522
in some sense.

01:00:04.522 --> 01:00:05.980
Because the hands
you want to bluff

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:11.060
with are the hands that
have some draw value.

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.360
So, here's an example.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.420
The button raises to 1,600.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.760
So we're 20 big blinds deep.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.350
And one of the big
blind with 10-9,

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:24.300
and we call with
our 4.5 to 1 odds.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.100
OK, and the flop is jack-10-5.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.710
So we've got what I would
consider a good draw.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.290
So a good draw, I would
say, usually means

01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:34.460
either an open-ended
straight draw.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.885
So four-in-a-row do a straight.

01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:38.560
So there's eight potential cards
that complete your straight,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.100
or a flush draw, which
it usually has 9 outs.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.920
OK, and then they bet 2,500.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.040
And then we go all
in in this situation.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.210
Essentially, we're bluffing.

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.790
We're hoping they fold.

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:52.870
But why is this a good play?

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:55.510
So, you know, it seems
pretty sane to just

01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:56.405
call instead, right?

01:00:56.405 --> 01:00:58.571
Because we can call, we can
have perfect information

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.590
of when we hit, when
we don't, and only risk

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.960
more money if we do.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.427
But it's actually also quite a
good play to go all in because

01:01:06.427 --> 01:01:08.260
even though it looks
like we have a bad hand

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.620
to be risking all our chips
because we only have 10-high.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.130
The point is the
fact that we have

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:15.730
10-high doesn't matter
because they're never

01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:19.210
calling our all-in with a naked
queen-high or king-high, right?

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:21.910
They're not to call
with a random hand.

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:26.440
So what matters isn't how good
our hand is, in this case,

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:26.960
10-high.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.680
What matters is how many outs
we have against the hands

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.900
that they called.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.990
So in this case, we're
always going to have 8 outs.

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:36.800
Even if they have the
best possible hand,

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.620
like pocket jacks, we're
still going to have 8 outs.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.270
So, this is a great hand to
bluff with because if we call,

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:47.110
we might just lose the pot
to queen-high by the river.

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:49.709
Whereas if we
check-raise all in,

01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:51.250
it's essentially
the opposite of what

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:54.310
I was talking about before with
like being averagely selected.

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:57.000
Here, it's just essentially
being beneficially selected

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.135
because all the hands
that barely beat you,

01:01:59.135 --> 01:02:00.190
he's going to fold.

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:03.250
And if they have a hand
as good as j-- ugh.

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.470
When they have a hand
as good as jack-jack,

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:10.000
it's almost, like,
wasted, you know?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.845
They haven't-- they got
their jack-jack with--

01:02:12.845 --> 01:02:14.970
if they had jack-jack,
they're hoping we have like,

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:17.432
pocket 8's that only has
one out against them.

01:02:17.432 --> 01:02:18.890
But here, we have
a much worse hand

01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:22.026
than pocket 8's with
8 outs against them.

01:02:22.026 --> 01:02:23.650
You can contrast this
with having, say,

01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:25.200
like 6-5 on this flop.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.730
6-5 is a really bad
hand to raise with.

01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:30.040
You just want to be
calling because it's

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.450
sort of the opposite.

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:33.790
Any hand that beats you is
going to be crushing you,

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.581
and you're going to
fold out the hands that

01:02:35.581 --> 01:02:38.770
are already using to your 6-5.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:43.000
But yeah, so 6-5, if you're
against like ace-jack,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.710
you only have five outs.

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:48.880
And you have close to 0%
equity against flopping jacks.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.290
So, right, so this
is essentially

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:51.330
the bluffing epiphany.

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:52.810
So when you're
bluffing, the-- when

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:54.601
you're bluffing before
the river, the thing

01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:58.150
that matters isn't how good
our hand is, it's how many

01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:59.960
outs we have.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.910
OK, so-- right, OK,
so this is essentially

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.610
just me talking about
the bluffing epiphany.

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:08.590
So you want to always
bluff with hands

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:10.850
that have a high number
of outs against the hands

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:12.980
that you get called by.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:15.130
So, here's an
example of something

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.830
that's not bluffing, OK?

01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:23.320
So the cut-off raises to 90 and
we call with 7-6 of diamonds

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.067
on the big blind.

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:25.150
And this happens randomly.

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:27.580
You know, sometimes you'll
see someone make a play like,

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.540
what if ends--

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.040
You're going to-- so someone
will make a play like this.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:30.998
And it's going to work.

01:03:30.998 --> 01:03:32.830
And they're going to
look like a genius.

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:35.510
So, we check to
the preflop raiser.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:38.820
We've got nothing, but we have
a read that they, like, scratch

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.600
their ear or something.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:45.040
So, we check-raise
hoping that they fold.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.040
So we get called.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.360
And, you know, we still got
absolutely nothing here.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.520
And we bet on the
turn because that's

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.890
the only way we could
potentially win the hand.

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:56.119
And they call.

01:03:56.119 --> 01:03:57.410
And then we still have nothing.

01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:59.680
And then as a last resort,
we go all in on the river.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.494
And, you know, a good
percent of the time,

01:04:01.494 --> 01:04:02.410
they're going to fold.

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:05.290
And we're going to look like a
genius for making this bluff,

01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:05.860
right?

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.130
So basically this is not-- so
yeah, this is not bluffing.

01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:10.930
This is essentially
opening your wallet

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.690
and giving your money
to your opponent.

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:19.030
So when you're
check-raising, you're

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:21.100
essentially-- the
reason why you were

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.110
check-raising in the
first place as a bluff is

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:25.930
because you had some chance
of making a good hand.

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:28.795
And essentially, a
bluff is because your--

01:04:28.795 --> 01:04:30.827
the hand that you could
have potentially made,

01:04:30.827 --> 01:04:32.785
the flush that you
potentially could have made,

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:33.880
didn't get there.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.790
It's not because you started
with a hand that could never

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:39.262
make anything on this board
and it didn't get there.

01:04:39.262 --> 01:04:44.650
So, OK, so here's
a similar situation

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:46.841
where I think it makes
a lot more sense.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.340
So it's going to
be a similar board,

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.110
but we have 10-9 of hearts.

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:55.180
And here, we check-raise
their flop bet.

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.950
So this situation's
a bit different

01:04:56.950 --> 01:05:00.330
than the jack-10 diamond
situation from a while ago,

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:02.500
where we only called
with a flush draw.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.380
The reason why
raising here is better

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.720
is because the stack
sizes is deeper.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:10.930
So with the jack-10
of diamonds hand,

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:12.730
the problem with
check-raising was there's

01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:14.470
a risk they would go all in.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:17.140
And we would fold because we
don't have good enough odds,

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.820
yet our hand is so good.

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:22.990
Here, our hand is similarly
good, but because it's so deep.

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:26.410
So, we actually started
the hand with, I think,

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:29.730
100 big blinds instead
of 40 big blinds.

01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:31.780
They're pretty
unlikely to go all in.

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.030
So here, check-raising
10-9 of hearts

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:39.400
has a lot lower chance of
getting blown off the hand.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.260
OK, and we get a called.

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.560
And we turn a 15-out draw.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.380
So we had 9 outs here, right?

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.830
But the jack now
essentially gives us

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:54.970
15 outs because it gives us
the 8 open-ended straight outs,

01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:59.350
plus the 9 flush outs, minus
the 2 from double counting-- so

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:00.460
15 outs.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.730
And we bet 650 here.

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.940
So it's the same
hand as a 7-6 suited.

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:07.260
It's the same hand
as the stupid play.

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.560
We're betting here.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.750
And we get called.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:12.190
So, some notes.

01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:13.930
Here, our hand was
good enough where

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:19.570
even though when bet 650
into the pot on this turn,

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:20.662
they could go all in.

01:06:20.662 --> 01:06:22.120
If they have like
ace-jack, they're

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.560
probably going to go all in.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.300
And you know it's going to suck.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:30.490
But we have good enough
odds in this case,

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:33.690
because we have so many
outs, that we can even

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:34.600
call an all-in.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.830
So it's fine.

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:38.980
We can just call.

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:42.790
And yeah, so, note that
by check-raising the flop,

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:43.930
betting turn--

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:45.790
so the good thing
about playing draws

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:48.580
like this is that now, if
we play draws like this,

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:52.240
we can also play our good hands,
like ace-8 or pocket deuces

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.336
like this, and get
paid off a lot more.

01:06:55.336 --> 01:06:56.530
So, OK, so we get called.

01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:58.300
And then the river is a king.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.710
It's not the scariest card, but
we can have queen-10 of hearts.

01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:04.690
We could easily get
a queen-10 of hearts.

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:06.390
So we go all in here.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:09.385
And even if the king
wasn't scary at all,

01:07:09.385 --> 01:07:11.570
like even if the king
was like a 3 or a deuce,

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:15.550
I'm fine with just going all
in because that's the only way

01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:16.660
we can win the hand.

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.414
But it's a fine excuse here
to go all in with 10-high

01:07:19.414 --> 01:07:21.580
on the river, and say that's
the only way I could've

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.760
won the hand because there was
a reason I was check-raising

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.065
and representing all the
strength on the flop at turn,

01:07:27.065 --> 01:07:27.565
right?

01:07:27.565 --> 01:07:29.080
It's because I had a heart draw.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.734
My heart draw didn't
get there, so now, I

01:07:31.734 --> 01:07:34.150
need to desperately, to have
a chance of winning the hand,

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.020
go all in.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.270
But it's reasonable.

01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:40.060
The reason why I got to this
situation, this bad situation,

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:42.191
is because essentially
I got unlucky, right?

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:44.190
I had a chance of hitting
a flush, and I didn't.

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:47.394
It's not like the
7-6 case where I

01:07:47.394 --> 01:07:49.810
knew I was going to get it in
this situation, which is not

01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:51.010
a good situation.

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:56.350
But here, I got a bit unlucky
to get in this situation.

01:07:56.350 --> 01:08:01.010
OK, so-- all right, so I think
this is the last example.

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:04.400
So, last example of when
you give up on a bluff.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.930
So sometimes, you're bluffing.

01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:07.190
You don't have a great hand.

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:10.700
But sometimes, you just give
up because you figured out

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.190
your opponent's not
folding, or the board

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:16.310
comes out in a way where
it's not theoretically

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.859
a good idea for you
planning to fold.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:21.100
So hijack minus 1 makes it 90.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.340
Cut-off calls.

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.689
And we're 100 bets deep.

01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:28.189
We call with jack-9 of
hearts from the big blind.

01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:32.630
OK, so the flop is a 10-7-deuce.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:33.979
And so we have a--

01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:34.939
we get a decent flop.

01:08:34.939 --> 01:08:37.609
So once again, you know, we
have a reasonable draw here.

01:08:37.609 --> 01:08:39.229
We have some reason
to be bluffing.

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:40.399
We don't have nothing.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:43.700
We have some reason to be
bluffing because even though--

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.970
essentially, we're
hoping to turn 8, even

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:49.759
though the chances that is
only 4 out of 47, which is low.

01:08:52.289 --> 01:08:53.330
But it's still something.

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.010
And it's much better
to bluff with a 4

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:58.689
out of 47 chance of making
a monster hand than a 0

01:08:58.689 --> 01:09:00.170
out of 47 chance.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:04.290
So, OK, so here,
this was interesting.

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:06.337
The preflop aggressor
checked, which is fine.

01:09:06.337 --> 01:09:08.920
As the preflop aggressor, you're
not forced to grant the flop.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.130
So, but this-- but note that
the preflop aggressor is not

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:14.210
the guy who got the flop.

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:16.580
So the cut-off bets the
flop, but the cut-off

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.330
was not the preflop aggressor.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:20.830
OK, so the cut-off
shouldn't have pocket aces.

01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:23.899
They could occasionally, but
it's less likely than usual

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:26.750
that they have pocket aces.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.390
So they bet, and we decide
to check-raise here.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.609
And yeah, I think this is
a very reasonable play.

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:32.870
So what are the reasons?

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:34.520
One-- so yeah, we
have something.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.880
We can try to turn an 8.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.439
And also, turning
a jack is fine.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:41.779
We also turn a heart.

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:45.587
And so we had lots
of backdoor draws.

01:09:45.587 --> 01:09:46.420
We can turn a heart.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.840
That will give us four hearts.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.340
And we could turn even
like a queen will give us

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.460
an open-ended straight draw.

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.010
A king will also give us an
open-ended straight draw.

01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:56.610
So that's the weird case where--

01:09:56.610 --> 01:10:00.890
so if the turn is a king, then
the board will be king-10-7.

01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:02.420
And we'll have the jack-9.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:05.570
And then an 8 or a queen
will give us a straight.

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:06.860
It's one of the rare cases.

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:10.370
It's called-- it's
called a double gutshot,

01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:11.217
or a double gutter.

01:10:11.217 --> 01:10:13.550
So it's one of the weird--
it's one of the strange cases

01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:14.258
to watch out for.

01:10:14.258 --> 01:10:17.154
It's possible that you have
an 8-out straight draw,

01:10:17.154 --> 01:10:19.070
even though you don't
have four to a straight.

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:22.139
So one example is
where you have like--

01:10:22.139 --> 01:10:24.680
it's like this one, where you
have a king and then jack-10-9,

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.970
and then 7.

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:28.790
And another example is where,
let's say you have like,

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:32.640
king-jack on an
ace-10-7-6 board.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.090
Then essentially the board--

01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:38.395
essentially, it's
ace-king-blank, jack-10-blank,

01:10:38.395 --> 01:10:39.470
8-7.

01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:41.640
So then you have it
hit a 9 or a queen.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.020
So there's a couple of weird
straight draws you can have.

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.900
But anyways, the point is--

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.190
so yeah, I think this
is a good play, not only

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:52.100
because we have a crappy
hand that's basically--

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:55.560
so basically, a crappy draw is a
really good hand to bluff with,

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.071
but also the fact that their
range isn't particularly

01:10:59.071 --> 01:10:59.570
strong here.

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:01.310
Because they can't
really have aces.

01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:05.480
So, I mean, they can have pocket
7's or pocket deuces, I guess,

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.310
but also we're attacking the
fact that he's not the preflop

01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.810
raiser.

01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:12.260
So their range
isn't that strong.

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:17.000
OK, so, so, hijack minus
1, the preflop aggressor,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:17.870
gets out of the way.

01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:20.420
And then cut-off calls us.

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:24.350
And then the turn is a 7,
which is basically the worst

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:25.470
card in the deck for us.

01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:27.260
I'd say the 7 of clubs.

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:29.305
Even if it was like
the 7 of spades,

01:11:29.305 --> 01:11:32.720
it would've been better.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.237
So, why is this the worst card?

01:11:34.237 --> 01:11:36.320
So first of all, it doesn't
help us at all, right?

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.445
It doesn't give us any kind
of better straight draw

01:11:38.445 --> 01:11:40.430
or better flush draw or a pair.

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:43.790
And furthermore,
it's fairly safe.

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:45.732
You know, even if
the turn was an ace,

01:11:45.732 --> 01:11:47.440
we could at least
pretend we have an ace.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.585
The 7 is a fairly safe card.

01:11:49.585 --> 01:11:50.960
If they have a
pair 10's, they're

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:54.620
not jeopardized
because of ace-king.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:57.200
Furthermore, the main
issue is his range

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.740
is going to be a lot more likely
to contain a 7 than our range.

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.510
Because, remember
what I said earlier,

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:04.190
you don't really
want to be raising--

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:07.359
check-raising the flop with
your middle-of-the-road hands.

01:12:07.359 --> 01:12:09.900
Because your middle-of-the-road
hands, you want to just call.

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.080
Because when you raise, you're
getting called by worse--

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.663
sorry, you're getting
called by better

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:15.050
and you're folding out worse.

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:17.820
So, probably if I had
a 7 on the flop here,

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.160
I'm never check-raising.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.590
So basically, I
can't have a 7 here.

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:25.170
And furthermore, they're a
lot more likely to have a 7.

01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:26.600
So this just really hurts us.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.640
Essentially, it's
just a bad situation

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.540
where their range is a lot
stronger than our range.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:36.380
And basically the best thing we
can do is just fold our hand.

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.880
There's no point--
you know, there's

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.787
no point to try to
continue bluffing.

01:12:39.787 --> 01:12:41.870
Like, it's sort of like
playing the "who's taller"

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:44.720
game where you don't
get to see my height,

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.360
but you know that I was
like malnourished as a kid.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.246
Like you just know,
on average, there's

01:12:49.246 --> 01:12:50.870
no way I'm going to
be taller than you.

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:55.372
So the right thing to do
here is just stop our bluff.

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:57.080
And it was like the
worst card that came,

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:00.950
but we just give up the
hand, which is fine.

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:02.950
And then they take down the pot.

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:05.940
Right, so, bluffing
epiphany 2 is basically,

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.050
other than counting
how many outs we have,

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.700
it's important to analyze
what we're representing.

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:11.825
What else is in our range?

01:13:11.825 --> 01:13:12.866
You know, we're bluffing.

01:13:12.866 --> 01:13:14.140
We don't have a good hand.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.970
But what's the good hand
that we could potentially

01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:19.430
have in some other
parallel universes

01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:21.430
that we're representing?

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:25.070
And in this case, there
just really isn't anything.

01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:27.080
So yeah, so like an
ace-turn would've been fine.

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.700
Even a 6-turn
would have been OK,

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.550
because we could
have represented 9-8.

01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:35.540
So, one of the best times to
bluff is when your draw missed,

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.010
but a different draw completed.

01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:38.240
So like if you had
a straight draw

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.906
and you were bluffing
the flop, and then

01:13:39.906 --> 01:13:43.000
the turn completes the flush,
it's reasonable to bet.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.740
I mean, you do run into the
risk that they have the flush,

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.470
but also it's just they're going
to be more scared of the flush.

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:50.690
And similarly, yeah,
like if you have

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:54.830
a flush draw and the straight
completes, you can also bet.

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.400
OK, so, yeah, so I'm running
through a lot of poker concepts

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:57.900
today.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:58.790
So that's the end.

01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:00.050
I'll give a quick summary.

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:03.260
So hopefully, this will
give people more ideas

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.720
on how to play online.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.300
I know I sort of left you
guys in the dark last time.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.640
I mean, I ran through
things pretty quickly this

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:13.137
[AUDIO OUT],, but hopefully,
as you play more,

01:14:13.137 --> 01:14:15.470
it's OK if you didn't understand
everything immediately.

01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:17.095
But hopefully, as
you play more, you'll

01:14:17.095 --> 01:14:19.490
be like, ah, implied
odds, or you'll

01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:21.740
be reminded of examples
from this class.

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:24.140
So yeah, so we covered
continuation betting,

01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:27.440
the preflop aggressor getting
the respect, being able to bet,

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.560
the Fundamental Theorem
of Poker about how

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.600
you bet your good hands
and bluff your bad hands.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.160
We analyzed different
flops, and I

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.060
tried to give you a general
idea of what sorts of--

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:42.700
how good your hand needs to
be on certain kinds of flops.

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.380
And yeah, so when I showed
you the different flops,

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:47.450
you know, what I told you--

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:50.649
I didn't like mathematically
prove that calling is good

01:14:50.649 --> 01:14:51.440
or raising is good.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.810
It's basically just
like from experience

01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:56.540
and from doing calculations,
I know roughly your equity

01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.170
is good enough.

01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:59.240
But I didn't like,
mathematically prove it.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.940
So you essentially
just have to trust me

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.180
in that sense for the example
flops that I showed you,

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.922
because I didn't show
any calculations.

01:15:06.922 --> 01:15:08.380
Yeah, we talked
about when to lead.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.640
We talked about implied
odds, reverse implied odds,

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.120
set mining, bluffing with
draws, and then the two bluffing

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.010
epiphanies.

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:18.770
And yeah, so it's important to--

01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:21.720
so basically, it's much
easier to play good hands

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.304
than bad hands in
poker in some sense,

01:15:23.304 --> 01:15:24.720
because when you
have a good hand,

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.300
you just bet and
hope everyone calls.

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.810
But it's important to know how
to play bad hands, a.k.a bluff,

01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:31.907
so that your opponent
also might call you

01:15:31.907 --> 01:15:32.990
when you have a good hand.

01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:35.600
Because if you're the type
of player who never bluffs,

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.590
then the game is
uninteresting, right?

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:39.980
So, because then, your
opponent just always

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.550
folds whenever you do anything.

01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:44.040
So that's why it's important
to think about the bluffing

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.740
epiphanies.

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:46.240
OK, cool.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.000
Yeah, thanks.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.868
And hope you continue
to play online.
