JOANNE STUBBE: The way we teach
the course is we show them

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.340
that all of these
chemical transformations

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.340
can be described by 10
pretty simple steps.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.750
And if you understand
the basic chemistry

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.290
of these simple steps, you can
really understand almost all

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.150
of the kinds of interconversions
you see and basic metabolism.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.140
And what you'll see is while
this looks overwhelming,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.750
really, with a few
central pathways,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.800
which is what we focus on
in this course-- glycolysis,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.770
fatty acid oxidation,
biosynthesis,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.930
sugar biosynthesis as well as
degradation, the Krebs cycle,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.630
which feeds into the
respiratory chain--

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.250
knowing those
central reactions--

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.490
almost everything in
metabolism feeds in and out

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.060
of these pathways.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.090
And so then, it
really is a question

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.520
of what is the
environment like and how

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.894
do you enhance
breakdown of sugar

00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:05.269
under the appropriate
environment

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.480
versus synthesize sugar under
a different environment.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.747
So then it's a
question of regulation.

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:13.580
So what you're going
to learn in this course

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.275
is really focused on
central metabolism.

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:18.650
And it doesn't
matter whether you

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.460
study a bacteria or a human,
the central metabolism

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.890
is pretty much the same.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.980
The thing that's different
is the detailed regulation

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.780
and the complexity
of the regulation.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.890
And we don't really talk that
much about regulation in 5.07.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.230
What we do is
introduce you to five

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.620
or six basic regulatory
mechanisms that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.270
are used over and over again.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.570
But then, regulation is
really distinct, even

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.580
between organisms.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.170
And so then that becomes
much more complicated.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.242
And when you go off and
become a biochemist,

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.120
you've got to study
your own system

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.930
and figure out what
the environment is.
