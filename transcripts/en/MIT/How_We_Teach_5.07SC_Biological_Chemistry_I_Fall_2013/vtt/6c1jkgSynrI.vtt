JOANNE STUBBE: My lab works
on the only cool enzyme

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.600
in the world--

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.800
ribonucleotide reductase.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.110
It's the only way
in all organisms

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.510
that you make the
building blocks de novo

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.270
that are required for DNA
biosynthesis and repair.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.140
So if you inhibit this enzyme,
you have no building blocks.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.180
You can't survive.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.290
So from a practical
point of view,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.884
it's the target of drugs
they use therapeutically

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:32.009
in the treatment of cancer.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.050
And I think in probably
not so distant future

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.890
in the antibacterials
because I think

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.080
there are sufficient differences
between humans and bacteria

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.070
reductases that you could
make specific inhibitors.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.360
Why am I interested in it?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.030
Because the chemistry
is sort of unbelievable.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.700
So I mean it was the first
example where you learn,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.650
or you hear about--
you heard from John--

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.820
radicals.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.720
They're reactive oxygen
species and nitrogen species

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.860
that you can't control.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.989
They want to pick
up an extra electron

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.260
and form a stable octet.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.040
And if you leave them
to their own demise,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.680
they react with
anything and destroy it.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.900
Well nature has figured
out how to harness

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.030
the reactivity of radicals
to do really tough chemistry

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.460
with exquisite specificity.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.430
And ribonucleotide reductases
have been the paradigm

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.450
for thinking about that.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.870
And from bioinformatics
now there

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.130
are 50,000 reactions
in metabolic systems

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.590
that are going to be radical
mediated transformations,

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.960
yet we never talk about radicals
in introductory courses.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.020
So I think that's
all going to change.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.280
So why is it unusual?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.140
Well, for the human
ribonucleotide reductase,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.080
the key to making this
work catalytically

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.260
is the amino acid
side chain tyrosine

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.250
needs to be oxidized
to a tyrosyl radical.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.750
So automatically
nobody believes that.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.840
A tyrosyl radical
in solution has

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.120
a half-life of a microsecond.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.890
In the active site
of these enzymes,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.030
the half-life of the enzyme
can be on the order four days.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.840
And this radical, which
is again one electron

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.390
oxidized amino acid--
if you reduce it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.440
with an electron and a proton,
the enzyme is completely dead.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.930
So this was the
first example of-- it

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.110
would be another example of a
post-translational modification

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.170
that we talked about earlier--
modifying your amino acids.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.570
And so nature has
figured out a way.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.250
How do you do this oxidation?

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.880
She has a little metal cluster
right adjacent to where

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.870
this tyrosine is.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.090
And the function of this
little metal cluster

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.730
is to put this into the
oxidized state, which

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.600
is essential for the
way the enzyme works.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.240
So the other thing that's
amazing about the enzyme

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.930
is the chemistry.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.810
There are two subunits.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.970
The chemistry all
happens in this subunit,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.480
but the tyrosyl
radical is there.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.420
And this oxidation-- normally
when you do an oxidation

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.290
the two atoms are sitting within
a few angstroms of each other--

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.280
the oxidation happens
over 35 angstroms.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.170
So that's unprecedented.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.150
It involves hopping
radicals which

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.280
no one has ever seen before.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.100
And so that was
another thing that

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.040
was completely fascinating
from a chemical perspective

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.420
about how the system works.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.447
The other reason that
people in biology

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:30.030
are interested in this, besides
the fact that makes a building

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.070
block for DNA, is that if
you believe in an RNA world

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.530
where we have a ribosome where
a catalysis of peptide bond

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.940
formation is all with the
RNA, not with the protein.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.530
How do you get from an
RNA world to a DNA world?

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.000
The only enzyme that
does that transformation

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.740
making these building blocks
are ribonucleotide reductases.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.430
And there are many classes of
ribonucleotide reductases--

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.680
one uses this tyrosyl radical--

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.710
but they all have
the same active site

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.570
and do the same
chemistry, but they

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.970
have different metal
cofactors depending

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.500
on where they evolved.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.500
And the function of the
metal cofactors in all cases,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.050
even though one's cobalt,
one's iron sulfur cluster,

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.000
one's manganese, one's iron--

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.752
the function in all cases
is to generate a radical

00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:23.460
in the active site
and then the chemistry

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.210
is the same in all these things.
