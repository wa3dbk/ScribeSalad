JOANNE STUBBE: The
morphological unit of life

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.200
is the cell, whether you're
a flea or you're an elephant.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.170
Right?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.500
And we all have water
as the major solvent.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.780
We all have the same
biological molecules that

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.680
play a major role inside our
bodies, like sugar or fat,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.860
or amino acids, or nucleotides.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.470
We all have the same
ways of making reactions

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.100
work fast enough so they
can succeed inside the cell,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.050
and controlling the specificity,
and they're conserved

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.960
from bacteria to humans.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.120
We all use the same vitamins
on your vitamin bottle.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.810
And those are also
conserved in general

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.140
from bacteria to humans.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.680
And we also all have the same
major regulatory mechanisms,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.430
although as you go from
prokaryotes to eukaryotes,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.600
things get more complex.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.000
And so what we cover in
the course is, in fact,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.390
most of the things we talk
about are bacterial systems

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.250
because they're better studied
but can be extrapolated

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.690
between the two systems.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.870
So are these things
ordered inside the cell?

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.850
And how do you study
them inside the cell?

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.570
That's the major
focus of a biochemist.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.780
You want to understand things
at the molecular level,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.430
but then you need
to understand what

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.160
you see at the molecular level,
how does that relate to what's

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.000
going on inside the cell?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.330
And so you need to
go back and forth

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.390
between inside the
cell and understanding

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
the chemical and physical
principles by which all

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.660
the reactions work.
