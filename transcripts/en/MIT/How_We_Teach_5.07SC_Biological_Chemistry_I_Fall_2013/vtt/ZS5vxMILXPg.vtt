JOHN ESSIGMANN: I'm always
interested in listening

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.980
to JoAnne's lectures,
and she talks

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.670
about how she got
interested in biochemistry

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.590
from a background
in what I would call

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.350
more physical organic chemistry
by attending a lecture

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.980
and being completely inspired.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.710
And I am a toxicologist
by training.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.620
And how did that
actually happen.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.840
I have a similarly
inspiring story,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.120
so I thought I would tell that.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.980
I went to a lecture about
45 years ago, by a fellow

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.010
by the name of [Richard]
Evans Schultes.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:47.150
He was the director of
the Herbarium at Harvard--

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.890
and I'd been to it; it
was very interesting--

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.410
and a professor there.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.362
And he is arguably the father
of the field called ethnobotany.

00:00:59.362 --> 00:01:01.570
I went to this talk-- there
were only about 10 people

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.080
at the talk.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.830
He-- because it was a small
talk, he gave it sitting down,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.760
he asked permission to do
that, he's a very polite man.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.070
And it was very informal,
only a few slides.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.690
And the slides
were mainly of him

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.110
living with indigenous
peoples, Native Americans

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.440
in the Southwest,
Amazonian native peoples,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.960
very interesting.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.550
And he talked about, for
example, he had just graduated,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.430
his undergraduate
degree from Harvard.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.760
His parents were eager to
have him go to medical school.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.320
He was very interested in
botany and in native languages.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.910
So he went to live with the--

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.880
I think it was the Kiowa
people in the Midwest--

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.100
I think it was
probably Oklahoma.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.420
And he learned about peyote
and a lot of other chemicals

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.820
that were hallucinogenic.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.530
And he realized, of
course, that many

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.470
of these kinds of compounds that
were used in a lot of rituals,

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.630
were also medicines at other
concentrations, anesthetics

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.190
and so on.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.320
He then went down
to South America,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.850
living with various tribes.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.310
He'd be gone for up
to a year at a time.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.160
There are wonderful stories,
well actually terrible stories,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.510
I guess, about him
paddling his canoe

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.040
for 40 days with malaria--

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.910
it was terrible-- to get to
a hospital, things like that.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.160
But anyway these are stories--

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.950
I was a young scientist
at the time-- these

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.990
were very influential to me.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.570
And he talked about, I was down
in South America and they--

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.860
and I found the plants from
which the native people got

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.320
their dart and arrow poisons.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.410
And he said, out of
that we isolated curare,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.270
and initiated the path
toward the clinic of curare

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.370
as a muscle relaxant.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.900
He said that it
didn't work so well.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.816
I remember this lecture
like it was yesterday.

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:04.000
He said that it was the
beginning of World War II,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.930
we were cut off from
the rubber plantations

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.700
in the Philippines
and other places.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.590
And since South America
had jungles, his form of,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.240
quote unquote
"military service,"

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.050
involved trying to find sources
in the jungle of latex that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.360
could be used to make
rubber so that we could

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.010
have an effective war machine.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.850
So anyway, I went up to this
fellow after he gave his talk.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.100
And I said, look, I just got
to do this kind of stuff.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.960
This sounds really interesting.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.460
And he said, what's
your background?

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.854
I said, well, you know,
I worked as a chemist.

00:03:35.854 --> 00:03:37.270
I was a biology
major but I worked

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.570
as a chemist at an
industrial consulting company

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.250
during my undergraduate years.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.340
And he said, oh, you got to go
talk with Gerry Wogan at MIT.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.660
He said that he isolates
toxins from fungi

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.600
that you find out in the
jungles of Southeast Asia.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.440
And, so anyway, that's
how my career began.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.230
As you know, I got to
eventually meet Gerry Wogan

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.180
and work with him.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.230
He had already identified
this toxin, aflatoxin.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.480
But he needed somebody to
figure out how it worked,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.370
and that's how I got my start.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.150
So my interests have been in
chemicals from the environment.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.590
It could be a pollutant.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.570
Or it could be a
chemical that could

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.730
be a precursor to
a therapeutically

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.690
useful molecule, and
how do they interact

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.220
with biological systems.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.643
And that's what toxicologists
and pharmacologists do.
