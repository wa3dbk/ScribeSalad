00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:23.330
PROFESSOR: Self-driving
cars are pretty cool.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.655
It's pretty hot
nowadays, so we're going

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:27.200
to use this as an example.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.850
And in the past we have seen
how we can give an autonomous

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.415
vehicle a goal-- some
condition we want it to reach.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:36.956
For example, we
might have a car that

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:38.914
wants to pick up some
passengers along the way,

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:44.300
get to some destination, and
maybe navigate some worlds.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.800
But let's consider
that for something

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.870
like a self-driving car, we also
have a number of other goals

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.590
or requirements that are sort of
implicit along the way, in that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.690
we want our self-driving car
to obey the rules of the road

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.800
as it's driving.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.695
And these aren't
just goal conditions

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:04.565
which is a sort of single goal
that you're trying to reach,

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:06.190
but these are sort
of goals that you're

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.090
trying to maintain throughout
the path that you're traveling.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.000
So one example of this
is a traffic light.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.860
So maybe you guys can
help me out with this.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920
Just in plain
English, how would you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.976
describe the rules
of how you would

00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:30.110
want a car to behave when it
comes across a traffic light?

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.610
Anything?

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.666
It's very simple.

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.165
Yes?

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:35.490
AUDIENCE: Slow down when you see
yellow, stop when you see red,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.434
go if you see green.

00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:38.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.600
So pretty much stop if you
see red, go if you see green,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.950
and specifically, if you
see red and you stop,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.606
you're going to want
to stop until you

00:01:48.606 --> 00:01:51.410
see the green, at which
point that sort of condition

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.883
that you're stopping goes away,
and you're able to move on.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.021
And in addition to things
like obeying traffic lights,

00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:06.020
there might also be some
other rules of the road

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.970
that we want to follow.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.970
For example, we might
want to always stay

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.841
within the speed limit.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.340
And then there might also be
some other practical conditions

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.000
of driving down the road,
which is that at some point

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.275
we're going to need to refuel.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:21.766
And if we consider
a car that might

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:26.650
be driving for a really long
time, one logical statement

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.890
we could say about the
path that this car takes,

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.350
and the sequence of states
that it goes through

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.020
is that at every
point in time we

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.470
want the plan to have some
future state when we are

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.490
going to visit a gas station.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.990
So this isn't just a single
goal that we're trying to reach,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.760
but over a very long
time, even if we consider

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.270
the car to be driving an
infinite amount of time,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.340
at every point in
the time, we're

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.340
going to be thinking
ahead that there's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.176
going to be some time when we
reach a gas station and refuel.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.600
So these types of
conditions, things

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.750
like staying at a red
light until it turns green,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.980
always staying within
a certain speed limit,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.520
or always having some
path in the future--

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.990
some state in the future
when we reach a gas station,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.250
are things that we can
express with a type of logic

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.010
called temporal logic.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.560
And there are two
things that we hope

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.860
you're going to be able
to do by the time you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.985
leave this lecture.

00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:27.820
The first is be able to model
these temporally extended goals

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.100
using a specific type
of temporal logic called

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.110
Linear Temporal Logic, or LTL.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.020
And secondly,
we're going to hope

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.100
that you'll be able to actually
apply this to planning, create

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.440
plans with these
temporally extended goals,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.130
and in addition just sort
of this regular planning

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.190
we've been dealing with,
actually incorporating

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.320
this idea of preferences
into your plans.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.630
So a preference basically
is not a required condition,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.250
but a desired condition
that you can use to select

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.647
between alternative paths.

00:04:02.647 --> 00:04:05.230
So you know, you might have many
different ways that you could

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.390
reach your goal,
but we can use some

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.100
of these temporally
extended goals,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.080
like maybe you prefer to break
as few of the rules of the road

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.459
as you can, and you can use
those a preferences to choose

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.315
between plans.

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:22.937
So just as an
outline, first we're

00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:24.520
just going to do a
little introduction

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.620
to linear temporal logic.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.200
We're going to talk
about what this

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.815
is-- what LTL is, why
we want to use it,

00:04:30.815 --> 00:04:33.430
and we're going to go through
the syntax and the semantics

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.190
of different LTL operators.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.460
Then we're going to walk
you through some example LTL

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.490
problems, and actually talk
about complications to plans--

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.025
how you create plans with
these linear temporal logic

00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:47.044
and temporal goals.

00:04:47.044 --> 00:04:48.960
Finally we're going to
incorporate preferences

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.235
into this, talk about how
you express preferences,

00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:53.110
and specifically talk
about a language called

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.220
LPP that allows you to plan with
temporal logic and preferences.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.420
So now for the introduction
to linear temporal logic.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.720
Temporal logic at its
core is a formalism

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.780
for specifying properties of
a system that vary with time.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.640
So these aren't
just conditions that

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.410
are true at single
state, which is

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.950
what we've mostly been dealing
with prepositional logic.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.320
Right, so we've been saying
things like, condition A and B,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.410
but not C, are true
at a given state,

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.294
and that's prepositional logic.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.960
Temporal logic is
sort of a layer on top

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.960
of that, when we're dealing
not just with what's

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.690
true at a single state, but
actually extending over time

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.050
as the system moves through
a sequence of states,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.525
and expressing properties
on a temporal level.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.200
So you might have a system that
can be represented as a state

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.360
machine, and a
[INAUDIBLE],, and it

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.935
can go through a sequence
of different states.

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:57.310
And while you might be able
to represent the whole system

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.950
like this, if we actually
execute the system

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.045
we're going to get one
path through the system.

00:06:03.045 --> 00:06:06.220
And that's often called
a trace of the system,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.040
and you can also think of it
as a timeline of the system.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.410
So one example
timeline of this system

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.480
is it might start
in state A, and then

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.340
go to state C, and then go to
D, and keep looping around in D

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.026
forever.

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:20.539
So that's one trace, or
one timeline of the system,

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.330
and that's really just
a sequence of states

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.205
that it goes through.

00:06:25.932 --> 00:06:28.720
And in the past we've seen these
in some of the problem sets.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.190
For example when we were
modeling the warp reactor,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.180
we had the valves
that could transition

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.452
between open and closed states.

00:06:38.452 --> 00:06:41.380
It could also be
the whole system--

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.380
the starship going
through different planets,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.772
transitioning through a
larger set of locations,

00:06:47.772 --> 00:06:49.480
picking up passengers,
dropping them off.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.813
So these could be quite complex.

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:59.310
And so as I said,
previously in our problems

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.845
that we've been modeling, we've
been going through a system,

00:07:01.845 --> 00:07:04.940
and we've been searching for
a single state that satisfies

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.640
all of our goal conditions.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.130
Maybe we to reach
[? Lavinia ?] and save

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.280
a certain number of people.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.640
But with temporal
logic, we can actually

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.200
express goals that are satisfied
over a number of states,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.959
and this allows us to do
some more expressive goals

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.500
than we could capture
just by looking

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.050
at a single state at the end.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.150
So for example,
what if a problem

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.630
requires some
condition to be met

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.465
until another condition is met?

00:07:40.465 --> 00:07:42.920
And for example, you know,
when you see a red light,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.990
that implies that we should
stop until we see a green light.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.350
And if we look at a
timeline, or a trace of one

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.160
of these systems, that might
look something like this.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.610
So we're going along
through our system,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.116
and at one of the states,
we see the red light.

00:07:59.116 --> 00:08:02.960
So that adds this condition
that we should stop.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.720
And then that condition
will hold forever

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.620
until we see a green
light, at which point

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.820
that condition is dropped,
and we can keep moving on.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.400
Another example where we might
want to use temporal logic

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.130
is, what if our problem
requires a condition

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.094
to always eventually be met.

00:08:18.094 --> 00:08:20.510
And this is what I was talking
about with the gas station.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.750
So we want to be
going on forever,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.030
and there should always be
some point in the future

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.110
when we do have a state
where we're at a gas station.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.309
So we might start our
system at a certain state.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:37.060
And our plan says
that at some point

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.809
we do reach a gas
station, so that's good.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.482
But then when we get
to the next state,

00:08:40.482 --> 00:08:42.440
we also want it to be
true that from that point

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.370
on, we're going to reach another
gas station, and after that,

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.070
going on and on and
on into the future.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.050
These are things that you
can't express very easily

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.550
with the types of logic that
we've been dealing with before.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.230
So one important distinction
that we should clear up

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.920
before we really dive
into the syntax of how

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.420
these linear
temporal logics work

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.950
is the difference between
branching time and linear time.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.480
They're really two
different models of time

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.725
that we can be working with.

00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:16.600
There's two different
types of temporal logic

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.080
that exist to express these
different types of time.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.790
So linear time is more
similar to the world

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.920
that we live in, unless you're
living in some sci-fi movie

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.820
where time is branching
into different realities,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.860
and all sorts of crazy
stuff is going on.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.930
You can think of time as
just this linear timeline.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.762
So right now, it's
one future state

00:09:37.762 --> 00:09:39.740
that's going to happen for me.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.170
And you know, regardless
of how many options I have,

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.180
there's one realization
of the time.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.890
And what this lets us
do is that it gives us

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:56.600
a single path for our system,
and we can reason very exactly

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.940
about the conditions that
are met within that path.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:11.680
And this lets us describe what
will always happen in a system.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.840
For example, we can
guarantee that we always

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.180
stop at a red light until
we see a green light,

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:23.080
or we always stay
within the speed limit.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.820
This is contrasted with a
different model of time,

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.360
called branching time.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.190
And in this model of time,
at each time instant,

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.560
we consider all
possible futures.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.020
So if we have multiple
actions that we could perform

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.570
at a given state, we're going
to consider different timelines

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.730
that branch off for each of
those possible behaviors.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.750
And this results in
alternate courses of time

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.730
that we can reason
about as a set.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:55.250
And instead of thinking about
this as always conditions-- so,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.904
our path always
does this-- we can

00:10:56.904 --> 00:10:58.585
think about this more
in possibilities.

00:10:58.585 --> 00:11:01.650
And if we're using branching
time, we can say, you know,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.290
at this state and time,
there exists a future path

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.860
in which we will always
stay under the speed limit,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.680
or, at this point in time,
all our future paths satisfy

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.110
a certain condition.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.810
So whereas linear
temporal logic is

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.930
more about guaranteeing what
will happen on a given path,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.980
branching time
allows us to reason

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.070
about what might possibly
happen in the system.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.440
So for our purposes
with planning,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.510
in part because it's
more attractable,

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.000
and in part because it gives
us an exact analysis of a given

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.384
path, we're going to
be doing linear time,

00:11:37.384 --> 00:11:38.800
and for that reason,
we use what's

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.610
called linear temporal logic.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.985
There's a different
type of temporal logic.

00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:47.255
There's one called CTL and CTL*
that deal with branching time.

00:11:47.255 --> 00:11:49.240
And those are sort
of an extension

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.290
of linear temporal logic.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.750
They add a few
other operators that

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.411
allow you to reason
over multiple paths.

00:11:55.411 --> 00:11:56.994
But for our purposes,
we're just going

00:11:56.994 --> 00:12:00.818
to be using the
linear time model.

00:12:00.818 --> 00:12:04.760
So kind of as a recap,
what linear temporal logic

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.910
involves--

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.490
we're using this
linear time model.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.830
Another important distinction
is that we're actually

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.900
going to be talking about
infinite sequences of states.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.090
So instead of us just reasoning
up until a certain goal

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.520
condition is met, we're
thinking about systems

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.000
that could theoretically
keep transitioning over time,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.560
over and over and
over into the future.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.490
So if you have one of
these state machines,

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.070
you could think,
at each time step,

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.860
it's going to visit
the new state.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.360
And if you give it
enough time, it's

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.970
just going to generate an
infinite sequence of states.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.800
And we can actually
express properties

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.290
that can hold over an
infinite number of states,

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.710
not just the discrete
number of states

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.300
that we might usually
think of to reach a goal.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.390
And linear temporal
logic can actually

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:52.470
be modified to work with
discrete set of states.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.490
It just requires an
additional operator.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.330
But the ability to reason about
infinite sequences of states

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.615
gives us a lot of power in
talking about guarantees

00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:05.680
for our system, regardless
of how much time we're

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.600
talking about it.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.730
Finally, all the
operators we're going

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.680
to be looking at
in our logic system

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.010
are what we call
forward-looking conditions.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.169
So when we're
given a state we're

00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:22.710
going to reasoning
about what's going

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.205
to happen in the future for
a potentially infinite amount

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:27.660
of time in the future.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.110
There's sort of a symmetric
version of this logic that

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.550
reasons about the past.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.570
So for example, we can say--

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.880
talk about guarantees that
something will eventually

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.472
happen in the future--

00:13:40.472 --> 00:13:42.180
there's sort of a
symmetric version where

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.500
we can talk about,
given a certain state,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.950
we can guarantee that
something had eventually

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.810
happened in the past.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.832
But for us in that we're
going to focus on planning--

00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:54.165
we're typically planning about
what to do in the future,

00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:57.190
and it makes more sense for us
to use this future of updating

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.267
the set for operators.

00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:03.897
And so I guess one
little nuance here

00:14:03.897 --> 00:14:05.897
that I sort of pointed
out in the previous slide

00:14:05.897 --> 00:14:08.980
is that because we're using
a linear model of time

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.475
and not a branching
model of time,

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.940
we're going to be expressing
properties that happen over

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.430
a single path of states, and
not properties that happen over

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.584
several path of states.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.645
So finally I'm just going
to talk about a couple

00:14:24.645 --> 00:14:28.580
of the main application
for linear temporal logic

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.530
before Ellie will
dive in, and actually

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.460
talk more about the
semantics and syntax of how

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.080
we use this logic.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.670
So the first menus is
verification and model

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.390
checking.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.990
We can use this
linear temporal logic

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.765
to create guarantees
about a system,

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:56.020
and formally verify it for a
couple different properties.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.390
For example, we can talk about
the safety of the system.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.160
We can say, over the
course of this system,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.690
we guarantee that
it will never enter

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.664
a state of a certain condition.

00:15:05.664 --> 00:15:08.610
We could also talk about the
maintenance of properties.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.830
So over the entire
lifetime of this system,

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.598
we guarantee that a certain
condition will always hold.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.565
The other main application
for temporal logic,

00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:24.260
the one that we're going to be
focusing on, is for planning.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.460
And this planning
using these temporally

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.680
extended goals that
I've been talking about,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.860
and it actually extends
nicely to talking

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.280
about temporally
extended preferences.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.130
So this is given that we have
a number of different paths

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.570
that could reach a goal, we
can actually look at all those

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.860
and see which paths
satisfy certain conditions

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.030
over the sequence of states,
and use those conditions

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.400
as a way of choosing
which ones we prefer.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.020
So with that, Ellie is now
going to talk about some

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.995
of the syntax of
linear temporal logic.

00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:03.396
ELLIE: Hi guys.

00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:06.174
My name is Ellie, and
I'm going to be talking

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:10.220
about the syntax of LTL.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.250
So an LTL formula is
a series of states.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.870
And at each state, you can
have various propositions

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.400
than can be either
true or false.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.394
So for example-- is it OK
if I erase this, Steve?

00:16:23.394 --> 00:16:23.894
STEVE: Yeah.

00:16:23.894 --> 00:16:24.394
Go ahead.

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:33.640
ELLIE: So for example you can
have a [INAUDIBLE] animation

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:39.131
show that has a series of
states that goes on to infinity.

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:42.470
And at each state you
can have propositions

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.150
that are either true or false.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.900
So the traffic could
be red could be

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.120
an example for a proposition.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:53.024
We could be stopped, et cetera.

00:16:57.452 --> 00:16:59.710
And there's various
logical operators

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.760
that we can apply
to these formulas--

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.540
these sets of states,
and we can determine

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.880
if these logical operators
are either true or false

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:14.079
about each set of
states-- each formula.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.730
So there's the not operator,
the or operator, the and,

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:20.896
the implies, if and only and,
and like I said, the state--

00:17:20.896 --> 00:17:25.636
each proposition of [INAUDIBLE]
can either be true or false.

00:17:25.636 --> 00:17:30.530
So just to go through
some examples of these,

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.315
the logical operator
true says that--

00:17:34.315 --> 00:17:38.160
essentially what the operator
true says is it's not saying,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.940
oh, this state is true.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.570
The operator just
true says that there

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.180
are states for all infinity.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.990
So true is always true.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.500
So no matter what you
had for your state here,

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.490
the logical operator true holds.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.290
However, when you talk
about the logical operator

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.330
true with respect to a certain
state or a certain proposition,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.130
then it can either
be true or false.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:04.460
So for example, here, the
logical operator red light

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.100
is true at the first state.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.535
If this was green, then
the logical operator red

00:18:10.535 --> 00:18:11.990
would be false at
the first state.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.796
Does that make sense?

00:18:13.796 --> 00:18:16.060
All right.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.660
One important thing to note
about the logical o operators

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.580
is that they just apply
to the very first state

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:24.880
in your statement.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.840
So when we're discussing
logical operators,

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.290
we haven't gotten
to the point where

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.430
we can express
temporal information

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.900
about our sequence of states.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.400
The next operator is, not.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.120
So as you can see
here, the traffic light

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.200
is read at the first state.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.460
So the traffic
light's not green.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.480
Hold, because the
proposition green is not

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.850
true at the first state.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:00.130
And the logical operator,
and, at this first state

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.350
is we're at the red light,
and we're getting gas.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.606
And so both that
we're at the red light

00:19:06.606 --> 00:19:08.814
and that we're getting gas
holds for the first state.

00:19:12.272 --> 00:19:16.584
And then the operator,
or, essentially says--

00:19:16.584 --> 00:19:18.250
I guess a lot of this
is probably review

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.980
for you guys--
logical operators--

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.985
but essentially if
you have red or green

00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:26.110
then you could either have
the traffic light be red

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.870
or the traffic light be
green at the first state.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.547
And as long as one of those
two hold, or both of them

00:19:31.547 --> 00:19:33.942
hold, then it's true.

00:19:33.942 --> 00:19:39.110
And one thing to note about
or lies in if and only

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.170
if these can be re-written with
just the logical operators,

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.700
and, and, not.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.830
So another way of
expressing red and green

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.010
is to say that you can't have
the scenario where both is not

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.180
red, and it's not green.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.350
And I'm not going to go
over that for, implies,

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.962
and, if and only if, just
for the sake of time.

00:20:00.962 --> 00:20:04.091
So that's just a review
of the logical operators,

00:20:04.091 --> 00:20:06.340
and now we're going to go
into the temporal operators.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.490
So when we're talking
about our autonomous car,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.360
what are some useful
temporal operators?

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.899
Because up until
now, we just are

00:20:13.899 --> 00:20:16.065
describing of the first
state in our sequence, which

00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:18.130
isn't really useful
if we want to talk

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:22.937
about the entire set of
sequences [INAUDIBLE] states.

00:20:22.937 --> 00:20:25.270
So what do you guys think are
some mutual things that we

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.890
want to be able to describe?

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.189
I know Ben touched on some
of them at the beginning,

00:20:29.189 --> 00:20:30.980
but if you guys could
recount some of them.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.480
Yes.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.847
AUDIENCE: State connection.

00:20:32.847 --> 00:20:33.430
ELLIE: Mm-hmm.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.830
State connections.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.510
So exactly.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.756
So if I'm in a state
right now, might there

00:20:40.756 --> 00:20:42.130
be concerns about
the next state?

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.192
Is that kind of like
what you're saying?

00:20:44.192 --> 00:20:44.691
Exactly.

00:20:44.691 --> 00:20:45.190
Yeah.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.399
So next is one of
the things that we

00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:50.216
might be concerned
about, the next state.

00:20:56.677 --> 00:21:00.156
Are there any other tings
you guys can think of?

00:21:00.156 --> 00:21:01.647
AUDIENCE: Always or [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:01.647 --> 00:21:02.638
ELLIE: Yes, exactly.

00:21:02.638 --> 00:21:03.138
Always.

00:21:09.599 --> 00:21:16.485
So like Ben said, we always
want to follow the speed limit.

00:21:16.485 --> 00:21:18.330
We always want to be
under 35 miles an hour,

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.332
or whatever the speed limit is.

00:21:20.332 --> 00:21:22.169
Anything else?

00:21:22.169 --> 00:21:22.835
AUDIENCE: Until.

00:21:22.835 --> 00:21:23.570
ELLIE: Until.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:24.640
Yep.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.470
So like he said, you
want to be stopped

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.995
until the light turns green.

00:21:29.995 --> 00:21:30.495
Yes.

00:21:30.495 --> 00:21:31.445
AUDIENCE: Eventually.

00:21:31.445 --> 00:21:31.920
ELLIE: Eventually.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.420
Yep.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:38.152
So we eventually
want to get gas.

00:21:38.152 --> 00:21:42.982
And eventually.

00:21:42.982 --> 00:21:43.931
Any other things?

00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:44.431
Yes.

00:21:44.431 --> 00:21:45.397
AUDIENCE: At this state.

00:21:45.397 --> 00:21:45.880
ELLIE: At this state.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.380
Yep.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.824
And so, at this state, is kind
of what the logical operators

00:21:49.824 --> 00:21:51.240
were doing at the
beginning, but I

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.580
agree that's something we
have to be able to express.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.499
So that's not a specific
temporal operator,

00:21:56.499 --> 00:21:58.040
but it's included
in the logical one,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.330
so I'll just write
it up here for you.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.627
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a question?

00:22:01.627 --> 00:22:02.210
ELLIE: Uh huh.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.668
AUDIENCE: So the
logical operators,

00:22:03.668 --> 00:22:06.320
are they acting on the-- so
they're acting for a state?

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.844
They're not acting
on the entire chain.

00:22:08.844 --> 00:22:10.010
ELLIE: They act for a state.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:14.460
And so if you just wrote
the logical operators,

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.200
just by the
definition of LTL, it

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.940
means let's just
analyze the first state

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.510
and see if it's true.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.760
And so it won't tell us
anything about the third state

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.160
or the fourth state or the
second state, which is why we

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.059
have to look at the next state.

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:29.015
So yeah.

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:32.438
Any other questions?

00:22:32.438 --> 00:22:34.883
OK.

00:22:34.883 --> 00:22:39.024
So like you said, next
is an important one.

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:43.748
So right here we consider OK,
the next light will be green.

00:22:47.412 --> 00:22:50.750
And until is the one
that she mentioned,

00:22:50.750 --> 00:23:00.050
so the light will be red until
it becomes green eventually.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.880
So the light will eventually
at some point in the future

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.620
turn green.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.270
So you might be waiting at
the red light for a long time,

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.826
but eventually it's going
to turn green for us.

00:23:09.826 --> 00:23:11.932
The light will
always be red, so I

00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:14.720
guess you're stuck at the
traffic light for a long time,

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.660
or globally-- that's
another name for always.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:25.040
And lastly, this on is a
little bit less intuitive.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.370
So what this is
saying is the light

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:32.050
will always be red until
another circumstance coincides

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.542
with the same state.

00:23:33.542 --> 00:23:36.540
So the light will be always
red until the car gets gas.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.520
And then after it gets its
gas, then the red is released,

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.670
and the light can be either
green or red after that.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:49.100
So you have red red red red red
until we have both red and gas.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.514
And then it can be green or
it can be red [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:51.514 --> 00:23:52.930
it's not constrained
to being red.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:53.864
Does that make sense?

00:23:53.864 --> 00:23:56.956
That one's a little bit
less intuitive, so--

00:23:56.956 --> 00:23:57.920
is that good?

00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:04.020
OK.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:04.520
All right.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.687
So now that we've gone
over just the intuitive

00:24:07.687 --> 00:24:09.520
understanding of that,
I'm going to give you

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.138
the actual syntax for that.

00:24:12.138 --> 00:24:16.570
So x is representative of next.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.765
So in the first state, we
don't care if p is true.

00:24:20.765 --> 00:24:22.370
p could be not true,
p could be true.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.390
It doesn't matter.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.592
But in the second
state, the next one

00:24:25.592 --> 00:24:29.610
up in the first state, p,
has to hold in order for xp

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.750
to be a true statement about
our sequence of states.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:43.169
So what do you guys
think if I wrote this?

00:24:43.169 --> 00:24:44.642
What would that mean?

00:24:49.061 --> 00:24:51.016
AUDIENCE: Different
state [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:51.016 --> 00:24:51.516
ELLIE: Yep.

00:24:51.516 --> 00:24:53.355
So this one over here?

00:24:53.355 --> 00:24:53.980
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.636
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:54.636 --> 00:24:55.136
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:24:55.136 --> 00:24:57.624
Perfect.

00:24:57.624 --> 00:24:58.124
All right.

00:24:58.124 --> 00:25:00.116
The until operator.

00:25:00.116 --> 00:25:04.650
The until operator essentially
says, like Ben said,

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.580
we're stopped until
the light is green.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.402
So if you have p
until w, you just p

00:25:11.402 --> 00:25:13.980
has to be true at every state
until w, and after that point,

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.110
p can be whatever
it wants to be.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.340
p eventually, or
future operator,

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.198
says that at some point in
the future we will get gas.

00:25:26.198 --> 00:25:27.600
However it's important to note--

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.600
I know when we talked
about getting gas we said,

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.840
oh, we have to always get gas
at some point in the future,

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.260
but the future eventually
operator is just

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.050
at one point in the future.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.240
So once you get gas, you
don't have to get it again.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:40.750
Yes.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.208
AUDIENCE: On the
previous slide you

00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:44.640
had a not at the
bottom that said that w

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.764
is required to become true.

00:25:45.764 --> 00:25:48.310
Does that mean an
until operator also

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.746
implies a future operator on w?

00:25:50.746 --> 00:25:51.246
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:51.715
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:25:51.715 --> 00:25:52.215
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:52.215 --> 00:25:53.591
ELLIE: Yep.

00:25:53.591 --> 00:25:55.565
But it's the added
condition that p

00:25:55.565 --> 00:25:56.940
will be true until the w.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.475
AUDIENCE: But like whenever
you use until, you say p

00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:02.940
until w that you'd
also have to add

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.791
at some point in the
future [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:04.791 --> 00:26:05.291
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:26:05.291 --> 00:26:06.405
Yep, you're right.

00:26:08.816 --> 00:26:11.440
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, it would
be possible that this stays p,

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.210
right?

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:12.595
ELLIE: It could.

00:26:12.595 --> 00:26:13.094
Yeah.

00:26:13.094 --> 00:26:16.203
But then if your system-- that
would be totally fine if you

00:26:16.203 --> 00:26:20.140
had your system just be p, but
then the operator p until w

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.770
wouldn't hold unless you had a
w at some point in that sequence

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.388
of p's.

00:26:25.388 --> 00:26:26.264
Does that make sense.

00:26:26.264 --> 00:26:26.888
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:26.888 --> 00:26:29.232
[INAUDIBLE] I guess it does
if that's the way to do it,

00:26:29.232 --> 00:26:32.170
but it doesn't make
sense [INAUDIBLE] it.

00:26:36.255 --> 00:26:37.796
ELLIE: So you're
saying that we could

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:39.355
have a bunch of p's, right?

00:26:39.355 --> 00:26:41.210
Is that what you're saying?

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:46.009
And I'm saying that this
is a fine state to have.

00:26:46.009 --> 00:26:47.300
You can have whatever you want.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.755
And we're just analyzing if
a sentence is true about it.

00:26:51.755 --> 00:26:54.890
So this statement,
it's not true--

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:55.660
or, sorry.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:03.010
I'm saying that it's not
true that we have p and lw

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.460
because there's
no w in our state.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.070
But if we add in a w somewhere
and we keep all the p's, then

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:14.963
it's true because we have
p up until we get to a w.

00:27:14.963 --> 00:27:15.909
Did that make sense?

00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:17.784
AUDIENCE: It made sense
that that's the rule,

00:27:17.784 --> 00:27:19.497
but it doesn't make
sense to me why.

00:27:19.497 --> 00:27:20.872
Because the
statement [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:22.850
true and if w never appears.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.280
You have p until w,
which never happened.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:26.780
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.759
If w never happened,
then it wouldn't be true.

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:32.050
AUDIENCE: I mean, technically,
for the English language

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.329
it would be true.

00:27:33.329 --> 00:27:34.495
AUDIENCE: I guess it's not--

00:27:34.495 --> 00:27:37.094
AUDIENCE: If you have
p out to infinity,

00:27:37.094 --> 00:27:39.120
and you never have w's.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.364
p until w is true.

00:27:41.364 --> 00:27:43.280
AUDIENCE: p until anything
is true [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.770
AUDIENCE: Like if
you say that I'm

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.830
hungry until I eat,
and you never eat,

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.125
then you will always be hungry.

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:50.040
ELLIE: Oh, I see.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.845
So that makes sense
in a logical sense,

00:27:51.845 --> 00:27:53.553
but that's not how
it's described in LTL.

00:27:53.553 --> 00:27:55.303
PROFESSOR: There's
also an operator that's

00:27:55.303 --> 00:27:57.850
sort of unofficial
called the weak until,

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.720
and that's sort of saying
p until w, or always p.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.390
So that kind of gets
rid of the condition

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:05.740
that it reaches w at some point.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.593
AUDIENCE: It aligns more
with the English, too.

00:28:07.593 --> 00:28:08.056
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:08.056 --> 00:28:08.520
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.640
AUDIENCE: But just the
until operator on its own

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.860
is just sort of
like a strong until.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:12.360
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.111
PROFESSOR: So it adds the--

00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:14.053
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's fine.

00:28:14.053 --> 00:28:14.524
ELLIE: OK.

00:28:14.524 --> 00:28:16.024
PROFESSOR: This is
the way it works.

00:28:16.024 --> 00:28:16.540
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.410
Sometimes-- yeah, I get
confused about this sometimes.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.030
I'll be like, why
they necessarily

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.930
[? chose any of these, ?]
but, OK.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.076
And then the globally
one, which we

00:28:24.076 --> 00:28:25.500
said-- this is the one that
you were just describing here

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.875
[INAUDIBLE] when
you were talking

00:28:26.875 --> 00:28:30.295
about the p at every
single state in the future.

00:28:30.295 --> 00:28:32.730
And then the release
operator is you

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.750
have to have p until you
have w, but p and w also

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.614
have to share the same state
when they switch from--

00:28:41.614 --> 00:28:46.110
so in until, you don't
have to have the p here,

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.940
but with release, you have
to have the p and w occur

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.522
in the same state.

00:28:50.522 --> 00:28:52.502
Does that make sense?

00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:53.002
Yes?

00:28:53.002 --> 00:28:53.502
OK.

00:28:57.466 --> 00:29:01.786
So just like before, operators
can be described using not

00:29:01.786 --> 00:29:03.160
and and.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.030
The future, released, and
the globally operators

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:13.030
can also be described using
other temporal operators.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:17.790
And so just as an exercise, can
any of you guys tell me which--

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.170
these are not in order--
which of these line up

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:23.720
with the other-- like, whichever
ones they line up with.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.553
And I'll give you guys
like three minutes

00:29:25.553 --> 00:29:28.178
to just think about it, and then
we'll work through it together

00:29:28.178 --> 00:29:29.174
on the board.

00:30:53.336 --> 00:30:54.830
All right, so have
any of you guys

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.818
thought about which ones
might correlate to which ones?

00:30:57.818 --> 00:31:00.804
Does anyone have
any suggestions?

00:31:00.804 --> 00:31:01.304
Yes.

00:31:01.304 --> 00:31:02.798
AUDIENCE: The first
one's the top one.

00:31:02.798 --> 00:31:04.089
ELLIE: This one is the top one.

00:31:04.089 --> 00:31:05.446
That's exactly right.

00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:10.870
So let's continue
this state again.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:16.149
So the statement, true,
doesn't say anything

00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:17.855
about what the propositions are.

00:31:17.855 --> 00:31:20.996
It's just something that's
true for all states, right?

00:31:20.996 --> 00:31:23.129
So if we're saying,
true until pi,

00:31:23.129 --> 00:31:24.670
that means that you
can have whatever

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:28.350
you want until p occurs.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.766
So does that make sense that,
at some point in the future,

00:31:30.766 --> 00:31:36.590
p has to occur, exactly because
we had the strong until, right.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.430
Does that make
sense to everyone?

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.280
You guys want to see
some [INAUDIBLE]??

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.280
All right and now
what about this one?

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.460
We have not as not p.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:54.110
So this is saying that
at some point, if you

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.720
can't get a p set at
some point in the future,

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.830
you don't have p.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.360
So what do you think
that would correspond to?

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.312
If at some point
in the future, you

00:32:02.312 --> 00:32:04.510
can't have the situation
where there's not p.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.510
AUDIENCE: The third one.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.385
ELLIE: The third one?

00:32:06.385 --> 00:32:09.262
[INAUDIBLE] So that
would be if you

00:32:09.262 --> 00:32:12.207
have p at every
single state, then

00:32:12.207 --> 00:32:16.376
you would never have a situation
where you don't have p, right?

00:32:16.376 --> 00:32:17.750
And so that leaves
this last one.

00:32:20.262 --> 00:32:27.738
You don't have a scenario where
you have not p until not w.

00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:33.686
So if you have not--

00:32:33.686 --> 00:32:34.186
OK.

00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:36.170
It's still a little hard.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:40.650
But I'll come back to
that one at the end, OK?

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.878
But it's just important to
remember that you can describe

00:32:44.878 --> 00:32:48.075
these operators
with similar to them

00:32:48.075 --> 00:32:49.450
so that your
planner doesn't have

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:53.185
to deal with the global operator
or these operators-- eventually

00:32:53.185 --> 00:32:58.200
operator, it can have less
[INAUDIBLE] to deal with.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.140
So yeah, you guys were right.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.595
Perfect.

00:33:01.595 --> 00:33:04.600
And then this is just a recap
of the different operators

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:10.205
and the other ways that
you can express them.

00:33:10.205 --> 00:33:12.950
And so there's a few
more really cool things

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.780
that you can do combining
these different operators,

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.090
and the first is that--

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.130
remember when Ben was describing
that we need to get gas?

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.090
And we need to get
it in the future,

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.838
but even after we
get gas, we're going

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:30.830
to have to get it again
some time in the future.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.886
So it's important that
we can describe something

00:33:32.886 --> 00:33:35.010
that happens infinitely often.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.680
And the way that we describe
that is saying that we always

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:44.660
have the scenario where you
will eventually reach p.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.105
So I'm trying to think of
another way to describe that,

00:33:49.105 --> 00:33:52.510
but does that make sense
that right now in the future,

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:53.782
I'm going to get gas.

00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:57.520
And even after I get that gas,
I will eventually in the future

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.177
also need to get gas again,
because your car will always

00:34:00.177 --> 00:34:01.742
be needing to get gas.

00:34:01.742 --> 00:34:04.658
Does that make sense?

00:34:04.658 --> 00:34:05.630
Cool.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.580
And then eventually
forever is another scenario

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.067
that's important to describe.

00:34:11.067 --> 00:34:13.192
So let's say that the
traffic light will eventually

00:34:13.192 --> 00:34:15.169
turn green forever.

00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:17.985
We need to be able to say that
at some point in the future,

00:34:17.985 --> 00:34:21.126
although we don't know when, the
traffic light will turn green.

00:34:21.126 --> 00:34:26.710
So the future operator says that
at some point in the future,

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.844
you will have
something come true.

00:34:28.844 --> 00:34:34.570
And so at this state, p becomes
true, but the global operators

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.480
that happened from this
state forever afterwards,

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.690
which is saying that you
eventually will always

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.231
have this state B be true.

00:34:49.062 --> 00:34:50.687
Do you guys have any
questions on that?

00:34:50.687 --> 00:34:52.111
Did I explain that good enough.

00:34:52.111 --> 00:34:54.610
AUDIENCE: It seems weird to me
that the gas tank is becoming

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.570
this occasional temporal
operator instead of just

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.420
like the state that
we actually have gas,

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:04.817
would just be the logical
thing that [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:04.817 --> 00:35:05.650
ELLIE: Oh, yeah, I--

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:09.360
AUDIENCE: Why is the act of
getting gas showing up here

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.529
like that, versus just, you
always need quantity of gas.

00:35:12.529 --> 00:35:13.320
ELLIE: That's true.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.880
We do always need
some quantity of gas,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.671
and you would describe
that, like you said,

00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:18.410
just with the always
operator, but I

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.861
guess my action
of getting gas is

00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:22.350
I was thinking of actually
driving up to the gas station

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.760
and filling it up with gas.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.830
And if you didn't do
that, you wouldn't

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.952
be able to always have gas.

00:35:31.952 --> 00:35:33.766
Does that make sense?

00:35:33.766 --> 00:35:35.140
AUDIENCE: Right,
so I would think

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.062
that always having gas would
make [INAUDIBLE] of you plan

00:35:38.062 --> 00:35:38.836
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:41.086
ELLIE: Yeah, and depending
on how you make your model,

00:35:41.086 --> 00:35:43.040
you definitely could do
that, and that definitely

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.220
would satisfy the condition.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.080
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.752
AUDIENCE: --the usual
way to deal with it?

00:35:47.752 --> 00:35:49.460
ELLIE: Well, it depends
on the situation.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.490
Maybe you [INAUDIBLE]
want to say

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.209
at some point in the future,
the light will always be green,

00:35:56.209 --> 00:35:58.500
because you want to make sure
that cars can go through,

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.041
and there's a
difference between red,

00:36:00.041 --> 00:36:02.097
and some point it will
be green in the future.

00:36:02.097 --> 00:36:03.930
So it really depends
on your model and how--

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.830
I think the way
you're saying it,

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.490
where you always
want to have gas,

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:13.692
and the proposition gas is how
much gas you have in your tank,

00:36:13.692 --> 00:36:15.150
and if you have it
or don't, then I

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.730
think that that would be a
really good way to model it,

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:17.270
too.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.728
AUDIENCE: Because this way, if
you said, I have to get gas.

00:36:19.728 --> 00:36:22.885
I planned it for next week, but
I've run out of gas this week.

00:36:22.885 --> 00:36:25.592
Do you know what I mean, like,
you have to somehow be tracking

00:36:25.592 --> 00:36:26.941
the quantity of gas also.

00:36:26.941 --> 00:36:27.566
ELLIE: I agree.

00:36:27.566 --> 00:36:28.080
I agree.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.890
I was just using it as an
example to explain the concept,

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:32.801
but I agree that that
definitely probably

00:36:32.801 --> 00:36:34.092
could be better with more work.

00:36:34.092 --> 00:36:35.890
AUDIENCE: Well, I
think in both cases

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:39.460
what it could represent is
having gas all the time,

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.088
or explicitly saying that you're
going to be in gas stations

00:36:44.088 --> 00:36:46.056
eventually--

00:36:46.056 --> 00:36:48.024
always eventually.

00:36:48.024 --> 00:36:49.475
It depends on how--

00:36:49.475 --> 00:36:53.260
maybe we'd want to always
have gas from a station,

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.290
and also getting gas from it.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:58.950
So depending on how you want
to model it, but I think

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.124
both will work.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.170
AUDIENCE: So infinite
and often, doesn't really

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.947
care about how frequently--

00:37:07.947 --> 00:37:09.780
ELLIE: Yeah, it doesn't
care how frequently.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.791
AUDIENCE: But [INAUDIBLE]
for instance something

00:37:11.791 --> 00:37:13.950
that happens every 60 years.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.304
My system lifetime
server is 30 years,

00:37:16.304 --> 00:37:17.970
which means something
happens only once.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:20.573
So in this case,
infinite and often,

00:37:20.573 --> 00:37:22.320
how can you filter
a switch operator

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.364
could be the same, right?

00:37:24.364 --> 00:37:26.547
ELLIE: Can you repeat
that again [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:26.547 --> 00:37:28.005
AUDIENCE: So for
instance something

00:37:28.005 --> 00:37:29.970
happens every 60 years.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.540
My system lifetime
goes to 30 years.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.210
After 30 years, I have to
get a re-up on the system.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.790
Then so during this [INAUDIBLE]
only one thing happened.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.814
And so it happens
off into infinity,

00:37:39.814 --> 00:37:41.230
but in the lifetime
of the system,

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.480
it only happened
once, and therefore

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.570
in this condition, the
infinite and often should

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.435
be set the same as the future,
right, in the current state.

00:37:49.435 --> 00:37:50.810
Something happened
in the future,

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.960
I would say something
could never happen again.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.200
ELLIE: Kind of.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.303
So when you're talking
about a system that's

00:37:57.303 --> 00:38:02.320
dying after 30 years, the LTL
doesn't actual model something

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.294
that ends.

00:38:03.294 --> 00:38:05.070
It would model
something to infinity,

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.870
although there is an
extension to LTL that

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:12.590
can incorporate that into it,
having it have an actual end

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.335
goal state.

00:38:13.335 --> 00:38:16.430
And I think in that case,
then infinitely often would

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.384
be different, and would--

00:38:19.384 --> 00:38:22.055
I don't know exactly how that
would find that situation.

00:38:22.055 --> 00:38:23.052
Do you know, Ben?

00:38:23.052 --> 00:38:25.909
I know you had kind of--

00:38:25.909 --> 00:38:28.450
BEN: So there's something called
metric temporal logic, which

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.704
associates a time scale of
each of these operators.

00:38:31.704 --> 00:38:33.870
So I think you'd have to
use that if you were trying

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.210
to express that you had to
always meet those conditions

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.354
still within your lifetime.

00:38:38.354 --> 00:38:41.740
You could have some sort of
qualifier to these operators

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.730
to specify an actual time
[INAUDIBLE] where that operator

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.237
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:45.237 --> 00:38:46.612
AUDIENCE: So which
would you file

00:38:46.612 --> 00:38:48.608
for the instance infinitely
often [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:48.608 --> 00:38:50.850
scenario something at a
little bit more frequent

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.230
of a general system
by the time, right.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.290
Now we have something you
know [INAUDIBLE] 100 years ago

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:57.570
for years.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.362
BEN: You know, it's
important that the LTL

00:39:00.362 --> 00:39:02.820
we're explaining here is only
dealing with infinite states.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.575
So I agree, it's
a little bit-- you

00:39:04.575 --> 00:39:06.200
have to think about
that process of how

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.219
do apply something that goes
on forever to a real system.

00:39:09.219 --> 00:39:10.760
It obviously doesn't
model correctly.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.259
AUDIENCE: There has
to be a way to--

00:39:12.259 --> 00:39:14.330
I mean the future thing,
if he has a system that

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.052
lasts 30 years, and
you say future p,

00:39:17.052 --> 00:39:18.635
somewhere in your
design of the system

00:39:18.635 --> 00:39:21.095
is going to say that the
constraint on future p

00:39:21.095 --> 00:39:23.290
is that it has to happen
within 30 years, right?

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.793
Because future p
here, for getting gas,

00:39:25.793 --> 00:39:27.750
has to happen before
I run out of gas.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.350
It's not just-- this
representation says it just

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:33.554
happens in the future, but
somewhere in your constraint

00:39:33.554 --> 00:39:35.362
checking, it's going
to say, hey, we

00:39:35.362 --> 00:39:37.580
didn't get gas in this
plan soon enough, right?

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.195
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:39:38.195 --> 00:39:38.560
AUDIENCE: Somehow.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.018
ELLIE: Yes, that's
definitely true.

00:39:40.018 --> 00:39:43.917
And these are just tools
to help you model it,

00:39:43.917 --> 00:39:46.755
but it's definitely not the
entire model of your system

00:39:46.755 --> 00:39:49.505
obviously, and so I agree
that we definitely would

00:39:49.505 --> 00:39:50.671
have to incorporate that in.

00:39:50.671 --> 00:39:54.145
And for finance systems you
have to account for that.

00:39:54.145 --> 00:39:56.270
And that's why they have
the extension of LTL which

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.520
is the finance systems,
which we can certainly

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.870
drop a link of of
the papers, and where

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.120
we got the information, to
the class if you guys would

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.514
like that.

00:40:06.514 --> 00:40:08.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think you
guys have done a very good job

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:10.430
of answering the questions.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:13.005
The three extensions
to LTL that I've

00:40:13.005 --> 00:40:14.880
found to be the most
relevant kinds of things

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.691
that we're doing is
metric temporal logic,

00:40:17.691 --> 00:40:19.440
which is the first one
that you mentioned,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.070
also to be able to have it over
bounded time, which is related,

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.820
and you mentioned.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.975
And then the last one is
to deal with uncertainty,

00:40:24.975 --> 00:40:28.129
and is then a problem of
linear temporal logic.

00:40:28.129 --> 00:40:28.629
ELLIE: OK.

00:40:28.629 --> 00:40:29.129
Cool.

00:40:29.129 --> 00:40:31.587
All right.

00:40:31.587 --> 00:40:34.545
So I meant to have this
as two separate slides,

00:40:34.545 --> 00:40:39.490
but what are some true
statements about LTL

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:42.173
that you guys can tell
me about to look at this,

00:40:42.173 --> 00:40:44.855
or do, and explain
why if you look at it.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:54.235
OK, so why is the next red true?

00:40:54.235 --> 00:40:55.776
AUDIENCE: The next
step is slow down.

00:40:55.776 --> 00:40:56.740
ELLIE: Yep, exactly.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.906
Because the next one is red.

00:40:57.906 --> 00:41:00.380
Why is it true that in the
future, that it's green?

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.766
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:01.766 --> 00:41:03.731
Because in the
future, it's green.

00:41:03.731 --> 00:41:06.612
And why is it true that
there's red until green?

00:41:06.612 --> 00:41:09.438
AUDIENCE: It keeps being
red until it's green.

00:41:09.438 --> 00:41:10.307
ELLIE: Exactly.

00:41:10.307 --> 00:41:11.890
So it makes sense
that if all of these

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.786
are true, that this culmination
of the and statements

00:41:15.786 --> 00:41:17.510
between all of them
is also true, right?

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.618
And so you could do
that with or as well,

00:41:19.618 --> 00:41:21.170
or you could do that with--

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.932
if you had sequences
behind here,

00:41:23.932 --> 00:41:26.410
you could put a future
around this whole thing,

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.930
and it would be true that
at some point in the future,

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.084
all of this would hold.

00:41:30.084 --> 00:41:31.912
Does that make sense?

00:41:31.912 --> 00:41:32.826
Yes?

00:41:32.826 --> 00:41:33.740
OK.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.073
AUDIENCE: Why keep it red there?

00:41:35.073 --> 00:41:37.160
Your red is the next step.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:37.660
ELLIE: Yep.

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.159
Exactly.

00:41:38.159 --> 00:41:41.330
I was just saying if you
had more in the past,

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.856
and you were considering
it from the previous--

00:41:43.856 --> 00:41:46.419
All right so now
Nadia's going to talk

00:41:46.419 --> 00:41:48.726
about expressing LTL in PDDL3.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:03.270
So Ben and Ellie have
guided through how

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.768
expressive LTL formulation is.

00:42:05.768 --> 00:42:11.820
I'm going to formulate the
LTL in a classical planner

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.010
like PDDL3.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:19.340
Now I'm using PDDL3, which is an
composed extension of PDDL2.2,

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:26.170
which supports some
of the LTL operators.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.670
So these are the basic
operators that you

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:31.920
can use to express
the constraints

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.230
and goals of your plan.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.875
So you have at end,
always, sometimes, within,

00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:43.020
at-most-once, sometime-after,
sometime-before, always-within,

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.910
and hold-during.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:50.940
So again, now here is a numeric
controls that you can specify,

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:57.550
and the ellipses represents an
already-existing [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:58.050
goal.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:59.956
This is a goal description--

00:42:59.956 --> 00:43:00.870
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:05.580
So some of the operators
may look familiar to you,

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.450
because they can also be used to
express the constraint in STN,

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:13.200
the Simple Temporal Network,
that we learned in class.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.870
And there are some
operators that

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:19.450
are unique to LTL
or other kinds,

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:24.910
like metric temporal network,
like always, for example.

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.370
So now we are going
to take a look

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:35.144
at how you can express
the operators using

00:43:35.144 --> 00:43:39.960
the PDDL3 language.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:44.090
So we can use, within one
occurrence to the next,

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:48.410
because there is no
explicit next in the PDDL3.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:52.625
And you use always
until to express until.

00:43:52.625 --> 00:43:56.220
And in the future, you
use sometimes after,

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.320
and globally, you
can use always.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.130
And for release,
since it can always

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:09.930
be omega or always until
omega when you see p.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:13.964
You can use all costs, too,
although this [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.980
OK, let's see some examples.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:25.877
So if your goal is to have
the traffic light turn

00:44:25.877 --> 00:44:29.110
red in the next
state, you would want

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:36.775
to formulate it using
within one occurrence,

00:44:36.775 --> 00:44:38.260
the traffic light
would turn red.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:45.320
And let's take a look at a
more complicated example.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:49.290
So if you want to model a
goal saying that the traffic

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:56.558
light would be green until
it turns red, at which point

00:44:56.558 --> 00:44:58.850
it would be red forever.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:03.862
So this is temporal
logic of predicates

00:45:03.862 --> 00:45:08.046
that express this goal.

00:45:08.046 --> 00:45:13.800
And then if you want to
model that using PDDL,

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.580
there is a direct mapping.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.828
You can see the direct
mapping between the predicates

00:45:17.828 --> 00:45:20.220
and the PDDL.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:25.740
So this is basically
saying, it would always

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.226
be green until it turns red.

00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:31.740
And turning red implies
it will always turn red.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:42.640
So next, [? Arleese ?] will tell
us how to map between the LTL

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.795
to PDDL with a
Buchi Automata which

00:45:44.795 --> 00:45:46.494
is a specialized automata.

00:45:50.752 --> 00:45:51.585
GUEST SPEAKER: Cool.

00:45:51.585 --> 00:45:54.880
So I'm [? Arleese. ?] I have
bridged the gap between LTL

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.404
and the planning world.

00:45:56.404 --> 00:45:58.434
So this is kind of
the framework for how

00:45:58.434 --> 00:45:59.850
you would go from
taking a problem

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.000
with temporally extended
goals all the way to a plan.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.376
So as you can kind
of imagine from what

00:46:05.376 --> 00:46:07.040
Ben and Ellie were
talking about,

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.195
LTL is pretty expressive.

00:46:08.195 --> 00:46:10.236
You can express a lot of
different types of goals

00:46:10.236 --> 00:46:14.170
that include more temporal
properties than just a time

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:17.140
window for a goal
to be completed.

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.196
So once we have a kind
of defined problem

00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:21.140
with these temporary
extended goals,

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:26.021
then you want to model it in
a language like LTL or PDDL.

00:46:26.021 --> 00:46:27.520
So if you have a
language like PDDL,

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.117
and you have a planner that
can do an algorithm called

00:46:30.117 --> 00:46:32.200
progression, which I'll
talk about a little later,

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.770
you can go directly to a plan.

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:38.503
Basically how progression works
is it's kind of an algorithm

00:46:38.503 --> 00:46:40.670
that tells you when
you're analyzing a state,

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:43.370
and you're analyzing
LTL-like formulas that

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:47.360
are true in a specific
state, how to push formulas

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.087
that you need to evaluate
later on to the next state,

00:46:50.087 --> 00:46:52.045
and how to keep track
of things that you

00:46:52.045 --> 00:46:56.890
need to continue to evaluate for
satisfaction in future states.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:47:00.375
Another way you can do this
is by taking LTL formulations

00:47:00.375 --> 00:47:02.640
and translating them
into Buchi Automata.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.710
So Buchi Automata are
basically finite state machines

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:10.530
that are extended to handle an
infinite sequence of states.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:14.110
And I'll get into more about
how Buchi Automata work.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:15.664
After you have a
Buchi Automata, you

00:47:15.664 --> 00:47:17.620
can then translate
that into PDDL2,

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.304
which you guys are
all familiar with,

00:47:19.304 --> 00:47:22.390
and then that PDDL2 can be used
from the classical planner,

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:23.582
and get a plan.

00:47:26.778 --> 00:47:28.528
So a little bit more
about Buchi Automata.

00:47:28.528 --> 00:47:30.270
Again, like I said,
it's an extension

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:31.780
of a finite state machine.

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.432
Oh, yes.

00:47:32.432 --> 00:47:34.973
AUDIENCE: Why would have a Buchi
Automata when you could just

00:47:34.973 --> 00:47:38.925
use a planner that will go from
PDDL3 straight to the plan?

00:47:38.925 --> 00:47:41.060
GUEST SPEAKER: I guess
it just depends on how--

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.930
what kind of planners
we have access to,

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.320
what other systems you have.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.602
It's done both ways.

00:47:45.602 --> 00:47:47.951
So PDDL3 is still kind of
new, and so there's not

00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:50.284
a lot of planners that actually
have progression and can

00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:51.228
handle PDDL3.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.990
AUDIENCE: And it's also the case
that the particular algorithms

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:01.350
that are trying to either be
verification or planning, maybe

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.180
exploiting particular properties
of the Buchi Automaton,

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.384
as opposed to the properties
of the native language.

00:48:09.287 --> 00:48:11.870
GUEST SPEAKER: So you guys are
all familiar with regular state

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:12.395
machines.

00:48:12.395 --> 00:48:14.822
Buchi Automata has a
very similar formulation.

00:48:14.822 --> 00:48:17.210
Some slight differences--
you have a set of states,

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:21.050
you have an initial state, and
you have a transition relation,

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:23.020
and then you have a set
of accepting states.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.603
These accepting
states are essentially

00:48:24.603 --> 00:48:27.545
what replaces finite states
in the state machine.

00:48:27.545 --> 00:48:30.570
We also have a set of
symbols that are again simply

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:33.040
the transitions between states.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.630
So what an accepting state
is, is a Buchi Automata

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:39.810
can only be valid if the
sequence of transitions

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.954
visits an accepting state
an infinite amount of times.

00:48:42.954 --> 00:48:44.974
So I'll get into
a couple examples.

00:48:44.974 --> 00:48:48.660
So let's say you want to model
the ticking-tocking of a clock.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.690
This is just a regular
finite state machine.

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:54.560
As you can see, after some
number of ticks and tocks,

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.630
you get into S2,
and you're in S2

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:59.350
because you can be in
transition only [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:01.900
So you're in S2 basically
forever once you get to S2.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.920
So we can model this
as a Buchi Automata

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:07.970
by making S2 an accepted state.

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:09.722
This example, making
it a Buchi Automata,

00:49:09.722 --> 00:49:11.180
doesn't really do
anything for you.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:14.030
It's just kind of to illustrate
what the accepting state does.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.470
So the accepting words are
a sequence of transitions.

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:20.600
In this case it would be
an infinite combination

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.512
of ticks and tocks that would
make this Buchi Automata valid.

00:49:24.512 --> 00:49:27.218
Does that make sense.

00:49:27.218 --> 00:49:30.401
Questions about that?

00:49:30.401 --> 00:49:31.900
Here's another
example, for example,

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.780
if I have changed what
my accepting state was.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.516
So if our accepting
state was S1,

00:49:36.516 --> 00:49:38.780
I now have to visit S1 an
infinite amount of times

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.980
for this Buchi
Automata to be valid.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.620
That means the
only valid sequence

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.589
of transitions I could
have is tock tick tick tick

00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:48.130
tick for an infinite
amount of times.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.830
So you can kind of
represent different things

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:52.420
and different
sequences of inputs

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.030
you might want to have based on
which accepting state you use.

00:49:57.596 --> 00:49:58.740
This is another example.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.920
If you wanted your clock to be
tick tock tick tock tick tock,

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.795
you can have more than
one accepting state,

00:50:03.795 --> 00:50:08.030
and now I have to visit S0 and
S1 an infinite amount of times

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:11.620
if I want this Buchi
Automata to be valid.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.800
So then the sequence
of transitions I get

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.772
is tick tock tick
tock tick tock.

00:50:15.772 --> 00:50:17.938
Does anyone have any questions
to really think about

00:50:17.938 --> 00:50:22.231
in general with Buchi Automata?

00:50:22.231 --> 00:50:24.620
OK.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.758
It might help to see how we
model LTL as Buchi Automata.

00:50:28.758 --> 00:50:32.800
So here's an example of
of these LTL formulas

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.192
modeled as a Buchi Automata.

00:50:35.192 --> 00:50:36.660
I guess take a few
minutes and see

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:40.066
if you can get which
one this one might be.

00:50:53.954 --> 00:50:55.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:56.590
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:59.620
Just so that everyone can kind
of see that, and future events,

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.865
we remember that means
that eventually p

00:51:01.865 --> 00:51:04.540
has to be true at least once.

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:09.740
So from any sort of input
state, you go to S0,

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.440
and then I do have amount
p for some amount of time,

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.674
but as soon as I have
p, I have to get to p,

00:51:15.674 --> 00:51:17.340
because I have to be
in my subject state

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.506
an infinite amount of times.

00:51:18.506 --> 00:51:20.340
So I have to execute
p at some point

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.650
to get to my accepting state
for this Buchi Automata

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:24.212
to be valid.

00:51:24.212 --> 00:51:26.680
And then once I'm
at S1, I can have

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.050
any other amount of inputs.

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:33.435
I'll always be in S1, and that's
what the true label means.

00:51:33.435 --> 00:51:34.810
AUDIENCE: And it's
also something

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:36.351
stronger, right,
which is you could--

00:51:36.351 --> 00:51:37.875
it's eventually globally?

00:51:37.875 --> 00:51:40.150
GUEST SPEAKER: Right.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:45.730
Yeah, so actually in this
case, after it gets here,

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:46.990
my input could be anything.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:50.260
So this basically just says
that for my initial state,

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.046
I have to execute p
at least once to get

00:51:52.046 --> 00:51:54.420
to this accepting state,
and once I'm there,

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.720
I can be there--

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.730
I'm always there.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:59.576
Any input will believe me in S1.

00:51:59.576 --> 00:52:02.455
AUDIENCE: So just to make this
clear for myself and maybe

00:52:02.455 --> 00:52:04.730
for others, the
data string executed

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:09.390
that's at R state something
that's on the loop.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:11.650
If you go from s0 to
s0, that's essentially

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:13.967
saying that one of
the nodes is not p.

00:52:13.967 --> 00:52:17.250
If you go from s0 to s1, it's
saying that one of the nodes

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:18.134
is p.

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:18.576
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:52:18.576 --> 00:52:19.950
AUDIENCE: If you
go from s1 to s1

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:25.010
and take whatever it would
be because you set it true.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.430
AUDIENCE: So if you put p
where the true is right now,

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:29.370
then you you won't
have to go through.

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:30.078
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:52:30.078 --> 00:52:32.020
That's what I missed.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:35.287
By the way, you guys
have 25 more minutes.

00:52:37.604 --> 00:52:39.520
GUEST SPEAKER: So that's
what we talked about.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.232
This is future.

00:52:41.232 --> 00:52:44.550
So the accepted
sequence of propositions

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:46.230
would be not to not p.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:47.600
Then you have p.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.450
Then it can be anything
after you get to p.

00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:52.180
And then in this case, for
Buchi Automata states, which

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:54.980
are like [INAUDIBLE],, slightly
different than the LTL states

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.153
we've been talking about.

00:52:56.153 --> 00:52:57.350
In this case, you're in s0.

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.716
And then once you get to
s1, you're forever in s1.

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:06.690
So globally, looks
pretty similar to this.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:08.840
Take a few minutes
to think about how

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.950
I might change this Buchi
Automata to [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:21.845
globally after [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:21.845 --> 00:53:24.597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:24.597 --> 00:53:25.805
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, exactly.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:32.170
So you have initially,
your first state by your n

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.810
because p has to be
true forever after you

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:35.940
get to this first state.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.320
You have an
accepting state in p.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.715
You can also model not p.

00:53:40.715 --> 00:53:42.090
If you want to,
you can also just

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.420
have this single see
which would encapsulate

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.552
exactly what Buchi is.

00:53:47.552 --> 00:53:50.940
This is how you go from
LTL to Buchi Automata.

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:54.304
In a real-world scenario, we
have multiple LTL formulas all

00:53:54.304 --> 00:53:54.846
combined.

00:53:54.846 --> 00:53:57.220
You're Buchi Automata are
going to look a little bit more

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.930
complicated than this.

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:02.290
Try multiple accepting states.

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:04.800
There's a full
weighted model of what

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.150
an LTL is trying to represent.

00:54:09.826 --> 00:54:12.684
AUDIENCE: If we have the not
p transition out of there,

00:54:12.684 --> 00:54:16.600
Like it's possible you can come
into s0 to accept the Buchi

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.465
Automata because it
would go to s1, right?

00:54:19.465 --> 00:54:21.690
GUEST SPEAKER: Accepting a
Buchi Automata after that,

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:22.799
it's a little confusing.

00:54:22.799 --> 00:54:25.090
A Buchi Automata is only
valid if the infinite sequence

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:28.345
of states satisfies it.

00:54:28.345 --> 00:54:33.129
If I were to go the
p instead of not p,

00:54:33.129 --> 00:54:36.456
my sequence would accept a
transition of p, p, not p.

00:54:36.456 --> 00:54:38.810
Then that would not
be a valid sequence

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.214
of transition for
this Buchi Automata

00:54:41.214 --> 00:54:43.380
because I'm transitioning
out of my accepting state,

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.240
which I need to have been in for
at least the amount of times.

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.346
And there's no way I
can get back to success.

00:54:56.436 --> 00:54:59.700
Also, a more defined algorithm
[INAUDIBLE] an intuitive way

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.444
to build a Buchi Automata,
or is an algorithm.

00:55:02.444 --> 00:55:04.110
The other one that's
most popularly used

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:05.830
was developed by [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:09.885
This is a pseudocode
version of the algorithm.

00:55:09.885 --> 00:55:11.380
We go from LTL to Buchi.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:13.960
As you've noticed, it
actually uses progression,

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:18.990
which is something that planners
that take PDDL use to generate

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:20.210
plans.

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.770
An important thing
to note, which

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:24.570
I won't go into too much
detail, this algorithm

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:26.250
generates a generalized
Buchi Automata,

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:30.019
which you then change to
a simple Buchi Automata.

00:55:30.019 --> 00:55:32.060
The difference is, the
generalized Buchi Automata

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.940
has a set of sets
of accepting states.

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:39.200
For a generalized Buchi
Automata to be accepted,

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.325
you need to visit
an accepting state

00:55:41.325 --> 00:55:43.393
in each one of those
sets of accepting states.

00:55:43.393 --> 00:55:46.220
At least one of those
states has to be listed.

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.430
For a simple Buchi
Automata, you only

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:49.950
have one set of
accepting states.

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:52.855
And you can visit any one of
those for the Buchi Automata

00:55:52.855 --> 00:55:54.255
to be valid.

00:55:54.255 --> 00:55:56.630
On the translation between
those two is a little bit more

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:57.640
complicated.

00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:00.052
We'll have paper in the
preference that will

00:56:00.052 --> 00:56:01.465
walk through how to do that.

00:56:01.465 --> 00:56:04.291
But we're not going
to do that now.

00:56:04.291 --> 00:56:07.800
This is a progression algorithm.

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:12.260
Basically, it just tells you
how if have a LTL formula f

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:14.180
and some current state N--

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:16.776
and usually they
involve some time step

00:56:16.776 --> 00:56:18.900
because we're in the real
world and we can't really

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.770
model infinite amount
of time, and we

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:23.890
have to make it discrete.

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:28.125
So we have some time step,
which means successive state.

00:56:28.125 --> 00:56:31.820
How do you push certain LTL
formulas onto next states

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:33.792
to be evaluated later?

00:56:33.792 --> 00:56:37.530
For example, I'll take
this next f as an example.

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.730
So if f was a next f
of some LTL formula,

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:44.936
you need to append that
formula to the next state

00:56:44.936 --> 00:56:46.820
to be evaluated
in the next state

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.486
to see if that's going
to be true or not.

00:56:49.486 --> 00:56:51.204
Similar things for LTL.

00:56:51.204 --> 00:56:54.770
And I won't go through
this [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:58.492
it's here for reference.

00:56:58.492 --> 00:57:00.950
The next step to this process
is going from Buchi Automata,

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.050
that's a PDDL2.

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:04.465
This process is confusing.

00:57:04.465 --> 00:57:06.960
At least it is confusing
for me to understand.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.440
The first thing I'll say is
that Buchi states are not

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.330
equivalent to
traditional PDDL states.

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:14.570
In a PDDL state, if
you have two states,

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:17.540
you have the same propositions
that are true and false,

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.902
those states are identical.

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:23.133
In the Buchi Automata,
that's not necessarily true.

00:57:23.133 --> 00:57:24.880
In the Buchi Automata
you also have

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.360
to encapsulate which
transitions you can make out

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.560
of each Buchi state.

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:33.020
So s1 and s2 couldn't have
the same set of propositions

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.830
that are [INAUDIBLE] hold.

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:37.290
But out of s1--

00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:38.815
actually, back up.

00:57:38.815 --> 00:57:42.230
This is the Buchi Automata
for FutureGlobally,

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:44.480
which is what [INAUDIBLE]
was talking about.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.760
So if I enter an
f1, the star means

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:52.560
I can have any transition
that I want in s1.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.560
At some point, I
make the transition p

00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.530
and whatever the s2, I have
to take transition p forever.

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:05.380
However, if I get a sequence
of inputs, let's say I get p

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:11.000
and then b, and p
again, and then p again,

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.730
it's not clear if
I'm in s1 or s2

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:16.070
because in s1 I can execute
any kind of state I want.

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:19.140
In s1 I can execute any
transition I want in s1.

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:21.500
2 I have to execute only p.

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:25.560
So if I got a sequence of p's,
I could be in either state.

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.120
You need something else to
activate PDDL2 to basically

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.355
to determine which state
you're and which transitions

00:58:31.355 --> 00:58:34.644
you can make from that state.

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:37.074
Does that make
sense to everyone?

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:42.620
So there's two ways
we can transform

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:47.020
PDDL2 to encapsulate what a
Buchi Automata encapsulates.

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:48.650
The first thing
is you can create

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:51.640
new actions that can encapsulate
the allowable transitions

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.490
of each state.

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.530
So basically, for
every action you

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:57.320
have in your
traditional PDDL, you

00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:02.279
have create a repetitive action
for each one of these states

00:59:02.279 --> 00:59:03.820
so you know exactly
which transitions

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.420
you can take out of that state.

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.280
This can get long
because you have

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.940
to make a new action
for every single one

00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:13.760
of these states for every
action that you want to take.

00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.295
That is one way you can do it.

00:59:15.295 --> 00:59:19.186
Another way you can do it is
introducing derived predicates.

00:59:19.186 --> 00:59:20.560
Derived predicates
are predicates

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.060
that don't depend
the actions at all

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:25.267
and just depend on some
other formula in your plan.

00:59:25.267 --> 00:59:27.100
For example, we can
have a derived predicate

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.170
that explicitly tells
you whether you're in s1

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:31.540
or whether you're in s2.

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.590
And you can use these
predicates in your actions

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:38.120
in PDDL2 to make sure, even
though which state, x1 or x2,

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.240
you're in in your
Buchi Automata.

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.080
And then, in your
formulation of your plan,

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:46.747
you set your final state to be
one of the accepting states.

00:59:46.747 --> 00:59:48.830
I guess that answers one
of the questions, though,

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:51.800
how you go from being
infinite to finite.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.570
The accepting state
is usually what

00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:55.298
you place as your final state.

00:59:55.298 --> 00:59:57.006
AUDIENCE: Then in the
derived predicates,

00:59:57.006 --> 00:59:59.437
you're purely in
the pre-conditions?

00:59:59.437 --> 01:00:01.020
Or do they also
appear in the effects.

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.936
GUEST SPEAKER: They also
appear in the effects

01:00:02.936 --> 01:00:07.610
because you need to know how
to transition out of s1 to s2.

01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:10.520
So you'd likely have a
derived predicate for both s1

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.690
and a derived predicate for s2.

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:16.572
And that is also a lot of work
to add to the PDDL2 problem.

01:00:16.572 --> 01:00:18.600
But it's definitely
shorter than the first way.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.350
And it definitely
encapsulates everything,

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.774
by the Buchi
Automata [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:22.774 --> 01:00:26.040
Does anyone have any
questions about that?

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.916
AUDIENCE: So you're
changing the action then?

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:28.748
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:00:28.748 --> 01:00:30.220
You're changing
the action but you

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:33.960
don't need make a new
action for every state.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:38.030
In the first
formulation, let's say

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.799
I have some traditional
action, like move blue block,

01:00:40.799 --> 01:00:41.340
or something.

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.840
I have to create a
move block action

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.790
for each one of these
states because I

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:46.450
need to know exactly
which transitions

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:47.747
I can take out of that action.

01:00:47.747 --> 01:00:49.080
AUDIENCE: In the second example?

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.579
GUEST SPEAKER: And
in the second one

01:00:50.579 --> 01:00:52.710
I can just have one move block.

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:55.050
But in my move block I'll
have a derived predicate

01:00:55.050 --> 01:01:00.800
that tells me which state I'm
in when I execute that action.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.210
The number of actions
you have to write

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.340
is less because
you explicitly have

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:14.533
predicates that are telling
you which state that you're in.

01:01:14.533 --> 01:01:17.005
Now I'm going to
hand it over to--

01:01:17.005 --> 01:01:19.254
if there are no more questions--
hand it over to Mark.

01:01:19.254 --> 01:01:21.524
And he's going to talk
about preferences.

01:01:25.172 --> 01:01:27.697
MARK: We're getting
a little low on time.

01:01:27.697 --> 01:01:29.280
Now I'll transition
to talking about--

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.370
we talked about
temporally extended goals.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:34.230
We said that goals are things
that always have to be true.

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:35.860
So now let's talk
about preferences.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.735
Preferences are things
that don't necessarily

01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:41.470
have to be true, but are things
that you'd like to be true.

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:43.050
In the classical
planning problem,

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:44.750
we can formulate it like that.

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:48.860
We can set a state S, set a
state s0, a set of operators,

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.220
and a set of goal states.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.980
The problem is transition
from the initial states

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:53.880
and any state.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.645
But those are goal states
using the operators [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:57.645 --> 01:01:59.020
Preference based
planning problem

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.636
introduces a
traditional field R,

01:02:01.636 --> 01:02:05.840
which is a partial or total
relation expressing preferences

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.942
between plans.

01:02:06.942 --> 01:02:10.490
And this is a little
preference symbol right there.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:12.690
That tells you, if
there are multiple plans

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:14.590
you need to
accomplish your goal,

01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:17.049
which one do you want to use.

01:02:17.049 --> 01:02:18.590
And again, preferences
are properties

01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.506
that are desired but not
necessarily required.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.770
There are two [INAUDIBLE]
different types

01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:28.752
of preference languages,
quantitative and qualitative.

01:02:28.752 --> 01:02:31.120
As you would expect, in
quantitative languages,

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.575
we actually assign a numeric
value to the different plans

01:02:34.575 --> 01:02:36.190
in order to compare them.

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.790
So these plans are a weight
of four, and a weight of two,

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.740
and that tells you
which one to prefer.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.870
Here are some
languages that do that.

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:45.150
For qualitative
languages, they actually

01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:48.420
just have a plan
with this property

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:51.810
is preferred to this other
plan with this property.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.870
But we don't actually
know any information that

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.993
knows how much we
prefer one to the other,

01:02:55.993 --> 01:02:56.951
or something like that.

01:02:56.951 --> 01:02:59.326
An important element
of this is when

01:02:59.326 --> 01:03:02.250
you have quantitative languages,
they're totally comparable.

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.350
Any two sets of plans
you can determine

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:06.056
which one is preferred.

01:03:06.056 --> 01:03:07.430
Whereas in
qualitative languages,

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:09.638
you could have situations
where plan one is preferred

01:03:09.638 --> 01:03:11.940
to plan two, and plan one
is also preferred to plan 3,

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:14.440
but that doesn't give you any
information about whether plan

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.938
two is preferred to plan three.

01:03:16.938 --> 01:03:21.210
So it's a little bit less
expressive [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:24.972
To go into how you actually
express preferences in PDDL3,

01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:26.930
like we talked about
temporally extended goals,

01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:29.800
there is a PDDL3
syntax to do this.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.150
There's a preference label here
that you can put on fluents

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:36.647
to represent things you prefer.

01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:38.480
And then there's a
function call is-violated

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.940
that essentially returns
the number of times

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.990
that any fluent that
has a preference label

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:45.960
was not satisfied in your plan.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.707
For example, if you
have a preference,

01:03:47.707 --> 01:03:49.710
"Traffic light is green
until it turns red."

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:51.620
Here's our PDDL3 template.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.378
It extended this
kid's preference,

01:03:54.378 --> 01:03:57.030
in which we label it with
a preference label here.

01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:58.830
And this is just a name.

01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:02.710
And then or plan tries to
minimize the number of times

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:04.990
that this preference
is violated.

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:08.460
That's one way to express
preferences directly in PDDL3.

01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:13.950
So now we talk about LDP.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:16.620
LDP is a different
language that is

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.980
quite expressive in terms
of types of preferences

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.390
you can represent.

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.210
It is a quantitative
language, which

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:25.660
means we're going to have
weights for each of our plans

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:26.999
to express our preferences.

01:04:26.999 --> 01:04:29.290
We can actually express the
strength of the preference.

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:33.736
So Goal A is preferred twice or
three times as much as Goal B.

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:36.456
It's an extension of an
older language named PP.

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:39.133
Here is the paper if you
want to actually check out

01:04:39.133 --> 01:04:41.060
these details.

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:43.180
The formulas are
constructed hierarchically.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.920
I'll go through quickly
how we actually construct

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.670
these preference formulas.

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:51.230
The lowest level is called a
Basic Design Formula, or BDF.

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.130
That just expresses
our temporally extended

01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:53.810
proposition.

01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:55.645
So this is just a
straight up LTL,

01:04:55.645 --> 01:04:57.436
basically, that we saw
in the first section

01:04:57.436 --> 01:04:58.404
of the presentation.

01:04:58.404 --> 01:05:00.070
I'm going to use that
I'm cooking dinner

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:02.170
example for these slides.

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:04.610
In this case, we always
use the future operators.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:07.040
At some point, I might want
to cook this program plan.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.160
Maybe I want to order
takeout to eat dinner.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.770
And then I have some eating
spaghetti or eating pizza.

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:14.470
Those are two different
things, two different options

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:15.678
that I could have in my plan.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.481
I don't have to have
either of those.

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.766
Those are just options
that I could have.

01:05:19.766 --> 01:05:21.070
That's the lowest level.

01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:24.590
The next level is called Atomic
Preference Formulas, or APFs.

01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:27.670
There are where we express our
preferences between the BDFs

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.920
that we formed in
the previous slide.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.729
So in this example
I'm using weight,

01:05:31.729 --> 01:05:33.270
specifically to
represent preference,

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:35.870
with lower weight
being preferred.

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:39.292
Here we're saying, we prefer
to cook over ordering takeout.

01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:40.750
This is you where
you have to cook,

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:42.748
this is where you
have to order takeout.

01:05:42.748 --> 01:05:45.496
And we apply weights to
those two expressions.

01:05:45.496 --> 01:05:47.120
The first one's
preferred, and how much

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.214
it is preferred over this plan.

01:05:49.214 --> 01:05:53.794
And here is you prefer to eat
spaghetti over eating pizza.

01:05:53.794 --> 01:05:55.150
So that's the second level.

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:59.060
Third levels called General
Purpose Formulas, or GPS.

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.420
These are where we can do
conjunctions or disjunctions,

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.200
or qualification of
our previous formulas.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.110
So for example, if
we want to say--

01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:09.093
because in the previous
slides we had two APFs.

01:06:09.093 --> 01:06:13.217
We had prefer to cook and
prefer to eat spaghetti.

01:06:13.217 --> 01:06:14.800
And here we can
express that we really

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.040
don't care which one of
these we want to satisfy.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.540
You can think of
this as we actually

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.010
tried to satisfy APF
at the lowest weight.

01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:25.114
So if we have this
"or" operating here,

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:27.405
that means that our planner
is going to try and satisfy

01:06:27.405 --> 01:06:29.515
the lowest weight among all
these different options here,

01:06:29.515 --> 01:06:31.570
which means that he
doesn't prefer to cook.

01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:33.610
That's its first goal.

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.510
You can also use a handoff
rigor, for example.

01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:38.620
And that's going to
minimize the maximum weight

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.160
against both of those options.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.076
Basically, what's it
going to try and do--

01:06:42.076 --> 01:06:44.230
oops-- what it's
going to try and do

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:47.600
is minimize the highest weight
among these two options.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:52.059
So it's going to try
and cook, and then it's

01:06:52.059 --> 01:06:53.850
going to try and eat
spaghetti versus doing

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:54.683
these other options.

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:00.020
So those are GPFs.

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.616
I'm now moving on to Aggregated
Preference Formulas, which

01:07:02.616 --> 01:07:04.380
are the highest level.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:07.232
So with APFs, these
define the order

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.190
in which our different
preferences are relaxed.

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:10.965
You can, of course, express a
lot of different preferences

01:07:10.965 --> 01:07:13.000
for your planner,
but not all of them

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.670
may be achievable,
especially if you're

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:17.170
trying to achieve a large number
of preferences at the same.

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:20.250
You may not actually be able
to achieve all of those.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:23.670
So how do we produce our
set in the correct order,

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:25.980
in the preferred order so
that our plan we end up with

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.640
isn't even the most
preferred plan?

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.050
That's what APFs like to do.

01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:36.744
You can express, using
this preference operator.

01:07:36.744 --> 01:07:38.660
First, I want to try and
satisfy both of these

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.550
in the previous slide.

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:43.620
Then if I can't, I want to
relax it so I only satisfy G2.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.250
And then if I can't
do that, then I

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.450
want to relax it so I
only try and satisfy G1.

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:50.760
So that gives us the order
in which things are relaxed.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.456
It's important here that if
you have these situations where

01:07:53.456 --> 01:07:55.080
you can't distinguish
from one another,

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.390
or you don't really care,
we can establish some order.

01:07:57.390 --> 01:08:00.300
So at the very
lowest type of level,

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.425
we can sort them alphabetically,
or something, just

01:08:02.425 --> 01:08:04.141
to provide some sort of order.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.330
This is just a review of
what I've been talking about.

01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:13.590
BDFs are the lowest
level, which express

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.425
temporally extended
propositions.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:18.840
We can apply preference
to those using APFs.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:25.470
Then we can combine or join APFs
using tell preference formulas.

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:29.210
And finally, we can aggregate
those preference formulas

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:31.630
to determine the order
in which you shouldn't

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:35.810
relax the propositions to allow
yourself to plan it right.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:39.260
So using this
scheme in LPP, we're

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:43.224
using both LTL syntax and
rules that we talked about

01:08:43.224 --> 01:08:45.439
in the first section to
express temporally extended

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:46.750
preferences.

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:50.222
The plans that's actually
used to solve these types

01:08:50.222 --> 01:08:51.830
of problems is called P Plan.

01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:54.288
P Plans can actually handle
templates, and the preferences,

01:08:54.288 --> 01:08:55.750
and a goal at the end, as well.

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:58.281
And it does basically
a best first search

01:08:58.281 --> 01:08:59.656
among all your
different options.

01:08:59.656 --> 01:09:02.114
It's actually one of the planner
that uses the left branch.

01:09:02.114 --> 01:09:04.700
But the one we showed
uses progression to take

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.947
LTL formulas at each
point in the plan

01:09:06.947 --> 01:09:09.155
and determine whether you've
satisfied those formulas

01:09:09.155 --> 01:09:09.655
or not.

01:09:09.655 --> 01:09:12.774
And if not, it will push
them to the next state,

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:15.149
so that in the next state you
can evaluate whether you've

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:16.460
satisfied those formulas.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.119
That's how it prunes
the search space

01:09:19.119 --> 01:09:21.819
and tries to always find the
most preferred plan to meet

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:24.290
your goal.

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:25.670
All right.

01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:28.500
So that's our presentation.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.990
Any questions from anyone?

01:09:35.974 --> 01:09:37.265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] question.

01:09:37.265 --> 01:09:39.760
I have a question about
[INAUDIBLE] presentation.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.819
You guys [INAUDIBLE]
and then believes omega.

01:09:43.819 --> 01:09:46.688
Would you say that
omega has to hold

01:09:46.688 --> 01:09:52.390
if p happens, and they have
a conjunction in one state?

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:55.620
ELLIE: Omega doesn't have to
hold until we [INAUDIBLE]..

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:59.250
Omega just has to hold
at the last state of p.

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:02.270
Essentially what it's
saying is omega releases p.

01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:05.890
So once omega happened, p
has to happen at the state.

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:07.940
And the omega has to release p.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.280
Now it happens, so p,
you can don't you want.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.454
You can be true,
you can be false.

01:10:12.454 --> 01:10:13.120
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.722
So p has to hold
until omega happens.

01:10:16.722 --> 01:10:17.222
ELLIE: Yep.

01:10:17.222 --> 01:10:18.190
And then omega--

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:19.160
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.847
AUDIENCE: So the definition is
just switched to p [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:22.847 --> 01:10:24.007
ELLIE: This is an occasion.

01:10:24.007 --> 01:10:25.340
Occasionally, you have pR omega.

01:10:29.384 --> 01:10:30.814
But like intuitively--

01:10:30.814 --> 01:10:32.522
AUDIENCE: It's just
the definition-- oh--

01:10:32.522 --> 01:10:33.775
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:35.900
AUDIENCE: That's all I was
wondering because then I

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:36.790
saw that and it was confusing.

01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:37.457
So that's all.

01:10:37.457 --> 01:10:37.959
OK, sorry.

01:10:37.959 --> 01:10:38.750
ELLIE: That's fine.

01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:48.540
MARK: Any other questions?

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.580
AUDIENCE: Since there
are multiple ways

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:57.125
to express the same formula
using the grammar, is there

01:10:57.125 --> 01:11:02.330
any notion of canonical forms,
or a least complicated form,

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:03.626
or something like that?

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:04.810
MARK: Yeah, there is.

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:10.560
Typically they actually--
let me find the slide.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:14.690
So to simplify the algorithms
they typically apply

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:16.812
the kind of reductions
that we showed in the slide

01:11:16.812 --> 01:11:18.395
to reduce the release
and the globally

01:11:18.395 --> 01:11:20.882
and the future down to just
the [INAUDIBLE] of an x.

01:11:20.882 --> 01:11:22.465
Otherwise, your
algorithms going to be

01:11:22.465 --> 01:11:24.831
able to handle fewer cases.

01:11:24.831 --> 01:11:26.330
And then they apply
the usual rules,

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:28.246
trying to push nots out
to the left-hand side.

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.852
All right.

01:11:41.852 --> 01:11:42.560
Thanks, everyone.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.410
[APPLAUSE]
