00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.620
GUEST SPEAKER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.120
Today we're going to talk
about semantic localization.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.770
So first I'm going to talk about
what is semantic localization

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.540
and what is the
motivation for it.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.370
Then we'll go
through an algorithm

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.840
that will allow us to localize.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.080
And then we'll go into
how to actually add

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.850
semantic information
into this algorithm.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.200
So our focus what we're
coming up with this

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.670
was the orienteering
Grand Challenge.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540
So in orienteering,
basically you have a map

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.950
and you have a compass,
and you have to go around

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.240
to various checkpoints.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.550
So as you can imagine,
this is sort of difficult,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.580
because you don't know where
you are on this map except what

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.910
you can tell from your compass.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.010
And so we weren't sure
how to do this either,

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.470
so we asked some
orienteering experts.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.720
So basically the key ideas
are, if you are disoriented,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.380
that's fine.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.330
You just need to find a
reference point so that you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.324
can figure out where you are.

00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:30.740
You can think about
where you last

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.980
knew where you were, and
estimate what your movement has

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.560
been since you were there.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.300
And that can give you some
options as to where you are.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.460
And you can look
around for features

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.280
that you can identify
uniquely on the map.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.500
And this is an example
of an orienteering map.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.710
If you just have what's over
here, it's not very useful.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.081
You can't actually tell
what those things are.

00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:01.580
You might guess
that green is grass,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.505
but you don't actually
know what they are.

00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:05.780
This map isn't useful
until you actually

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.509
have a legend to go
along with it so that you

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.190
can say you have roads,
or foot paths, or pits,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.720
or different things on the map
that you can actually identify.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.950
So this is the difference
between how robots typically

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.120
localize and how
humans localize.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.350
So humans think about
places in terms of features,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.800
in terms of what you can do
with them, things like that,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.580
whereas robots might measure
distances with laser scanners

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.630
to form a perfect map
of the entire space,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.170
whereas humans might
think about obstructions

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.100
such as rooms and their
relative location to each other.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.980
So we can define
semantic information

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.870
as signs and
symbols that contain

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.910
meaningful concepts for humans.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.900
Basically different
sorts of abstractions.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.135
And why might we want
this semantic information?

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:03.770
Well, one very
important application

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.840
would be improving
human-robot interaction.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.990
So say you want a robot
that can make coffee.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.680
It has to understand commands
like, go to the kitchen.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.320
Get a mug.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.230
Turn on the coffee maker.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.490
This is the language
that humans think in,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.840
and it's very useful if a
robot can actually understand

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.380
this sort of language as well.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.300
Know what a coffee maker is,
what it does, and where it is.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.190
And additionally, you can get
some performance and memory

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.820
benefits.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.100
You're not storing this
full map with the distance

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.750
to every single surface.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.470
You're just storing
locations of key information.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.930
And this means that your search
base is a lot smaller too.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.060
So you can prune
everything that's

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.450
not related to kitchens
or coffee makers,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.040
and get a performance that way.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.550
Finally, the fact that
you can use simply

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.730
a camera instead of a
complicated laser scanner

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.460
means that this is a lot cheaper
and more accessible for robots

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.970
to have.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.800
So we've talked about what
semantic information is.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.370
So now let's define what
semantic localization is.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.770
So basically, it's
localizing based

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.680
on semantic information rather
than metric information,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.630
like distances.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.779
So for our Grand
Challenge, we have a map

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.760
with labeled objects
and their coordinates.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.220
This is our semantic
information.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.100
And we want to basically look
around and say, what can we

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.300
see in our field of view?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.860
And from that, we
want to figure out

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.260
where could we be on this map.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.590
And it's important to note
that map building is actually

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.740
a very different and
hard problem with a lot

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.820
of other research on it.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.860
In our case, we've
been given a map,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.680
and we're simply talking about
the problem of localizing

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.440
based on that map.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.350
And now I'm going
to let Matt tell you

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.100
about particle filters, which is
an algorithm for localization.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.240
MATT: All right, so
my name is Matt Deyo.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.448
Now we're going to talk
about particle filters.

00:04:56.448 --> 00:04:57.864
So this is a tool
that we're going

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.740
to teach you to
use, specifically

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.370
for state estimation, using the
given math and measurements.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.810
So what is localization?

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.850
We just went over it.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.390
Specifically, it's the
question of, where am I?

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.990
For any system to
work, the robot

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.010
needs to know where
it is on a map.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.830
This is not so
simple of an answer.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.030
Metric localization.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.340
As was said before,
it is quantitative.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.460
So how many meters are you from
this wall or from your origin?

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.628
What's your
orientation in degrees?

00:05:31.628 --> 00:05:33.887
And here's some
examples of that.

00:05:33.887 --> 00:05:35.595
You can convert between
coordinate frames

00:05:35.595 --> 00:05:36.970
really easily if
you have metric.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.640
So the localization is, well,
in our case, mathematical.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.990
The problem statement
is, you have a control u.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.070
You're going to observe
something about your state.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.290
It might be a camera image.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.730
It might be laser scans.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.320
And then essentially
on your map,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.820
you're going to use probability
to figure out where you are.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.990
So this equation specifically
is taking into account

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.120
the probability of being out of
position at your current time

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.517
based off your previous
position, the observation

00:06:15.517 --> 00:06:17.225
that you're taking
right now, the command

00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:21.360
variable you gave it, and
then your map, like I said.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.230
So that's built on the
observation noise, actuation,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.064
and then the belief.

00:06:26.064 --> 00:06:27.730
We're specifically
looking at the belief

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.110
here for the particle filter.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.960
So in our case, we're
approximating it

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.800
by several points, also
known as particles.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.280
So we're going to look
at an example here.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.400
I have to actually
press the Play button.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.594
OK.

00:06:46.594 --> 00:06:47.578
Here's a quick demo.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.662
So a quick YouTube demo of
a particle filter in action.

00:06:59.662 --> 00:07:01.120
So I'm just going
to show it first.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.130
So pause.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.310
The red dot here is our
actual robot position.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.270
And it's trying to
localize itself in a maze.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.670
There's black walls
throughout here.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.470
And it looks like a grid world,
but that initial distribution

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.840
we had was completely
random across all the walls.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.640
So it's taking in observations
of probably laser range

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.460
finders.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.830
So it essentially knows that
there are walls around it,

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.960
and it knows that there's
not a wall in front of it.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.940
So that centers all
of these guesses

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.590
on the center of hallways.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.220
Obvious it got rid of things
that were close to the walls.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.354
There's a low probability that
it's right up against the wall

00:07:49.354 --> 00:07:51.020
because of the
observations it's taking.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.055
And we're going to
revisit this example

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:55.360
at the end of the presentation.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.120
Particle filters.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.410
So the method that
we're going to teach you

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.090
has four easy steps.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.040
One is not repeated.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.250
So the initial step is your
first sample of particles.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.540
If you don't know anything
about your state at the start,

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.330
then you can sample
just a distribution

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.361
of your entire space.

00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:16.115
And then the repeated steps are
updating weights, resampling,

00:08:16.115 --> 00:08:17.550
and then propagating dynamics.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.290
So we're going to show
you a toy example.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.270
This is a really simple example
just to get the idea across.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.130
We're focusing on
just one dimension.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.300
We have an aircraft
at constant altitude.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.990
So take that variable out.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.080
The only thing we're
trying to localize to

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.380
is a distance x over a map.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.659
The sensor is just
a range finder down

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.360
to the ground at this
constant altitude.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.040
And then the math
is a known mapping

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.750
of x location to
ground altitudes.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.400
And we're about to
see what that means.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.400
The goal here is determining
where you are in the mountains.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.400
So here we have our plane.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.590
As you see, we
know the map below,

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.450
and we know that it has to
be flying at this altitude.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.830
So with a range finder, you can
measure different depths down

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:04.940
to the mountain.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.990
So here we have long
distances, a medium distance,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.150
and a short distance if it's
directly on top of a mountain.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.380
Constant altitude, unknown x.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.690
That's what we're solving for.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.070
And then we actually have
a noisy velocity forward.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.570
So we know how fast the plane
wants to be traveling in this

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.700
direction, but obviously
with some noise,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.430
it could be travelling a little
faster or a little slower.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.390
So the first step, sampling.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.810
Our initial belief
here is that we

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.476
don't know where it is with
respect to these mountains.

00:09:32.476 --> 00:09:33.850
So we're going to
actually sample

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.700
with a uniform distribution.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.930
Well, this is as uniform
as I could get it.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:42.500
So over this range, those
were our initial particles.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.482
Essentially guesses for
what the x location is.

00:09:45.482 --> 00:09:46.940
We're going to
update these weights

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.390
based on the observation.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.290
So we get our first observation
from our range finder,

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.370
and it's this length.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.670
So it's a long length.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.140
It's, I guess,
green in this case.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.857
This is our measured value.

00:09:58.857 --> 00:10:00.440
Here are all the
values that we expect

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.523
to see at these particles.

00:10:01.523 --> 00:10:04.370
So this is pretty easy to
calculate, based on the map

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.350
that you have.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.340
The position of each
particle maps directly

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:12.410
to a range finder measurement.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.710
So we're going to compare them.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.060
So the likelihood
of getting these.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.639
So measuring the likelihood
of each of these occurring.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.430
And we're actually
weighting the particles.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:26.530
So based on what we measured,
these are most likely,

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.250
so they get a larger weight.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.790
And we are most
likely not on top

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.630
of a mountain at this point.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.600
So those get smaller weights.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.240
So we're going to
resample, given that.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.610
So we're going keep the
same number of samples

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.290
the entire time.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.880
That's just how this
particle filter works.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.800
Except we're going to resample
across our new distribution.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.597
So these are the weights
that we just came up with.

00:10:52.597 --> 00:10:54.180
And we're going to
resample over them.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.600
So now it's more
likely that it's here,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.370
or here, or way over there.

00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:03.220
And then the final
step is propagating.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.370
So this whole time that we've
been filtering and updating

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.820
our weights, the way forward.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.410
So we need to take
that into account.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.370
So we have a forward velocity.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.250
Let's say this range
is 0 meters per second,

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.996
to 5 meters per second,
to 10 meters per second

00:11:19.996 --> 00:11:21.245
that you can see on this plot.

00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:24.780
So we're most likely moving
five meters per second.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.360
So essentially,
this is your change

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.050
in time between
sensor measurements.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.410
Obviously if you're only
getting sensor measurements

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.440
at 10 hertz, then
you can propagate

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.240
in between each of those.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.880
So here we are.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.450
Using our new sample particles,
propagating them forward.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.110
For example, this one moving
there is a low likelihood.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.400
That's a large distance.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.380
And these moving at
a shorter distance

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.340
is more likely, given our model.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.590
So we have those new ones.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.855
The new weights are now based
in the probability of it

00:11:57.855 --> 00:11:59.400
transitioning to that point.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.500
How likely is it for the plane
to move that far, essentially.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.180
And then we repeat.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.641
So we're repeating
the steps again.

00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:08.057
We're going to get a measurement
in from our range finder.

00:12:08.057 --> 00:12:11.880
We're going to compare it to
the map, to our particles,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.240
keep the ones that are most
likely and weight them more,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.910
and then propagate them.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.200
So as an example,
here's time step 2,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.530
when we're measuring the
uphill of this mountain.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.620
Time step 3, now we're
halfway up the mountain.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.420
So positions that we've
kept are at similar heights,

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.880
so here and here.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.130
And then we can slowly get
down to differentiating it.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.040
So now that we're on top of a
mountain, the only pattern that

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.370
matches that is here,
and maybe over there.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.810
And then eventually, we
get down to these two.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.030
And then eventually, as
this mountain drops off,

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.910
it's a unique position, where it
goes farther than that one did.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.820
So in the end, our
particle filter

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.075
thinks that we're right
around here or here.

00:12:57.075 --> 00:12:58.980
And finally, there's
a pretty high chance

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.510
that we're over that valley.

00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:05.250
So we'll looking at
this, again, now that you

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.333
know how to do the filter.

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.600
And this will make a
little more sense now.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.050
So they started with the
uniform distribution.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.795
They had no clue where
they were at the beginning.

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:20.830
And as the robot moves
forward, they are resampling.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.000
And the measurements
are changing, obviously.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.610
Because it's seeing
these two walls,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.400
and eventually, it sees that
there's doorway to the left.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.410
And you can keep
going forward as well.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.940
So eventually, that
geometry doesn't line up

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.820
with any other spot on the map.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.630
Here, we see it nose
into this hallway.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.780
I think this top
hallway is the only one

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.590
on this map that's that long.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.790
But it still don't know
which direction it's going.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.980
It hasn't been able to
differentiate that yet,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.760
but it's about to.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.790
So the only remaining
particles are here and here.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.730
It knows it's in the
middle of a hallway.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:59.200
And it knows it's moved about
two blocks now without seeing

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.590
a wall directly in
front of it, which

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.430
that doesn't occur
anywhere else,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.970
without having another turn-off.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.008
So it's about to solve itself.

00:14:11.008 --> 00:14:15.189
Because eventually, it
sees this wall over here.

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:16.730
And those observations
don't match up

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.360
with what it's actually seeing.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.290
So there we go.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:25.030
There's a [INAUDIBLE] particle
filter successfully working

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.376
for a little robot
with a rangefinder.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.599
I went too far.

00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:37.565
There we go.

00:14:38.882 --> 00:14:40.340
DAVID STINGLEY:
I'm David Stingley.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.570
And now, after we've
gotten an idea of why

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.720
we want to use
semantic localization,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.720
and how to use particle filters
to get an idea of our guesses

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.190
for initial
positions, we're going

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.130
to talk about how we can use
these two to actually implement

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.010
semantic localization
onto a robot.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.260
So hearkening back to
the implementation idea,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.680
we have three important parts.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.290
We have a belief representation.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.860
We have the actuation model.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.310
So once we have a location,
how are we going to move?

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.080
As we said before,
if you don't exactly

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.580
know how fast you're
moving, there's

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.710
a probability you move to a
bunch of different locations.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.955
And then finally, we have
an observation model,

00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:17.330
which is the
probability that you

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.940
see some certain observation,
given you're in this newly

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.310
simulated position.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.960
If we continuously solve
for our most probable x,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.490
then that's our location.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.600
So that particle that
is the most probable

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.937
is the place that we
guess we're going to be.

00:15:32.937 --> 00:15:34.520
So let's look at a
pseudocode for what

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.186
a semantic localization
would look like.

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.240
So as long as our
robot is moving,

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.130
we're going to
make observations.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.670
And those observations are
going to be [INAUDIBLE] z1.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.633
Then for those
observations, we're

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:47.480
going to start off
our particle filter

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.690
and guess a certain number
of probable locations.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.830
We're going to use our
actuation to update it.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.680
And then we're going to simulate
observations at that location,

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.510
and compare what
we expect to see

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.630
for that particle on our map
versus what we actually saw

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.000
that we made our observation.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.380
This is going to be our update.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.300
And this is what we're going
to focus on understanding,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.633
since a lot of the rest of
this is covered by a particle

00:16:10.633 --> 00:16:12.830
filter.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.424
So what kind of
models can we pick,

00:16:15.424 --> 00:16:17.840
because we need to define what
our observation looks like.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.280
And you get a lot of choices.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.900
In metric localization, you'd
use a labelled laser scan.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.520
You'd have perfect information
about the environment.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.330
And so you can see everything.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.080
It might be nice to
use a scene of objects

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.080
at specific locations, but
that requires once again,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.219
a lot of information.

00:16:34.219 --> 00:16:36.010
Now you need to know
where the objects are.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.455
You need to have an idea of
its exact specific locations

00:16:39.455 --> 00:16:41.450
and orientations with
respect each other.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.230
Maybe it might be nice just
use, like, a bag of objects.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.460
I see four things in my
view pane versus three.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.960
These are all choices, and
we're going to take a look just

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.939
really quickly at what
the facts of these are.

00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:55.480
As we've stated
before, there's a lot

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.580
of choices in observation.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.280
It can get complicated
really quickly.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.920
So just to impress
that upon you,

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.760
imagine if you
used laser scanners

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.800
when you have three
objects here--

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.089
for instance, a house, a
couple of trees, and a mailbox.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.400
You check each line
for an intersection.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.250
And then you have to figure out
what counts as your detection,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.200
since you're going to
have to differentiate

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.720
what's in your scene.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.160
The problem with
that might be is

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.800
that, well, you saw an
entire wall, for instance.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.880
Where do you want
the house to be?

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.720
So let's say we
assume that objects

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.222
were a point at some point.

00:17:28.222 --> 00:17:30.430
You either completely see
it or you completely don't.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.980
That way, you don't have
to half-see an object.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.570
You just check to
see if whatever

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.010
you want your
center of mass to be

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.590
intersects with your
current view plane.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.020
If it does, then you're good.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.240
The issue with that
is that, for instance,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.180
something center of view isn't
inside the scene anymore,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.650
you just completely ignore it.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.615
We have the exact
opposite problem.

00:17:50.615 --> 00:17:52.750
So you might want to make
it a bit more complex

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.025
and have polygons,
parts of objects.

00:17:55.025 --> 00:17:57.910
Do you see some
percentage of something?

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.800
How much of it is
in the view plane?

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.260
It adds in a lot of
chance for errors.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.710
And that's, I guess, the
big point here to remember,

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.210
is that depending on how we
characterize our observations,

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.280
we have different ways
to get things wrong.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.570
So let's say, for instance, for
an observation like distance

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.610
and bearing to some new scenic
object, what can be wrong?

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.140
Well, you have noise
inside of your sensors.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.640
Your sensors might
have limitations.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.874
You can't necessarily
see to infinity.

00:18:25.874 --> 00:18:27.290
So an object might
be too far away

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.970
for you to identify correctly.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.370
It might be rotated in a way
that you can't necessarily

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.154
interpret it correctly.

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.570
How about if you want to have
your observations in classes

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.530
of objects, so of
just everything

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.620
being an obstruction, now
you have different types

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.400
of obstructions?

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.960
Trees are different
from mailboxes,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.640
of course, in which case you
have a classification error.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.210
What if you see a
tree and you just

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.157
think it's a really, really big
mailbox, or you see a mailbox

00:18:50.157 --> 00:18:51.740
and you think it's
a really small tree

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.520
with a funny, little, metal top?

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.970
These kind of
errors can then make

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.590
your scenes look incorrect.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.450
If you decide to have
sets of objects, well,

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.680
what permutations matter?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.040
If you don't have a way of
differentiating elements

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.659
in the set, then you don't
know if two trees and a mailbox

00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:08.950
with the trees on the left
and the mailbox on the right

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.570
or vice versa aren't
the same thing?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.040
So with that in
mind, we're going

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.780
to be talking about
how we're going

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.500
to solve this question
of given some position

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.900
and your synthetic
view, how likely

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.997
is it that it's your
actual observation?

00:19:25.997 --> 00:19:28.580
And for that, we're just going
to change what this probability

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.730
statement looks like to make
it a little more concrete.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.540
In this case, Z is the set of
observed objects that you have.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.210
So we're going to say that
there are objects in the scene,

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.300
and we put them inside
of this value, Z.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.940
So for instance, you see a
house and you see a mailbox.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.580
That would be Z. Your set of
objects is just two things.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.150
We're going to use the bag
of objects approximation.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.880
Y of x is going to
be the set of objects

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.401
you expect to see given your
map for the position that you're

00:19:56.401 --> 00:19:56.900
at.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.709
So given a position X,
Y is a set of objects

00:19:59.709 --> 00:20:00.500
that you would see.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.125
So you might be in
a position where you

00:20:02.125 --> 00:20:03.720
can see a house and a mailbox.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.304
Then Y is is a
house and a mailbox.

00:20:06.304 --> 00:20:07.970
And X is just going
to be your position.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.261
That's the element that we're
getting from our particle

00:20:10.261 --> 00:20:11.880
filter.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.480
So in our example,
as you can tell

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.247
by how much I talk
about it, we're

00:20:16.247 --> 00:20:18.330
going to use just two
things, trees and mailboxes,

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.530
because I like them.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.850
So here's my map.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.220
There's going to be a long
road, and off to the side,

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.418
we have trees and mailboxes.

00:20:26.418 --> 00:20:27.876
And let's say that
your robot wants

00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:29.610
to be a paper delivery boy.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.210
So he needs to be able to figure
out where the mailboxes are

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.800
and how far down
the street he is.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.750
Because if he were to
throw the paper wrong,

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.940
he'd throw a paper into a tree.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.440
So in this world, our robot is
going to be here, represented

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.950
by an orange hexagon.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.530
And it has this field of view.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.510
So given this field of
view, what does Z look like,

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:53.850
our actual observation,
one tree and one mailbox?

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.305
Well, for this case, what
we're going to say is,

00:20:56.305 --> 00:20:58.430
we're assuming that as long
as the thing intersects

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.980
with our field of view,
we're going to see it.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.332
So simple finding that.

00:21:02.332 --> 00:21:03.790
We're just going
to say that we see

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.660
both trees and this mailbox.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.570
Once again, we talked
about how difficult

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.870
it is to do this observation.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.210
So for a simplifying assumption,
let's say that we just

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.360
completely see the tree.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.320
So that's great for our
actual robot position.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.127
But when we start
spawning particles,

00:21:20.127 --> 00:21:21.710
we need to figure
out what we're going

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.940
to say they synthetically do.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.325
So say we spawn a particle
here, and we spawn one

00:21:27.325 --> 00:21:28.960
when we're just
slightly off the road.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.001
We deviated a little bit.

00:21:30.001 --> 00:21:32.210
We're further forward
than the actual position.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.870
We drove into somebody's
house, another guy's house

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.170
in the woods.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.250
Then what is each of synthetic
observations for these given

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.390
points?

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.806
Determining this is going to
determine how we actually get

00:21:43.806 --> 00:21:46.050
that probability calculation.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.410
So what do we need
to consider here?

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:51.620
Well, the first thing we need
to consider is classification.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.337
Like we said before, with this
set of objects approximation,

00:21:54.337 --> 00:21:56.420
it's important that you
understand if you classify

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.880
things correctly or not.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.060
Past that, like we
asked before, we said,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.140
wait, why didn't I just
see a tree and a mailbox?

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.890
Well, we need to know
if we saw everything

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.430
inside of our field of view.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.900
Maybe we did miss something.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.960
Maybe instead that old
scene saw just one tree,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.020
one mailbox, even though the
other tree intersected it.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.560
And noise can happen in reverse,
so we could accidentally

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.650
see a tree when there
actually isn't one.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.700
And finally, we could
see things overlap.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.220
We kind of ignored this before,
but what if two trees were

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.480
right on top of each other?

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.080
It might make it
kind of difficult

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.120
for you to successfully
see that there are

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.910
two trees there instead of one.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:38.340
So to start with, we're going
to strike this assumption.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.300
It will become more evident
later why this is important.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.010
But for now, we're
just going to assume

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.610
that every observation
corresponds

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.160
to only one object being seen.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.770
Otherwise, you could
end up infinitely

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.040
expanding your scene.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.880
Think about it.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.776
You see a tree.

00:22:53.776 --> 00:22:56.150
There might be a possibility
that that tree is two trees.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:57.750
Well, you saw two trees, then.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.240
So maybe there's a probability
that each of those two trees

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.860
is also two trees.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.450
And you keep going
and keep going,

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.094
until the entire forest
is behind one tree.

00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:08.510
It would be kind of bad for
doing probability calculation,

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:11.009
because you'd eventually have
to cut that off at some point,

00:23:11.009 --> 00:23:13.329
so that your algorithm
actually finishes.

00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:14.870
So for our purposes,
we're just going

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.411
to cut it off at the start and
say that everything's just one

00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:17.920
object.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.210
It's just error.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.760
So now we need to talk about
if we classify it correctly.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.840
If we can solve this
equation, what's

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.490
the probability that our
classification is right?

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.430
So for now, we're going to make
two simplifying assumptions.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.700
They're going to remove the two
problems that we had before.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.590
And don't worry, we'll
relax them later.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.240
For our first
assumption, we're going

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.916
to assume that we see everything
inside of our field of view.

00:23:40.916 --> 00:23:43.550
So that means we're not going
to have any misconceptions.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.930
And we never see something
that doesn't exist.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.644
So we have no false detections.

00:23:47.644 --> 00:23:49.810
Everything that's in the
scene, we see successfully.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.640
If it's not in the
scene, we don't see it.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.700
So given that, and we
spawn a robot here,

00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.240
and it has this field of view,
What does this robot see?

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.530
AUDIENCE: Three trees.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:02.810
DAVID STINGLEY: Yes.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.500
It happens to see three trees.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.470
So remember our assumptions.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.380
We're going to say here that our
actual observation for wherever

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.790
our robot is is one
mailbox, and two trees.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.980
And we can see that the
synthetic robot that we made

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.810
saw three trees.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.360
So what are some
other forms of Y

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.760
that we can make that
would also map to this?

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.570
What's the way that we can
take our Y and transform it

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.320
so that it maps this Z?

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.070
What kind of action would
we have to take on this?

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.320
If you were thinking that
we'd have to misclassify one

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.780
of these trees, you're correct.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.169
And remember, this is
just a set of objects.

00:24:41.169 --> 00:24:43.085
So this doesn't have to
be the first tree that

00:24:43.085 --> 00:24:44.150
got misclassified.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.220
There's three of them.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.500
We could have any permutation of
these trees get misclassified.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.500
So it becomes important.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.270
And we're going to
introduce this concept

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.050
of this operator, phi.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.820
And what phi is
going to do is it's

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.870
going to be a way to map the
permutations that we could have

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.520
of misclassifications for
Y to look like Z. That way,

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.520
we don't have to try and write
all the permutations down.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.040
It's possible to do this
essentially with a matrix,

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.000
like a permutation
matrix, that just reorders

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.280
the elements that you have.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.650
So what does this
probability look like now?

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.200
We're going to use the
lower case z, y and i

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.770
to represent each individual
element of those sets.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:29.945
So for some element in
the actual observation, z,

00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:31.870
what's the probability
that some element

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.360
in our synthetic
observation matches it?

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.676
Well, for that we
need to pick-- well,

00:25:37.676 --> 00:25:39.050
there's some
probability of being

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:42.480
wrong or a misclassifying,
or classifying correctly.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.530
So we're going to use c to
represent a classification

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.040
matrix.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.700
So there's some probability
that we classify correctly,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.470
usually a higher probability,
and then some small probability

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.900
that an object becomes
another type of object.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.160
So how often we misclassify
is represented here.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.870
But we could add another term.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.090
Let's say that our
classification engine gave

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.160
the weighted values of things.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.910
It's common for neural nets
and other types of systems

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.740
that observe images to
kind of give weights

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.280
to their classification.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.510
So you might want to use
those weights to represent

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.450
our confidence.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.870
And there's a problem
that that confidence

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.130
determines that our
classification might just

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.210
be wrong out the get-go.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.710
In that case, we
want to know what's

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.370
the probably that the
score is likely to be

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.690
that type of object.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.700
And then we could
have other things.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.740
For instance, let's say
that our classification

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.586
was way better at identifying
mailboxes from the front.

00:26:33.586 --> 00:26:35.210
And if we turn the
mailbox to the side,

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.021
it gives poor observations.

00:26:37.021 --> 00:26:39.020
And it tells us if it
thinks that the mailbox is

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.210
on the side, so it
doesn't really know.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.040
In that case, maybe
having the bearing

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.930
of the object inside
of our synthetic view

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.210
allows us to determine
another probability

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.286
for misclassification.

00:26:49.286 --> 00:26:51.590
The important thing
to notice here

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.380
is that we can keep
adding more terms to this.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.630
The more specific your
classification can get,

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.610
the more terms you
can introduce into it.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.640
So add some confusion to it,
and make the probabilities

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.660
of misclassification smaller,
and smaller, and smaller.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.300
So with that in
mind, we're going

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.620
to look at what the probability
for these entire sets

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.500
is going to look like.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.000
And what is really
is going to be is

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.140
it's just going to be a product
over all these classifications

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.237
for some selection of phi.

00:27:20.237 --> 00:27:22.820
So you're going to have to take
all the different permutations

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.455
that you could possibly
have, and for each of them,

00:27:25.455 --> 00:27:27.580
you're going to multiply
all of these probabilities

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.380
by each other.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.570
In the end, it's going to give
you that entire probability.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.740
So it's all the
permutations that you have,

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.760
and then just the probability
of each of those objects being

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.410
classified as that
type-- that you just

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.720
map one set to the other set.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.600
So now let's take a
look at another scene.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.720
So we spawned a particle
above, fake robot here.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.510
And it has this field of view.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.790
What does this field
of view look like?

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:55.970
If you said it looked like
two mailboxes and two trees,

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:56.512
you're right.

00:27:56.512 --> 00:27:58.219
And so we're going to
assume that we have

00:27:58.219 --> 00:27:59.640
the same actual observation.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.250
We still see a
mailbox and two trees.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.330
And we're going to remove
our old assumption.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.280
We're going to say that
it might be possible

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.180
that we don't see everything
in a synthetic robot's field.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.100
In which case, how can we amp
this synthetic observation

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.570
to the actual observation?

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.130
Well, we just add
in a probability

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.050
that we miss
identifying an object.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.925
If we just didn't see
one of these mailboxes,

00:28:22.925 --> 00:28:26.240
it looks exactly like this.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.780
So for that, we want to capture
what's the probability that we

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.560
see nothing?

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.060
So say we have a synthetic view
with some number of objects.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.590
What's the probability
we just miss all of them?

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.790
So the probability that
we miss all of them,

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.350
we're going add an
assumption here,

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.433
which is that we're going
to say that there exists

00:28:44.433 --> 00:28:47.230
some probability that we
see an object for a given

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:51.470
synthetic view here, and that we
don't see it with a probability

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.612
one minus that probability.

00:28:52.612 --> 00:28:54.320
So essentially, there's
just two states--

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.030
either we see the object
or we don't see the object.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.640
And we're going to say that
probability of identifying

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.230
objects is independent.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.930
So if we see one
object, then that

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.870
does not change our chance
of seeing the next object.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.750
Both of these assumptions
help simplify the math here.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.130
In reality, these might
be strongly interlinked.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.620
For instance, if your
robot's camera is broken,

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.246
the probability that
it doesn't see one

00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:20.203
object directly correlates
with the other ones,

00:29:20.203 --> 00:29:21.860
because it won't see
any of the objects

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.290
successfully if it has
no camera any more.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.030
If your robot
drives into a wall,

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.196
and can't see anything
because it's staring straight

00:29:28.196 --> 00:29:30.380
at the wall, the same
kind of idea holds.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.800
But for the purposes
of making it

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.350
so that you don't have
a lot of covariances,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:35.420
and a really, really big
conditional statement

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.970
of a lot of probabilities
of seeing things,

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:42.250
we make these assumptions for
our items to be independent.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.450
Independence means we can
multiply our probability

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.780
successfully.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.990
So if we just don't want
to see any of the objects,

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.495
we just take 1 minus
the probability

00:29:49.495 --> 00:29:52.080
of seeing the object for all
the objects in the scene.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:30:00.476
So what goes hand-in-hand
with not seeing anything?

00:30:00.476 --> 00:30:02.630
Think about if you
had a robot far off

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:03.965
in the distance over here.

00:30:03.965 --> 00:30:05.480
What can it see?

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.100
Just two trees.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.370
So now, we're going to
remove the idea that we can't

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.420
see things that don't exist.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.230
So to make two trees map
to two trees and a mailbox,

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:19.120
we just made up a
mailbox of some noise.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.720
So what's the probability
that we see a full scene

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.444
when we can't see anything?

00:30:23.444 --> 00:30:25.860
And if you're thinking it's
going to map to a very similar

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.765
formula, you're kind of right.

00:30:27.765 --> 00:30:30.670
But we need to figure out a way
to capture our noise statement.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.840
Specifically, we are
going to use noise

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.440
as a Poisson variable, which
means that there's always

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.610
some probability of seeing
an object out of nothing.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.030
And it's going to be coordinated
and according to this factor Kz

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.680
we'll get to on the next slide.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.260
You could choose a lot
of different things

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.680
to represent your
noise in this case.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.240
A Poisson variable was just
chosen by the specific method

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.809
that we used and implemented
from another paper.

00:30:54.809 --> 00:30:56.350
But with testing,
you could find that

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.170
different potential
distributions

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:02.170
map to your noise for your
particular sensor better.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.239
So with a Poisson variable,
what we're going to have is

00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:07.030
we're just going to
have the product of all

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:11.850
of our Poisson variables times
this Kz factor for the given

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.354
scene that we want to map to.

00:31:13.354 --> 00:31:14.770
Essentially, it's
just the product

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.600
of all these independent
Poisson variables

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:21.650
for each of our different
objects that we want to create.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:25.120
So with that in mind, what's
this Kz factor that we're

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.205
multiplying everything by?

00:31:27.205 --> 00:31:28.580
What it's actually
going to be is

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.799
it's going to be a set
of uniform distributions.

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:33.340
These uniform
distributions are going

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.100
to be uniform over all the
classifications we could get

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.415
for an object we spawned
from the noise, and all

00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:43.120
the possible scores, and
all these possible bearings

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.390
for this synthetic object.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.400
And if you remember a few slides
ago or you rewind the video,

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.790
you'll notice that these map
directly to the categories

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.950
that we put into that
classification engine.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:54.940
In fact, they should.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.340
So if you added more
things or took them out,

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.740
you changed this
uniform distribution.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.810
The idea is that when
you synthetically

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.280
create an object
out of noise, you

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.310
might get any of those
types of objects.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.990
But if you needed to create a
tree synthetically from seeing

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.100
it in the noise,
you might get a tree

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.650
or you might get a mailbox.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.275
Either one of them
might show up.

00:32:15.275 --> 00:32:17.560
If you had a different
or more intelligent

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.520
distribution for how you
might misclassify things--

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.200
for instance, let's say your
noise, whenever it shows up,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.030
always identifies trees.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.560
Whenever you accidentally
see noise as an object,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.672
it's always a tree.

00:32:28.672 --> 00:32:31.255
Then you might only want to have
a probability of seeing trees

00:32:31.255 --> 00:32:33.977
over here, and it would
change you distribution.

00:32:33.977 --> 00:32:35.560
But for simplicity's
sake, we're going

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.720
to assume that it's
equally probable

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.230
that any type of object
shows up out of noise.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.600
So now, we're going to put
it all together, since we

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.200
relaxed our assumptions.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.090
So we have a lot
of different things

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:52.090
that can potentially map
to this actual scene.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.360
We have scenes
that lack objects.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.920
We have scenes that lack
objects and therefore,

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.100
need to add the object in.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.030
And when they lack objects
and have to add the object in,

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.100
there's a chance they add
in a different object.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.510
And then maybe, they just
misclassify something,

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.830
like our misclassification idea.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.100
But wait-- I guess we can
make this more complicated.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.370
What if one of them
just wasn't seen,

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:17.470
so we'd take one of these out?

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.760
And then we just see
two things from noise.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.662
As you could see, these keep
getting more complicated.

00:33:23.662 --> 00:33:26.120
But if you think about it, with
our previous probabilities,

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.940
is every single one
of these is going

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.440
to add a lot of
probability terms

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.590
to be multiplied by each other.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.720
You can keep getting as
complicated as you want it to.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.570
If we removed our
first assumption,

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.540
we'd be adding in
probabilities of two objects

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.195
becoming one object.

00:33:41.195 --> 00:33:43.510
The idea is like
higher power terms when

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.310
you're doing approximations.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.100
The goal is to make sure
that any particle you spawn

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.160
could potentially be what
you've actually seen.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.700
But we want the ones that are
very low probability to really

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.649
be very low probability.

00:33:56.649 --> 00:33:58.690
So we make sure that these
incredibly complicated

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:02.070
transformations are going to be
so insignificant that they'll

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.880
usually return to almost 0.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.690
So if we wanted
to solve this, we

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.100
need to start by using a
little assumption, which

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.280
is the fact that we now
have to fold in the idea

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.020
that we could have
some missed detection

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.690
and some false detections.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.570
So false detections
would increase the number

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.570
of objects we've seen
over the number of objects

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.537
that are actually presence.

00:34:23.537 --> 00:34:25.870
And missed detections would
reduce the number of objects

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:26.956
that are actually present.

00:34:26.956 --> 00:34:28.330
Notice that this
always has to be

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.429
same size as the number
of expected objects,

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:33.370
because you're trying to map
whatever your synthetic scene

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:37.060
is to the actual thing
that you observe.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.060
When you do this, it really
turns into a large number

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.320
of multiplications.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.270
So this should look familiar.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.940
This is our term for
successfully classifying

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.514
all of our objects,
and we're going

00:34:47.514 --> 00:34:48.889
to multiply it by
the probability

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:52.544
that we actually identify it,
since we could now miss things.

00:34:52.544 --> 00:34:54.699
Then, we have to multiply
that by the probability

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:56.770
that for whatever
objects we didn't see,

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.630
that we actually missed them.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.234
And then finally, we
have to add in the noise,

00:35:02.234 --> 00:35:04.150
because the noise is
going to make the objects

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.700
that we're missing
show up, so that we

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.370
have a classification of
the same size as the thing

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:10.870
that we want to see.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:14.470
Now, one thing you should note
is that we added in phi way

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.110
down here at Kz.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:19.720
That's because we have to map
these false detections that

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.900
added to the number of
objects that we could see,

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.850
as well as the
actual detections.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.460
Essentially, we have to
take all the objects that

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.440
are seen here, real
or not, and map them

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.245
to all the objects
we expect to see,

00:35:30.245 --> 00:35:31.870
because they're going
to be one to one.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.210
So let's take a look at a
little video that shows what

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.410
semantic localization can do.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.320
So in this video, for
a little heads up,

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.750
we have essentially
a scene where

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.270
they have mapped out two things
inside of a suburban area.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.910
They've mapped out
cars and windows

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.372
on the path of the robot as
it drives around an area.

00:35:53.372 --> 00:35:55.455
And they're attempting to
use just the information

00:35:55.455 --> 00:35:57.944
of the cars and windows
visible on the scene in order

00:35:57.944 --> 00:35:59.860
to localize where they
believe the robot to be

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.018
during its journey.

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:04.160
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.750
- This is a video
extension to the paper--

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.496
DAVID STINGLEY: So
going to mute that.

00:36:08.496 --> 00:36:10.170
It's on.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:15.230
So this is a few steps
into the process.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:17.180
And then it resets.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.080
It's spawn a number of points
for potential locations.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.330
And then it very quickly
localizes and finds

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:24.350
its spectacular rotation.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.820
These are all the
identifications

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.070
that are happening
inside of the scene.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.420
You can see the boundary
boxes for cars and windows

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.220
showing up, the cars in red,
and the windows in green.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.300
It expands out its
distribution of particles.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.950
And then shortly
thereafter, it gets

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.050
a couple of approximations.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.420
And then it settles
in on a location.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.150
It happens to use a kind of like
a centralized weight for where

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.810
it is for the set of particles,
and then it draws the car

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.170
as being in that location.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:50.224
If you let it keep
running, it occasionally

00:36:50.224 --> 00:36:51.890
expands back out to
make sure it doesn't

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.530
fall into a local minima, and
then compresses once again

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.690
to where its
strongest belief is.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.270
Notice that it has
a couple of seconds

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:02.060
of having a very, very spread
distribution, and very quickly

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.980
converges into a singular point.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.200
That's because a lot
of these locations

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.830
become very, very
low probability

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.070
after you've seen a couple
of scenes into the future.

00:37:13.255 --> 00:37:14.997
And we're going to pause this.

00:37:14.997 --> 00:37:15.580
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.100
I welcome you to go see
the video, to see the video

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.640
yourself if you want to.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.720
You can check the title.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.220
It's pretty easy
to find on YouTube,

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.093
because it's pretty
much the only one.

00:37:25.093 --> 00:37:27.710
So hopefully, it works now.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.720
Step back over here
to the other side.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.480
So why would
semantic localization

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.210
be useful in this manner?

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.440
In the example that was
shown, it was kind of

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.090
done on post-processed data.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:38.020
They took a scene.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.540
They drove around it already.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.740
Then they did the identification
on the video feed,

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:45.210
and used that to
do a localization.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.540
We talked about before.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.270
But people kind of use sparse
information to do a lot

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.527
of their-- or if you
can't walk into a room--

00:37:51.527 --> 00:37:53.860
people don't walk into a room
and produce an exact laser

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.840
scanned map of the
entire area themselves.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.220
But they can store
important information,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.750
like seeing objects
and tables that they

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:05.960
find with their shins, and
use those to move around.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.089
Robots store that perfect map,
if they can manage to make it.

00:38:09.089 --> 00:38:11.380
But they don't really have
a good understanding of what

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.990
that map might mean to a human.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.860
So that means that we're
actually kind of like better

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.970
at doing tasks with
the environment.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.929
If we wanted to go
directly to a location,

00:38:20.929 --> 00:38:22.720
we don't have to look
around and figure out

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.230
on a wall what our
distance from the wall

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:27.832
is before we can then
localize and move ourselves

00:38:27.832 --> 00:38:28.790
back over to the table.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:30.190
We just say, oh, I want
to go to the table.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.190
And you look over there.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.200
Oh, there's a table.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.000
Table, got it.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.610
So how can we make robots think
a little more like humans,

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.620
so it's easier for us to
give them instructions?

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.010
If we can make the
robot use a map that

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.960
has just scenic
objects like we use

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960
a map that just
has scenic objects,

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.990
then order to move
between scenic objects

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:50.590
are as simple as turning,
finding the object, and saying,

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.570
oh, well, I know
where the object is.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.210
So I know roughly
where I need to be.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.200
And then we start moving
in process towards it.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.756
In conclusion, semantic
localization has a lot of--

00:38:59.756 --> 00:39:01.506
I'm going to leave the
references slide up

00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:03.589
while I talk, so that if
you wanted to go and take

00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:05.960
a chance to see any of these
papers, you definitely can.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.870
Most of the work in this
slide comes directly

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.070
from these sources.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:12.070
Semantic localization
offers us the opportunity

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:16.820
to take robots, use sparser
information to potentially

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.540
localize, find ourselves
inside of spaces.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.270
It also gives us a chance to
have really tweakable factors

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:23.800
for how you might
understand where

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.220
you are in a space intuitively.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.970
If you think certain
things are important,

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.000
you can add them in as
probabilistic factors.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.970
If you don't, you remove
them just as well.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:33.552
Thank you.

00:39:33.552 --> 00:39:36.010
And this is essentially the
conclusion of our presentation.

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.920
I definitely recommend taking,
if you wanted to use something

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.815
like this, taking a look at
this particular paper here.

00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:46.969
Notice how it says, "via
the matrix permanent?"

00:39:46.969 --> 00:39:48.760
As I said before, a
lot of these operations

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.120
are a series of multiplications
and some permutations.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.940
There's permutation matrices.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.820
There's matrix multiplication.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.280
And there's a lot of ways to
make matrix multiplication

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.480
faster.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.889
This paper details how
you can take the math that

00:40:00.889 --> 00:40:02.680
was shown before that's
pretty inefficient,

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.304
and turn it into
something that you can

00:40:04.304 --> 00:40:07.270
do an estimate of very quickly.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.920
[APPLAUSE]
