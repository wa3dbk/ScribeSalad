00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.760
RYAN ALEXANDER: All right, so
as this XKCD comic points out,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.990
in CS, it can be very
difficult to figure out

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.480
when something is
just really hard

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.200
or something is
virtually impossible.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.700
And until a couple
years ago, people

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.690
thought this idea of
image classification

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.840
would be something that was
closer to the impossible side.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.856
But with the advent of
deep learning typology,

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:43.147
we've made significant strides
in image classification,

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:45.475
and now the problem's
actually quite practical.

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:47.690
So today we'll be
going through how

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.310
the process of
image classification

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.351
with deep learning works.

00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:53.390
So we're first going to talk
about what deep learning is,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.170
and then we'll move into some of
the image processing techniques

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.749
that researchers use,
followed by the architecture

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.290
of the convolutional
neural networks,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.440
which will be the main
focus in our presentation.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.840
We'll also talk about
the training process,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.240
and then go through some
results and limitations of CNNs

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.400
and image classification.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.760
So what is deep learning?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.290
Well, the term is
particularly vague,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.530
and it's purposely so
for a couple of reasons.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.230
The first is mystery is
always good for marketing.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.030
But the second reason
is that deep learning

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.150
refers to a pretty wide range
of machine learning algorithms.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910
They do have some commonalities.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.850
They all seek to solve
problems of a complexity

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.840
that previously, people thought
only people could solve.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.504
So these are more sophisticated
classification problems

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:37.420
than traditional
conventional machine learning

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.800
algorithms can do.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.280
So how do they go
about doing this?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.120
Well, all of these
deep learning programs

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.950
tend to take all the
processes that need

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.430
to happen, and split them up.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.950
They've got different parts
of their program working

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.440
on different things, all
while performing calculations,

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.540
and then at the end,
it all comes together,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.240
and we get a result.
Of course, this

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.320
isn't unique to deep learning,
and lots of distributed systems

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.250
decentralize their calculations.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.980
But the key thing
about deep learning

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.310
is that every part is
performing these calculations.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.674
The calculations are
not simple calculations.

00:02:09.674 --> 00:02:11.840
They're not we'll do this
one simple operation over,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.570
and over again on a lot
of data, and then we'll

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.570
get a result at the end.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.960
Each part is performing some
particularly complicated

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.440
process on all the little parts
before they come together.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.470
So why is this
architecture a good idea?

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.360
Why did engineers
come up with this sort

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.190
of decentralized,
multi-layered complex process?

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.080
Well, we take the example
of image classification.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.030
It turns out that
the human brain

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.920
does a pretty similar process.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.470
So here's the human
visual system,

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.350
and it's pretty much a
hierarchical process.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.470
So you begin by
moving from the retina

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.917
into the first
areas of the brain,

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.500
and as the information
gets processed,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.625
it moves from one region
of the brain to the other,

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:54.170
and each spatial
element of your brain

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.880
is performing an entirely
different calculation.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.640
For example, the
v1 area over here

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.430
is picking out
edges and corners,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.800
and then over here, a
couple steps later in v4,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.360
you're starting to group
those figures together.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.000
And so the brain
kind of operates

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.330
in a way that is very similar to
the way these networks operate.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.780
So let's talk about
to classify a face.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.080
If I asked you guys how
would you classify a face,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.331
what is the first
thing you might do?

00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:22.580
Well, as I mentioned before,
the first thing out brain

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.350
does is it finds these edges.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.470
The first thing to do is
identify where the face

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.970
is versus everything else.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.890
Now, does anyone have
any idea as to what

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.150
we could with the next step?

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.720
Julian, you have an idea?

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.224
AUDIENCE: Maybe you could
group these edges together.

00:03:41.224 --> 00:03:42.140
RYAN ALEXANDER: Right.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.170
We could maybe identify
some of these features

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.520
that we're working with.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.420
So these are things like
noses, and lips, and eyes.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.905
And then what do we do after we
have these individual features?

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.644
Steve.

00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:01.060
AUDIENCE: Well, maybe we can
group some of those together.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.059
RYAN ALEXANDER: Exactly.

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.000
Yeah, we can organize them into
what we know the pattern to be.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.900
We know that a face has to
have two eyes, above a nose,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.550
and then above the mouth.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.849
So that is precisely what a
neural network actually ends up

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.390
doing, and we'll walk through
the process of how it does this

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.129
later on in the talk.

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:18.670
But as you can see,
the intuitive way

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.500
that we classify a
face, and the way

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.996
our brains are
wired to do it, is

00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:24.120
pretty similar to the way
got these neural networks

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.350
to operate.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.990
So like I said,
we're talking a lot

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.740
about these convolutional
neural networks.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.556
There are other types of
architectures involved.

00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:34.180
Like we mentioned
before, deep learning

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.600
is a pretty wide
variety of algorithms,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.440
but we're going to
focus on these CNNs.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.750
To give you a precursor
of how good these CNN are,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.740
this results from
ImageNet competition.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.680
So the ImageNet
competition is basically

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.470
exactly what it sounds like,
a bunch of computer scientists

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.803
get together, and see how
many images they can correctly

00:04:52.803 --> 00:04:54.160
classify.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.430
And their error rate
was pretty high.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.980
Almost a third error
rate over here in 2010,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.010
2011, and then in 2011, the CNNs
were introduced to the topic,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.950
and the error rate plummeted.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.030
As you can see
over here in 2015,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.420
we've got a significant
improvement in these ImageNet

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.020
competitions.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.994
So clearly, the CNNs
have been very effective,

00:05:13.994 --> 00:05:15.410
and it's definitely
been something

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.500
that is exciting in the field
and happening right now.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.759
All right, so now we're going
to move into image processing.

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.550
ISHWARYA ANANTHABHOTLA:
OK, so Ryan gave us

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.900
a nice overview of where
we get this concept

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.690
of neural networks, but
let's take a time travel,

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.290
and go into a quick
history lesson.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.740
So suppose I had a chair,
and I wanted the computer

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.580
to classify this chair.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.520
I have some a priori knowledge
about what sort of things

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.210
make up a chair.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.668
So I might be
interested in looking

00:05:42.668 --> 00:05:46.400
at arms, and corners of the
chair, legs, things like that.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.480
So I would go ahead, and feature
engineer my discovery scheme

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.897
to be looking for
specific things.

00:05:51.897 --> 00:05:53.855
So I'm going to talk
about some techniques that

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:55.020
are traditionally used.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.520
For example, chairs, doors,
these things have corners.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.855
So I might use an image
processing technique called

00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:02.030
a Harris Corner Detector,
where we basically

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.400
look at large changes in
intensity as groups of pixels

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.550
move from an image to
an image that indicate

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.470
the presence of corners, and you
can use common corners to say

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.150
that OK, all of these images are
chairs, or doors, or whatever.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.790
Similarly, I want to say I have
a bunch of pictures of chairs

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.200
of different sizes, but
that they all must have

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.380
so many corners or something.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.590
So typically, we use a sift
algorithm to scale invariant

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.520
feature transforms.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.086
It basically says that
across different sizes,

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:29.960
I still should be able
to extract information

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.416
about the placement of corners.

00:06:33.416 --> 00:06:35.930
Another common technique
that's used in image processing

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.832
is what we call HOG,
Histogram of Gradients.

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.540
So basically, for
example, in this image,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.140
if I want to say I want to find
all the images that have faces

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.940
in them, or consist
of faces, let's

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.480
say, I might come up with
a template of a face that

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.870
basically assigns gradients
to groups of pixels that form

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.460
an outline of what
looks like a face,

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.910
and then scan it across my
sample images, and say OK,

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.305
a face is present in this image.

00:07:00.305 --> 00:07:01.680
Obviously, there
are some errors.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.240
A mead cap, and a logo back
here have become a face,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.710
but this is the
traditional approach.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.310
But here's the problem,
what if I don't actually

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.410
necessarily know what features
are the most critical depending

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.280
on the dataset that I get?

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.130
I want the system
itself to figure out

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.490
what techniques to apply without
having any a priori knowledge

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.940
about the dataset.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.884
So this is exactly
the idea of CNNs,

00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:27.300
the convolutional
neural networks.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.030
We want the techniques to
be learned automatically

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.760
by the process, by the system.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.950
So if I'm trying
to classify faces,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.980
I want the system to
figure out that eyes,

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.330
and ears, and nose, these are
the most important things.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.955
Or if I'm trying to
classify elephants,

00:07:39.955 --> 00:07:41.900
the ears and trunks are
the critical features,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.460
without me having
to say OK, we're

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.790
going to do corner detection,
so on, and so forth.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.470
So this is the idea.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.000
So to be able to understand
this process in greater detail,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I'm first going to go
into a little bit of math,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.230
and the idea is to present
the most fundamental operation

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.019
here, which is the convolution.

00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:01.310
So this is the formal definition
of the two-dimensional

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.210
convolution, and since
we're working with images,

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.060
we're only considering
the two-dimensional case.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.937
So in a more graphical
presentation,

00:08:09.937 --> 00:08:12.395
which is a little bit easier
to understand than just seeing

00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:14.570
the formula, the
idea is that we have

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.610
a kernel, or a
convolutional filter

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.860
that we seek to apply
on another image,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.410
and that extracts some
information about that image

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.485
that we can use to help us
classify the convolution.

00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:27.860
So assume that this is our
kernel, or this is our filter,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.280
and suppose this--

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:35.850
oh, there it is.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.090
So suppose we're applying
the kernel [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.690
here to the image
that's in green.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.587
So the idea is we want to slide
this filter across the image,

00:08:43.587 --> 00:08:45.170
and what we're
basically doing this is

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.580
a succession of dot products.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.440
So at each placement
on the image,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.590
we multiply the
overlayed numbers,

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.770
and the sum becomes the output
image on the convolt output.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.964
So this is basically the
way the process works.

00:08:57.964 --> 00:09:00.380
You probably notice that there's
a reduction in dimension,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.520
and Henry will talk a little
bit more about why this is.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.386
Let me get to it, and
then [INAUDIBLE] So let's

00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:09.320
see some examples
of what information

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.390
we get by applying
the convolution.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.580
So you see the image of
a tiger on the top left.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.760
When we apply a filter
that's a low pass filter,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.440
basically-- it's
a Gaussian-- then

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.390
we get low spatial frequency
information about this image.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.680
So basically, we blurred
it, and this tells us

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.285
something specific that
we might want to learn.

00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:29.785
So the kernel actually looks
like a two-dimensional Gaussian

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:32.243
function that's been distributed
across this three-by-three

00:09:32.243 --> 00:09:34.010
kernel.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.570
Similarly, we
might be interested

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.220
in high spatial
frequency information.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.850
So in this case, we're
looking at sharp features.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.740
So horizontal edges
or vertical edges.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.660
So a question for you is
if I have this kernel,

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.935
which of these outputs
when this kernel

00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:51.310
was applied to the original
image, which of these outputs

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.449
do you think it produced?

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:54.990
AUDIENCE: The third
one on the right.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.180
ISHWARYA ANANTHABHOTLA:
Yeah, that's exactly right,

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.740
and it's probably
pretty easy to see

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.960
why that's the case, given
that the numbers are all

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.370
horizontal bands here.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.525
Lastly, we also may be
interested in extracting

00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:06.710
information at a
particular frequency.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:11.420
So we can take the
difference of a high pass

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.212
filter and a low pass
filter, and add it

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:15.545
to your frequency you can
extract information about that

00:10:15.545 --> 00:10:17.910
as well.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.591
OK, one last helpful
piece of information

00:10:20.591 --> 00:10:22.090
is that there's
another way that you

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.960
can think of the information
that's learned at each stage

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.940
because a convolution
can also be

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.470
thought of as a Fourier
transform in the frequency

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.970
domain.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.140
You can think of the image
transformation that way.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.180
So from an image perspective,
what a Fourier transform is

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.580
is basically a sum of a
set of sinusoidal gratings

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.575
that differ, say, in frequency,
in orientation, in amplitude,

00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:44.743
and in phase.

00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:47.250
So you can think about
the zebra image here

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.030
that's actually a composite
of different gradients

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.880
that might look like this,
and the Fourier coefficients

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.100
would be how much of
each of these pieces

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.907
come together to make
that final image.

00:10:59.907 --> 00:11:01.990
So just to get a sense of
what kind of information

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.042
this could convey, we typically
take a Fourier transformation,

00:11:05.042 --> 00:11:07.000
and break it apart into
the magnitude and phase

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.850
representation.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.390
So you see magnitude,
and you see phase.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.420
So those images weren't
particularly clear,

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.192
but this is a really
good example for this.

00:11:16.192 --> 00:11:17.650
So if we take the
Fourier transform

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.150
of all the horizontal
text here, you

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.880
see how the magnitude
reflects this,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.870
and you can go back to
the math to understand

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.243
why it's reflected in
a vertical marking.

00:11:26.243 --> 00:11:28.550
And similarly, if I were
to take that same image,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.540
and rotate it, and then ask
for the Fourier transform,

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.850
you see how that information
is contained very clearly

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.380
in the magnitude spectrum.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.860
So these might be things
that a network would

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.140
learn at each stage to try
to identify this as a text,

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.615
or as as body of text that's
tilted one way or the other,

00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:45.050
so on and so forth.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.660
So with that, we can now go into
what the actual architecture

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.981
of a convolutional neural is.

00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:52.480
HENRY NASSIF: All right, so as
it was said earlier, in order

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.909
to classify or detect
objects, you actually

00:11:54.909 --> 00:11:55.825
need certain features.

00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:58.630
You need to be able to
identify these features.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.530
And the way you can
identify these features

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.790
is using certain convolutions
or certain filters.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.060
In many cases, we don't know
what these features are,

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.920
and as a result of
that, we don't actually

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.530
know what the filters are
to extract these features.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.290
And what convolution neural
networks allow us to do

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.110
is actually determine
what these features are,

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.600
and also determine what
the filters are in order

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.970
to extract these features.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.720
Now, the idea for
convolutional neural networks,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.470
or the idea for replicating
how the brain works

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.440
started in about 1960s or
1950s after some experiments

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.120
by Hubel and Wesel.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.830
And what happened in
these experiments,

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.680
as can be seen here,
is a cat was actually

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.390
shown a light band
at different angles,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.510
and the neural
activity of the cat

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.730
was measured using an electrode.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.070
And the outcome
from this experiment

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.280
show that based on the angle
at which the light was shown,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.040
the neural response of
the cat was different.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.620
As you can see here, the
number of neurons, as well as

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.810
the neurons that were
firing were very different

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.690
based on the angle.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.820
So what you can see
also here is really

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.670
a plot of the response versus
the orientation of the light.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.390
And what this has led
Hubel and Wesel to

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.940
is the idea that
neurons in the brain

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.600
are organized in a certain
topographical order,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.770
and at each filter, it
fills a specific role,

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:24.610
and the only fires when its
specific input is shown,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.980
or when the angle is show,
or the angle is specified.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.020
Now, the first step to
actually replicating

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.760
how the brain works
in code is really

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.120
understanding how the building
block, the neuron, works.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.080
That's a quick
reminder of 7012 here.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.100
So a neuron is actually a cell
with dendrites, nucleus, axon,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.770
and a terminal.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.960
And what the neuron
actually does

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.240
is aggregate the action
potentials or the inputs

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.480
it gets from all the
neighboring neurons that

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.670
are connected to it
through the timelines,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.580
and it sums these action
potentials, and then compares

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.840
them to a certain threshold
that it has internally,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.250
and that would determine
whether or not this neuron would

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.620
fire an action potential.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.400
And that very simple idea can
actually be replicated in code.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.840
An artificial neuron looks
very much like a natural one.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.000
So what you would have
is a set of inputs.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.720
Here we have three inputs that
are summed inside of a cell,

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.640
or a neuron.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.220
The sum here is not
just a regular sum,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.190
it's a weighted sum.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.950
So the neuron
specifies some weight,

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.540
which you can think of as how
much it values the input coming

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.740
from a specific neuron, and
then the input is multiplied

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.070
by its weight, and then the
total sum that the neuron

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.820
computes is then fed into
an activation function that

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.935
produces the output that the
neuron then basically produces.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.740
Now, what we just saw here
is really a simple neuron,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:59.950
a single neuron.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.570
You can't really do much
with just one neuron,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.710
so what you would do is
combined these neurons

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.750
in a certain topography,
or in that case,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.130
we have a network with
seven neurons organized

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.730
in three different layers.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.430
And what you can think
of that is really

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.790
as one big neuron with 12
inputs, and one output.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.922
So for example, in the
case of the chair that

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.380
was previously
mentioned, if you're

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.890
trying to identify whether
a specific image has

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.670
a chair in it or not,
these 12 inputs here

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.060
could be some sub images,
or some small areas

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.030
of the initial image that
you feed into the network,

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.100
and the output here
could be a yes or no.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.480
Whether the image has a chair,
or doesn't have a chair.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.330
And that is really
the concept behind

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.990
convolutional neural
networks, which

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.040
we'll go into details in a bit.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.460
So what each neuron would
be doing in that case,

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.600
is really just
performing a dot product,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.520
which if you aggregate
that with the dot

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.140
products computed by each
of the other neurons,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.960
you would obtain a convolution.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.420
So what we have here
is three inputs.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.810
If the input, in that case,
is an image or a sub image,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.790
then the inputs would be pixels.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.650
The weights that you
would be using here

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.100
would be the filter weights,
which is the filter that you

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.930
use in the convolution.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.480
And then the sum here
would be the dot product

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.060
of the weights and the
inputs, and that sum

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.110
would be computed by a specific
neuron in your network.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.710
Then, that would be
the convolution step,

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.990
and then that
convolution step would

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.699
happen at the first
layer in the network.

00:16:37.699 --> 00:16:39.490
So you would be applying
this to the input,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.120
but you also would
be applying this

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.699
at the second layer,
and third layer.

00:16:42.699 --> 00:16:44.240
In that case, we're
only showing what

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.030
happens in the first layer.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.590
The next step after
the convolution

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.720
would be the activation step.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.470
So the dot product
computed here would

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.470
be there's a function that
would be applied to the sum,

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.420
and then that
function would produce

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.730
the output of the neuron.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.030
And this is where the
activation layer is.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.369
You also have another
activation layer here,

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:08.630
and then a final one here.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.290
What we just went through
now are convolutions

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.829
and activations, but this is
not the only thing that actually

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.260
happens in a neural net.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.415
What we also have is a step
called subsampling, which

00:17:25.415 --> 00:17:28.880
we will be talking about next.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.210
For now, we will dig
deeper into the activation,

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.240
and specifically, what
activation functions to use.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.810
In that case, we can see
that that's a neuron,

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.400
and what the neuron
is doing here

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.290
is the weighted sum
that we talked about,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.532
or the dot product.

00:17:43.532 --> 00:17:44.990
And then the output
from this would

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.480
be fed into a certain
activation function.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.960
Common activation functions
are sigmoid, tanh,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.490
or rectify linear unit, and
we will go through each one

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.190
independently.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.690
So here, we can see the
sigmoid activation function.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.490
So what this function
essentially does

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.595
is map any input to an output
in the range of zero to one,

00:18:06.595 --> 00:18:10.970
and it's defined as one divided
by one plus e to the minus x.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.700
The other common activation
function is tanh,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.160
and that's any
input to an output

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.320
between minus one and one.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.890
And then finally, would be the
rectified linear unit, which

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.470
maps an input to itself
if it's positive,

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.440
or to zero if it's negative.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.590
Now, in theory, you
could use any function

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.930
as an activation
function in your network,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.290
but that's not what you
want to do in practice.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.000
You want your
activation functions

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
to be non-linear
for one main reason,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.830
that the goal of the
activation function

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.510
is actually to introduce
non-linearity in your system.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.442
And if all your activation
functions are linear,

00:18:48.442 --> 00:18:50.900
then you would essentially be
having a linear system, which

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.690
prevents you from achieving
the level of complexity

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.320
that you would ideally want to
achieve with a neural network.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.850
And there's a formal
proof for as to why

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.620
you need non-linear
activation functions.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.370
They don't all need
to be non-linear,

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.757
but you need to have a least
a few non-linear activation

00:19:06.757 --> 00:19:07.840
functions in your network.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.131
And the proof is available
in the appendix, or the link

00:19:10.131 --> 00:19:14.840
to the paper that has the proof.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.350
So after we've discussed what
happens at the activation

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.370
layer, now we want to
talk about convolution.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.780
So as I said earlier,
an image is obviously

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.170
a two-dimensional image,
but we're using RGB images.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.200
So actually need three channels.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.170
So what this means is
that an image is actually

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.670
three-dimensional, and each 2D
matrix represents one channel.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.230
One of them corresponding to R,
one of them corresponding to G,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.330
one of them corresponding
to B. So a 32 by 32 image

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.900
would essentially be represented
by a 32 by 32 by three matrix,

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.100
as can be seen here.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.980
So what happens at
the convolution layer?

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.070
So here we have a
nice animation that

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:05.800
shows what is happening at
each convolutional layer.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.590
So assume we have a five
by five by three filter.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.360
So what this is,
essentially, would

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.380
be doing is covering a certain
patch in the original image,

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.450
which is 32 by 32 by three.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.820
So what can see here
is that for that five

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.460
by five by three patch
in the original image,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.320
we have a neuron
that is actually

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.170
performing the dot
product on all the pixels

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.120
in that specific patch.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.690
So what is happening
here is the pixel values,

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:37.400
which in that case, we have
five by five by three pixels,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.220
are being multiplied
by the filter values,

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.530
and this operation is
being performed here.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.120
Then, after that dot
product is performed,

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.080
it's fed into an activation
function, as can be seen here,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.420
and this produces the
output of this neuron.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.260
Now, this is what this single
neuron is actually doing.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.680
It's just covering that
area of the original image.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.890
What you would have
in a neural net

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.020
is many neurons, each
covering a certain area

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.830
of the original image.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.930
And if you aggregate the output
of all of these neurons, what

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.650
you would be doing or performing
is, essentially, a convolution

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.920
on the original image.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.290
And to formalize
what happens here,

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.480
or what's the output
that's being produced

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.180
from that operation, we can
look at that from a more

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.300
mathematical perspective.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.570
So if you have an
input of size H1,

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:34.630
W1, D1, and you're performing
a convolution with a filter,

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.420
then the output, W2,
would be related to W1

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.730
with the following formula.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.360
So W2 plus W1 minus filter width
plus one, and the same formula

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.460
applies for the height, and
the depth would actually

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.020
be the same because
in that case,

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.260
we're using a filter that
has the same depth, or three,

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.430
as the original image.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.280
So what this would
produce in aggregate

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.890
is if you have 28 by 28 by one
neurons, each one performing

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.030
a dot product on some pixels
in the original image,

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.690
the output would be an
activation map of size 28 by 28

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.790
by one, and the
output of each neuron

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:15.540
would be one pixel in
the activation map.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.870
Now, if we go back to the
points that we made earlier,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:23.060
one thing we said was that the
reason you use a neural network

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.979
is because you don't know
exactly what features

00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:27.770
you want to extract,
and you don't actually

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.950
have specific filters that you
want to apply to the image.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.140
So ideally, what
you want to do is

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.650
have multiple filters being
applied to the first image,

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.540
and perform multiple
convolutions,

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.434
and this is what you can do
with multiple neuron layers.

00:22:41.434 --> 00:22:43.850
So what we described before
was just for one neuron layer.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.990
In that case, we can assume
we have five different neuron

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.000
layers, each one performing
a different convolution

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.690
on the original image.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:53.780
So in that case, we
would have 28 by 28

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.210
by one neuron per
layer, and then

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.070
if we aggregate all
these neurons together,

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.865
we need to multiply
it by five, and that

00:22:59.865 --> 00:23:01.490
would be the total
number of neurons we

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:06.230
have in that specific number.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.860
So this actually leaves us with
a pretty complicated system.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.070
It would have many parameters.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.510
The neurons have weights,
the number of neurons

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.890
is also a parameter So how do
we actually formalize that?

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.160
If we have an input volume
of 32 by 32 by three, which

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.800
is our original image,
and a filter size of five

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.100
by five by three, then the
size of the activation map

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.970
that would be reduced
would be 28 by 28 by one.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.850
Then in that case, we also said
we have five different neuron

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.410
layers that perform five
different convolutions.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:41.310
Then the total number of neurons
would be 28 by 28 by five,

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.460
and then the weights
per neuron are five

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.062
by five by three, which is 75.

00:23:46.062 --> 00:23:48.520
In that case, we're assuming
that the neurons independently

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.860
keep track of their own weights.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.129
This could be simplified
to each layer having

00:23:52.129 --> 00:23:54.170
their own weight, which
would tremendously reduce

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.460
the number of parameters.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.010
But in that case, just
to get an upper bound,

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.622
this leaves us
with a total number

00:23:59.622 --> 00:24:01.910
of parameters of 294,000.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.480
And this is just using a
32 by 32 by three image.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.980
You can think of this
as a pretty small image.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.520
So if you have a
bigger image, you

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.500
will have many more parameters.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.000
Great.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.570
So what we just saw now, and
described, were convolutions,

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.425
activations, and these
steps happen sequentially

00:24:21.425 --> 00:24:24.110
in a convolutional
neural network,

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.920
specifically as can be see here.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.870
One step that also happens
occasionally is subsampling,

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.594
and we'll discuss that
step in detail here.

00:24:32.594 --> 00:24:34.760
So there are two main reasons
why you would actually

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.140
subsample your input.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.920
One is to obviously reduce
the size of your input,

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.752
and your feature space,
but also because you

00:24:42.752 --> 00:24:44.960
want to keep track of the
most important information,

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.850
and get rid of everything
else that you don't think

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.130
is going to be relevant
to your classification.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.490
And the common methods
used in subsampling

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.825
are either max pooling
or average pooling.

00:24:56.825 --> 00:25:00.280
We will describe
max pooling here.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.010
So what happens
in max pooling is,

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.940
essentially, you are
dividing the image

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.430
into different sub images,
non-overlapping sub images,

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.590
and you perform an
at max operation.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.650
So in that case, if we
consider two by two filters,

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.520
we would split the image, which
in that case is four by four.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.370
We'd split it into
four sub images,

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:21.370
and for each two by two square,
we would take the maximum.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.590
In that case, for the first
square it would be six,

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.480
then eight, then
three, then four.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.610
And the reason
that actually works

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.340
is because what you want
to do is really keep

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:35.740
track of the response of the
neurons that-- or the highest

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.130
response produced
by your neurons.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.780
In that case, for example,
the first highest response

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.730
in the first square
is six, and that

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.610
means that if you get
that high of a response,

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.020
it means that something has
been detected in the image,

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.090
or has been detected.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.135
And this is something you
want to keep track of as you

00:25:52.135 --> 00:25:53.530
move forward in your network.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:57.580
And although this moves
around the location of pixels,

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.640
because you can think of
that as subsampling an image,

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.220
it does keep track of the
information you care about

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.470
because you only
care about the fact

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.541
that something has been
detected in the image.

00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:09.040
At this point, you
don't really care

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.560
about where it's
located in the image,

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.590
and you want to keep
track of all the features

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.770
that your neurons have
detected in order to be

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:22.070
able to eventually classify
the input correctly.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.570
So if you have multiple
feature maps-- so in that case,

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.910
if you have 224 by 224 by 64,
what your subsampling operation

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.140
would be doing is reducing
the height and the width

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.180
so the depth would
remain unchanged.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.670
So in that case, you would go
from 224 by 224 by 64 to 112

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.600
by 112 by 64, and that would
be reducing your output size

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.200
by a factor of four.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.820
And formally, what
this would look

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.250
like is if you have
an input of size H1,

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.775
W1, D1, the size of
your output would

00:26:57.775 --> 00:26:59.800
be related to your input
in the following ways.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.460
W2 would be W1 minus
the pool width plus one.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:09.240
The same applies for H2, and the
depth would remain unchanged.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.286
So these are, essentially--

00:27:11.286 --> 00:27:13.660
these are the steps that happen
in a convolutional neural

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.825
network.

00:27:14.825 --> 00:27:17.300
What you could be doing
is repeating these steps

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.380
on a certain number of
times in your network.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.070
But eventually, you have
to make a classification,

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.010
and decide in our case,
whether our image has a chair

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.450
or doesn't have a chair.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.230
So how does that happen?

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.130
So after you perform
all these steps,

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.940
there's a step that happens
here that would allow

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.240
you to make that
prediction, and that step

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.960
is usually called a
fully connected layer,

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.225
or a multi-layer perception.

00:27:43.225 --> 00:27:47.010
And what this essentially is is
layers that are very similar,

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.120
or exactly the same as
what you had before,

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.980
except that every
neuron in the layer

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.690
is connected to all
the previous neurons.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.290
So what it's allowed
you to do is really

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.610
consider everything
you currently

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.430
have about your input,
or everything that's

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:05.080
left about your input, and
compute a dot product on that,

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.340
rather than focusing on a
subset subsample of your input

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.740
like previous layers do.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.140
In that case, if
you're actually trying

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.620
to classify your input
into four classes,

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.830
you would ideally have
four different neurons

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.460
in your output layer,
each one corresponding

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.070
to one of the classes
that you have,

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.220
and then you would
perform the same operation

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.920
as you would in a previous
layer, compute the dot product,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.570
and then once you obtain
the values at every neuron,

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.870
you would perform a
normalization operation

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:36.940
on all the output.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.430
This organization operation
is called softmax,

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.280
or normalized exponential,
and what it does is really,

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.800
put more weight on
the highest value.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.740
And by computing the
softmax at the output,

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.190
you're able to compute the
posterior probabilities,

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.730
and allows you to
make a more informed--

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.460
or basically make
a classification

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.730
decision on your input.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:58.850
Great.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.182
So that's everything.

00:29:01.182 --> 00:29:05.325
And now, the next step will be
talking about back propagation.

00:29:05.325 --> 00:29:06.450
ISHWARYA ANANTHABHOTLA: OK.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.940
So now that Henry has
given us an overview

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.459
of the entire
architecture of a CNN,

00:29:09.459 --> 00:29:11.000
I'm going to quickly
spend some time,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.610
and talk about standard
preprocessing tricks and tips

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.020
that people might use
on the image dataset

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.710
before they actually feet
it through a neural net

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.600
to classify the images.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.580
So let's suppose we
have a dataset x,

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.900
and there are n number of
data points in the dataset,

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.450
and each point has
a dimension, D.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:33.010
So they have D
features per point.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.520
So in this example, we use
these graphs as an example.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.370
Basically, our original data
here has just two dimensions,

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.879
and it spans this
range of values.

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:43.170
So for example, if we want
to center this data, what we

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.330
would do is a mean subtraction.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.760
So we basically
subtract the mean

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.085
across all the features
of all the points,

00:29:48.085 --> 00:29:50.710
and we basically center it, and
you can see that transformation

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.120
here.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.920
And then we might, again, go
for normalizing the dimension

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.932
so that you have it.

00:29:55.932 --> 00:29:58.270
The data points
span the same range

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.692
of values in both dimensions.

00:29:59.692 --> 00:30:01.150
So you can see that
transformation,

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.942
and how it's taken place here.

00:30:02.942 --> 00:30:07.087
And we just divide by the
standard deviation to do this.

00:30:07.087 --> 00:30:08.545
Something that's
very commonly done

00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:11.297
is called PCA, or Principal
Component Analysis.

00:30:11.297 --> 00:30:12.896
And the idea here
is sometimes we

00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:15.270
have a dataset that has a
very, very high dimensionality,

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.910
and we would like to
reduce that dimensionality.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.770
So basically, what
our goal is is

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.680
to project the higher
dimensional space onto a lower

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.126
dimensionality space by taking
the subset of those features.

00:30:27.126 --> 00:30:28.750
And if you've seen
a little bit of 1806

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.340
from linear algebra,
the way we do

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.860
this is by generating
a covariance matrix,

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.070
then doing the single
variable decomposition.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:39.210
And I'll gloss over the math
now, but that's the idea.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.960
And you can see here
how the original data

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.980
spanned two dimensions.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.438
I would decorrelate it so that
it spans a single dimension.

00:30:44.438 --> 00:30:46.066
And even with this
data, you might

00:30:46.066 --> 00:30:47.440
want to ensure
that it's widened,

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.850
which is the same deal.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:52.770
You want the values to span the
same range in both dimensions.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.631
So then you would just
divide by your Eigenvalues

00:30:55.631 --> 00:30:56.950
to get the widened data.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.190
This last bit is
something that's

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.960
very commonly done
as a preprocessing

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:08.010
trick, though people aren't
entirely sure why it works very

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.720
well, or that it
really does help,

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.230
but it's something
that people do,

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.820
and it's called
data augmentation.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.582
So basically, if I
have a dataset that

00:31:14.582 --> 00:31:18.165
contains a bunch of
images of chairs,

00:31:18.165 --> 00:31:20.790
a bunch of images of tables, and
then a bunch of images of say,

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.510
trees, I might want to
intentionally augment

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.080
that dataset further by
introducing a few variations

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.300
on these same images.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.280
So I might take the chair
image, rotate some, reflect it

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.042
a few more, scale, crop,
remap the color space,

00:31:35.042 --> 00:31:36.500
or just kind of
have a process that

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.250
does this randomly
to create more

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.960
variation on the same dataset.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.490
And this is a good illustration
of why this makes a difference.

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.620
I've taken an image
here of what looks

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.860
like a waterfall or
some spot of nature,

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.785
and simply just
inverted the colors.

00:31:49.785 --> 00:31:52.076
And what I see, if I were to
just see this image alone,

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:54.370
it maybe looks like a
curtain, or a bit of texture,

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.010
or something.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.464
And the idea is even
to a human perception,

00:31:57.464 --> 00:31:59.380
these images have two
very different meanings,

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.744
and so it's interesting
to see what effect they

00:32:01.744 --> 00:32:04.790
would have on a neural network.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.480
And with that, we'll go over to
image classification results.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.310
ALI SOYLEMEZOGLU:
So, so far we've

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:14.600
seen how convolutional
neural networks are built,

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.890
and certain image
processing techniques

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:22.850
we can use on the input images
to get them into formats that

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.430
are there for the
classification process,

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.930
but so far, it seems
a bit abstract.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:33.500
It's good to know how CNNs work,
why CNNs work, but why don't we

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.500
take a look at some of the
practical results from CNNs,

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.990
and what they're used
for so that when you're

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:41.450
done watching this
lecture, you can

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:46.490
go home, and try classifying
images on your own time?

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.880
With that, let's first revisit
the ImageNet competition.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.240
I hope you remember the graph
at the bottom from the beginning

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.580
of the lecture,
where we used this

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.980
to motivate the use of CNNs.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.040
CNNs came onto the
picture in 2012,

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:06.470
but the winning CNN from 2012
was used on the 2010 ImageNet

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.390
competition as
well, and it managed

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.070
to bring down the top five
error rate to 0.17, which

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:16.910
is pretty much on the same level
as how performed in the 2012

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.480
competition when it was first
used, which was at 0.16.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.150
So this just goes to show that
these convolutional neural

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:26.646
networks are the state of the
art when it comes to image

00:33:26.646 --> 00:33:30.740
classification, and
that's why we're currently

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.770
focusing on that.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.820
But you might be wondering
what the ImageNet

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.340
competition exactly looks like,
what the images looks like.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.410
So why don't we
take a look at that.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.360
As you can see here,
these are images

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.310
from the ImageNet competition.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.830
Underneath each image
is a bold caption, which

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.390
is considered to be
the ground truth,

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:50.950
or what the competition
believes to be

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:55.190
the correct classification
of the image.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:56.850
Underneath that
ground truth, you

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.630
see a list of five
different labels.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.770
Now, these five
labels are produced

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.120
by a convolutional
neural network,

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.390
and the different bars--

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.600
the different lengthened bars,
some pink and others blue,

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.179
represent how
confident the CNN is

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:14.989
that what it sees in that
image is that specific label.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.850
As you can see in
certain examples,

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:21.469
the CNN is pretty confident in
that it has a correct answer.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.750
For example, when we look
at the container ship,

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.540
it's pretty confident that
what's in that image is exactly

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.650
a container ship.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.350
There are certain cases when it
doesn't get the correct label

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:34.070
on its first try, but it does
have in its top five labels.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.010
For example, you can
see grill and mushroom.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.870
Now, the funny thing
about the mushroom image

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.750
is that what it thinks
the image should

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.658
be classified as is agaric.

00:34:43.658 --> 00:34:46.199
And if you don't know, agaric
is actually a type of mushroom,

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:48.530
and in fact, it's a
mushroom that image.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.510
And it make sense that
their confidence levels

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:51.590
are pretty much the same.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.909
Agaric is slightly-- it's
slightly more complex that what

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:57.770
it sees in the image is agaric.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.140
But there are certain
cases when the CNN

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.870
fails to classify
the image correctly

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:07.200
in its top five levels.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.320
This will be registered
as a top five error,

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.810
as you just saw in the previous
slide about the top error rate.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.560
One example here on
this slide is cherry.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.140
Now, the ImageNet
competition believed

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.902
that this should be
classified correctly

00:35:19.902 --> 00:35:21.360
as cherry, even
though there's also

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.850
a Dalmatian in the background.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.940
The CNN, on the other
hand, is pretty confident

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.410
that what it sees in this
image is the Dalmatian.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.550
But if you look at some
of the other results

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.640
within the top five, although
it doesn't guess cherry at all,

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.380
it does guess certain
fruits that it

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.780
may think look sort
of like cherries

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.820
like grape or elderberry.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.510
So the CNN does
actually pick up on two

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.000
different distinct
objects within the image,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.210
but as a result of how it's
built, or its training set,

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.610
it ends up classifying
it as a Dalmatian.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.720
But it goes to show you
that CNNs could also

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.775
be used not just as an
image classification,

00:35:56.775 --> 00:35:59.987
but also as object detection,
which we do not touch up

00:35:59.987 --> 00:36:02.910
on in this lecture at all.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:05.460
So I'm not going to
go further into that.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.080
Now, this is all fun and all,
but what about some real world

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.040
applications?

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.220
So this is a study that they
did at Google with Google Street

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:18.670
View house numbers, where
they used the CNN to classify

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.637
photographic images of house
numbers, as you can see here,

00:36:21.637 --> 00:36:23.470
of certain examples of
these house numbers--

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:24.500
what they look like.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.100
So what the CNN was
tasked with doing

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.600
was that it was supposed to
recognize the individual digits

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.630
within the image, and then
understand that it's not

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.910
just one digit that
it's looking at,

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:38.410
but it's actually
a string of digits

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:42.720
connected, and successfully
classified as the correct house

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.780
number.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.430
This can be quite challenging,
even for humans sometimes

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.930
when the image is quite blurry.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:54.420
You might not exactly know what
the house number exactly is,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.890
but they managed to get the
convolutional neural network

00:36:56.890 --> 00:37:00.410
to operate around
human operator levels.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:04.420
So that corresponds to
around 96% to 97% accuracy,

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.270
and what that
enables Google to do

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.950
is that they can
deploy the CNN such

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:12.790
that the CNN automatically
extracts the house

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:19.180
numbers from the images online,
and uses that to geocode

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.516
these addresses.

00:37:20.516 --> 00:37:24.190
And it's gotten to a point
were the CNN is successfully

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:27.520
able to do this process
in less than an hour

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.390
for all of the street view
house numbers in all of France.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:35.930
Now, you might asking where
this could be useful for.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.560
If you don't have access
a lot of resources

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.750
to actually do this
geocoding process where

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:45.670
you match latitude and
longitude to street addresses,

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.680
then your only resource might
be actually photographic images.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.160
So you actually need
something, hopefully not human,

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.030
but some sort of software
that can do this successfully.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.200
And so this is, for
example, a place

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.000
in South Africa,
a bird's eye view.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.670
Not sure if you can
exactly see, but there

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.459
are these small numbers on
top of each of the houses.

00:38:03.459 --> 00:38:05.500
All of these numbers were
extracted and correctly

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.930
classified using this
previously seen CNN.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:15.620
Another example from robotics
is recognizing hand gestures.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.120
So obviously, robots
come equipped with a lot

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.680
of different hardware.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.660
They can sense
sounds, they can also

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.330
capture images of
their surroundings.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:28.812
And if you're able to classify
what you see-- if the robots is

00:38:28.812 --> 00:38:30.400
able to classify
what it sees, then it

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.280
can actually act upon it,
and take certain actions.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.785
That's why it becomes really
helpful to successfully

00:38:35.785 --> 00:38:37.640
classify the images.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.810
So this is what they
did using hand gestures,

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.810
where there were five
different classes.

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.460
Each class corresponds to the
number of extended fingers.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.790
So a, b, c, d, the top row,
corresponds to the same class.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.640
They all have two
fingers sticking out.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.620
The bottom row has three
fingers sticking out.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.230
So that's another class.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:00.250
And they get the error rate
down all the way to 3%.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.370
So 97% of the time, the
convolutional neural net

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.650
correctly classified
the hand gesture.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.230
And you can use these
hand gestures then

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.990
to give certain
commands to a robot,

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:15.100
and it can train the CNN
to act upon something

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.360
else besides hand gestures.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.276
For example, if it's in
some sort of terranean

00:39:18.276 --> 00:39:20.850
and you train it
on certain images

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.740
that you might find
in nature, then it

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.490
can take those classifications,
and act upon it once it sees,

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:32.230
for example, a tree, or
some sort of body of water.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.080
It's all thanks to
image classification.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.050
Now, obviously, gestures
are not necessarily static.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.390
You could be waving your
hand, and so that would

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.730
require a temporal component.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.660
So it's not just an image
you're looking at, but a video.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:50.380
And so if follows
that we can probably

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.050
extend image classification
into video classification.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:57.580
After all, videos are just
images with an added component,

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.920
specifically time.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.930
Obviously, the added
temporal component

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:04.520
comes with a lot of
additional complexity.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.517
So we're not going to dive into
any of that, but in the end,

00:40:07.517 --> 00:40:08.850
it comes down to the same thing.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:10.900
You extract features
from the videos,

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.520
and you attempt to
classify them using

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.180
convolutional neural nets.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.190
So why don't we look
at a study done, again,

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:21.390
at Google, where they
extracted one million videos

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:26.980
from YouTube, sports videos,
with somewhere between 400

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:32.630
to 500 different classes,
and they used CNNs to attempt

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.360
to classify these videos.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.550
Now, they used
different approaches.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.590
They used different
approaches, different tests,

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:43.360
different types of CNNs that
I'm not going to go into.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.795
But as you can see
here, these are

00:40:45.795 --> 00:40:50.260
certain stills from these videos
where the caption highlighted

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.770
in blue is what the
correct answer should be,

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.740
and underneath it,
the top five labels

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.250
that the convolutional
neural network producers.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.990
The one highlighted
in green is supposed

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.420
to be the correct answer.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:09.180
So you can see on all of these,
it gets it within the top five,

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.757
and for the most part,
within the top two,

00:41:11.757 --> 00:41:14.090
and it's pretty confident
when it does get it correctly.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:16.673
Now, when I said that they use
different types of classifieds,

00:41:16.673 --> 00:41:19.880
some of them were more
stacked classifieds,

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.970
where they were just trained
on stills within these images,

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:26.120
while others were what they
called fusion ones, where they

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.865
sort of add the temporal
component by fusing

00:41:28.865 --> 00:41:34.250
in different stills from
these photo images together.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.680
Now, the current accuracy rate--

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.810
the best one they've
achieved so far--

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:43.550
has been around 80% accuracy
within the top five label.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.190
Now, 80% accuracy
is nowhere near what

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.020
we saw with the
ImageNet classification,

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.690
where in 2015, they had
managed to get it up

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:56.350
to 98% or 99% accuracy.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:01.520
But obviously, there's way more
complexity involved in this.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.520
So it makes sense that
it's not quite there yet.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.090
But it does provide a good
benchmark, and something

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.310
to improve upon in
the future as well.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:15.740
Now, that being said,
convolutional neural networks

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.450
do come with
certain limitations.

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:19.190
They're not perfect.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:25.020
And so Julian will now
talk about the limitations.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.750
JULIAN BROWN: Thanks, Ali.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.210
So Ali talked about the
ImageNet competition,

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.540
and talked about how
the recent winners have

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.180
been convolutional neural nets.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:40.604
So before, the best was about
26% top five error rate,

00:42:40.604 --> 00:42:42.020
but now they've
actually gotten it

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.330
down to a 4.9% top five
error rate, and that

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.920
was-- the winner of that
competition, the 2015 one,

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.452
was actually Microsoft.

00:42:50.452 --> 00:42:52.785
They've got the current state
of the art implementation,

00:42:52.785 --> 00:42:54.890
and so because it's the
ImageNet competition,

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:58.070
that means they can
identify exactly 1,000

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.770
different categories of images.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.050
So there are few
problems, actually,

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.240
with the implementation,
or just in general

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.300
with convolutional neural nets.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.710
So one of them is that
1,000 categories, well, it

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:10.700
may seem like a lot--

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.012
ImageNet is actually one of
the largest competitions--

00:43:14.012 --> 00:43:15.720
that's not actually
that many categories.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.500
So it doesn't contain things
like hot air balloons,

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.330
for instance.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:23.180
So these things that children
would be able to classify,

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.400
the neural nets actually
aren't able to, even

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.810
in the biggest competition.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:29.570
And each of these
categories also

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.940
requires thousands
of training images,

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.860
whereas you could
show a child a couple

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.560
examples of a dog
or a cat, and they'd

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.740
be able to, generally, get a
feel for what a dog or a cat

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.000
looks like.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.980
It takes thousands of images
per category for the neural

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.850
nets to learn, which means
that the total number of images

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.370
you need to train for
the ImageNet competition

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.510
is over a million.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.200
And so this leads to
very long training times,

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.360
even with all of the
heavy optimizations

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.300
that Ishwari was telling
us about like how

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.480
efficient convolution
is, it still

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.970
takes weeks to train on multiple
parallel GPUs working together

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:10.110
to train the net.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:12.260
There's actually a more
fundamental problem

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.500
with neural nets as well.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.410
So here on the left, we have a
school bus, some kind of bird,

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:20.174
and an Indian temple.

00:44:20.174 --> 00:44:21.840
And all of these
images on the left side

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.350
are actually
correctly identified

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.670
by convolutional neural nets.

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.980
But when we add this
small distortion here

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.290
in the middle, that doesn't
change any of the images

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:36.230
perceptively to the
human, this actually

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:39.660
causes the neural network
to misclassify these images,

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.170
and now all three of
them are ostriches.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.330
So that's a little weird.

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.020
How does this work?

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.960
How did we find
those distortions.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.750
So here on the left side, we see
how a neural network typically

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:51.250
works.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:53.690
You start with some
images, you put it

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.970
through the different layers
of the neural network,

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:58.630
and then it tells you
a certain probability

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:00.620
that it is a guitar,
or a penguin.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.160
So it classifies
it, and so we can

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.010
use a modification
of that method

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:11.120
by applying an
evolutionary algorithm,

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.700
or a hill-climbing or
gradient ascent algorithm.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.840
We take a couple of images,
and we put them through,

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.290
it classifies it, and we see
what the classification is.

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.590
And then we can do some
crossover between the images.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:27.170
So we take the ones that look
a lot like what we're training

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:31.150
for in the guitars or
penguins, in this case,

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:33.190
and we take the
features of those

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:35.692
that identify very
strongly as a guitar,

00:45:35.692 --> 00:45:37.900
and we combine those together
in the crossover phase.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.910
This is for the
evolutionary algorithm.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:42.690
Then we mutate the images,
which is making small changes

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.275
to each one, and
then we re-evaluate

00:45:45.275 --> 00:45:47.720
by plugging it back in
through the neural network,

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.850
and only the best
images, the ones

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:51.860
that looked the most
like a guitar or penguin,

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.397
are then selected for
the next iteration.

00:45:54.397 --> 00:45:56.980
And this continues until you get
to a very high identification

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.595
rates, even higher than
actual images of the objects.

00:46:01.935 --> 00:46:04.560
So using gradient ascent, these
are some of the images that you

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.000
could produce if you start
with just a flat grey image,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.530
and then you run it
through this algorithm.

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:13.890
So here on the side,
we have a backpack,

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.290
and we can actually
see the outline of what

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.200
looks like a backpack in there.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.790
And over here, we have what
looks like a Windsor tie

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.185
right here, but all of
these objects-- and perhaps,

00:46:24.185 --> 00:46:25.810
there are things in
these other images,

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:31.610
but they seem to be lost in
the LSD trip of colors here.

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:32.966
So that's kind of strange.

00:46:32.966 --> 00:46:34.590
That's definitely
not how humans do it.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:35.923
So let's try a different method.

00:46:35.923 --> 00:46:37.580
What if instead of
directly encoding,

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.200
which is where we change
individual pixels,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.710
what if we change
patterns in the images,

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.340
like different shapes?

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.980
Then this is the kind
of output that we get.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.830
So in the upper left,
we have a starfish.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.526
So you can see that it
has the orange and blue

00:46:52.526 --> 00:46:54.150
of the orange in the
starfish, and also

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.355
the blue of the ocean
of the environment

00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:59.320
that typical images of
starfish are taken in.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.810
And you can also see that it has
the points, the jagged lines,

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:06.194
the triangles that we associate
with the arms of a starfish.

00:47:06.194 --> 00:47:08.110
But the strange thing
here is that they're not

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.500
arranged in a circular pattern.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.840
They're not pointing
outwards like this,

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.230
like we would expect
of an actual starfish.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:19.920
So clearly, it's not latching
onto the same large scale

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.110
features that humans do.

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:25.470
It's actually just looking
at the low down features.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:27.530
Even though it's a
deep neural network,

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:32.040
it doesn't grab onto
these abstract concepts

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.980
like a human would.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.920
So the reason for this
problem, or at least

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.420
why we think neural
networks aren't

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:43.210
as good as humans at things
like this is the type of model.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.210
So a human would
have more of what's

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.150
called a generative model,
which means if we have examples

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:51.990
here, these dark blue
dots, say, of lines,

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:55.660
a few examples of
images of lines,

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.080
then we could construct a
probability distribution,

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.320
and say that images that
fall somewhere in this region

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.770
are lines.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:06.060
And over here, we have a few
examples of giraffes, say,

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:08.660
and so anything that falls in
this region would be a giraffe.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:12.710
And so if you had a red triangle
in here, that would be a lion.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:14.790
But if the red triangle
is instead over here,

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:17.220
it actually wouldn't
classify at all.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.570
We wouldn't know what that is.

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:21.370
We would say that's something
other than a lion or a giraffe,

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.990
but neural networks
don't work the same way.

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:25.480
They just draw a
decision boundary.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.505
They just draw lines between
the different categories.

00:48:29.505 --> 00:48:33.480
So they don't say that something
really far away from the lion

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.080
class is necessary not a lion.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.420
It just depends how far away it
is from the decision boundary.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.770
So if we have the red
triangle way over there,

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.030
it's very far away
from giraffes,

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:47.480
and it's just
generally closer lions,

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.890
even though it isn't explicitly
very close to it at all,

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:54.030
and that will still be
identified as a lion.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.200
So that's why we think
we're able to fool

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:01.290
these neural networks in such
a simplistic way or in such a

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:03.842
really abstract way.

00:49:03.842 --> 00:49:05.715
So the main takeaways
from our presentation,

00:49:05.715 --> 00:49:09.980
and the salient points
are that deep learning

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.200
is a very powerful tool
for image classification,

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.035
and it relies on multiple
layers of a network.

00:49:17.035 --> 00:49:19.570
So multiple processing layers.

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:24.190
Also CNNs outperform
basically every other method

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:27.570
for classifying images, and
that's their primary use

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:28.540
right now.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.810
We're currently
exploring other uses,

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:33.450
but that's generally
where it's at,

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.970
and this is because
convolutional filters are just

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:37.230
so incredibly powerful.

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:41.250
They're very fast
and very efficient.

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:44.670
Also back propagation is the way
that we train neural networks.

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:47.280
Normally, if you were to
train a neural network that

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.480
has a lot of layers, there's
actually an exponential growth

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:54.470
in the time it takes to train
because of the branching when

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.730
you go backwards because
each neuron is connected

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.590
to a large number of neurons
in the previous layer.

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:03.060
You get this exponential growth
in the number of dependencies

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:03.980
from a given neuron.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.910
By using back
propagation, it actually

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.690
reduces it to linear time
to train the networks.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.600
So this allows for
efficient training.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.410
And even with back
propagation and convolution

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:20.130
being so efficient, it still
takes a very large number

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:23.910
of images, and a long time
with a lot of processing power

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:27.900
to train neural networks.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.670
Also, if you'd
like to get started

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.550
working with neural
networks, there

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:36.870
are a couple of really nice
open source programming

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:38.290
platforms for neural networks.

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:41.480
So one of them that we used
for our pset was actually

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.440
TensorFlow, which is Google's
open source neural network

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.600
platform, and
another one would be

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.839
Cafe, which is Berkley's
neural network platform.

00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:51.380
And they actually
have an online demo

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.240
where you can plug in
images, and immediately

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.590
get identifications.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:59.560
So you can get started
very quickly with that one.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.410
Thank you.
