00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.670
PROFESSOR: Sometimes
psychologists like to talk

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.570
about two aspects of our mind,
the hot and the cool.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.290
So the cool parts we've been
talking about recently,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.970
thinking parts, like language,
thought, things related to

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.540
intelligence, problem solving,
the rational aspects of the

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.630
human mind.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.360
And today we're going to focus
on maybe the hottest of the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.240
hot, the emotions that we feel
and that color our lives in

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.120
terms of intensity and arousal
and what matters to us.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.590
And so we'll talk a little bit
about, just very briefly about

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.410
a thumbnail history of the
study of emotion, the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.160
scientific study of emotion,
ideas about how to define it,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.430
a few models of emotion, how
emotion might work, some big

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.440
questions about things like is
emotion universal, does it

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.990
correlate to bodily feelings?

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.160
Why do we have emotion?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.060
And then things about the
brain basis of emotions.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.010
So we have a huge number of
words, by one count about 550

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.860
words, that describe the
feelings we have,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.870
the emotions we have.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.740
And there's a lot of overlap
conceptually among them, but

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.260
we have so many words because
we think that, we feel that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.280
from our daily lives, the
feelings and emotions that we

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.950
have are such a big part of our
human existence, how we

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.640
relate to other people, how we
feel when we're by ourselves.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.790
Emotions are just a big,
big part of how we

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.280
go about our lives.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.090
And they're readily apparent
to us everywhere we look on

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.150
the faces of others.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.210
Positive emotions, negative
emotions, fearful emotions,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.740
you see them around
you all the time.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.270
In psychology, a lot of ideas
about formulating the field go

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.190
back to William James, who
worked at Harvard, who

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.260
articulated in many ways, in
language that's still relevant

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.030
to this day, the basic ideas,
the basic things about being a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.650
human that one wants to
understand out of a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.840
psychology.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.630
And he wrote about emotion this
way, "If you can conceive

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.430
of yourself suddenly stripped of
all the emotion with which

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.810
our world now inspires you, no
one portion of the universe

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.940
would have more important
characteristics beyond

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.460
another; and the whole character
of its things and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.770
series of events would be
without significance,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.960
character, expression, or
perspective." That what we

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.710
fear, what we desire, what
we enjoy, what we find

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.250
disgusting--

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.710
we'll talk a little bit about
disgust today-- that all those

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.950
things tell us what's important
and whether it's to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.070
be avoided or approached,
enjoyed or loathed.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.540
And so people have thought
about emotions.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.740
You could pick a million
different cultural directions.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.330
Here's a picture from
Greek philosophy.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.670
But you could pick
practically every

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.770
culture around the world.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.350
You can't be a human and
not think about the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.560
feelings you have.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.690
But kind of strikingly in terms
of research, for a very,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.150
very long time compared to
language or thinking or many

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.640
topics, people didn't study
emotion because it seemed hard

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.060
to study scientifically.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.210
And it's still harder to study
scientifically in many ways, I

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.480
think, than cognition.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.220
But there's been tremendous
progress in bringing

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.760
scientific approaches to
understanding something about

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.860
emotions in you and I. And
like many things, it was

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.400
reinvigorated around the
Renaissance and the mystery of

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.000
Mona Lisa's smile.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.460
And now there's entire journals
and conferences and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.420
organizations of scientific
psychology

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.730
devoted to study emotion.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.210
It's a big part of our lives.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.310
You would think in the study of
the human mind and brain it

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.690
would be a big endeavor.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.990
And it is now.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.430
But that wouldn't have been
true even 20 years ago.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.340
How might we define emotion
just to sort of have some

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.920
boundaries?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.200
So we could say that emotions
are biologically-based

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.010
responses to situations
that are seen

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.579
as personally relevant.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.709
They are shaped by learning and
usually involves changes

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.400
in peripheral physiology.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.430
Your hands are trembling
or things like that.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.700
Your heart is pounding.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.170
Expressive behavior, the
intonation with which you

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.740
speak, the facial expression
that you

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.100
have or see in others.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.650
And subjective experience.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.690
The emotions you have go with
what you feel is going on

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.780
inside you.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.280
Research has tried to
distinguish between moods and

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.700
emotions, and talk about moods
as diffuse, long-lasting

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.670
emotional states.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.150
When you're in a funk or a
positive mood over days,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.480
weeks, months, that's
not what we're going

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.250
to talk about today.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.160
That's interesting and
important also.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.640
We're going to talk about
emotions, which are very

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.110
punctate, immediate responses
to situations, to a specific

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.910
thing or a specific stress or
a specific element of your

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.420
environment, an immediate,
strong response.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.450
And within that, one more
distinction has turned out to

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.050
be useful for thinking about
emotions between two

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.920
dimensions, arousal, or
you could call it

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.670
intensity, and valence.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.200
Arousal means things that are
exciting, intense, if they're

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.870
high arousal, or calm
or lethargic

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.320
if they're low arousal.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.840
Valence refers to whether it's
a positive thing that makes

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.500
you elated or contented,
negative sad or gloomy.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.060
And you can already
see, for example,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.720
take positive valence.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.150
Elated is high arousal.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.220
Contented, ah, that's
low arousal.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.900
They're both positive, but
they're kind of different.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.790
So is calm versus lethargic.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.520
Being calm can be
sometimes good.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.150
Feeling really slow, really
lethargic, also is low

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.570
arousal, but it's usually not
a desirable low arousal.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.580
And so people think that they
can take basically these two

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.850
dimensions, valence and arousal,
and use it as a

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.080
useful way to say something
like calm is here.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.970
It's a little bit positive
and it's low

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.550
on the arousal dimension.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.690
Excited is up here.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.070
It's a positive valence.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.020
Different things, gloomy is
negative and it's fairly

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.280
intense feeling, as opposed
to merely lethargic.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.170
These two dimensions can cover
a big sense of the life of

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.610
emotions that inhabit us.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.430
And a huge question, and one
that's brutally hard to

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.865
satisfy in some deep scientific
way, of course, is

00:06:33.865 --> 00:06:35.540
it restricted to humans?

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.110
So if you hang around pets
and animals in various

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.660
circumstances, you can't help
but feel they have emotions.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.890
It's just very hard for us
to ask them to fill out

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.900
questionnaires telling
us their emotions.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.250
Here's a chimp that has lost
its mother recently.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.034
Here's a dog going out
for a good old night.

00:06:57.034 --> 00:06:59.330
Here's an armadillo
going, whee!

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.520
It looks pretty aroused.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.480
We don't know how much of this
in some cases is us reading

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.060
human feelings into their
expressions, how much of that

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.200
is them feeling the
same as we do.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.650
There's a lot of sense,
obviously, that many species

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.990
have feelings as
well as humans.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.810
We'll focus just on
humans today.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.140
And the other thing that's
important is

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.020
they're shaped by learning.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.450
What that means is many
different things, but for

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.210
example, they can vary from
one culture to another in

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.200
certain ways.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.520
And here's one example of a
movie that's bringing tears to

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.270
everybody's eyes, except
this person who

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.380
finds it utterly hilarious.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.870
If you work in emotion
research, I can

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.750
tell you you get that.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.880
I worked a little bit on that.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.420
You show some really horrible
pictures to everybody.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.910
They go, oh, horrible,
horrible, horrible.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.190
And somebody else
starts laughing.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.920
It's like horror movies.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.540
Have you've been around horror
movies where some people are

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.800
really scared out of their seats
and very worried about

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.010
the characters and other
people think

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.110
it's all pretty funny?

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.930
So that's your prospective.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.730
It's not an automatic response
to many situations.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.310
So how have people thought about
the emotion you feel

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.580
when a bear jumps out of your
closet unexpectedly?

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.540
Here's the logical one.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.310
Common sense.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.340
Bear is scary.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.970
You feel fearful.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.650
That's your subjective
experience.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.460
And your body starts to
do things like your

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.770
heart starts to pump.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.290
Your sweat glands start
to sweat, because

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.390
you go, this is dangerous.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.110
This is scary.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.100
Here comes my body.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.370
That would be the
intuitive one.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.770
My heart is pounding because
I feel afraid.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.380
Interestingly, you can reverse
the order and find some things

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.780
that are better explained
that way.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.480
It's sometimes nice, sometimes
people will say, oh my gosh.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.659
Everything in psychology
is so obvious.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.200
For some reason, they always
say, my grandmother

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.630
would have known it.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.610
I don't know why they
pick that example.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.650
Show us something that science
only can tell you.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.060
So here's a very clever reversal
from William James

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.780
and also Lange.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.730
They reversed it.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.860
They said that first comes the
bodily response to the

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.210
situation and second comes your
mind interpreting your

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.790
body's primary response.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.200
The exact opposite order of
why we feel as we do.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.160
"We feel sorry because we cry,
angry because we strike,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.570
afraid because we tremble, and
not that we strike, cry, or

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.660
tremble because we are sorry,
angry, or fearful." He sees

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.870
the exact opposite.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.770
Here it says first comes an
emotion that's shaking your

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.560
body in some way, and then comes
to your mind saying,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.030
aha, I'm afraid--

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.110
pretty fast--

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.840
or I'm happy or whatever.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.150
Here's some examples, because
you could think, OK, yes, you

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.120
can cleverly reverse them.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.570
But is there any science to
suggest that in some cases

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.490
that relationship
does reverse?

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.360
So here's what people did.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.760
And I'll show you a
picture for this.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.160
They said, how can peripheral
bodily events, things on sort

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.230
of the edge of our bodies,
influence the

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.270
emotions we feel inside?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.710
So they would have people do
things like hold a pencil

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.630
tightly between their
teeth and--

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.530
look at that pencil.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.830
They're not told to smile.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.570
They're just told to keep
that pencil there.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.100
And what does that look like?

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.040
A smile, right?

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.530
OK.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.490
You've tricked the person's
face into smiling.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.940
And they don't even know
that, necessarily.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.720
They're thinking, this is a
weird psychology experiment

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.750
about how long can you hold a
pencil in your mouth, although

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.240
they're going to know something
more in a moment.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.300
Or between the lips,
hold that pencil.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.440
Now, does this person
look happy?

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:18.590
No.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.910
A little bit not happy, right?

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.880
OK.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.930
And then you have them watch a
funny movie that most people

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.250
find funny.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.080
And they rate how much
they like it.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:36.330
And the person who had this one
rates it as more enjoyable

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.630
than the person holding a pencil
this way, as if already

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.050
having the muscles in your face
moved into a position

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.190
that typically signals happiness
or laughter makes

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.860
you feel happy inside and the
funny movie is even funnier.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.810
Being in a somewhat neutral to
negative position makes that

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.610
same funny movie seem
less funny.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.380
You're interpreting where your
muscles are that normally go

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.360
with one emotion or another,
and that's driving your

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.640
internal final emotion about how
you feel about the movie.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.274
Was there a question?

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:10.574
AUDIENCE: Could it require more

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:11.824
concentration, or patience?

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.340
PROFESSOR: Does one require
more concentration?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.820
That's an excellent question,
because we always like to say,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.690
oh, it's this thing.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.580
What if this is a harder
thing like that?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.130
And so when one have to
hope-- and I have to

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.800
admit I don't know--

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.690
that they've controlled for
things like that in some way.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.710
If you read the research paper,

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.390
you'd want to be concerned.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.730
That's an excellent question.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.680
If this is just harder work than
maybe you're paying less

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.750
attention to the movie and just
hanging onto that pencil.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.730
I don't know.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.360
And I have to hope they did
a good job on this.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.390
That's an excellent question.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.510
And here's other ones, again,
where they're trying to get

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.260
the face to go smiley
or go frowny.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.040
And then they just ask them,
how do you feel?

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.810
And this person will rate
themselves as feeling happier

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.280
than this person as they answer
on a piece of paper in

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.020
front of them.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.860
Again, they're trying to say, if
I can move your peripheral

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.010
facial expressions into--

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.260
your muscles into expressions,
the feelings will follow from

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.510
the expressions.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.050
You can also do something else,
which is you can tell

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.130
people-- so Paul Ekman, his name
will come up a lot today.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.510
He's done a fantastic amount of
the key research on this,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.980
making emotions into a research
topic in many ways.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.480
What he developed is a way that
he said, I'm going to

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.300
describe objectively which
muscles are in which position

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.800
for each of six fundamental
emotional expressions.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.260
We'll come back to those.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.500
So he would tell a person, raise
your eyebrows and pull

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.300
them together.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.620
Raise your upper eyelids.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.450
Now stretch your lips
horizontally back

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.430
towards your ears.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.650
So what he's giving this person,
step by step, is

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.750
directions that move the muscles
into an expression of

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.040
fear, by the time you
end up there.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.860
The participant usually doesn't
know that, because

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.340
it's so weird.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.200
You're moving your mouth.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.790
You're moving--

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.300
it's just so weird.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.160
But then they can do these
kinds of experiments.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.340
And these people will report a
fearful movie as being more

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.600
fearful than somebody who just
gets to sit there or whose

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.580
muscles are moved into
a happy position.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.240
So all of a sudden you've got
all these peripheral things

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.770
being interpreted by our mind
as a signal for what emotion

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.140
you have, or enhancing
it anyway.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.500
And then because any strong
theory usually turns out to be

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.980
not nearly complicated enough,
you get the wishy-washy middle

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.760
that probably covers more of
the truth, which is both

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.050
things are going on.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.350
Both you're having a subjective
cognitive

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.810
interpretation of your
environment and a bodily

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.680
response, maybe more
in parallel than

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.860
one driving the other.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.110
So again, how can peripheral
bodily

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.690
events influence emotions?

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.570
One idea that's floated around,
and probably true, is

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.540
that the perception or
thought, your mental

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.670
interpretation of your emotion
tells you the type of emotion.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.980
so if a bear jumps out, you
can say, OK, I know

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.150
something's pretty intense.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.050
And I can tell you right
away it's bad.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.040
But if something wonderful
jumps out of your closet

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.140
unexpectedly, then you
go, oh my gosh.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.460
I can't believe Lindsay Lohan
is visiting me and I didn't

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.170
even know it.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:10.540
Then if that is considered
a good visit, that would

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.790
influence again, the
interpretation, but the

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.720
intensity might come from
the bodily parts.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.440
How intense it is might
be signaled from that.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.590
So here's a couple of ways
that people explore this.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.700
Here's a study from years ago
from Schacter, where he

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.580
injected people with
adrenaline--

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:31.100
adrenaline is the neurohormone
that goes with high arousal,

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.440
it raises your heart rate--

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.440
or a placebo.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.290
So he's directly taking the
chemical that we normally

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.560
produce under higher
arousal conditions.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.780
And the first question you might
ask is, and you might be

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.890
curious about, if somebody gave
you a shot of adrenaline,

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:47.610
what would happen?

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:48.950
Would you like jump out
of your seat and run

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:49.910
laps around the room?

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.200
What would you do?

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.440
And surprisingly, all by
itself, not very much.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.670
People said they feel a bit
jittery, like if you've had

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.730
maybe a little too much
coffee or Red Bull--

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:00.980
is that the current?--

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.570
that little jittery feeling.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.260
But they're not like jumping
up and do jumping jacks and

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.380
one-armed push-ups and
stuff like that.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.920
Now, having had the placebo or
the adrenaline injected into

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.950
you, and you don't know
that, they show you an

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.130
emotion-eliciting--

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.330
they'll show you a movie,
like a horror movie.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.470
And the people who had the
adrenaline will report more

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.880
fear when they see the horror
movie, more anger when they

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.640
get insulted.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.130
That's a fun experiment
when you insult them.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.840
I'm sure the IRB, you have
to be pretty careful.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.370
More laughter for a comedy.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.860
Adrenaline seemed to amplify the
intensity of the emotion.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.390
But the emotion was driven
by the situation.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.150
Does that make sense?

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.770
OK?

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.680
But here's something quite
interesting about humans,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.540
which is that if you told
them, we've given you

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.690
adrenaline and it usually
amplifies stuff, then it

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.850
disappeared.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:57.200
Once the person knew that, they
could discount that in

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.690
their mind.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.210
So it's not like adrenaline is
your master, and that I must

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.800
have twice as big a response.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.650
Once you knew that was in the
picture, then the ratings went

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.300
back to placebo.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.840
It's not that biology
is destiny.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.080
But under normal circumstances,
it seems like

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.290
the adrenaline accentuates
the intensity.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.170
So that would go with the
possibility that peripheral

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.630
stuff drives the intensity,
peripherally injected

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.720
adrenaline, and our mind's

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.550
interpretation drives the content.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:30.760
Here's a sort of fun, slightly
sexist experiment that in the

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.100
end, I think, explains the
following phenomenon.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.407
When you see famous movie stars
go into a movie set, on

00:16:36.407 --> 00:16:39.040
set, or whatever they call it,
you incredibly often hear

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.230
about romances occurring between
the leads, right?

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.370
And there's debates about what
this is just the press agent

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.500
selling their movie
or whatever.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.200
But you hear that all
the time, right?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.490
OK.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.340
So I'm going to tell you
why that happens

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.290
when it really happens.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.220
I can't really tell you that.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.060
But I can tell you an
experiment that

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.300
might touch on that.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.450
So here's the experiment.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.120
This was done by Dutton
and Aron in

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.770
North Vancouver, Canada.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.720
And they did the experiment in
an area where there were two

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.500
bridges not right next to each
other, pretty near each other.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.170
One was a flimsy suspension
bridge, five feet wide,

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.200
swaying and wobbling 320
feet over jagged

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.880
boulders and river rapids.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.750
So you have to imagine
Indiana Jones, OK?

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:16.960
And you come to this
bridge and you're

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.900
going, I don't know.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.750
OK.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.089
The other one, upstream, same
river, same Canadian district.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.030
There's a steady, low,
broad bridge.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.520
No problem at all.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.670
You could drive your car
over that, no problem.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.290
Two bridges over the
same waters, one

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.900
seeming scary, one not.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.390
Then what they did is in the
middle of each bridge they

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.210
placed an attractive, in this
case female, confederate.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.240
Maybe somebody's done the
reverse gender experiment.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.560
I don't know.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.110
Anyway, as men walk across the
bridge, they ask them to fill

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.230
out a questionnaire, some
boring questionnaire.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.940
And they casually mentioned that
if that person, as they

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.670
finish the questionnaire, has
more questions, he can call

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.670
the woman providing the
questionnaire at home.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.060
And she provides him
her home number.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.290
And the measure that they have
is how many phone calls go

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:12.180
from the male subjects to the
female experimenter at home.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.230
And they're betting that it's
not really scientific

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.880
curiosity that's driving a
lot of the phone calling.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.550
But here's what they
actually find.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.300
More males will call that female
at home if they were on

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.930
the dangerous bridge than
on the safe bridge.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.220
That's the actual finding.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.000
And the interpretation is this,
the dangerous bridge,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.520
because of the true feeling of
danger, produces high arousal,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.350
increased adrenalin.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.980
And that's misinterpreted, if
you want to call it that, by

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.940
the male because he thinks now
he's super-attracted to that

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.910
woman because of the
swaying bridge.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.770
Another reason to take somebody
you want to win over,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.370
whatever the gender situation
is, a really scary roller

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.290
coaster ride is highly
recommended together with that

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:01.480
warm beverage, as long as it
doesn't spill on them.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.550
I'm making you too powerful
to control people.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.300
Again, the arousal of the bridge
has been misinterpreted

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.030
by that person as an intense
attraction to that woman.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.230
And you could imagine making
movies are probably high

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:17.220
arousal exciting situations,
and that would promote

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.310
romantic relations and high
intense situations that might

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.030
not otherwise occur.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.280
Yes?

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.990
They had to randomly assign
them to one bridge or the

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.290
other, you would hope.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.140
I can tell you there's been a
bunch of other experiments

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.250
sort of like this.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.300
This is the most what you could
call ecological, silly,

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.830
or sexist, you could figure.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.470
But they all go with this idea
that if you're in a high

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.840
arousal situation, you sort of
move over that arousal into

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.070
whatever it is you're
encoding.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.830
Does that make sense?

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.850
And in this case, because you're
creating an interaction

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.760
between a man and woman, it's
promoting this probability of

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.890
a sense of romance
in the male.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:54.910
Is that OK?

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.130
But it could be any situation.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.220
The arousal will make it-- if
it's something, it can make

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.210
you feel worse about it.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.380
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.650
Totally excellent question.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:06.900
You're asking awesome
questions.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.560
I have to assume-- and I should

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.590
know this, but I don't--

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.530
that they weren't.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:18.120
Yes, because if you had males
self-selecting, you had some

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.710
males running to the danger
bridge, drawn to danger, and

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.060
others saying, oh, please give
me a safe road, is that the

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.370
real difference.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.120
So you have to presume
they did something to

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.020
control that, yes.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.270
Excellent question.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.480
The current view is something
like that there's two factors,

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.820
that there's both.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.060
A bodily response that happens
pretty fast, pretty

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.470
automatically, pretty
unconsciously.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.030
There's a lot of
interpretation.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.300
And the combination of that
bodily response and an

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.960
interpretation leads you finally
to the subjective

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.440
experience you have, and
probably works differently for

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.200
different emotions.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.050
And things are complicated.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.350
But we're pretty far from this
first guess in terms of the

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.920
fact that peripheral things can
have very powerful effects

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.730
on how you interpret situations,
the intensity of

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:04.910
your interpretations.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.400
And the intensity itself can
change the behaviors that

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.580
follows the situation.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.410
Three questions in the field
are, are emotions universal?

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.110
Are they in you from
when you're born?

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.010
Are they the same for people
around the world?

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.895
Do they have unique
physiological signatures?

00:21:18.895 --> 00:21:20.460
Could we define--

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.450
if we knew your heart rate, if
we knew your pulse and so on,

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.380
could we know what emotional
state you're in.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.700
And then speculations as to why
we have emotions at all.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.100
What's the use of
having emotions?

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.930
Brilliant as he is in so many
ways, in many ways this

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.930
dialogue began in modern times
with Charles Darwin, who

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.270
noticed that animals had very
striking facial expressions,

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.070
as we saw before.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.260
And that made him think about
the evolution of facial

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.540
expressions.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.360
This is one of his drawings
of a cat.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.930
Here are infants having early
displays of emotions, joy,

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.490
disgust, surprise, sadness,
anger, fear.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.140
So people have been very
impressed that very early on

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.600
infants are having the full
array of expressions.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.500
Of course, they might
see them.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.410
From moments from their birth
they have people around them.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.920
But it's very early, that's
almost for sure.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.430
A really interesting line of
research-- and I'll show you

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.810
an example-- has been looking
at emotional expressions,

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.970
emotional facial expressions, in
people who are born deaf or

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.040
born blind, so they never
hear intonation.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.150
They never see a facial
expression.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.150
They can't learn it from
their environments.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:34.493
So they're sort of a natural
window into is this inborn in

00:22:34.493 --> 00:22:37.520
us, or do we learn it from
people around us?

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.910
Here's an experiment where they
took spontaneous facial

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.970
expressions of emotion in
athletes from both the

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:45.670
Olympics and the Paralympics.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.760
And they looked especially at
congenitally blind people,

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.760
born blind, never saw a face,
and sighted athletes.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.630
And they looked at the
expressions after winning or

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.880
losing an Olympic-level match.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.830
Before I show you this, you
may know the story.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.860
What happens after
an Olympic event?

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.930
Somebody wins and where
do they go?

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.960
You know this podium thing?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.030
The gold medal winners up here,
and the silvers here and

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.090
the bronzes here.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.160
And they've also done
studies--this

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.880
is just a side note--

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:18.602
saying, who looks the happiest
in those pictures?

00:23:18.602 --> 00:23:19.460
AUDIENCE: Bronze.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.960
PROFESSOR: The bronze
medal winner.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.680
Who looks the saddest
in those pictures?

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.420
AUDIENCE: Silver.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.430
PROFESSOR: The silver, right?

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.070
Because the bronze medal
winner's going, thank goodness

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.010
I came in third place.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.700
I'm on the podium.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.510
I have an Olympic medal.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.720
If I'm in fourth place, fourth
through infinity gets the same

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.350
Olympic medal, right?

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.970
The silver medalist, what's
he or she thinking?

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.180
On average.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.590
Man, if I had just one more
fraction of a millisecond, I

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.110
could be the gold medalist.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.160
It's kind of an interesting
thing of when we consider

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.980
things satisfactory or not.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.390
But now let's turn back
to this question.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:55.600
Here's two people who just lost
Olympic medal matches.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.770
And your question is which is a
sighted person and which is

00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:59.820
a blind person?

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.560
And to the extent it's hard to
be certain, that would be a

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.350
big suggestion that these
expressions are inborn in us,

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:10.890
because a person who's never
seen a sad expression still

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.050
has a sad expression.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.020
And the answer is, that's the
blind athlete and that's the

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:16.800
sighted athlete.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.720
So it's pretty convincing, I
think, that we're born with

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.320
this set of expressions as a
core entity of being human.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.630
Even though we're born with
that, we live in different

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.780
cultures, very different
cultures around the world, and

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.550
even within countries and
across countries.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.470
So how universal are these
sorts of things?

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.870
And there's lots of evidence
of a degree of influence of

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:46.260
cultures around this
core universality.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.720
So does a smile mean friendship
to everyone?

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.550
And again, Ekman and Izard made
a big study in which they

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.680
argued that as far as they can
tell in looking around at

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.690
facial expressions, there's
six basic emotional

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:03.860
expressions that signal
feelings, happiness, sadness,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:08.070
fear, anger, surprise,
or disgust.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.040
These are all people who are
trained to try to make the

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.300
perfect expression
of those things.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.280
They look kind of weird
by themselves, right?

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.780
They look kind of weird.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.240
You don't see a neutral
one here.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.370
Maybe we'll see a neutral
one later.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:22.380
Neutral is kind of weird,
because you

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.710
go, well, it's neutral.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.310
But I can tell you, a totally
neutral face looking at you

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.680
can be kind of creepy.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.630
Because if you interact with
somebody and they have no

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:34.210
expression at all, it's
a little disturbing.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:39.320
But these are ones are pretty
universally recognized, but

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.410
not completely.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.145
Let's take Westerners,
people from the

00:25:42.145 --> 00:25:45.150
United States or Europe.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.100
We're not perfect in that.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.070
Even with these posed pictures,
this is how often

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.530
people came up with the
correct labels.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.040
Pretty often, not perfect.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.100
There's a lot of mystery
at the edges of this.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.310
But here's how people came up
from non-Western cultures for

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.830
the same Western faces.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:03.670
Well above chance, but not the
same as Westerners looking at

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.300
Western expressions.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.110
And it would reverse if
Westerners had to look at

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.080
non-Western expressions.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.990
So there's definitely a degree
of cultural influences on the

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.560
recognition of these expressions
as well.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.770
It's partly innate and
universal, and there's a

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.420
cultural overlay as well.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.560
This is a joke.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.370
"Shoot!

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.390
You've got not only the wrong
planet, but you've got the

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.240
wrong solar system.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.500
I mean, a wrong planet
I can understand.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.510
But a wrong solar system--" And
you can tell with just a

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:32.310
little information that this
is a sheepish smile of

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.310
embarrassment.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.970
And this is a little bit of
the body expression of a

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.850
little bit of irksomeness.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.760
Irked.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.510
But here's an isolated
pre-literate

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.810
tribe in New Guinea.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:48.220
And that smile looks like the
smile of any kid you ever saw.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.735
That's sadness, the sadness
of any kid you every saw.

00:26:50.735 --> 00:26:54.370
That's a little bit
of a disgust.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.570
And some people have built up
a model, something like

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:00.730
there's things in the
environment that happen that

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:04.560
drive some sort of facial
affect program.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.760
Your muscles in your face move
to express 6 or so different

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.720
kinds of feelings.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.210
Cultural rules about what should
you show, what should

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.180
you not show in different
cultures.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.530
Some face's expressions are more
appreciated than others.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.540
And finally, all of that
moves into the facial

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.570
expression you make.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.290
So now the second question we
have, we think to a first

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.500
approximation emotions, at least
as far as we can tell,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.590
are pretty universal but there's
cultural and learned

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.540
pieces as well.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.460
Do emotions have unique
physiological signatures?

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.340
Can we tell from your

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.620
physiology what you're feeling?

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.830
And there was a lot of hope that
this would work, because

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.320
intuitively emotions differ
from one another.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.790
Our body feels different
as we go from

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.300
one emotion to another.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.330
And we use language words like
"she got hot and bothered."

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.550
"You make my blood boil." "He's
just letting off steam."

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.780
Different physiologies go
with different feelings.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.300
And so people hoped they could
make decision trees like this.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.150
Let's measure your heart
rate, high or low.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.360
Well, if it's high, then we
get your skin temperature.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.630
And then we can tell if you're
angry or fear or sad.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.340
That you could make a decision
tree by looking at peripheral

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.950
measures of physiology.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.150
But it never worked.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.700
It's never been strongly
discriminating.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.320
People have not been able
to have a physiological

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.030
fingerprint for the emotion
that you feel that's

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.210
reasonably accurate.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.592
Yes?

00:28:26.592 --> 00:28:28.593
AUDIENCE: So why are they
[INAUDIBLE] as something that

00:28:28.593 --> 00:28:30.958
could go in that tree,
for instance?

00:28:30.958 --> 00:28:33.190
Could they measure chemical
concentrations in places?

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.870
PROFESSOR: It's possible, yes.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.180
Here's a very good question.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.730
Here they're measuring
peripheral physiology or

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.030
autonomic systems, skin
temperature, heart rate.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.580
Could there be other things
like chemicals, right?

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.720
So I'd say yes, but we just
don't know them well enough.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.890
Or could you have brain measures
that ultimately would

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.010
be sophisticated enough?

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.390
I can tell you that brain
measures are not that

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.530
good at that now.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.180
But could they be someday?

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:54.890
Yes.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.210
So yes, it's the specific
measures that we have.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:03.800
A really deep question will be
at some level when you're

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.960
fearful and I'm fearful, how
identical will those be,

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.070
depending on our cultural
background, depending on

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.500
situations we've experienced?

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.300
We can both agree we're scared
of something, but it could be

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.550
pretty different.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.490
So it's a really
deep question.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.650
In the end, how close are these
things from one person

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:22.850
to another?

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:28.620
Now, at least at speculative
is why we have emotions.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:33.380
And sometimes people think
it's intrapersonal

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.240
functions within us.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.920
We're organizing ourselves--
what's our basic feeling?

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.290
Are we basically happy or sad
about something or fearful of

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.240
something?--

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.960
so that we use that feeling as
a source of information to

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.630
sort of pull ourselves
to say, this is

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:46.800
basically where I'm at.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.070
It's a source of information
for me.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.760
And it can tell me what behavior
makes sense to do in

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.220
this context.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.640
And then from one person to
another, interpersonally.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.610
What does that person feel?

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.610
What am I signalling
to that person?

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.150
So here's an experiment.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.890
And I'll show you just a brief
YouTube video on this, because

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.210
I think it's really cute.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.380
But it's almost a life and death
experiment, although no

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.410
infant was harmed in the making
of this experiment.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:15.270
So what they do is, this
is a visual cliff.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.970
An infant is put on this,
a very tiny baby.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.360
Here it's hard Plexiglas.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.020
There is no danger
to the baby.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.500
But there is a drop here
and a drop here.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.890
Now, as the baby approaches
this, they're not used to the

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.120
idea of Plexiglas.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.300
Even you and I would be pretty
worried about that if it was

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.700
on a larger scale.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.260
We'd want to be pretty sure
about the strength of the

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.450
Plexiglas But to the infant's
eyes, they're approaching what

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.460
they call a visual cliff.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.120
On the other side--

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.740
I'll show the film
in a moment--

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.450
is a mother.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:50.030
And the mother can either be
showing a positive expression

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.070
or a negative expression.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.960
And look what happens to the
infants in this perilous

00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:01.940
situation where they see a drop
that's a big, and how

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.630
much they trust their mother's
expression to know what to do.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.120
So if the mother is looking
happy, like it's OK.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:09.880
This is going to be great.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.100
We're having a lot of fun.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.970
3/4 of the time the infant
goes for it.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.510
If the mother looks
scary, never.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:22.120
They're making kind of a
dangerous decision entirely on

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.750
the facial expression of the
mother and their trust that

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.050
the mother knows the right thing
to do and is giving them

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.300
the right advice.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.820
Sometimes everything in
psychology can just seem like,

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:38.720
oh, it's just another thing.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.030
But facial expressions are an
unbelievable powerful way that

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.280
we communicate with
one another.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:51.660
Here's an extremely clever
experiment from Adam Anderson,

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.540
who happened to be a
postdoctoral fellow in my lab,

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.200
but he did this completely
independently.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.970
Here's the question.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.640
So we have some different
expressions.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.390
And you could say, well, are
they completely random as to

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:05.310
what the actual expression is?

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.330
We haven't even asked this.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.610
Why does a smile go one way and
a frown go the other way?

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.200
Does it mean anything or are
they just arbitrary signals of

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.820
different emotions that have
evolved over time?

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.385
And he's almost the first
person I know to

00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:18.600
even ask this question.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.980
And he looked at two emotions
that we'll come back to in

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:28.540
just a little bit, fear,
and disgust.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.830
And he thought, well, look, it's
kind of interesting what

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.660
fear and disgust do.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.340
For example, fear, your eyes
get bigger, disgust--

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:41.770
think about something
really stinky--

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:42.580
you close your eyes.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.490
You sort of scrunch
up your nose.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:45.330
Look at this.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.830
And he looked at and measured
how airflow patterns and

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.150
different things happen when you
go into those expressions,

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:56.610
non-arbitrary properties
of an expression.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.100
And then he did psychological
expressions.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.620
He got people to get into
these expressions.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.560
And he found that if they were
in a fearful expression, that

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.490
they would feel like they had a
wider field of view, and if

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.820
it's disgust, a smaller.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.720
Now think about this
for a moment.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.020
When it's fearful, do you want
to feel like you know what's

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.390
going on around you?

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.210
Or do you want to sit back
and think about stuff?

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.880
Or do you want to
say like, uh-oh.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.570
Where do I run?

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.020
What's going on?

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.480
When you go into some disgusting
situation, do you

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.020
want to really look
around a lot?

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.150
Or are you kind of happy to
find some way out of it?

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.420
Same thing with your nose.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.390
Here's the air velocity that's
passing through your nose when

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.940
you're fearful and when
you're disgusted.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.980
Now you don't even
think about that.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.980
Who's thinking, I'm controlling
my air velocity?

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.420
But why do you think you might
want to really sample your

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:56.420
environment when you feel
danger, visually and in an

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:56.990
olfactory way?

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.240
Why do you think you might
want to sample?

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.450
Well, you want to know
what's going on.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.690
You want the information
as fast as possible.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:02.360
Do I run?

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.200
Do I duck?

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.890
What do I do?

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.960
Do I fight, flee?

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.605
What do I do?

00:34:05.605 --> 00:34:08.940
I have moments to decide,
because I'm in danger.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.790
If you're in a disgust
situation, are you interested,

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.750
typically, in exploring the
olfactory environment in as

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:18.080
much detail as you can?

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.510
Usually not.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:20.699
So it's kind of interesting.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:21.372
The very first time --

00:34:21.372 --> 00:34:23.000
I know, it's very clever --

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.699
asked where do these expressions
come from?

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:28.940
Well, maybe they tend, to a
certain extent, to exaggerate

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.409
or diminish forms of sensory
input that are relevant for

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:35.159
the emotion.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.500
So for the last little bit I'm
going to talk about for a

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.360
little while what we know
about the brain

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.550
basis of some emotions.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.290
We already talked about the idea
that the amygdala plays a

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.210
special role in fear.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.659
And I'll show you a couple
different ways in

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:46.929
which that's true.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.949
This is just sitting in front of
the hippocampus, one on the

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:51.760
left, one on the right,
the core elements

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.889
of your limbic system.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.820
Here it is viewed from the
side, the amygdala.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.520
Here's the actual amygdala
from a post-mortem brain.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.890
And there's another whole level
of analysis that animal

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.140
researchers do that we can't
touch today, which is the

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.670
amygdala itself is made out of
bundles of neurons called

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.300
nuclei, very distinct ones that
have different roles,

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.140
different inputs, different
outputs.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.940
And in animal research, where
you can selectively influence

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.180
one or the other, you can see
they have quite different

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.070
specific roles.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:26.500
In humans we don't have that
precision of control, so we

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.740
sort of have some clump average

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.530
statements about the amygdala.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.350
But really we're mixing together
a few functions.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:37.200
So you already saw this picture,
that animals, mice or

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.050
rats, that have an amygdala
removed lose the fear they

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.395
ought to have of a cat.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.570
In primate studies, they found
that if they have amygdala

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:50.610
lesions, the loss of threat
appreciation impairs social

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.460
fitness, that animals that don't
know what they ought to

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.730
be afraid of get into
big trouble.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.560
They lose their position in
dominance hierarchies.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.830
You may know primate groups
tend to have dominance

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.170
hierarchies, a sort of
alpha male and so on.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.800
They slide down that.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.360
If they lesion the dominant
male, the alpha male, the male

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.930
who wins all the fights and
controls the group, that

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.850
animal will fall down the
hierarchy and become

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:15.690
subordinate.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.130
And in the wild, they've shown
that if they do lesions and

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.930
return the animal to the social
situation, they get

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.980
rejected by the other animals,
because the other animals feel

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.300
there's something weird
about the animals.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.840
And they're often isolated and
they get to early death,

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.210
because the other animals
are not helping them

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.550
or supporting them.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:33.400
So very important for learning
what's dangerous.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.130
Here's an experiment with rhesus
monkeys lesioned at two

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.660
weeks as infants, returned to
their mothers, and tested at

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.660
eight weeks.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.130
And here's an example of
something, this is if you show

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.310
an animal a novel object.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:47.950
And this is how often
they respond to it.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:52.590
Young animals will often not
explore it, because they go,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.050
well, I don't know.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.560
That could be dangerous.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.090
They're waiting for their
mother's expression.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.420
Here's the other animals with
the amygdala lesions.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.800
They'll explore it.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.090
In a sense, they're fearless.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:05.820
But that's probably not an ideal
thing to do when you're

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.880
an infant exploring the world.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:17.350
Or they'll put food only or
food next to a play snake.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:19.460
Snakes are dangerous
for monkeys.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.360
They usually don't want to
figure out at this age is it a

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.480
play snake or a real snake?

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.480
They just say, I don't really
need to eat that.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.400
So everybody likes the food.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.070
Put the snake next to it, and
the control animals go, no, I

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.800
don't think so, basically.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.520
The amygdala ones, what's
for dinner?

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.260
And the answer is, if it's a
real snake, you're for dinner.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.180
So they lose the fear of things
they ought to have fear

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:47.700
of, they lose fear of unknown
things, fear of things they

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.190
ought to be afraid of.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.290
So the amygdala plays this
really important role.

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.180
Fear sometimes is maybe the
best understood emotion in

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.430
terms of brain processes, and
maybe the most studied, partly

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.130
because we've had some success
in understanding what's going

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.080
on and partly because fear is
maybe the emotion that most

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.780
people think is closer
to survival.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.110
You fear what kills you.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.510
You fear what pains you.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:12.640
That's a very powerful emotion
for survival and safety.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.310
And you can do fear
conditioning.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.510
We talked about conditioning
before in all species, from

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:22.050
humans to primates, other
mammals, fruit flies.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:26.310
All of them have, to a first
approximation, similar fear

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.890
conditioning.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:30.220
It's as if you're alive, you
have to fear things that are

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.960
scary and dangerous.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.680
So people have done fear
conditioning experiments.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.370
And now you know
this very well.

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.090
You might hear a tone that's
not scary at first.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.780
If you put it with something
that you don't like, like a

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.590
foot shock, you get fearful
to the tone.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:47.340
And what people have discovered
kind of remarkably

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.920
is that you can make lesions in
many parts of the brain and

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.880
you don't affect that learned
fearfulness to the tone.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.940
But if you make a damage in the
part of the amygdala, you

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:58.940
abolish that learning.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:03.500
These animals fail to learn the
signal of something that

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.050
is coming up to be painful
and dangerous.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:08.700
And you can even make large
lesions in the cortex.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.490
That doesn't affect anything.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.740
And these animals with the
amygdala lesions, they have an

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.690
intact unconditioned response.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:17.930
When they get the shock, they
jump like the other animals.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:18.910
They don't like it.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.340
It's not that they
can't feel pain.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.260
They can't learn that the tone
predicts the painful stimulus.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.270
They can't learn the warning
signal of danger.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.610
There's very few patients with
amygdala injuries only.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:34.730
But there's a few.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.960
So here's a patient, SM, who's
been studied by Damasio and

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.420
his colleagues.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.410
This is where the amygdala
ought to be.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.870
It's a developmental disorder
where this is calcified very

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:44.820
early in development.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.870
It's not an adult lesion.

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.200
But it seems to be fairly
amygdala-specific.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.050
And people have done
a couple of

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.320
experiments with these patients.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.580
And it's sort of guided our
understanding of what the

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:58.240
amygdala does in you and I.
Here's one example where they

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.230
did conditioning.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.340
Again, in this case they
didn't use shocks.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.560
They used a super-loud
boat horn that's

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.840
pretty noxious to people.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.120
People don't like it.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.580
And they preceded that with
something gentle that warned

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.190
you it was coming.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.360
Here's the initial response.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.130
And here's the important
thing.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.390
With humans, of course
you can--

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:20.200
well, let me just say they
managed a skin response, a

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.530
galvanic skin response
to the bad tones.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:29.750
So here's the conditioned
stimulus, the response to the

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.590
boat horns in the conditioning,
what predicts

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.760
the boat horns.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.460
Here's the response
to the baseline.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:41.080
And here's the performance of
patients with amnesia who have

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.250
the amygdala--

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.770
controls, I'm sorry, who both
can tell you they're

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:48.630
responding selectively to the
scariest tones and also

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.080
remember perfectly well.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.570
At the end of the testing
session, you go, what went on?

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:54.720
And they say, oh yes.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.980
Well, when I got one signal I
got a horrible boat horn.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.720
And when I heard the other
signal, I got nothing.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.920
It's easy.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.560
You do that for half an hour.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.280
You get one visual signal that
means boat horn coming up, one

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.540
visual signal, nothing
coming up.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.670
If you have patients who have
amygdala lesions, that

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:11.180
galvanic skin response doesn't
happen, even though they tell

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.470
you perfectly well afterwards
what happened.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.440
So they know just like everybody
else that they got a

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.840
certain signal that went with
a noxious boat horn.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.930
But their body is not learning
that association.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.780
If a patient has hippocampal
damage, their body learns that

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.960
association, but they don't
remember it afterwards

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.490
consciously.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.540
So you can separate out two
kinds of learning, a

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.080
hippocampal-dependent learning
of the facts of the session,

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.700
and an amygdala-dependent
learning, which is a bodily

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.380
response to learning that
something is dangerous and

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.630
unpleasant.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.510
Now, we often learn things like
the visual cliff without

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.370
having to have a boat horn
and practice, right?

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:54.850
If somebody tells you that
something is dangerous, or you

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.760
figure out that something is
dangerous, you don't have to

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.870
go through a terrible experience
to pretty much

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:02.550
decide you're not
going to do it.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:08.450
So here's an experiment that was
aimed at showing you that.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.240
What people were shown-- there's
a funny human subjects

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.330
wrinkle to this I'll
just tell you.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.320
This occurred at Yale,
where they had a

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.500
blue square came on.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.310
That means safe.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.360
You can just relax.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.410
Nothing bad's going to happen.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:21.850
But when the yellow square
comes on, get ready.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:25.170
You might get a somewhat
unpleasant shock.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:29.270
But they never give
them a shock.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.180
So you're not learning
that way.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.670
You just factually learn that
something is safe and

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:35.120
something is dangerous.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.960
And here is the amygdala
response to the scary one, to

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.120
a neutral situation, and
to the one where you

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.930
know, ah, I'm safe.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.640
So you never got the shock.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.030
You never got the shock.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.890
You were just told
about the shock.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.650
You didn't have to get
it, but you're human.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:51.840
You can figure this out.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.060
And your amygdala is going, you
know, I can just figure

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.700
out that's dangerous.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.040
That's baseline.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.610
And that's the absence of
danger, positive safety.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.770
The Yale IRB, hilariously I
think, said, oh, but you're

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.210
deceiving the people, because
you tell them they might get a

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:11.500
shock and they never
got a shock.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.410
So you have to give them one
shock at the end of the

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.780
experiment.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.370
So dutifully, the experimenters
gave them one

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:20.390
shock after the experiment was
over so they were honest.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.890
Because during the experiment,
as they measured the brain

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:26.440
activation in the amygdala
responding to the threat of

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.050
pain without any pain
being associated--

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:29.560
we're smart.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.560
We can learn something is
dangerous just by thinking it

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.440
through, and it engages the same
part of the brain that

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.300
learns by actual painful
experience.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.210
Now how about memory?

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:43.580
So here's the way this
study was done.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.210
People viewed a slide
story with an

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.360
emotional middle section.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.550
So an example would be this,
parents are home having

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:52.580
breakfast with a kid.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:53.540
Parents go to work.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:57.050
Kid walks to school, kind of
tragically, but these are all

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.940
slides, again, nobody
was injured,

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.640
child is hit by a car.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.120
Something high arousing
happens in the

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.140
middle of the story.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.290
Everybody runs to
the hospital.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:06.290
The kid is OK.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.580
When people ask a week later or
something like that, a week

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.960
later, tell me about the stories
I told you last week.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.220
There's a number of stories.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.130
People have best memory for
the part where something

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.660
highly arousing happened, like
the child was hit by a car.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.115
That makes sense, right?

00:44:21.115 --> 00:44:22.510
Kid having breakfast, huh.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:24.190
Kid OK, huh.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:26.450
Car accident with a kid,
you're aroused and you

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:27.540
remember that better.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.750
Emotion is amplifying memory.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:34.000
The patients with the amygdala
lesions don't have that memory

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.290
bump based on emotion.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:39.050
The emotion is not enhancing
their memory.

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:41.310
And you can imagine that there's
a pretty good reason

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.900
for emotions to enhance
memory, right?

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.070
If something is fearful,
delightful, horribly

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:51.640
disgusting, those are all good
reasons to remember.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.510
Let's do that again,
if it's great.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:56.060
Let's avoid that, if
it's terrible.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.100
It's a good idea for emotions
to drive memory formation.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.270
And in your brain and mine, it
appears the amygdala has this

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.845
role of transforming emotions
into memories.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:13.370
Now we also talked about
six facial expressions.

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:14.470
And I showed you this before.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:18.380
The same patients have trouble
in recognizing fearful facial

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:18.880
expressions.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.720
So the amygdala in so many
different ways, learning,

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.510
memory, perception of faces,
seems to play this

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.490
huge role in fear.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.710
And kind of interesting way,
because you might have the

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:36.370
intuition--

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:40.050
and a lot of this came
from Freud--

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.800
that a lot of emotions are
happening kind of under our

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.390
conscious awareness.

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.180
We almost discover them after,
like why am I angry with this

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.520
person, or why am I so happy?

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.790
We have to think it
through, almost.

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.940
If you show subliminal fearful
faces versus happy faces,

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:58.190
subliminally presented so people
can't tell you what the

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:02.330
facial expression was, still
they turn on the amygdala.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:05.330
So unconscious perception
of a fearful

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:06.790
face engages the amygdala.

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.400
You don't have to go through
consciousness.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.880
Cortical blindness.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.475
We talked about that earlier
in the course, where you're

00:46:12.475 --> 00:46:14.715
blind in one visual field.

00:46:14.715 --> 00:46:17.660
And yet individual patients, a
couple of them with cortical

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.460
blindness, if they were shown
a fearful stimulus in the

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.990
cortically blind field, still
turn on, in the cortically

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:27.910
blind field, the amygdala for a
fearful face versus a happy

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:32.250
face, which indicates that a
non-conscious, subcortical

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:36.720
pathway that doesn't intersect
with conscious thought or

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.000
cortex, is sending information
from your eyes to your

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.020
amygdala, a different pathway.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.270
And people have speculated that
maybe again because fear

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:50.580
is survival and danger, we might
have a super-highway of

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:53.180
information that sends
dangerous information

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.550
immediately to our amygdala.

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.370
It doesn't wait for you to think
a lot, so to speak, in

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:58.200
your cortex.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.680
Boom.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.720
Danger, danger, danger, even
before you process the rest of

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.570
the situation.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.840
So we talked about fear and the
threat in the amygdala.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.430
I'll just say a word
about disgust.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:13.750
People think there's many
reasons things we can be

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.650
disgusted at or about, but
that maybe in terms of

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.680
evolution, it might have been
a pretty good signal for

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.750
contaminated food, food that
makes you sick, things to

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:24.380
avoid that make you sick.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.300
And it turns out another part of
the brain called the insula

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.100
is pretty important for that.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.030
So here's the amygdala
left and right.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.850
Here's the insula that
you have, left and

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.470
right, outlined in purple.

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:40.320
And again, just like with the
amygdala, patients with

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:43.790
lesions of the insula don't
recognize facial expressions.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:46.790
And imaging wise, if you see a
disgusted face, that turns on

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:48.210
that part of the
brain as well.

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:52.000
So those are the best understood
brain pieces of

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.990
emotion by far.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.120
So now those are patient things,
so let me turn for a

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.540
moment, lastly to a few imaging
studies of typical

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.290
people and some topics
on emotion.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:06.260
So here's some terrible
pictures from 9/11.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.240
"The horror of the moment"--
and we always

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.290
imagine we'll remember--

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:10.610
and we've already talked a
little bit about this in

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:11.740
flashbulb memories--

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.110
emotionally things correctly
for a long time.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.530
"'The horrors of that moment,'
the King went on, 'I shall

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.020
never forget.'" This
is Lewis Carroll,

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.180
Through the Looking Glass.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.910
"'You will though,' the Queen
said, 'if you don't make a

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:20.720
memorandum of it.'"

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.470
And now you know that Lewis
Carroll was talking about the

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:23.760
amygdala, right?

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.600
You didn't know that before,
but you know that now.

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.830
Because if the amygdala isn't
there, the emotional intensity

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:33.660
doesn't make the memory more
permanent or more powerful.

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:37.040
So Larry Cahill at UC Irvine did
the first brain study on

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:37.990
this topic.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:41.280
And what he did is he showed
students while they were

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:46.800
getting PET scanning, Positron
Emission Tomography, short

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.450
films that were either
powerfully

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:51.480
emotional or neutral.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.280
And then he brought them
back three weeks later.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.200
And here's what he found.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.830
The more activation there
was in the amygdala--

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:01.040
each square here is a
different person--

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.350
the more they remembered
the emotional stuff.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.110
But it didn't matter
for neutral things.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.820
So the amygdala seems
unimportant for neutral

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.380
information, but the more it
was engaged, the more they

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.690
remembered emotional
information.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:14.750
So this is sort of evidence in
the typical human mind of a

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:17.090
relationship between
the amygdala

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.750
and emotional memories.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:23.200
So here's an experiment actually
that we did at

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.540
Stanford, where we showed
people stimuli that were

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.640
either neutral, somewhat
negative-- and I'm going to

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.170
show you something that's
very negative.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:32.010
If you don't want to look, close
your eyes for a moment.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:32.310
Close your eyes.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.200
Here we go.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:33.840
Very negative.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.660
OK.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.390
Sorry.

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:39.220
It turns out if we don't show
you something that negative,

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.200
it's hard to get your
brain pumped up.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.330
It doesn't have to be
that sad, but it has

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.330
to be pretty intense.

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:46.680
So we show you things
like this.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:51.110
And we record your brain
response for each of those.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.590
And here's what we do.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.450
We ask you to tell us
how bad is this?

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:59.420
So the baby picture was
bad for most people.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.580
We wait three weeks, pretty long
time, and then we test

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.310
your memory for the scenes
from before.

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:08.190
We test your memory three weeks
later, pretty long time.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.050
And here's what we see.

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:10.890
Two things.

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:14.520
In the left amygdala in this
study, here's what you rated

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.080
as terrible, pretty bad,
somewhat bad, and neutral.

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:23.650
So the amygdala is responding
to your subjective sense of

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:24.390
terribleness.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:27.470
Now, we were really looking
at arousal and negativity.

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:30.040
We didn't look at
positive ones.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.550
I can tell you in
other studies--

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.360
and here's a trick
in research.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.280
I'm going to tell you now--

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.452
I only have a couple more
slides, but I'm going to tell

00:50:36.452 --> 00:50:38.660
you a little bit about insider
things on imaging, just so you

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.660
understand imaging as as human
and fallible a form of

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.860
research as anything, which
you might suspect anyway.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.555
So we show these things.

00:50:51.555 --> 00:50:54.000
And we got these responses.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.180
So that's going with your
subjective sense of

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.050
how bad films are.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.690
And then we tested people's
memory, what we also found was

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.380
that memory was best
when we got the

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.495
biggest amygdala response.

00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:06.870
So that's just like
you heard before.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:11.240
So that all seemed find and
lined up with a prior result.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.950
But here was the slight surprise
in the thing that

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:17.210
followed and that still gets
cited fairly often.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.790
It's the research that I've
been affiliated with that

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:22.820
still gets cited most often in
newspapers and magazines.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.830
Anyway, so this was a study
that you saw before.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:26.670
And the thing I didn't emphasize
to you was that this

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:28.695
was in the right amygdala,
in the right hemisphere.

00:51:28.695 --> 00:51:29.800
It doesn't really matter.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.690
It just happened to be there.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.450
Our study at Stanford was
in the left hemisphere.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:37.770
This is where we were getting
the emotion memory responses.

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:41.410
And so we were very
deep scientists.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.750
And we said, what could
be going on?

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.820
Why is Larry Cahill at
UC Irvine getting

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.890
it in the left amygdala?

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:50.740
The more active it is, the
more you would remember

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.570
emotional information.

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:54.690
And why is he getting it in the
right amygdala and we're

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.700
getting it in the left?

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.110
So we took a piece of paper
and we wrote down the

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.720
different things that
people had found.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.040
Oh.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.400
The story I was going
to tell you is about

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.360
Stephan Hamann's study.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.650
So Stephan Hamann at Emory did
a study where he said, OK.

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:08.940
All this amygdala response to
negative things, does it also

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.360
respond to positive things?

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.590
That's a good question.

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.820
And the answer is yes.

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.110
But it turns out in many
experiments it doesn't look

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.910
that way, because you saw, for
those of you who looked at

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.270
that horrible-looking baby
picture, what would be an

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:27.190
equal positive powerful
picture?

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.920
Let's try this one.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.510
Everybody agrees it's cute when
there's little children

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:32.600
around a birthday cake.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.290
Smile, she smiles.

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:38.230
Powerful, unless it's
your kid, maybe.

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:40.730
Powerful image.

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:42.170
Powerful as the face
of the infant?

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.840
No.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.870
So it's a really interesting
thing.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:49.310
It's very hard to get positive
stimuli that are as potent as

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:50.490
negative stimuli.

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.900
You can get a million negative
stimuli from the internet and

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.530
it's very hard to get
very positive ones.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:57.560
Having said that, we said, let's
just think about the

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.810
negative ones for the moment.

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:02.390
So our studies were
fMRI, PET, PET.

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:04.260
Ours were all with women.

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.640
And these were all with men.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.120
And you could go, well,
why did that happen?

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.410
It's good that it's half women
and half men, because these

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.160
were Positron Emission
Tomography.

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.060
That involves injecting
radioactive stuff into people

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.580
to do that kind of imaging.

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.420
And many IRBs say, well, let's
not have women do it, because

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.350
they could be unknowingly
pregnant.

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.710
They could be.

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:25.840
And we shouldn't be giving
radioactive stuff just for an

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.250
experiment.

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:29.410
You could have debates about
that, but that's the thought.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.380
Why not let the men get their
radioactive stuff?

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:34.940
We don't really need them.

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.980
Then so when we did this study,
we said, well, these

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:37.640
were all with men.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.620
It seems in fairness we should
do it with women too.

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.770
We just thought that seemed
fair, kind of.

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:44.030
We didn't have any big
thought about that.

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:46.940
And again, we were getting left
amygdala and they were

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.020
getting right amygdala.

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.060
Pictures or films, different.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.430
And this caught our eye,
that we had done

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:53.260
studies with women.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.150
We were getting left amygdala.

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.040
They did it with men,
with right amygdala.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.820
So deep scientists that we were,
Larry Cahill said, I'll

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:00.420
test men and women.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.750
And we said, we'll test
men and women.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:02.950
And here's what we found.

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:05.780
And these are averages, but
one critical thing that we

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.960
discovered-- we didn't know
this-- is that to the extent--

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.070
and these are averages, of
course these are averages--

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:15.270
that you compare men and women,
on average women have

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:19.200
better memory for emotional life
events, faster production

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.210
of autobiographical memories
to cues, more accurate in

00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:22.800
dating memories.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.720
So these dating studies are
pretty useful, because you

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.400
never know how accurate a person
is when they have a

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.620
memory for something.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:31.050
What they do in the dating
studies is they have people

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:33.460
who are dating keep
diaries, for

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.340
example, in the fall semester.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.960
And presumably those are
reasonably accurate.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.050
They're filling them
in every day.

00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:42.130
And then things happen over the
holidays and some people

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:43.960
remain dating and some don't.

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:45.890
So you go back to them in March,
and you go, in your

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:49.480
fall, when the two of you were
going out, tell us about what

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.400
you did in November.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.850
And they can say who's
more accurate.

00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:55.480
And they have almost a virtual
record, because they have the

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.500
responses that the men and
women put down that day.

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.080
And on average-- these
are averages-- the

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.370
women were more accurate.

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:02.940
And wives scored higher than
husbands on vividness of

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:05.320
memories for first date, last
vacation, recent argument.

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.740
So these are all averages.

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.440
There's lots of overlap, but
an average is that way.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.540
And so Larry Cahill went
and did this thing.

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:14.710
And sure enough, again, as he
found before, for men, the

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:16.800
more they turned on the right
amygdala, the more certain

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.130
they were to remember
negative films.

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:21.330
And for women, the more they
turned on the left amygdala,

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:22.470
the more certain they
would remember

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:24.240
negative films on average.

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:31.810
Now, the thing to know is, on
average again, when you have

00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:34.290
people rate the kinds
of pictures we

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:37.330
use, how do you think--

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:38.210
here it is.

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.690
This is one example where your
stereotype guesses probably

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:42.810
play out for the averages.

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:46.660
Who rates this as more scary,
or who says it's more scary,

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.710
men or women?

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:50.940
OK.

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.250
So positive or negative,
I should say

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:54.620
for positive or negative.

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.860
Here's the women, not finding
this a particularly--

00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.940
on average, and there's
a range of responses--

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:02.200
positive picture.

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.490
Here's men going, pretty cool.

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.110
What DVD did that come from?

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:10.290
So people are always asking,
what does this really mean?

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:14.300
Are men just knowing they have
to do this or whatever?

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:15.090
Who knows?

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:17.000
There's no answer to this about
whether it's social

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.610
things or biology.

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:22.020
Certainly social things are
a big part of the story.

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.100
When we have people rate the
pictures in the scanner,

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.560
here's the women rating here's
the worst pictures.

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.130
And look at the men.

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.940
They're less willing to rate
these pictures as bad.

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.795
Again, psychologists who see
these data say, well, maybe

00:56:32.795 --> 00:56:35.610
the men think they're never
supposed to rate them as bad,

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.610
because we're tough guys
and nothing's so bad.

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:38.380
I mean, I don't know.

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.320
Who knows?

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.570
But this is the ratings.

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:44.830
Now, if we look at the
activation of the men and

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:48.590
women on the left as they rate
them, the worse they rate it,

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:51.140
the more intense they find it,
the more they turned on their

00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:51.970
left amygdala.

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:55.450
So at the moment they're rating
them, men and women

00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:57.510
look very similar.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:59.840
But when we relate it to their
memory, two things happen.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.350
First, the women did have
superior memory to the men.

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:04.010
These were Stanford
undergraduates, probably not

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:07.440
that dissimilar on average to
the people in this room.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.200
And quite strikingly, as you
saw it, activation in the

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.800
right hemisphere predicted
memory in men, and the left

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.520
hemisphere for women.

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.750
So I know there's been a
lot of right and left.

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:21.820
But here we think
was the message.

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.490
And it's kind of stood
the test of time a

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:27.310
little bit, on average.

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:30.480
What you see here is the part of
the left amygdala turned on

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.120
for women as they're
rating it.

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.550
The more intense,
the more active.

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:36.880
In relation to whether they form
a long term memory, the

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.580
more active, the more likely
they'll remember it.

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.250
And kind of the physical
overlap of the two.

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:45.970
In men, more active in that
amygdala on the left during

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:47.350
the rating, but doesn't
seem to be

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:50.460
involved in memory formation.

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.920
In the hippocampus, again,
overlap, overlap, overlap.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.860
No apparent overlap
in the men.

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.590
So what happens literally in the
brain, I mean, literally

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.890
as far as we can measure it, in
women on average there was

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:03.860
more overlap between the parts
of the brain engaged as you

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.460
evaluate something and the parts
of the brain that make

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.470
the memory of that.

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:11.990
And in men, on average it was
as if, here's my emotional

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:14.480
rating on the right, and here's
what I'm going to

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.130
remember on the left.

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:18.150
Kind of a separation of
those processes in

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:20.350
the most simple sense.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:23.160
Now here's a huge question.

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.230
Does this brain imaging study
tell us anything about whether

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:30.150
this is in the genes of boys and
girls as they're born or a

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:32.430
consequence of socialization
or both?

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.730
It's incredibly intuitive for
people to think that if you

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:42.370
see it in the brain it's
hardwired and genetic or

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:45.000
hormonal or something.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.630
Brain imaging data never
tells you that.

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:48.880
It never tells you that.

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.820
It just tells you by this age,
this is what's going on.

00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.680
And you don't have to know much
psychology to know that

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.420
we're all hugely influenced to
varying degrees, but we're all

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:01.750
hugely influenced by social
influences on what it is to be

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.760
a male or a female in our
families, in our cultures, in

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.690
our societies.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:09.120
Whether something's in your
genes or in your culture, it

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.160
shows up in your brain.

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.640
And we can't tell those
two things apart.

00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.780
Is this anything to do
with how we're born?

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:20.630
Is this anything to do with how
Hollywood pitches movies

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:27.320
that are about video game
battles versus chick flicks,

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.930
how they're pitching that and
trying to tell us we're

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:30.640
supposed to like something?

00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.500
Who knows?

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:35.690
We can't tell if it's social
or genetic at all.
