00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.090
PROFESSOR: OK, so up until now
in many ways we've thought

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.610
about people as individuals--

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.360
how they see, how they remember,
their personality,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.810
things you can measure by
IQ tests, if they have

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.000
psychopathology or not.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.540
We've primarily focused on
people as an individual agents

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.590
in the world.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.370
And for this lecture and for the
next lecture, we're going

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.780
to flip over and think about
people as they interact with

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.840
other people.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
And all the way back from 1962,
here's an example--

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.000
and you know so much
from your life--

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.820
of how powerfully we're
influenced by other people in

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.990
our behaviors.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.810
So this is a story of
elevator rules.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.080
You guys know elevator
rules, right?

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.040
You get in an elevator, what are
you supposed to be so you

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.050
don't make other people
uncomfortable or where they

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.930
don't make you?

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah, which
way you're facing.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.300
Not too close in space.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.450
If there's only two of you and
the person huddles right next

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.880
to you, you go, hmm.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.950
OK.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.330
So anyway here we go.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.430
So I was a graduate student in
brain and cognitive science

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.600
and I got minimally exposed
to social psychology.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.860
I was actually a teaching
assistant.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.930
I must have heard something
about it.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.830
But it wasn't until I was
teaching at Stanford which is

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.140
full of famous social
psychologists and I was

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.800
hearing them give their
introductory psychology

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.770
lectures that I got amazed by
what social psychologists have

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.720
discovered about human nature.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.550
And maybe because I was exposed
to it in one shot, it

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.789
really changed for me personally
how I try to think

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.240
about people from that
day forward.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.160
So let's see if it
does it for you.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.290
And in many ways, we're going
to do today the core, core

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.450
famous, most famous things
in psychology--

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.610
that the Stanford Zimbardo
prison experiment, the Milgram

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.120
obedience experiment.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.170
And a theme you'll see is how
funny we are as humans in our

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.460
desire to want to fit in.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.860
So what is social psychology?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.840
The scientific study of the
way in which our thoughts,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.460
feelings, and behaviors are
influenced by the real or

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.130
imagined presence
of other people.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.330
So it's how we relate
to other people.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.560
And to a certain extent, if you
compare it to things like

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.290
linguistics or other aspects of
psychology, social things

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.670
have seems weakish.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.040
But people have been thinking
in the last decade, more and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.880
more, that maybe many things
that make humans humans have

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.030
been pulled by powerful social
relations that occur

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.450
in groups of humans.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.920
And so for example, looking
across primate species--

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.110
just across primates--

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.800
here is the average size
of the social group.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.610
Here's the average size
of the neocortex.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.830
And it's a pretty good fit.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.280
And so you could think back
in the course of examples.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.140
For example, the infant who's
willing to crawl across a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.450
dangerous visual cliff if the
mother has a positive facial

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.840
expression.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.900
Risking injury, or worse,
because you have a social

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.340
queue that says it's OK.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.720
And you're just an infant
interpreting that.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.330
So more and more, the thought
that many of the abilities we

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.450
have, how we work together, how
we communicate together,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.910
are driven by our fundamental
social character.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.760
And so we'll talk today about
the power of the situation.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.460
This is a big idea in social
psychology is that people's

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.950
behavior can be phenomenally
altered by the situation

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.670
they're in.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.120
And we'll talk about
attribution--

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.800
how we decide whether a person
behaves a certain way because

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.620
of their character or the
situation they're in--

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.250
the fundamental attribution
error, conformity, compliance,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.510
obedience, and bystanders.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.510
There are so many experiments
here that amaze me and that

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.730
are still completely relevant
today, and I'll

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.930
convince you of that.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.000
So I think we engage in all
the time as humans as

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.570
interpreting the actions
and words of others.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.700
Why did somebody do something.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.890
Right?

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.570
That fills our lives-- our
families, our teachers, our

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.620
friends, or coworkers--

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.190
why did somebody do something
or say something.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.170
Why is that person looking at
me friendly across the room?

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.060
So the causal attribution--

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.080
what is driving that
person's thoughts?

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.760
What's in their mind
that's making them

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.320
to behave that way?

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.040
And there's at least two kinds
of the explanations.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.330
One of them is character.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.250
So personality psychology
is all about that.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.500
The character of the person is
making them behave that way

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.910
because they're outgoing
or because

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.800
they're shy or whatever.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.030
So Jeremiah helps the elderly
person across the street

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.950
because he's a really
nice guy.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.060
Sven had a hard time solving the
puzzle because he's kind

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.460
of a dummy.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.500
Tamae gave money to the boy.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.140
Boy is she nice and generous.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.000
That's the personality
predisposition interpretation.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.130
So that's the who
she is or he is.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.500
Or they're behaving that way
because they're in a

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.090
particular situation.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.310
So Jeremiah helped the elderly
man across the street because

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.020
his friends are breaking in
to the apartment the guy's

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.320
leaving behind.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.890
Or there's another person
there and he's trying to

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.850
impress that person what
a swell guy he is.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.080
Sven had a hard time solving the
puzzle because it was an

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.480
impossible puzzle.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.180
He didn't get nearly
enough sleep--

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.490
the situation.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.620
She gave money to the boy
because he's the drug dealer.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.040
He's a courier running--

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.550
whatever.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.880
It's the situation, OK?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.760
So you pick it, but all of a
sudden the interpretation

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.520
completely changes as
to what's going on.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.730
It's about character
versus situation.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.440
So where does the behavior
come from--

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.670
the dispositions of an
individual or the situation

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:01.920
they're in?

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.270
Personality psychologists
focus on this.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.920
Social psychologists
focus on this.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.040
And they will argue that this
dominates everything.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.300
This dominates everything.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.740
Not the only thing, but it
dominates everything.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.970
So let's consider them
in one other way.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.090
So let's say that you are late
for an appointment with me.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.480
So what do I start to think as
I'm sitting there waiting for

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.200
you and you don't email
me, you don't call me.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.720
You might think, well, this
person is a bit inconsiderate,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.820
a bit disorganized,
a bit unmotivated.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.390
It would not be a good idea,
for example, to show up for

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.940
job interview late for your
appointment, right?

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.370
Why?

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.020
Because we don't want them to
think we're disorganized,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.380
inconsiderate, or unmotivated
until we're hired.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.410
So that's the other person.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.700
Like why aren't they here?

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.210
They're messing up, and there's
something not good

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.690
about their character.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.920
But imagine when you're late.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.790
Why are you late?

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.750
Because you're disorganized,
inconsiderate, and

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.380
unmotivated?

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.100
No, because something came up.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.930
The situation, right?

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.470
The traffic was worse than
you could have imagined.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.020
Last minute, there was an email
that you have to respond

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.670
to or your parent called
or whatever.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.560
Some situation made you late.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.230
And what I'm going to show you
in a moment is that a very

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.070
fundamental thing about people--
in fact, called the

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.390
fundamental attribution
error--

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.840
is that we're biased to
interpret the actions of

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.800
others as revealing their
character, whereas we're

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.950
biased to interpret our own
actions as being driven by the

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.380
situation we're in.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.870
So Lee Ross was the one who came
up with this term, the

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.450
fundamental attribution error.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.230
The other person is driven by
character and that's how we

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.900
interpret why they do things.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.180
We give ourselves a break
by the situation.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.500
And so what they did is, they
ran experiments where they

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.830
wanted to make it incredibly
clear to Stanford

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.710
undergraduate research
participants, incredibly clear

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.910
that the situation
was dominant.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.440
And show that even then, even
when you know for certain it's

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.620
the situation, and you know as
much as you can possibly know,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.910
you tend to ascribe character
to people.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.690
OK?

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.150
So they had students
run in pairs.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.700
And they were truly randomly
selected to be a quiz master

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.980
or a contestant.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.190
Two students at a time.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.200
The quiz master comes up with
questions and the contestant

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.610
has to answer.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.360
So they can answer who were the
two inventors of calculus.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.470
And you know the answer
might be--

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.180
and probably you could
argue some things

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.720
about those, right?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.710
But look, you know this
as students--

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.695
it's sort of unfair that we get
to ask you the questions.

00:08:30.695 --> 00:08:33.809
So I get to ask you something
like what's the structure just

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.360
in front of the hippocampus
that's important

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.950
for emotional memory?

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.064
And you might answer,
oh no, oh no.

00:08:40.064 --> 00:08:41.429
[LAUGHS]

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.390
That was on the previous test.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.400
It's not cumulative.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.940
[LAUGHS]

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.900
and I go, it's the amygdala.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.620
And I've worked in that field
for 30 years and I feel pretty

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.360
proud of knowing that
little fact.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.380
Now, I need a student
hand to go up?

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:56.960
OK.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.530
Now you asked me a question
that you think I might

00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.830
struggle on.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.820
And believe me, there's an
infinite number outside the

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.170
location of the amygdala.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.580
Pick one from physics or
math or chemistry.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.990
You're going to embarrass me.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.770
Make it really hard so
I don't look so bad.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.902
AUDIENCE: There was
a football match

00:09:13.902 --> 00:09:15.000
this weekend in England--

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.980
PROFESSOR: There's
what, sorry?

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.800
AUDIENCE: A football match
this weekend in England.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.940
PROFESSOR: A football match
this weekend in England.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.915
AUDIENCE: Between two
of the top of teams

00:09:19.915 --> 00:09:21.030
in the Premier League.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.840
Who won?

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.090
PROFESSOR: Manchester?

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.830
No?

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.170
OK, I just made that up.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:25.910
No, I don't know.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:26.650
So here's the point.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.020
If I ask questions,
I know the answer.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.550
I picked the question, right?

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.590
And you may or may
not know it.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.610
If you create the question,
there's a pretty good chance I

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.880
won't know it.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.240
OK, so inherently when somebody
is the quiz master,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.160
they're going to know the answer
and the other person

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.860
may or may not it.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.150
A pretty good chance
they don't as

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.870
they make up questions.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.830
You know that.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.570
Logically you know that.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.500
So the setup was--

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.840
and the students were only
correct 40% of the time-- not

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.270
bad-- who were answering the
questions spontaneously made

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.700
up by the randomly selected
quiz master.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.570
So this is an experiment--

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.950
knowing this, does it tell you
anything about the knowledge

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:02.580
or intelligence--

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.810
let's call it, just
an easy label--

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.950
of the person asking the
questions or the person

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.960
answering the questions?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.140
No.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.110
Does that make sense?

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.710
They were randomly put into
positions where one person

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.010
gets to ask and one answers.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.060
Yet even seeing all this right
in front of them, then

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.610
students were asked, compared to
a person in general, to the

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.380
average student, are the people
up there, the quizzer

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.800
and the receiver, are they
less knowledgeable, about

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.200
average, or more knowledgeable
than the average other

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.470
Stanford student?

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.550
And in a pure scientific sense
you should say I have no idea.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.410
Because you created a situation
where one person had

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.910
a hopeless advantage compared
to the other.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.760
You told me you were
doing that.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.670
I saw you do that.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.670
But human beings can help
us say-- including the

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.430
contestants say, I guess I'm
a bit dumb, but that other

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.900
person was really smart.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.450
The one who knew about the
soccer match in England and

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.040
other questions.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.760
Or the other person
observing--

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.090
that quiz master seems to know
a lot, that student.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.540
And this other one-- the one
who was answering the

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.180
questions--

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.540
not quite an average
MIT student.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.510
All right?

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.240
Because people can't help but
say if I see behavior, it's

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.200
because of the content
of your character--

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.170
smarter or dumber
in this case.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.970
Even though I know logically,
your mind goes to that

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.940
analysis of behavior in others
by their character or

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.320
disposition.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.750
Here's another one.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.860
Participants read essays that
were in favor of Castro, who

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.900
is the leader of Cuba,
or against Castro.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.510
In the US, we're mostly
against Castro.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.510
The opinions expressed in the
essays were presented as

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.190
either chosen--

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.980
so the person could choose
to speak what

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:37.930
they want to speak--

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.450
or they were assigned
by the experimenter.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.150
So you were asked, please give
a pro-Castro speech or please

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.830
give an anti-Castro speech.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.490
That's your job here.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.000
And then the people listening
said, OK, what do they really

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.140
think about Castro?

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.160
What do they really think?

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.670
OK, even in a situation where
you're told they're going to

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.720
be assigned that.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.990
So what happens?

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.490
Here's how much they believe
that the essay writer was

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:07.030
pro-Castro or anti-Castro
in the case where they

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.540
chose what to do.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.990
But when they were given the
assignment, and now you know

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.440
it's really truly random, it's
not quite as much as this, but

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.860
they still believed that if you
write a pro-Castro essay,

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.790
even though you're told the
person was assigned that

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.560
essay, as you read it you go,
this person seems to really

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.860
believe it.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.570
I think they're really for
it because that's their

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.540
predisposition.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.370
You're told fully this is a
situation that's assigned, but

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.300
humans can't help but think, I
see through this a little bit.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.850
And that essay is just a little
too well written, a

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.610
little too convincing, for a
person just to be randomly

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.760
writing it.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.495
So humans, even when you give
them all the information, that

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:46.130
it's 100% situational, they
can't help but interpret

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.420
things as being built out of
character or predisposition in

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.920
that person.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.960
So people have also thought to
this idea of understanding

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.880
another person's behavior in
terms of their predispositions

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.010
versus the situation.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.020
That the disposition on one
is made automatically,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.290
reflexively.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.350
That the situational information
sort of follows in

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.420
a controlled, slow,
thoughtful way the

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.890
takes energy to correct.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.470
That humans on the whole first
interpret automatically,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.770
reflexively, the behavior of
others as their character.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.380
And then second, optionally, can
correct it thinking about

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.150
the situation.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.630
So the idea is you see
something, you immediately

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.820
decide what the person's
character is.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.360
And then maybe, maybe, we'll
slowly, effort-fully and

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.850
consciously, think about
what the situation

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.040
is that led to that.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.540
So these are automatic, and
this is controlled,

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.580
thoughtful, and deliberative.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.510
So it may not happen.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.630
So the people to show this--
and it's a slightly

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.230
complicated experiment, but
let me show you how.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.620
They wanted to prove that
thinking about the situation

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.490
demands a lot of extra mental
resources to overcome the

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.110
initial interpretation.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.330
So they had participants watched
silent video clips.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.730
They said it was silent
because they wanted to

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.040
preserve the privacy of the
woman who was being videotaped

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.470
having a discussion
with a stranger.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.030
You just see the woman.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.680
And she looked extremely
anxious in some

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.640
clips and not others.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.270
The task is we want you to
rate how anxious is this

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.110
person basically.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.000
Rate your impression in terms
of their character.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.580
Are they an anxious
type of person?

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.550
Some of the research people
who were the subjects were

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.530
told the target was discussing
what the topics were.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.550
And then they also did one other
thing which was some of

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.360
the people we're asked to
just watch and rate.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.620
And other people were told,
not only do you watch and

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.550
rate, but we're going to test
your memory for the content of

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.860
what she said.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:34.870
Because of that, they're
trying to

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.520
memorize what they hear.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.640
And the idea is that your
filling up their attention

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.560
with what they're memorizing,
they can't make the

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.272
correction.

00:14:42.272 --> 00:14:44.350
They're out of mental resources
to make the

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.810
situational correction.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.470
So you're watching these
films on anxious

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.060
topics or relaxing topics.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.470
So the relaxing topics might
be these things-- tell me

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.640
about a foreign film you like
or a favorite hobby.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.500
Or speak about your worst public
humiliation, a sexual

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.360
fantasy you have, a personal
failure you had.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.320
And of course, these things in
red, you could expect a person

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.230
talking about that to
see more anxious.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.520
Those are personal, anxiety
provoking topics, OK?

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.620
So here's what happens.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.340
So again, the topics
were either anxiety

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.600
provoking or not.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.270
And you were either just
watching the film or

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.920
memorizing what you were
hearing as well.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.240
And the hypothesis is that
this would happen.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.800
So if you were doing one
task and you were told

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.080
what the topic is--

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.730
it has a relaxing topic
or an anxious topic--

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.350
you could separate out what the
task is versus the person.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.430
But if you were trying to
memorize simultaneously what

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.510
the content of the film was,
that difference disappears.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.070
The rating is identical.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.610
The people are not taking into
account the topic that's being

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.110
talked about.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.180
Because they're memorizing,
their mind is occupied with

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.080
the content of the scene.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.300
And they're not able to sort
of correct the intuitive,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.880
automatic, reflexive, habitual
interpretation of a person's

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.370
actions based on their
character.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:20.120
So in the news today, as if it
were organized for our course,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.560
there's a fantastic debate about
what pictures to release

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.370
or not release from what?

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.760
Yeah, the killing of
Osama bin Laden.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.160
A huge debate going on about
whether it should

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.840
be released or not.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.400
That's gotten the public
attention.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.940
One of the biggest reasons why
among several, but a big

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.060
reason why there's such a huge
debate is another set of

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.260
pictures some years ago from
Abu Ghraib prison.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.070
I'm going to show you those
pictures and the consequences

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.260
that were felt to follow
from the release.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.280
So this is one of the soldiers
who was there, Private Lynndie

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.330
England, who was said to have
participated in maltreating

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.960
and torturing detainees at
the Abu Ghraib prison.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.860
So you know, when the United
States went into Iraq, they

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.590
very much had the thought that
they were liberating the

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.530
country from tyranny, which in
some sense everybody agrees I

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.130
think just about.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.990
They were in some sense.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.359
But one of the goals was to
convince the population of

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.150
Iraq that the United States was
not there to occupy and

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.380
take over but to liberate and
free the people of Iraq.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.859
That was a big message the
United States wanted to send

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.470
to the world and to
the Iraqis, right?

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.410
Regardless of whatever else you
know or believe or have

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.839
political opinion, that was a
message the United States

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:25.950
wanted to send to everybody.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.470
That was huge for them to do.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:32.020
That they were there to help
free Iraqi citizens not to

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.300
occupy and take over Iraq.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.980
So imagine when these pictures
came out, a very large prison

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.200
that was run by Americans
in Iraq--

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.060
and these pictures were put on
the internet-- of various,

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.880
what looked like and probably
were, torturous situations.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.290
Here's an Iraqi person with this
hood on their head with

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.830
wires connected to the body.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.370
Here is that soldier holding a
leash, and here's a prisoner

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.600
on the leash.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.050
Here's a smiling picture with
her and another soldier.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.075
There's a pyramid of naked
prisoners piled up, one on top

00:18:13.075 --> 00:18:15.060
of the other in a humiliating
position.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.260
Here's another picture of her,
thumbs up, pointing at hooded,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.840
naked prisoners' genitals.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.830
OK, and then she was tried in
court for these things.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.550
It was devastating for
the United States.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.690
These pictures were devastating
for the United

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.700
States because they were exactly
the opposite of the

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.590
picture the US wanted to
present, which is one of

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.860
liberation and friendliness
and democracy and freedom.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:43.050
And here's tyranny, brutality,
and prison torture.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:48.670
And it figures hugely in the
mind of people in Washington

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.070
now as they're debating
about these pictures.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.150
And for the moment,
they decided not

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.320
to release any picture.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.925
The power of these pictures as
they floated around to inflame

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:57.185
and incite arguments.

00:18:57.185 --> 00:18:59.920
And so here two ways you could
do it from the viewpoint of

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.740
social psychology.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.160
The disposition attribution.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.760
You imagine you're a juror
where she's being tried.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.550
So the accused knew what
she was doing.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.610
She was laughing and joking.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.450
She is enjoying participating,
all for her own sick humor.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.670
So here's the crime.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.990
You get angry and you're not
very sympathetic because it's

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.110
from controllable factors.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.520
She should've controlled
herself.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.165
She's held responsible.

00:19:18.165 --> 00:19:20.450
She should get a severe
punishment.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.820
Or you could ask--

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.880
and we'll come back to this at
the end of the lecture--

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.870
were there uncontrollable
factors well beyond what a

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.710
person could be reasonably
asked to control.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.260
Then you're not so angry at
them if you think the

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.010
situation was very
problematic.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:38.890
For example, she had a boyfriend
who was not only

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:43.430
superior to her militarily, but
also was the ring leader.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:44.190
She was a follower.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.980
She was an individual smitten.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.860
She did whatever he
wanted her to do.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.010
Somewhat more sympathy, person
not held responsible, and the

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.740
punishment is more about
rehabilitation than

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.010
punishment.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.070
So those would be
two approaches.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.720
She was found guilty of one
count of conspiracy and four

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.280
counts of maltreating detainees,
one count of

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.180
committing an indecent act.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.910
She was acquitted on
a conspiracy count.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.690
So I'm going to come back to
this in a little bit after we

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.600
talk about the Stanford prison
experiment and ask you your

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.450
thoughts about this individual
from the information you have.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.540
So we'll come back to that in
a little bit, thinking about

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.490
what is a person responsible
for versus the situation.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.340
So let's start to talk about
social influence, which is

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.390
again a change in a person's
behavior or beliefs in

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.790
response to the intentional
or unintentional

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.730
influences of others.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.820
And we'll talk about
three kinds.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.560
Conformity, which is changing
your behavior or beliefs in

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.850
response to explicit or implicit
pressure from others.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.170
That's the person turning
in the elevator.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.170
Compliance, changing one's
behavior to avoid conflict.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.250
And obedience, which is
following the demands of more

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.130
powerful people or
organizations.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.310
So conformity.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.100
I mean, conformity sounds like
a bad word, but we conform to

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.100
implicit and explicit
social rules.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.100
It's pretty useful for social
groups operating.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.650
If everybody here was talking
and walking in and out and

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.290
stuff like that, we couldn't
have a class.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.650
I mean, if we didn't conform in
some ways, we couldn't do

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.390
very much that took more
than one person to do.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.690
And it's seen across people and
lifespans and cultures.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:15.530
It's how, in certain ways, we
work together as people.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.150
Now the original experiment
on this came from a very

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.850
perceptual effect.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.560
Participants supported for study
on visual perception--

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.990
Muzafer Sherif.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.930
They were seated in a dark room
and saw point of light

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.840
appear, then move, and
then disappear.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.660
And they were asked to judge
how far the light moved.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.410
This was based on a perceptual
illusion.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.730
Because if you stare at a light
in a totally dark room,

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.550
you'll start to interpret it
moving, even though it does

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.660
not physically move.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.940
It has to be a blacked
out room.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.440
You have to sit there
for a while.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.740
And then you start to get
signals about movement that

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.750
are incorrect.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.880
And this perceptual illusion
that a dot is moving was

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.800
called the autokinetic effect.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.300
And that's OK.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.900
You've see an amazing allusions,
and that would be

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.890
another amazing illusion of a
single dot of light in a dark

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.600
room, and you start
to think it moves.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.550
But what the astounding
thing was this--

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.820
here's three individuals who are
tested and their rating of

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.610
how much it moved.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.050
It didn't move, so there
are some differences.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.600
Now the three of them are tested
together on day two,

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.200
day three, and day four.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.670
And you can see that these three
different people start

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:20.280
to converge on the identical,
imagined illusory movement, as

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.920
if the responses of the others
were influencing one and

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.430
another on such a
simple thing.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.540
And then this experiment was
made even more ridiculous by

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.400
one of the most spectacular
experiments just in the

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.980
simplicity and power
and replicability.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.870
So this is from Asch.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.180
Imagine that you walk into a
room and your task is this--

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.790
now get ready because I'm
going to ask for a

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.360
volunteer right now.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.370
OK, thanks.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.505
Get ready, this is going
to be pretty tough, OK?

00:22:47.505 --> 00:22:49.450
And everybody else will be
nice to you because you

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.860
volunteered.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.430
You see this line here?

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.246
Which of these three lines
has the same length?

00:22:55.246 --> 00:22:56.240
AUDIENCE: Number one.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:56.860
PROFESSOR: Number one.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.175
That looks good to you?

00:22:58.175 --> 00:23:00.960
Does that look like a
really tough thing?

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.570
No?

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:02.130
OK, thanks.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.840
OK, I was being a little
facetious.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.110
Thank you.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.860
But you have to understand,
this is the gist of the

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:07.540
experiment.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.250
Not such a tough thing,
pretty obvious.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.330
Here's what they did.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.300
Now you are brought into a
room and there were six

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:14.850
confederates.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.150
So that's the word in social
psychology that's used for

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.260
people who are in on
the experiment.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:19.460
OK?

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.090
They're not really subjects.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.770
So you walk into a room.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.390
You don't know what's
going on.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.800
There are six other students
sitting there.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.630
And they do exactly
what we did now.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.810
They show you a line like this
and three other lines and say

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.400
you pick it.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.940
The six other people go first.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.210
So you're sitting there--
imagine this.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.610
Imagine the first one says,
one, you go, OK.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.960
Then somebody goes,
eh, uh, two.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.650
And you go, hm.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.800
The next person says,
oh yeah, two.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.240
And by the time they get to you,
four of the six have said

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.170
number two.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.670
What do you do?

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.250
Now to an astounding extend
what you do is this--

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.980
you also say two.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.410
OK, and it's not--

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.910
like you're saying, I'm
just fitting in.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.130
When they show you the pictures,
people are turning

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.580
their head.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.450
Is there an angle?

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:05.820
Is it the lighting?

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.870
Why do I think it's
number one when

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.070
everybody else is pretty--

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.070
for such a simple thing,
pretty much the same.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.470
So the confederates are not
always wrong, but they're

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.690
pretty often wrong, and
in a consistent way.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.020
It's all set up.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.540
But you as an individual--

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.290
and here's one of these.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.840
You see this person like, OK,
if I look hard enough, I'm

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.360
going to figure it out.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.830
How did they figure out that
line number one equals line

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.450
number two?

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.550
If you do it by yourself,
less than 1% errors.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.770
Obviously, the only error you
make is if you're not paying

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.830
attention, right?

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.820
With group pressure, not every
single time, but all of a

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.650
sudden, 37 times more often,
you say it's the wrong the

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.020
line length.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.860
And almost always, the
impression is you really

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.930
believe it.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.220
The people are really
struggling.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.470
They're really hemming
and hawing.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.950
Not everybody's the same, but
only 25% give the correct

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.260
answer throughout
the experiment.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.340
75% of people at least once will
give the obviously wrong

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.890
answer because they feel
that conformity.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:10.990
They need to respond to the
other answers given by the

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.950
other students around them.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.490
Such a simple thing as line
length, we cannot help but

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.930
want to fit in and figure
out a way to do that.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.110
What effects this conformity?

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.650
Well, the more confederates,
the more powerful it is.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.910
That makes sense, right?

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.590
So here's the group
size effect.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.240
So if only one person is making
it, you just figure

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.040
they're not too swift and
you can get the line.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.430
Two people, you're already
moving up.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.620
By the time you get to
four people, you're

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.620
all the way up there.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.650
4 to 15 is about the same.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.770
So four other people giving you
obviously wrong answers,

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.920
you decide there must be
something interestingly going

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.220
on and you could figure
it like they did.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.650
OK

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:54.630
Presence of an ally.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.140
We'll come back to this
a couple times.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:02.090
All it takes is one person to
break the conformity and

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:03.970
you're willing to
break that, too.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.610
In these experiments,
that's set up.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.340
The ally is one of the
confederates who's now told to

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.940
give the right length.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.240
So one brave person can really
change what you do, but it's

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.790
hard to be that brave person.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.060
These allies are set up
by the experimenter.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:18.650
So what happens?

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:19.570
Here you go.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.780
Here's the mistakes being made
when all the other people are

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.930
saying the wrong length.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.660
And if one person is giving
the right answers, only

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.140
occasionally.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.640
Still you do it sometimes, but a
dramatic difference from one

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.850
person giving the
right answer.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.980
One dissenter opens up your
chance to go with the answer

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.490
you know intellectually
is correct.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.230
Embarrassment.

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.240
It's amazing the stuff
we all do.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.230
It's amazing the stuff we all do
to avoid being embarrassed.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.580
Embarrassment is such
a powerful thing for

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.470
almost all of us.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.570
There are some exceptions,
but for almost all of us.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.600
So part of what's going on in
conformity is to not to be

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.340
embarrassed to be different.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.670
And so here's the way
they show you that.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.170
They have you arrive late.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.550
You're not really
arriving late.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.180
They tell you, oh, you should
have been here.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.220
We had a miscommunication.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.290
All the other people are here.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:09.310
They knew.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.750
Well, because you arrived late,
why don't you just write

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.700
down your answers.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.980
You don't have to say
them out loud.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.750
Because we can't have you mess
up the experiment now.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.720
Then it's still not perfect, but
people reduced by a third

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.750
the number of their
incorrect answers.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.090
Because they don't have
to tell other

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.330
people what they saw.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.030
OK, it's not perfect, but all
of a sudden, at least that.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.110
And a few other things.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.250
It peaks in ninth grade.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.500
Women on average a bit
more than men.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.590
Cultures that are more
interdependent showed a bit

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.390
more than cultures like the US
that emphasize independence.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.320
But these are all variations on
a relatively small thing.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.640
Fundamentally, humans
want to conform.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.560
And they don't form
superficially.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.540
They convince themselves there's
something going on and

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.210
then the right thing to
do is to conform.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.060
Why do we conform?

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.210
There's all kinds
of hypotheses.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.240
We want to be right.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.910
Everybody knew that line length,
I want to be right.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:02.640
I want to be popular.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.760
I don't want to be the weird
person not doing this stuff.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.930
So anyway, let's come to
compliance which is even more

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.276
oppositional.

00:28:10.276 --> 00:28:14.240
You know this from your life if
you have ever spent money

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.010
on something you didn't mean
to because there's an

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.570
effective salesperson.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.090
It's called a foot-in-the-door
technique,

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.770
and here's an example.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.730
Here's what they did in
1962 in California.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.010
Freedman and Fraser
drove to homes--

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:28.440
random homes-- show a large
unattractive sign that says

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.060
drive carefully.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.170
Now we can all agree that it's
pretty non-controversial to

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.740
drive carefully.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.060
And they knock on the door and
they ask the person will you

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.270
place this on your lawn.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.000
Now think if somebody comes up
to you, knocks on the door,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.290
and says, would you place this
large unattractive sign to

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.130
drive carefully?

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:47.920
And less than 20% say yes.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.630
OK that's not a shocking
number.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:53.020
They're picking something that's
like apple pie, right?

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.800
I mean, drive carefully, who
could be against that?

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.130
But who wants a weird sign
on your lawn, right?

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.990
And they made it unattractive
on purpose.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.390
So 20%.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.530
Here's the other group.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:03.910
They go up to your door, they
knock on the door, and they

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.300
say, I have a petition here--
you've had that experience on

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.105
the street or somewhere--

00:29:07.105 --> 00:29:08.460
I have a petition here.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.570
Will you sign up to support
legislation to

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.750
reduce traffic accidents.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.870
OK, do you think there's
some gimmick here?

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.200
I mean, who's for traffic
accidents?

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.260
The person says yes.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.130
OK, I'm going to
sign that one.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.020
So a lot of people
sign that one.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.980
Then you go back to the same
house a few weeks later and

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.700
you ask the sign, it moves
up to over 50%

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.780
say yes for the sign.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.450
That's literally the
foot-in-the-door.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.060
Once you sign this petition,
then you're incredibly more

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.290
likely to say yes
for the sign.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:40.090
And what we understand that to
be through other experiments,

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.590
we want to be consistent
in our behavior.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.860
Well gee, if we're willing to
sign a petition for fewer

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.050
accidents, why wouldn't we put
a sign on our lawn to further

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.060
promote people not
getting run over.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.410
All right, but once you make
the small agreement, then

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.570
you're willing to do something
way larger that by itself you

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:57.810
would never do.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:00.450
And I can't tell you from my own
experience how much that

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:03.380
when people end up doing
something they really wish

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.590
they hadn't done, it often
starts-- and you may know this

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:09.740
in yourself-- with a small
thing, good or bad.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.770
It seems small, then you do a
little bit more, and then a

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.090
little more, and then all of a
sudden, you're surrounded by a

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.550
SWAT team in your dorm room.

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.840
And you say, how did
this happen, right?

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.720
It's amazing how often things,
good and bad, start with small

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.960
steps, another small step, and
all of a sudden you're on a

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.990
slippery slope to doing
something you could never have

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.020
imagined if it would have been
posed as strongly as you ended

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:33.910
up doing it.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:34.300
Does that make sense?

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.580
OK, so this is compliance.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.310
Little question, little
question, all of a sudden,

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.890
you're doing something you
would never do by itself.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:42.520
Obedience.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.570
Now obedience, we think,
well, we're not

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.095
going to be that obedient.

00:30:46.095 --> 00:30:48.350
We, to a certain extent, obey
our parents, the police, our

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.840
bosses, and firefighters.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.000
Again, a certain amount of
obedience logically we think

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.580
is necessary for social order
and civilization so that we're

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.510
all organized in some
non-chaotic way.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.290
And it varies across groups
and times and so on.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.010
But we know there are horrible
examples where obedience is

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:09.430
associated with genocide.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.730
The defense of many Nazis in
Germany was that they were

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.080
simply following
orders, right?

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.020
And in genocides all over the
world, tragically, tragically,

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.140
people will say why
do they do that?

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.180
Why would they end up-- and if
you had posed it that way to

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.230
people, why would you end up
murdering many people,

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.680
innocent people, defenseless
people?

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.820
So often, part of it is being
obedient to some group.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.880
So now comes one of the all time
amazing experiments that

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.950
we can't pull off-- although I'm
going to tell you it was

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.230
pulled off in a certain
way recently--

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.580
from Stanley Milgram.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.810
So it works like this.

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:47.460
This is the actual flyer that
Milgram at Yale sent out,

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.640
"Persons Needed for a Study
of Memory." And

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.680
they'll pay you $4.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.080
At that time that
was something.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.050
And you would come into
Professor Stanley Milgram, the

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:58.110
Department of psychology
at Yale University.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.460
And here was the gimmick.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.790
It was a newspaper
add like that.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:02.510
And you would come in.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.800
And there would be two
people in the room.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.970
One was a confederate and one
was you, who naively, honestly

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.680
just shows up to do
an experiment.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.270
They tell you they're here to
help science improve learning

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.590
and memory through punishment.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.820
Can we improve learning and
memory through punishment?

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.620
And we're going to say that
one of you will randomly

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.060
become the teacher and one
will become the learner.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.480
And they make it look
like a lottery.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.620
They hand out a piece
of paper.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.190
But it's all a set up.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.310
You will become the teacher.

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:31.340
The other person will
become the learner.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.880
You will become the teacher.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.900
And you get sets of word
pairs to memorize.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.980
As a teacher, you give a word
and the student is supposedly

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.940
to give you the right answer.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.690
You have the answer
in front of you.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:47.210
And you tell them whether they
were right or wrong.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.120
If they give you the correct
answer, you're supposed to say

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.450
"good" or "that's right" to
encourage good learning.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.630
If they give you the incorrect
response, you're supposed to

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:58.720
press a button that
delivers a shock.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.570
Here is the device they used.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.670
And with every one of these
buttons, the voltage goes up.

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:09.430
And you, as the teacher, sample
a 45 volt shock which I

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.960
can tell you is moderately
uncomfortable.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.270
It's not terrible, but you
know it's not fun.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.320
OK, so you know that.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.020
In case you had some illusion
about that, you know 45 volts

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.210
is already pretty
uncomfortable.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.350
So you say that's how
it feels, OK?

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.840
OK.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.290
Now the other person
goes into the room.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.000
And you're sitting there
as the teacher.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.380
So here's the set up.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.550
Here you are getting your $4.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.860
Here's the scientist
in a white jacket

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.440
telling you what to do--

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.450
the researcher.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.140
Here's the so-called learner,
but that's really a

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:40.880
confederate.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.100
They're not really getting
shocked in the other room.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.160
But they're going to
play act a lot.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.040
And you're sitting there in
front of this device that goes

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.110
from 15 to 450 volts in small
steps of 15 volts.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:56.450
30 switches across here.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.670
150 has a label that
says strong shock.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.140
255, intense.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.000
375, danger, severe shock.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.110
At 435 and 450, there's
no word left for the

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.910
intensity of shock.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.060
They just put XXX.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.310
All right?

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:12.770
Initially, the learner
does well.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:13.320
Again, it's a set up.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.159
The learner knows what they're
supposed to do.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.860
But then, errors
start to make.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:17.860
The learner starts--

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.310
and with every error, you're
supposed to go one worse.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.630
The learner complains that the
shocks are starting to hurt as

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.989
they move up to about 100.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:29.320
Then they scream in the other
room when you give the shock.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.670
And the participants--

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.170
I can tell you, they're just
like you would think, just

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.770
like you would do.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.270
You go like, I really don't
like this, This

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.389
doesn't seem right.

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:40.210
And the person running the
experiment says, your job is

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:41.790
to do the next thing.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:42.540
OK?

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.569
And the people are suffering.

00:34:43.569 --> 00:34:45.130
And like, this can't be right?

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.489
And how is this happening
at Yale?

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:47.810
And so on.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.690
So think what you would do.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.280
The learner complains
about his or her

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.750
condition the other room.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:54.739
More errors.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:58.700
Now the teacher is often begging
the other person,

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.020
please listen and
pay attention.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.440
I don't want to shock
you any more.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.345
Come on, get it together.

00:35:02.345 --> 00:35:04.000
I don't want to do
it any more.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.500
Then the person starts to scream
from the other room.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.710
"You have no right to keep
me here!" Another shock.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.780
"I refuse to answer anymore.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.660
You can't hold me here!" The
person's shouting this from

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.480
the other room.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.100
"My heart is bothering me!" At
300 volts, the person says

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.830
they refuse to answer.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.060
You turn your head to the
experimenter and you say, the

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.140
person's not even answering at
300 volts, what do I do?

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.290
And the scientist in the white
jacket says, if there's no

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.100
response, that's a
wrong response.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.350
So you give another shock.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.750
And at 350 volts, the person's
not even responding anymore.

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.790
As far as you know, they're
sort of dead.

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:42.050
I mean, you don't know what
they're doing, but you think

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.200
something horrible
has happened.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.430
This is fully play acted.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.380
And the people who went through
this were miserable.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.860
So much so that it's been almost
impossible to do this

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:49.290
ever since.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.440
People think it's too dangerous
for the naive

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.580
research participant who thinks
they're nearly shocking

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.830
somebody to death.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.470
So how many people go
all the way up?

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:03.710
And this person's screaming,
begging, saying their heart is

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.720
starting to give out, and
finally going silent.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.100
How many people go all the way
up to 450, all the way up?

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.730
Long after the person has
stopped responding and you get

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.080
these incredibly bad times?

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.360
So they asked experts and they
said, it'll be about 1 to 3%,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.510
and that's a good
way to identify

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.866
psychopaths in the world.

00:36:21.866 --> 00:36:24.510
And you could certainly sit
there and you could say what

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.110
I'm going to say, like I
would never do that.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.920
And I'm going to convince you
in a minute, guaranteed in

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.780
this room most of you would do
that all the way, guaranteed,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:33.965
by any scientific evidence.

00:36:33.965 --> 00:36:36.550
And all of us will say I
would never do that.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.640
The power of the situation.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.590
So how many people went all
the way? two thirds

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:42.870
went all the way.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:43.380
Two thirds.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.160
Look at around.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.815
Look to your left and
to your right.

00:36:45.815 --> 00:36:47.760
If there's three of you,
two of you will

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.370
go all the way until--

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.540
I know, no, not me,
not me, not me.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.810
So here's what experts said.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.040
Once you get to some intensity
level, practically nobody's

00:36:59.040 --> 00:36:59.860
going to do it.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:04.510
Here's the two thirds of people
who went all the way.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:08.690
And so two thirds went
all the way, but

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:09.940
everybody went to 100 volts.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.280
Almost nobody stopped
early on.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.970
But one third stopped around
a third through.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:19.320
Two thirds went all the way.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.260
So people have said, oh,
that's the 1950s.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.370
People were much more conformist
and obedient.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:30.200
That was before Vietnam, before
rock 'n' roll, before

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.280
Watergate, and all this
stuff that has

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.700
made us distrust authority.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:38.400
And before the internet, we
know what's going on.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.920
So now, you guys go
like it's not us.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.710
That's some sad 1950s people
who are just following

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:44.200
instructions.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.000
We're independent people
of the 21st century.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
So they almost redid this
experiment in some reduced way

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.900
a couple years ago and it
doesn't make a difference.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.580
So 2009, here are some
things they did to

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.000
get approval of this.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
First of all, they carefully--

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.110
even more carefully than
before-- screened the subjects

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.790
to make sure they were in good
mental health so they weren't

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:06.120
breaking down people.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.360
They were told three times they
could stop and still get

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.830
$50 for participating.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.490
They were told multiple times,
you can stop, you can stop,

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.260
you can stop.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.170
After the experiment they were
instantly told what the whole

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.880
thing was about, which wasn't
that well organized before.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.080
They had a clinical psychologist
sitting there to

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.810
make sure that the person
seems not to distressed.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.920
And they said, look since
we know that pretty much

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.390
everybody who went to 150
went all the way,

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:29.430
we'll stop at 150 volts.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.430
We won't torture a person
all the way through.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:33.030
But 150 is pretty big.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.960
You're doing it for quite
a bit of time.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.720
So what happens in 2009?

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.260
For Milgram, 79%
went 150 volts.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:45.810
In 2009, 70% of undergraduates
go to that same length.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:47.990
It looks pretty much the same.

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:49.520
And by the way, in case you
thought women were more

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.760
merciful, or not, they are
identical to men in these

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.140
studies in 2009.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.160
It's stunning.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.350
And so everybody who worries
about situations in the world

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:04.040
where people do horrible things
to other people is

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.530
incredibly impressed
by this experiment.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:11.500
Where so a little pressure, as
a volunteer experiment, where

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.890
you can stop any time and walk
out, it's not your boss, it"s

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:17.950
not a general, it's not your
culture, it's not your parents

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.770
and schools, just an
experimenter--

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.970
almost everybody goes
all the way.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.360
And that's true in
2009 as well.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.670
We're incredibly prone, if we
have the right situation, to

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:32.910
be obedient beyond what our
humanitarian spirits suggest

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.140
they would be.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.600
So nobody really knows why
we're so obedient.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.220
Although I'll show you some
things that people have

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.280
discovered.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.340
Does the status of the authority
figure matter?

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.310
Does it matter that the person
seems like a scientist who

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.970
knows what he or she is doing?

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.940
Is it belief that the source
of authority, because they

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.480
know what they're doing,
it must be OK?

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.110
How much does it matter that you
can't quite figure out how

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.080
to get out of this situation?

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.090
And how much of it is a slippery
slope like we've

00:39:59.090 --> 00:39:59.550
talked about?

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.160
Well if I can do five
volts, I can do 10.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.290
If I can do 10, I can 20.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:03.720
If I can do 20, I can do 30.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.730
And somehow, five by five,
you end up at 400.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.020
So these are all ideas.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.420
So people have looked at this.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.600
What if the person gives
no instructions?

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.520
Almost nobody does it.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.270
If the person just says, here's
the experiment, please

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.660
do it, and then doesn't talk
with you when you say you want

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.210
to stop, people stop.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.090
All they have to say
though is "please

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:25.020
continue" and that's enough.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.360
Men and women aren't
different.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.960
If you do the experiment
not in a psychology--

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.010
here's the baseline, the 70%
that go all the way.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.150
In an office building,
it's less.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.840
Why do you think that?

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.010
PROFESSOR: People's
interpretation of the

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.480
situation is not quite as
officially scientific.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.340
Still, you get a lot.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.060
If the person in charge doesn't
seem like they know

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.020
what they're doing, particularly
in a white coat,

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.950
doesn't seem like an advanced
scientist, pushes way back the

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:50.310
authority the person.

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:54.490
If the experimenter is more
formal but away from you so

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.930
you don't see them-- they're
talking to you over an

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:57.130
intercom or something--

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.610
that pushes you back to
do it less likely.

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:01.970
If the victim is in the
same room as you are,

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:02.880
that reduces it.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.820
Although still 40%
go all the way.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.920
If you have to touch the person
while the person's

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.050
being shocked, that
reduces it.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:11.640
And if you have a
confederate--

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.510
another person working
with you on this--

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.800
who rebels, that also
has a huge effect.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.870
This idea again if there's one
dissenter, that frees you

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:22.430
sometimes to follow your
own ideas and thoughts.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.190
But these one dissenters
are set up who

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:27.170
becomes that one dissenter.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:31.890
OK, the famous Stanford
prison experiment.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:33.500
Same idea, roughly speaking.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.860
And unbelievably relevant
to Abu Ghraib.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.070
It's almost as if from the
viewpoint of psychologists

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:41.640
they had rerun the Stanford
experiment except in Iraq with

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.240
real prisoners and American
soldiers.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.420
But in the Stanford prison
experiment, there was a social

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.770
situation where they basically
told people that they would be

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.050
either the prisoners or
the guards, Stanford

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.500
undergraduates.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.300
And they would put them in the
basement of their psychology

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.300
building and they would
use various closets

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.010
as the pretend cells.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:02.150
You were assigned
to be randomly

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:03.500
a guard or a prisoner.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.780
To make it a little bit more
realistic, they surprised you

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:06.480
when they picked you up.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.720
You had signed up.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.110
But they would run to your house
and a guy would grab you

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.720
and say, you're coming now
and you're the prisoner.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.690
There's a little play acting
in this as well.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.400
And what they found was
that the guards--

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.390
the Stanford students who were
randomly assigned to be

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:22.160
guards-- became so sadistic, and
the Stanford students who

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.710
were the prisoners were so
stressed-- that the study was

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.530
stopped in six days.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:26.780
They were going to do 24 days.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.500
Because people were sobbing,
people were doing horrible

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.280
things to one another.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.230
Here's pictures of the
Stanford-- this reminds you of

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.920
Abu Ghraib, right?

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.660
All lined up like that.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.920
Typical Stanford students
who were dressed

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.280
up and given a baton.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.100
And they were just horrible,
horrible, horrible, horrible.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:49.250
Playing the role of the prison
guards, they became abusive

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:53.390
and mean to an astounding
degree.

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:57.090
And so again, this idea now--

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:59.470
weirdly enough, the only
authority here is Phil

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:00.940
Zimbardo, the social
psychologist, who said your

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.560
job is to be the guard
and your job

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.260
is to be the prisoner.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.180
So anybody could have stopped
sort of at anything.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:09.120
But once they got playing these
roles, it took them only

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.450
a few hours to really occupy the
life of the sadistic guard

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.660
and the life of the victimized
prisoner.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:21.230
So think of this thing in Abu
Ghraib where you had a huge

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.690
number of prisoners, a very
small number of American

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.800
soldiers, very few of the
American soldiers had any

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.840
training about how to think
about being a guard.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.340
It was almost as if you had
rerun the Stanford prison

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.480
experiment.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.670
Add to it fear on both sides of
harm that's intended by the

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:39.560
other groups.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.470
Add to it the cultural
divisions between the

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:45.020
Americans and the Iraqis, so
they really felt like the

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.210
other group was another group.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.490
I mean, you know here at
Stanford in the basement that

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.780
these were your other
students.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.675
Half the room could be the
guards here, Half the room

00:43:52.675 --> 00:43:53.840
could be the prisoners here.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.640
Nobody has been allowed to
rerun this because the

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.770
behavior was so horrible, so
fast, that there's nobody--

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.083
that you're simply just not
allowed to do an experiment

00:44:01.083 --> 00:44:02.333
like that again.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.390
And here again is a picture of
the guards, the students

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:09.120
randomly chosen to
be the guards.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.190
And here's one of the
students randomly

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.050
chosen to be the prisoner.

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:13.290
It looks just like Abu Ghraib.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:18.080
It's as if the Army should
have heard about that

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.755
experiment before that.

00:44:20.755 --> 00:44:23.330
And here's more pictures
of the sort of abuse.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:26.460
And you could find lots of
videos online about that.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.550
OK so I'm going to jump
forward to this.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.970
So again we could think, again,
the more you know about

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:34.800
this, how free was this person
to do the right thing.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.690
And how situationally dominated
were they by

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.900
authority and by the situation
that around them.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.430
If you think about the Milgram
experiment, who's your

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:43.920
commander in charge of you.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.580
If you think about the Zimbardo
experiment, you have

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:51.270
the job of being the guard.

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:54.490
And is she really a bad person,
or did you put her a

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:59.140
hopeless situation
to do a good job?

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.320
So the last thing I want to
talk-- let's talk about that

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:02.750
for one second.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:03.420
Any thoughts?

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.670
How would you find her?

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:08.040
Yes?

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.730
AUDIENCE: What kind of
torture [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.350
PROFESSOR: What kind of abuse
was in the prison?

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:15.630
Well, from what one reads, and
who knows how accurate exactly

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:21.460
that is, one person did die.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.670
Not much of it was the torture
of the sort of water boarding

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:25.720
that you hear about.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.690
It was more scaring the heck out
of them and embarrassing

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.520
them horribly.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.140
Taking a bunch of people, having
them all be naked, and

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:37.160
piling them up, putting them on
a leash, I'm sure it wasn't

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.180
physically nice.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.680
It wasn't brutal in
the most sense.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.410
It was more taunting
and humiliating.

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:48.210
But there was some pain
involved as well.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.680
It wasn't murderous.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.230
You could say that limit.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.520
Yes?

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.734
AUDIENCE: Has anyone been
able to do a follow up?

00:45:54.734 --> 00:45:56.660
I mean, I know given the
circumstances [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.880
PROFESSOR: It's almost
impossible.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.750
The same thing with
the Milgram.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.860
We did a little bit in 2009 with
these limitations, right.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.890
But the amazing thing is
it looks just like--

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:07.240
as far as they took it-- just
like the 1950s Milgram.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.080
The Stanford experiment, people
now think ethically you

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:12.820
can't do that.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:16.360
Because not only is the
behavior of the guards

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.500
abysmal, but the people who were
the prisoners were really

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.000
depressed afterwards, were
really anxious afterwards.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.730
It wasn't like stepping in
and out of an experiment.

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.070
As were, by the way, the Milgram
subjects who went all

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:28.760
the way up.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.350
They reported being haunted
by this experience for

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.490
many years to come.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.250
So these kinds of things people
would not do now,

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:38.450
because it's just considered
too risky for the

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:38.990
participants.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.488
Yes?

00:46:39.488 --> 00:46:44.468
AUDIENCE: So the Stanford
people, the students that were

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:48.706
participating in it, did they
go on to live normal lives

00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:48.960
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.260
PROFESSOR: Oh, what's the
long-term damage?

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.130
That's a very good question.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:53.090
I don't know they're being
followed up or-- that's a very

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:53.690
good question.

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:56.210
I know for months, the people,
especially with the prisoners,

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.900
said they felt very,
very, very bad.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.410
But I don't know if
decades later they

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:02.150
followed them up or not.

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:05.820
And that would be an interesting
question.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.751
Yes?

00:47:06.751 --> 00:47:10.679
AUDIENCE: Do they consider
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:10.679 --> 00:47:14.116
for instance, if someone were
knowledgeable in psychology

00:47:14.116 --> 00:47:15.366
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:20.430
they had been trained
for in psychology?

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:21.680
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:27.150
It's not so much psychology,
I'd say.

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:28.740
I'm going to give you my
impression, because I don't

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.645
have a good answer.

00:47:29.645 --> 00:47:32.280
It's if you get the right kind
of training so you're prepared

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.360
for situation, you have
much better chance.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.490
So remember earlier we talked
about-- now it seems very

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.150
academic compared to
these experiments--

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.550
we talked about cognitive
busyness.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:44.810
That if your mind is not free to
evaluate the situation, you

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.830
interpret it in terms
of disposition.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.490
So what does that mean?

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.200
In a scary, complicated
situation, we go by our guts.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.240
And our guts are, the other
person is different.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.140
I'm in charge of them
as the guard, right?

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.990
If we're trained so that we
have a second habit we can

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.910
fall back on, then we have a
better chance of doing the

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:08.350
right thing when the
situation arises.

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:09.380
This is a general point.

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.370
But yes, just sending in people
kind of unprepared--

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.720
it's not that they have to know
psychology, it's that

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.430
they have to be told again and
again and again, when you're

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:20.630
the guard, keep in mind that
it's so easy to be abusive.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:24.490
It's so easy to be humiliating,
that you have to

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.740
guard against that
in yourself.

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.770
Does that seem OK?

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:27.020
Yes.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.200
So it's training we think is--

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.400
it's not the intellectual
knowledge.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.450
It's practicing so that when
the moment arises, you're

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:37.780
ready, is I think what people
believe is right thing.

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.580
OK.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.780
So last thing I want to talk
about, a couple of things, is

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.735
bystanders and helping.

00:48:41.735 --> 00:48:44.040
And these are just amazing
experiments.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.170
And in many ways, they're all
about embarrassment, and how

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:50.530
embarrassment makes us
incredibly less helpful and

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:54.100
kind to others than
we can imagine.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:58.030
So the most famous case that
began a lot of this research

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.650
was they murder in New York
City of Kitty Genovese.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:01.970
And I'm going to read
to you just a

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:03.320
minute about her murder.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.720
It got a fantastic amount
of newspaper coverage.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.540
And this was the walk home
she had to her apartment.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.970
So at approximately 3:20 in the
morning of March 13, 1964,

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.000
28-year old Catherine Genovese
was returning to her home a

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.210
nice middle-class area
of Queens from her

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.410
job as a bar manager.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.240
She parked her red Fiat at a
nearby parking lot, turned off

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:25.010
the lights and started the
walk to her second floor

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:27.690
apartment some 35 yards away.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:30.580
She got as far as a street light
when a man grabbed her.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:31.490
She screamed.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.930
The lights went on in a 10
floor apartment building

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.570
nearby, so a lot of people.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:36.770
She yelled, "Oh, my God.

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:37.480
He stabbed me.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.100
Please help me." Windows
opened in

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:39.870
the apartment building.

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:43.230
A man's voice shouted, "Let that
girl alone." The attacker

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:46.470
looked up, shrugged, and walked
off down the street.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.000
Ms. Genovese struggled
to her feet.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.860
Lights went back off
in the apartment.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:53.140
The attacker comes immediately
back and stabs her again.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.680
She again cries out,
"I'm dying.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.490
I'm dying." Again, the lights
come on, and the windows open

00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:59.760
in many of the nearby
apartments.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.860
The assailant again left
and got into his

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.040
car and drove away.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.760
She staggers to her feet as
a city bus drives by.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.250
It's 3:30 in the morning now.

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.290
The attacker returns again.

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:11.880
He finds her in the doorway at
foot of the stairs and he

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.075
stabs her a third time, this
time with a fatal consequence.

00:50:14.075 --> 00:50:16.560
It's 3:50, OK?

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.100
Half an hour when the police
received the first call.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.490
They responded quickly, and
within two minutes they were

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:24.170
at the scene.

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:25.370
She was already dead.

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:26.110
The only person--

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.830
well, the one person to call
was a neighbor who revealed

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:31.900
that he had phoned only after
much thought and an earlier

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.100
phone call to a friend.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.330
So he doesn't call the police.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:36.220
He calls a friend and says, hmm,
I wonder what I should do

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.560
here, right?

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.050
And he said, I didn't want
to get involved.

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.280
Later, it was learned that there
were 37 other witnesses

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.700
to the stalking and stabbing
over the half hour period.

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.450
Why did no one offer any help
or call the police?

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:48.860
The story and question
were front page

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.890
news across the country.

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:52.430
Urban and moral decay, apathy,
indifference where some of the

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:53.970
many offered explanations.

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:56.390
This was one of these cases that
people said, this shows

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:59.420
you how bad off we are,
especially in cities, where

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.070
people just don't care
about other people.

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:02.720
OK.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.380
They won't make a phone call
to the police, except one

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.200
person hemming and hawing his
way for half an hour.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:14.000
So the lack of the bystanders
helping this woman, is it

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.950
because people are selfish?

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:18.380
Nowadays, you can bet you'd
have a video of that on

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.100
YouTube, right?

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.710
The question was what about
the rest of it?

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:22.210
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:25.360
my life, fear of getting hurt,
what would you have done?

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.460
Now, let me tell you--

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.570
you'll see the punch line in a
moment-- is the more people

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:31.400
around who could help, the
more certain you are that

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.690
nobody's going to help.

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:37.450
The last thing you want to get
help is a bunch of people.

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:38.200
OK?

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.860
The best chance you have
is one person,

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.910
counter-intuitively
and against the

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:44.260
math of multiple people.

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:45.430
So here we go.

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:47.750
So the most famous studies--
and show you about three of

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.320
them, because they're
just amazing--

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.900
about how we won't
help people.

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.670
Because if we're not sure what
the right thing to do is, and

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.750
there's other people there, it's
too embarrassing to do

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.930
the most obvious humanitarian
gesture.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:04.310
They did a series of
experiments, most of them

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.590
around Princeton,
looking at ideas

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:07.850
about pluralistic ignorance.

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:09.750
They say, each witness is
uncertain whether there's a

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:11.155
real emergency, they
look around, if

00:52:11.155 --> 00:52:12.330
the others not reacting--

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.020
this probably part of the
story-- decide it must not be

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:14.990
real emergency.

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:18.160
Social evaluation of others,
what are they doing?

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.280
Diffusion of responsibility,
each person felt that somebody

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.170
else is going to get help.

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:23.470
So these are parts of the
story, but here's the

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:24.820
experiments.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.410
You arrive for an experiment to
discuss personal problems.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.930
You signed up.

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:28.745
You're a Princeton
undergraduate.

00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:29.850
You show up.

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:31.830
There's one to four
people put in

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.470
different rooms over intercoms.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:36.860
So it's one person sometimes
alone or two at

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.200
two different intercoms.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.400
One person, the confederate,
over the intercom,

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.800
dramatically enacts a person
having a seizure.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.090
All right.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:47.770
So imagine you're a student.

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:49.980
And one of these people, who
you believe is randomly

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.390
another student, starts
to say, I think I

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:53.870
need somebody here--

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:54.370
dramatically.

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:55.410
I can do well enough--

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:57.350
because I've got one of the
seizures coming on.

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.790
I could really use some help,
if somebody could help me,

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:00.890
somebody could help.

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:01.630
Choking sounds.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:02.300
I'm going to die.

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.640
I'm going to die.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.500
Choking sound.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.250
The intercom goes quiet.

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.430
What do you do?

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:14.810
Well, if there's two of you,
about 80% of the time, you're

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:16.200
going to do something.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.020
If there are six if you, only
30% of the time will anybody

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.780
do anything.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.042
Yes?

00:53:22.042 --> 00:53:24.838
AUDIENCE: I think sometimes
it's also people

00:53:24.838 --> 00:53:25.770
can be really selfish.

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:30.390
I heard recently in a Johns
Hopkins examination that was

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:32.840
just a few months ago, somebody
started having a

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.780
seizure in the middle of the
exam, and not a single person

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:40.515
stopped their test to help
them, not even the TA.

00:53:40.515 --> 00:53:42.140
PROFESSOR: So you're saying
people can be really selfish,

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.100
because at Johns Hopkins--

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.340
AUDIENCE: It was their exam.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:44.990
They didn't want to stop.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.870
PROFESSOR: They had an exam.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:47.360
And somebody started
having a seizure.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.630
And neither the students nor
the teaching assistant did

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:50.680
anything to help the person.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.480
AUDIENCE: For a long time.

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.290
PROFESSOR: For a long time.

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:53.270
OK.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:55.120
So you're going to
call it selfish.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.520
And I'm going to agree, in
some sense, that's true.

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.890
But I'm going to tell you,
it's amazingly--

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:00.080
I didn't hear about
the story-- it's

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.770
exactly this thing.

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.285
Everything-- and I'll
show you, I

00:54:04.285 --> 00:54:05.480
think, three more examples--

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.410
every experiment shows that if
it's just you and one person,

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:11.846
you are incredibly more likely
to help that person than if

00:54:11.846 --> 00:54:14.210
it's you among five people
or 10 people.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:17.900
The more people, the more
certain you are to do nothing.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.120
And I'm going to tell you
in a moment-- this

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.300
is an amazing example--

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.260
why the exam matters, too.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.680
OK?

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.030
Because these experiments will
show you that this is deeply

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:26.370
human, unfortunately.

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:26.950
OK.

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:27.810
Deeply human.

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:31.090
And I think it's not that
we're more selfish.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:32.950
It's that that were terrible
at knowing--

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:34.630
this is a question about this--
we're terrible about

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:37.720
knowing what to do under
unusual circumstances.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:41.450
And we're overcome by
wanting to fit in.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:42.810
You look at that person, they're
not doing anything.

00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:44.070
They look at you, you're
not doing anything.

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:45.450
You look at that person.

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:47.490
And you guys are-- you're having
a face-off of not doing

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:48.970
anything while the
person's sort of

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:50.770
sinking into their seizure.

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.050
And you could think it's all
about selfishness not helping.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.230
But we think it's something
weirdly about humans that in

00:54:57.230 --> 00:55:00.250
groups, they don't know how
to act if it's unusual.

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:01.900
They just don't know
how to do it.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.720
By themselves, incredibly
more likely to help.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.470
So here's an example.

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:05.160
I'll show you a couple more.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:05.770
Was there a hand?

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.045
Yes?

00:55:07.045 --> 00:55:09.570
AUDIENCE: Is this
showing the--

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:10.410
PROFESSOR: This is
a percentage of

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:11.130
participants who helped.

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:12.200
So are you asking the math?

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.992
Are you still better off--

00:55:13.992 --> 00:55:16.813
AUDIENCE: Is this the percentage
of the time the

00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:17.930
person received help or--

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:18.370
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:19.640
This is a percentage of help.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.740
You're right that you're still
better off with six, but I'll

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.210
show you that very often, it
doesn't play out that way.

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:25.900
But you're right.

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:27.940
There's a trade-off between the
sheer number of people and

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:28.870
the likelihood per person.

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:30.390
You're absolutely right.

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.470
That varies a little bit.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:34.580
Here's another one called
lady in distress.

00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:37.590
A subject walks alone or with a
passive confederate, so the

00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:39.360
confederate is set
up to do nothing.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.470
Or with a friend, a real friend,
you come as a pair.

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.900
And used you go into a room
that's separated by a curtain.

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.930
The experimenter goes
to the other room.

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:49.780
In this case, they made it
a woman at the time.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:53.060
Turns on a tape recording
of a huge fall,

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.060
much bigger than that.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.130
Boom.

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:56.580
She's around a curtain.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:01.180
And she start moaning, a
pre-recorded, painful moan.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.800
You are sitting on the other
side of the curtain.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.490
Who gets up to go see what
happened to the experimenter

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:09.870
who sounds like they had
a huge fall and are

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:11.350
moaning with pain.

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:12.370
This is very much like
the example you

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:13.720
said almost, right?

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.120
What do the people do?

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.170
So here's what happens.

00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:20.900
If you're by yourself, a 70%
chance you'll go there.

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.590
You could wonder what's
happening to the other 30%,

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:23.940
but OK, that's still--

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.190
OK.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:29.750
If the other person sits there
who's set up to not do

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:35.260
anything, practically nobody
ever go and helps.

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:36.560
Because you're sitting
there, and the other

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:37.260
person's not doing it.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.680
And you're going, well,
I don't know.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.090
It's kind of weird situation.

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.940
Am I invading a person's
privacy?

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.430
Maybe that wasn't what
I thought I was.

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:45.720
Because the other person doesn't
seem to be doing

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.780
anything, because
they're set up.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.230
If there's two people who
are naive, you're

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:50.460
somewhere in between.

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.060
If you come with a friend,
somewhere in between.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.570
But here's the weird thing.

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:56.760
The more people, the more you
kind of try to figure out,

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:57.800
what's the right thing to do?

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.822
And you're not doing
anything, so I'm

00:56:58.822 --> 00:56:59.620
not going to do anything.

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.460
The other person's saying you--
does that make sense?

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.920
Every one of these, the more
people there are, the more

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.090
people don't know what to
do, and they do nothing.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:08.110
Because they don't want to
do something weird and

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:10.440
embarrassing like make trouble
or not do what

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.620
you're supposed to do.

00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:12.640
Here's another one.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.880
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.920
Subjects filling out survey.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.410
Smoke enters through a vent.

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:20.365
You're doing this survey alone,
in a group of three or

00:57:20.365 --> 00:57:23.460
with two confederate's who
notice but ignore the smoke,

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.040
or a friend you bring
with you.

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.270
So who leaves the room within
six minutes to go get help

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:32.720
when smoke is billowing
into your room?

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.480
As you sit there again-- this
is like the Milgram

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.700
experiment-- you go, well,
of course I would do it.

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:38.130
But amazingly, people are
sitting there trying to figure

00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:41.810
out, should I finish this first,
is this really a fire,

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:42.970
what's going on here?

00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:46.080
Alone, 75% of the people get up
within six minutes and go

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.590
tell somebody, there's smoke
billowing into here.

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:50.410
With two passive confederate--
so people set up to do

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:52.840
nothing-- only 10% of the time
does the individual get up and

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:53.780
go tell anybody.

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.530
You look around the other two
people aren't doing anything,

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:59.290
you figure well, that must
be the right thing to do.

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:01.850
Two naive subjects--

00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:03.500
now that we're doing
the math this way--

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:07.680
12% by individuals, so
a third of the groups

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.690
approximately do something.

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:11.760
That's still pretty low.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.600
But if you go interestingly in
with a friend, that number

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.580
goes up-- a person you really
know and trust.

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.100
Because the interpretation is,
if it's somebody, you know,

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.110
you're not going to
be embarrassed.

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:22.090
You can say to that person,
well, this is a little wacky,

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.760
but shouldn't we go tell
somebody there's smoke here or

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.760
somebody collapsed next door?

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.660
And then the friend goes, yes,
it's probably a good idea.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.250
I don't know, but maybe we
should do that, right?

00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:31.730
But if you don't know the
person, you're not to have

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:32.700
that conversation.

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:36.480
So a friend is very powerful
to release you from this.

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.900
But if you don't know
the other people--

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:39.772
yes?

00:58:39.772 --> 00:58:40.756
AUDIENCE: Does it make
a difference if

00:58:40.756 --> 00:58:41.371
it's a family member?

00:58:41.371 --> 00:58:43.216
Like if you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:43.216 --> 00:58:45.350
PROFESSOR: I don't know that
they've done this.

00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:48.010
So these are usually done with
undergraduates, so you just

00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:50.030
bring your roommate
or your pal.

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:51.990
I don't if it matters
at other levels.

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.970
So that's a very
good question.

00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:53.820
And maybe people
looked at that.

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.990
I just don't know.

00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:58.320
This is the last experiment.

00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:00.060
And this is kind of the
topper of all of this.

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.740
So this gets back to being
in an exam situation.

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:03.650
I'm glad you brought
up the --.

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:06.730
Because this is almost
an ironic experiment

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:07.830
in a deepest sense.

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:09.670
It's again Darley
at Princeton.

00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:10.550
A Good Samaritan.

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:15.590
So what's the story of the Good
Samaritan from the Bible

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:16.310
for those--

00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:16.770
yes?

00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:19.530
AUDIENCE: Pretty much
this guy who's dying

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:21.840
of thirst on a highway.

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.920
PROFESSOR: Somebody really
injured on the side of the

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.435
road, right?

00:59:24.435 --> 00:59:24.720
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.970
It was somebody who needs
help in life.

00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:29.534
And a bunch of people go by
one person at a time.

00:59:29.534 --> 00:59:32.468
First person goes by,
doesn't do anything.

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:33.446
Second person doesn't
do anything.

00:59:33.446 --> 00:59:35.900
Third person called the
Good Samaritan --

00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.300
PROFESSOR: He's from Samaria.

00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.220
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:38.550
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:38.640
No.

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.443
I'm just telling
you that's it.

00:59:40.443 --> 00:59:42.898
AUDIENCE: Sorry--.

00:59:42.898 --> 00:59:43.389
PROFESSOR: No, it's good.

00:59:43.389 --> 00:59:43.715
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:43.715 --> 00:59:47.480
The third guy looks down
at the injured man, and

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.310
he helps him out.

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:48.740
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:51.810
Now, I'm going to tell you
one more thing, which is

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:55.630
Samaritans we're not the most
affluent members of

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:56.610
society at the time.

00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:59.730
This matters for the story in
a way you're about to hear.

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.600
So a Good Samaritan.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.600
So they took students--
now, think about this.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.770
Because they want to show you
how absurdly weird it is when

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.410
it is we're willing to step
forward and help a person.

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:12.280
And I don't think it's
about goodness.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.860
It's about the weirdness
of our minds and not

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.220
embarrassing ourselves.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.090
And how preoccupied we are
with our other business.

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:22.590
So social psychologists are
going to tell you the reason

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:25.750
the Good Samaritan stopped
was not because he

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:26.950
was such a good guy.

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:31.090
It's because he didn't
have so much to do.

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:32.040
And here's the experiment.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.290
They're going to tell you why.

01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:38.950
These are seminary students
studying to become ministers.

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:40.590
So this is the group.

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:43.270
They picked this group because
they want to show you-- social

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:46.600
psychologists get irritated by
personality psychologists.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.840
They say, can you pick a nicer
group than people studying to

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.520
be ministers?

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.770
That's the disposition.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.560
They're filling out
surveys about

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.630
religious values in a room.

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.210
They're told that they're going
to have to present a

01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:06.350
talk about either seminary
jobs or--

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:07.990
so this is careerism--

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:12.040
or a sermon on the
Good Samaritan.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.670
So you're sitting there going,
help people, help

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.430
people, help people.

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:17.970
All right. that's
their speech.

01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:19.910
They're prepared.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.130
Then they're released to go
give this talk in front of

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:25.450
other faculty members and their
students, so they want

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:26.770
to do a good job.

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:29.090
Either they're sent to the
building across the campus

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:31.340
ahead of time, plenty of time.

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.950
On time, they have--
or they're late.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.370
They go, oh, my gosh,
you didn't go over?

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:35.355
We told you you should be--

01:01:35.355 --> 01:01:36.690
you're going to be--
if you don't run,

01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:38.010
you're going to be late.

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:41.100
You don't want to be late to
give your practice sermon or

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.730
speech to the faculty committee

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:46.100
waiting for you, right.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.680
And then here's one more
thing to keep in mind.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.470
Some of you probably have
visited Princeton, New

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:51.390
Jersey-- just to give
you a sense of this.

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:55.880
This is even back in the
1960s, but even now--

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.920
so who's been to Princeton
University?

01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.350
You have?

01:01:59.350 --> 01:01:59.790
OK.

01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:06.300
Scary urban environment full
of threatening noises, the

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.410
campus itself?

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:13.040
Pastoral place full of eating
clubs and references F. Scott

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.490
Fitzgerald.

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.290
I'm just adding in that
Princeton is a pretty

01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:20.000
nonthreatening place,
the campus itself.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.170
I'm just adding this in,
because you've got

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:21.500
to keep this in.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.470
OK.

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:24.550
Here's the confederate.

01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:29.230
It's a man slumped in a doorway
moaning in obvious

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:32.670
pain, hunched over on the ground
going, uh, uh, uh.

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:36.260
Now, on the path to giving the
speech, who stops to help?

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:42.000
Anything they could measure
about the personalities in

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.840
individuals made no difference
whether you stopped to help.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.130
Whether you were saying stop to
help, stop to help, stop to

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:52.110
help, because you were going to
give a talk about the Good

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:57.260
Samaritan or going to talk about
career paths doesn't

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:58.900
make any difference at all.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.490
So amazingly, the people's
zooming by this injured person

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:03.440
are saying, stop and help the
person, stop and-- the guy's

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.790
moaning in the doorway
next to them--

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:09.510
as they're walking, sorry.

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:12.270
What counts as to who stops?

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:12.780
They're by themselves.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.910
So it's not a group thing now.

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:15.520
They're by themselves, right?

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.590
It's if they're ahead of time.

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:20.610
If they have time, because they
know they can stop and

01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:25.670
help somebody and still make
their talk on time, 63% stop,

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:30.370
45% if it's going to be close
call, 10% if they're rushing,

01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:31.725
because they're going
to be late.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.020
The description you set up, a
big group of people taking an

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.460
exam, they're like this.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.500
They're pressured, their
pressured, they're pressured.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.560
And there's a lot of us.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.640
Somebody's going to take care
this if they need to.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.090
And I've got things to do,
like take an exam.

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.920
Or run over and explain how
incredibly important it is

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.960
morally to help those who are
injured and around you, right?

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:01.970
So it can have a more sort of
literary experiment showing

01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:06.780
you how weird it is when we
stop and help people.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.682
Yes?

01:04:07.682 --> 01:04:09.158
AUDIENCE: This happened
on campus.

01:04:09.158 --> 01:04:10.634
I was walking back to
one of the dorms.

01:04:10.634 --> 01:04:14.324
And I walked by and I saw feet
sticking out of a bush, like

01:04:14.324 --> 01:04:15.554
someone had collapsed
into a bush.

01:04:15.554 --> 01:04:17.891
I didn't quite believe it at
first, so I stopped the next

01:04:17.891 --> 01:04:19.982
person and asked, are
there feet there?

01:04:19.982 --> 01:04:21.700
Is that actually what
I'm seeing?

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.943
So eventually, we called the
police, but the response from

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:25.306
most of the people going
by, one was, I'm

01:04:25.306 --> 01:04:26.028
sorry, I can't stop.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:27.471
I'm late for MITSO.

01:04:27.471 --> 01:04:28.914
I have to go pset.

01:04:28.914 --> 01:04:31.800
So a lot of people just went
by and didn't stop.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:31.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.960
So you're giving a story in real
life, on the campus here.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.470
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.250
PROFESSOR: Where two feet were
sticking out from a bush.

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:37.250
AUDIENCE: Yes [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.550
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:39.960
PROFESSOR: No, no, no, no.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.190
This is not a set up.

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:44.280
You're not a confederate.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.570
So first, you wanted to
ask somebody else.

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:46.600
And but this really
interesting.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:46.955
I mean--

01:04:46.955 --> 01:04:47.700
AUDIENCE: To make sure
[INAUDIBLE].

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:47.900
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.890
Because that's the first
thing, right?

01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:50.310
Like, yes, what do you think?

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:51.380
Good idea to have a body here?

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.970
Bad idea to have a body here?

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:56.960
And another person walks by and
say what-- we'd like your

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.110
opinion before we do anything.

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.280
And the person says,
I can't stop.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.470
I have things to do, right?

01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:02.570
I have homework.

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:03.250
Yes.

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:04.550
It's astounding.

01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:08.630
So I'll just stop with saying,
it makes you think-- you used

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:09.880
the word selfish.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.840
And that-- no, no.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.670
I don't mean to pick on you.

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:14.840
But it's just weird how
humans are like this.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.010
You see this all the time.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:20.120
For me personally, all of
these things have really

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.050
changed how I interpret
situations, and how much I

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:25.110
think a person's a
crummy person.

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:27.110
Because up until the fundamental
attribution error,

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:28.990
although I always gave myself
every break for doing

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:32.230
everything wrong, I always
interpreted other people's

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:34.930
failings as deep character
flaws, right?

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:39.610
And it has made me personally
stop and think.

01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:41.960
If somebody's not doing
something I wish they did or

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.730
that I think would be better,
maybe from their perspective,

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:49.690
they're in a situation that's
compelling them to perform

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:52.030
less well than I think they
should or something like that.

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:54.650
So these are unbelievably
fascinating things and very

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.100
convincing.

01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:59.370
And it's very sad when they set
up prisons not remembering

01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:01.050
these lessons that
are so clear cut.

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:03.380
And I think the huge thing to
know about this, as far as we

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:07.650
possibly understand, this is
true of everybody, all of us.

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:09.300
None of us think we
would do this.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.400
All of us are prone
to do this.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.940
Through many, many, many
experiments, without any

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.520
evidence to the contrary, from
a scientific viewpoint, it's

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.330
about as convincing a story
as you can possibly have.

01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:21.580
Thanks very much.
