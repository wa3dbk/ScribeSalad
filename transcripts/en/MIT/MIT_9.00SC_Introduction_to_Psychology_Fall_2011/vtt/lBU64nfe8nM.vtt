00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.930
PROFESSOR: So today we're going
to talk about attention.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.870
And sometimes we talk about
patients who are very unusual.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.350
In the next lecture,
we will do that.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.210
We'll talk about spectacular
disorders of attention.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.650
But today we're going to talk
about attention as it

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.910
typically occurs in you sitting
here right now.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.440
I want to convince you that in
addition to slips of attention

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.520
that can occur as you get older,
also how you attend to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.180
the world around you is weirder
than you think.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.740
In a broad sense, I hope to
convince you that it's

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.760
happening all the time.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.269
Right now, as you go back to
your room, as you walk to the

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.500
next class, or your room.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.540
How you attend to what's around
you in the world is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.730
weirder than you think.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.760
So what is attention?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.670
What do we mean by attending
to things?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.340
So William James was a
psychologist at Harvard who,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.160
in many ways, articulated
concepts in psychology that,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.950
till this day, turned out to
be beautiful ways to talk

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.200
about them in an
everyday sense.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.060
"Everybody knows what
attention is.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.960
It's the taking possession by
the mind in clear and vivid

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.760
form of one out of what seems
like several simultaneous

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.530
objects or trains of thought.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.720
It applies withdrawal of some
things in order to deal with

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.940
others."

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.090
So a big idea there is we can
pay attention to some things

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.820
and there's a lot of
things around us.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.930
And so we have to pick where
we focus our attention.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.650
A little bit like if
you have a budget.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.820
If you have some money, what
do you spend your money on,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.400
and what do not spend
your money on?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.730
So we're going to talk
about attention.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.540
It's kind of similar to
the idea of awareness.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.130
What are you aware of?

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.020
Or what are you conscious of?

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.760
And two themes across the talk
will be we often attend to

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.050
more than we realize.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.310
And I'll show you very specific
evidence for that.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.060
But we often attend to
things less than we

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.350
realize all the time.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.480
And here's roughly
the outline.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.670
We're saying attention, what you
pay attention to, is kind

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.190
of a gatekeeper to what you
perceive and what you know.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.380
Attention is very limited.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.610
We can only process one
thing at a time.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.940
And because of that, we miss a
lot around us all the time.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.970
There are unconscious processes
that pick up

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.560
information.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.870
So sometimes things that we
don't notice do influence us.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.840
And attention can be
viewed as kind of a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.970
dialogue between two things.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.390
Between things in the world that
capture your attention.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.840
If somebody throws a ball at
you, something dramatic

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.540
happens-- you hear a scary
sound that captures your

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.190
attention--

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.220
we talk about that as
"bottom-up" processing.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.610
It impinges on you.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.210
It forces you to attend to it.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.600
Because it's danger, it's
moving, it's unusual.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.830
And then, "top-down" things.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.680
What's your goal?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.310
What are you paying
attention to?

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.980
What do you care about?

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.860
What are you up to?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.815
People call that top-down
processing.

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:03.520
So things that the environment
drives into your attention

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.440
because they're so dramatic,
bottom-up.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.460
Things that you're looking for,
thinking about, you know

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.210
are useful for your purposes,
top-down.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.930
There's tremendous evidence that
we encode a very small

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.710
fraction of what's around us
in a very specific way.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.760
Estimate with me how often a
day, on average, since you've

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.770
been about five or six or seven
and you've been allowed

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.160
to have any money in your
possession at all.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.290
Do you think you've held
or seen a penny?

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.540
OK, so we all know the
horror when you're

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.910
handed $0.4 in change.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.100
That's 4 pennies right there.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.540
So we'll make an estimate.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.230
Pretend from age 5 to 20 you've
been handling change.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.470
So maybe you've encountered
3 pennies a day.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.330
OK, that's reasonable?

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.690
OK.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.780
We don't have to be just
in the right ballpark.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.290
There's 365 days a year,
skip 15 years.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.670
Just do the multiplication.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.770
You end up with about 16,380
penny experiences.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.710
All right, so we all know that
if you head towards midterms,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.320
it's going to be hard to study
a lot of stuff quickly.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.390
But if somebody said to you,
if you study something

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.589
approximately 17,000 times,
you'd think, well, that one

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.350
I'm going to get.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.930
So let's ask the question.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.590
Does the Lincoln penny face
to the left or the right?

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.360
Is there anything above his
head or below his head?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.560
Is there anything on the penny
to the left or to the right?

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.600
And how about the other side?

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.320
And how many of you with
approximately 17,000, or

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.800
certainly many thousands of
visual experiences with a

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.820
penny would bet something that
means a lot to you on the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.000
correctness of your answer to
these 5 fundamental questions?

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.730
This is good teamwork.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.340
Let's take it multiple choice.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.590
That's better, right?

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:04.380
AUDIENCE: It faces the right.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.860
PROFESSOR: You're making
me feel better because

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.810
of the fouls up.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.330
And I appreciate that.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.170
This is actually what
it looks like.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.490
So what do you think it means
that 17,000 exposures to a

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.110
penny don't leave in you a
reasonably accurate memory of

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.190
the main things you
see in a penny?

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.390
How could that happen?

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.670
And it happens to everybody.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.730
In fact, when they
do experiments,

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.540
here's people's drawings.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.190
Don't feel bad if you
didn't know it.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.590
Half the people don't even think
that the version that

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.970
you show them, if you ask them
is plausibly correct, you show

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.830
the correct answer,
they go no.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.910
That can't be right, OK?

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.130
So here's one thing.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.450
If we don't attend to something
very specifically,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.700
we can see it a tremendous
number of times and it leaves

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.320
no impression on our mind
and no memory of it.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.160
Now, why is that in
an everyday sense?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.400
We don't know on a deep
science sense.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.540
But what do you think
the point of it is?

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.870
Why don't you know what
a penny looks like?

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.000
Because it's not important
somebody said.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.540
Yeah.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.870
Because it's close enough to see
that brown smallish thing,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.010
and you don't need the rest of
any information to hand the

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.680
money back and forth.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.060
So what you attend to, what you
decide is important, makes

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.610
incredible difference.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.350
And nothing else makes
up for it.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:31.400
17,000 exposures don't make up
for what a penny looks like.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.830
So, it was research at MIT
that used this method of

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.390
simultaneously processing two
messages in the two ears, the

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.490
shadowed message, the one you're
copying, and the second

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.920
message, the one that you
try to pick up, but

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.960
it's hard to do.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.760
So they ask in the ear that
you're not paying attention

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.080
to, what can you pick up?

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.570
Here is what you can pick up
if a voice is present.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.540
Now you just imagine silence
versus somebody talking.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.940
That you can notice.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.420
If the voice changes from
a man to a woman--

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.300
if it changes from a man to
woman, you can pick that up in

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.860
the unattended ear,
the one you're not

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.780
paying attention to.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.585
Or if the voice goes-- a
person's talking and, all of a

00:07:19.585 --> 00:07:20.880
sudden, it goes er.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.490
You notice that.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.660
Here's what you don't notice.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.010
Anything about the content.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.190
I mean, that's what
you experience.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.745
You can switch the language
of the message.

00:07:30.745 --> 00:07:33.480
You can go from English to
Spanish, or Italian.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.215
A person won't notice
that it's changed.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.860
You can also change whether
it's typical speech or

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.710
backward nonsense speech,
which sounds very weird.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.220
You don't notice that either.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.125
So you notice a few things.

00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:50.380
But there's a lot of
other things you

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.370
don't notice at all.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.350
Now, you may have all had the
experience of what's called

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.950
the cocktail party phenomenon.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.400
Do you know what that is?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.760
Have you ever been talking with

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.710
people, you're at a party.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.650
You're at some events, or
something like that.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.910
And somebody mentions
your name.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.240
Especially your first
name, but your name.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.450
Maybe your last name
works, too.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.530
And then all of a sudden,
you notice a

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.710
conversation around you.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.650
It's almost hard to pay
attention to the person you're

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.880
talking to because the person
over there has just said your

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.880
name and you wonder what they're
saying about you.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.170
Now, here's a really interesting
paradox.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.100
How did you not notice
that other

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.920
conversation, which you didn't?

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.270
That's like the shadowing
task.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.890
I'm talking to one person,
there's some hubbub over here.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.020
I don't know what they're
talking about.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.400
All a sudden, they say my name
and I notice what they're

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:34.820
talking about.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.690
Well, how did that happen?

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.919
I wasn't paying attention
to it.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.390
I don't know anything
about it.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.799
But my name pounced out
in my mind and drew my

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.630
attention to it.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.230
So it's kind of a paradox.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.220
I'm not paying attention, but
somehow I pick up my name.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.750
And so we'll talk a little
bit more about this.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.640
But people have looked at this
very experimentally.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.400
So here's how they
approached it.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.960
They would, again, hear a
sentence in one ear, "The man

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.590
approached the bank." That's
the one they're repeating.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.330
And in the other ear, they
would hear one of two

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.010
different words.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.830
In the unattended ear, they're
not getting much out of that.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.590
They would hear the word "money"
or "river." So now the

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.190
bank could be interpreted as
you went to the bank to

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.580
deposit your paycheck, or you
want to the bank to have a

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.720
picnic by the river.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.980
Two different meanings of the
word "bank" are suggested by

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.900
the word you hear in the ear
that you're not processing

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.620
information in.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.420
And then the people tell you,
well, tell me what the

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.740
sentence is you just
heard, kind of.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.390
And people are primed to give
the interpretation of the

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.480
sentence that goes with the word
that's suggested in the

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.940
ear they weren't listening to.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.630
So something in their mind and
brain heard enough of that to

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.700
influence what they're
interpreting in

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.220
the attended ear.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.580
Here's another example.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.650
They're shadowing, they're
paying attention and repeating

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.630
aloud an essay in one ear.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.810
And in the other ear, they hear
something that's like a

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.090
word "taxi fare." And they pick
words that are spelled

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.590
two different ways, homonyms.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.750
So the word F-A-R-E
or F-A-I-R.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.240
Now, if you were typically--

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.160
if I ask you to write down the
word "fair" and spell it

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.620
correctly, you might say, well,
which one do you want or

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.460
something like that?

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.140
But if I didn't tell you
anything, most people would

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.090
put down the word F-A-I-R
most of the time.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.570
It's a more common word.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.120
But what they found is this.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.045
They finished the experiment.

00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:16.510
They shadowed one thing.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.430
They had a word like "taxi fare"
in the unattended ear.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.800
And they said, well, did you
notice you got that word?

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.230
Well, if you listen to it, you
remembered you heard "taxi

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.840
fare." But if you were shadowed,
you pretty much--

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.650
you very rarely remembered
that you heard it.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.050
So it's not consciously
available to you that you

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.500
heard it because you were so
busy in the other ear.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.170
And in your mind, listening
to that ear.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.230
But if you're asked to spell
the word, how often do you

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.520
come up with the rare spelling
because of what you

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.600
heard in your ear?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.740
It's exactly the same.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.140
So part of your mind heard that
word, thought about that

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.900
phrase "taxi fare." And when
somebody says to you write

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.300
down the word "fair," your mind
got moved to think about

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.095
the alternative spellings.

00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:02.580
Your unconscious processing of
that content has influenced

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.870
you in experimentally
verifiable way.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.880
So what this shows, if you go
back to the cocktail party

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.500
effect, which is the everyday
kind of version of this, is

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.040
that weirdly enough some kinds
of things that we don't pay

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.450
attention to have such
a property that in a

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.910
machine-like reflexive way our
mind brain process it to some

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.650
extent anyway.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.250
And then there's something
curious that we don't

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.880
understand deeply, which is
somehow if it's your name,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.260
it's going like, I'm
hearing my name.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:27.990
I'm hearing my name.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.580
Pay attention over here.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.640
That's a deep psychological,
computational theory.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.020
And somehow you pull it out
because it's triggered your

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.620
mind enough.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.200
Because our names are
so important to us.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.420
Yeah?

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.392
AUDIENCE: Is this similar
to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:50.530
PROFESSOR: OK, tell me again.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.790
So the phenomenon where if you
notice a word-- go ahead.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.190
So tell me again.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.450
Sorry.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.842
AUDIENCE: Like you're just
looking around and suddenly a

00:11:54.842 --> 00:11:58.285
specific word [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:58.285 --> 00:11:59.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.880
It's very much aligned
to the same thing.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.900
The question was, something pops
in your head-- a word--

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.190
and then you look back and
you go, wait a minute.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.190
I just read that, but
I wasn't even

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.710
thinking about it or something.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.040
Somebody said it or
it's on a sign.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.400
But yes.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.820
Some experience you're not
paying much attention to tips

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.080
your mind to think
a certain way.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.580
And all of a sudden you're
thinking that way and you

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.090
don't know what tipped
your mind that way.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.340
That's very similar, yeah.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:35.285
So again, the message here is,
as you're walking around in

00:12:35.285 --> 00:12:37.850
the world, there's very few
things that you're very

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.510
specifically really aware of.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:44.700
And many things can change
on you in these examples.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.380
So one of the reasons-- this
is just a thought that by

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.700
being selective in attention,
you can focus on what you want

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.310
to focus on.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.720
It's not only a weakness,
it's a strength.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.620
So you could pick out the
message in red or you could

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.330
pick out the message in blue.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.590
Where you attend helps
you select

00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.920
information that's relevant.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.390
But here's two more works.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.135
Almost all the examples I just
showed you were from Dan

00:13:05.135 --> 00:13:07.420
Simons, who's done really
beautiful work in this way.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.040
Made it very available to--

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.310
so here's two YouTube ones.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.880
Sometimes people have said, OK,
these are cute laboratory

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.960
things where you're having
people counting.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.850
But the real world
is different.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.100
When I'm out of the classroom
and I'm out of the laboratory,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.490
the real world you kind
of notice a lot more.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.660
Because it's real people,
real situations.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.800
So this is one more
example that's a

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.050
beautiful example of this.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.810
So do you think it would have
worked if the replacement

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.440
person was very different?

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.780
If we was a man or a woman, of
if a very taller person versus

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.900
a person not--

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.780
no.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.290
But what does that mean?

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.260
Why does it work for this one?

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.740
And why would it-- it means
that in the person's head,

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.330
they have a very rough picture
of who they're talking to.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.210
Does that make sense?

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.610
So there's a lot of room
for replacement.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.140
Not total room, but a
very rough picture.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.010
But it's right in
front of them.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.590
OK, now, you've seen this thing,
so I won't do it as a

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.080
demonstration now, where people
simply read the words,

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.570
the red, orange, brown.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.930
And that's easy because you're
a very automatic reader.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.670
If you're a typical adult, you
read about 250 words a minute.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.810
Zoom, zoom, zoom.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.090
But if you have to name the
color of the print when the

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.430
print is contradicted by the
word, so you're reading the

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:52.160
word red printed in green, but
your job is to say green.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.040
That naming of the print when
the word is not matching the

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.040
color of the print slows
people down.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.900
They make mistakes.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.780
They're slower.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.240
And that's because there's
a big lesson in this.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.980
It's great to get automatic
at things.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.690
That's how we're skilled at
things-- speaking, driving,

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:06.910
everything physical.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.530
We don't even think
about how we walk.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.900
The price of automaticity
being really skilled and

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.170
reflexive is you lose control.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.230
You lose control.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.935
So you don't want to think about
what that word says, but

00:15:18.935 --> 00:15:19.560
you can't help but.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.300
Now, let me touch
one more thing.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.270
How many people think-- and just
be honest in your seat--

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.882
that hypnosis is kind
of bologna?

00:15:28.882 --> 00:15:29.990
OK.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.410
All right, a lot of you.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.420
This is MIT, right?

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.040
OK.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.250
So I'm going to tell you that I
think a lot of hypnosis, the

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.030
kinds of things where if I learn
how to hypnotize people,

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.740
then they can all vote for me,
or something like that, that

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.900
doesn't work.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.770
And people who are serious about
hypnosis will tell you

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.710
that hypnosis is in the person,
it's not in the

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.490
hypnotizer.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.840
It's in the person, it's
not in the hypnotizer.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.370
And it turns out that, in ways
that are not well understood,

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.970
there are some people who are
highly hypnotizeable and some

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.590
people who are not.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.290
So this is why I think
we're suspicious.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.450
Because if we're not, we're
going, well, they must be

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.160
faking it, or pretending,
or whatever.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.170
But let me tell you what they
did and let me see if this

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.560
convinces you at all
as an experiment.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.180
So they told people sometimes to
read those words where it's

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.800
confusing because you're reading
the color of the print

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.180
and the word is contradictory,
it slows you down.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.090
They told them, imagine those
characters are characters in a

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.840
foreign language that
you do not know.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.850
Would the content of the word
mess you up for the

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.380
color of the print?

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.670
No.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.260
Because if it's a language you
don't know, it's just stuff

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.120
and you can just name--

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.130
OK?

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.280
And they asked them
to imagine that.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.020
Now, here's what happened.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.060
For people who are low
hypnotizability, you can give

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.270
people questionnaires and
they're pretty good at these

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.520
kinds of measures.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.240
They're slowed down by about a
tenth of a second per word

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.130
when the information
is contradictory.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.740
And when they're asked to
imagine it's a foreign

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.410
language, it's about the same.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.000
The low hypnotizables, you can
tell them, imagine it's a

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.750
print you don't know.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.710
It doesn't matter.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:04.890
Here's the high hypnotizable.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.750
Also slowed down.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.050
But when they imagine it's a
print in a foreign language

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.750
they don't know, not
slowed down at all.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.800
So that's behavior.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.119
That's evidence.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.630
And we don't think you can
fake it because how

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.220
would you fake it?

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.170
But here, in case you were
still worried about that,

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.109
here's the brain imaging
evidence from just the people

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.880
with high hypnosis, the high
hypnotizable people.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.330
What you see here turned
on is the part--

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.290
our brain areas are turned on
when you have to do the

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.530
difficult task where
it's contradictory

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.510
versus the easy task.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.855
All this area you see turned on
in the anterior cingulate,

00:17:41.855 --> 00:17:43.250
and especially--

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.300
which is an area that we know
is involved when things are

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.750
contradictory or paradoxical and
people are sorting it out.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.970
Look what happens to that when
these individuals are

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.050
imagining it's a foreign text.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.740
It's pretty much gone.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.900
Is that OK?

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.730
I'm as skeptical as anybody
about behavioral

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:00.870
claims, I really am.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.400
I think hypnosis is real for
some people and very powerful

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.390
for some people.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.850
And for other people it
doesn't work at all.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.920
I happen to be in the low
hypnotizable category.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.170
I'm as skeptical as anybody, but
I think there are people

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.800
who can do remarkable things
by hypnotic suggestion.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.900
But it's in them, it's not in
the-- a person who hypnotizes

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.160
you, so to speak, can help
you a little bit.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.020
But it's in you whether you have
that approach to control

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.270
of your thoughts or not.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.760
So let's go back to a test.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.520
So we're talking, again,
about two ideas.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.270
That there's things--

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.470
top- down and bottom-up
processes, and different ways

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.010
that you can attend
to the world.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.980
So I'm going to ask you to
consult your own intuitions

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.570
for the following thing.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.770
I'm going to show you things
displayed on the monitor.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.650
And your job is simply to answer
in your own mind as

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.470
quickly as you possibly can.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.080
Maybe just, if you're willing to
do it out loud, let's just

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.370
say yes or no aloud, if you're
willing to do it.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.790
As quickly as you, whether you
see a red X. Sometimes there's

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:01.760
a red X, sometimes not.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.250
So ready?

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.610
Sorry, that's my get ready.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:07.885
AUDIENCE: No.

00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:09.370
PROFESSOR: No, great.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.860
See, MIT is easy.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.051
Sorry.

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:12.920
OK, ready?

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.046
Red X or not?

00:19:14.046 --> 00:19:14.720
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.510
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.950
Ready?

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.380
OK.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.990
Thank you.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.350
Ready?

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.483
Red X or not?

00:19:21.483 --> 00:19:22.745
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:23.200
PROFESSOR: Whoa.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.050
You guys are amazing.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.660
Now, look how many places you
had to look to find it.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.170
But did it feel that way, or
did it seem to, what they

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:28.900
call, pop out?

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.530
It's just obvious.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:30.840
It's just there.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.430
So imagine I gave
you this task.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.580
I said, go into this room and
please get a particular book.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.610
And you go into the room and
there's one book there.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.430
And you've picked it up.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.596
Would that be easy?

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:42.450
Yeah.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.290
You go into a room and you go,
my gosh, there's hundreds of

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:45.940
books in this room.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.230
Would that be easy?

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.520
Now, here are many, many more
things to find the red X. But

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:55.390
your mind instantly, easily,
trivially finds it, right?

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.371
So now, let's try another
version of this.

00:19:58.371 --> 00:19:58.760
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.740
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.990
OK, get ready.

00:20:03.298 --> 00:20:04.680
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.370
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:05.870
Slower?

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:06.450
Harder?

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.460
OK, some disagreement.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.160
OK.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.070
All right, so let me show you
data under well controlled

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.760
conditions.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.320
And here's the concept.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.250
People think that in many ways
when we look out in the world,

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.320
there's features, things
like simple things--

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.490
shape or color.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.970
Those are the two we're
looking at here.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.140
But in order to combine those,
to know the same thing out

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.420
there has this shape and this
color, to glue together

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.680
features, we have to
have attention.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.100
And so when the display looked
like this, a single feature--

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.800
redness--

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.380
helps you.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.180
A single feature-- redness--

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.610
helps you.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.750
You don't have to worry
about the shape.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.560
Now, you have to worry about
the shape and the color to

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.630
decide the red X. Worse
yet, now it's a

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.920
slower, harder process.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.590
And when people do this, here's
exactly what they find.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.760
If it's just a feature by shape
or by color and that

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.940
alone would tell you the answer,
you can have one

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.100
thing, a few things,
and many things.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.820
And boom, your mind instantly
discovers it.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.180
Instantly.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.270
This is how long it takes
you to do it.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.460
But if you have to combine two
things together, the shape and

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.310
the color on the very same
thing, combine those things,

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.180
you need the glue
of attention.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.840
And the more things that are out
there, the more your mind

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.470
has to search, search, search,
search, until it

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:21.850
finally finds it.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.690
It has to look around, and look
around, and look around

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.980
to find the answer.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.970
So some kinds of things in the
world we notice without

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.550
attention features.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.030
We can look everywhere at
once in the display.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.700
That's how we're so fast.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.230
Things just pop out.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.580
And the flat slope is--
mathematically.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.540
Doesn't matter how many things
are out there-- boom, you get

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.990
it right away.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.310
Other things where we have to
glue together two features

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.130
require our attention
to do the gluing

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:50.940
things that are together.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.200
We have to search spot,
spot, spot, serially.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.280
We don't feel the intuition
of pop-out.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.180
And we have a steep
slope in search.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.270
Now I need somebody from their
chair who's pretty confident

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.520
in their math.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.350
It's a little bit harder than
before, but I'll tell you

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.920
don't have to go into
triple digits.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.050
Someone help me.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.850
I owe you one.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.760
I'll come back to you
if there's one more.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.540
I can't remember, sorry.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.900
OK, ready?

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.570
So you're going to see some
numbers and I want you to add

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.850
them and tell me
what they are.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:25.950
And I'm going to
be pretty fast.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:26.622
Is that OK?

00:22:26.622 --> 00:22:26.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.700
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.950
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:33.095
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:22:33.095 --> 00:22:34.025
OK?

00:22:34.025 --> 00:22:35.885
Ready?

00:22:35.885 --> 00:22:36.350
AUDIENCE: 14.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.190
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.474
Ready?

00:22:38.474 --> 00:22:39.560
AUDIENCE: 5.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:39.830
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:40.816
Ready?

00:22:40.816 --> 00:22:41.670
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.350
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.730
Ready?

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.030
AUDIENCE: 13.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:44.655
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:22:44.655 --> 00:22:48.570
Now what were the letters
between them?

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.000
Sorry, it's a trick.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.005
It would have been mean.

00:22:51.005 --> 00:22:51.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.196
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:53.988
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the last one so far.

00:22:53.988 --> 00:22:54.436
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

00:22:54.436 --> 00:22:54.890
OK.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.750
Now, you can go, oh,
that was a trick.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.750
How reasonable is that?

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:02.220
Well, let me make the argument
that in order to add the 5 and

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.570
the 8, you had to look
at the letters.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.650
You had to look at
the letters.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.050
They're in the middle.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:10.650
But because your mind is not
attuned to that, it's as if

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.970
they weren't there almost.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.005
You know some thing's
there, right?

00:23:14.005 --> 00:23:15.570
It's right in front of you.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:16.810
It doesn't seem that hard.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.040
But again, if your mind is tuned
to something, the other

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.960
stuff gets fuzzy.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.610
And you got the R somewhere.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.380
Now, let me ask one
more question.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.171
Do you the colors the
letters were in?

00:23:28.171 --> 00:23:29.600
No.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.370
And in fact, you don't.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.200
So thanks very much for
willing to do that.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.540
So again, we just said to bind
shape and color, we need the

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.420
glue of attention.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.880
We're not attending to
the middle letters.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.340
They seem irrelevant
even though they're

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.190
right in front of us.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.670
Even though we have to walk
through them in our mind's eye

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.090
to move from one number
to the other.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.270
They're like, I don't care.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.700
Boom, you move to
the other side.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.680
So it's not just seeing
something, it's attending to

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.760
something that really matters.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.150
And on top of that, you need a
lot of attention if you do

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.010
glue together the shape
and the color, that

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.180
requires a lot of focus.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.480
What does this mean
in everyday life?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.750
In everyday life, we're probably
walking around

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:11.225
constantly having free floating
features around us

00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:13.340
and things we're not paying
attention to.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.170
Right now I'm probably seeing a
yellow computer over there.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:21.820
And I'm seeing some blue fire
extinguisher sign over there.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.670
Now, why am I not freaked
out by that?

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.250
And why are you not freaked
out by that?

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.310
And why is it almost certain?

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.630
Because if you're not attending
to things, you're

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.340
constantly having free floating

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.320
features that are incorrect.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.220
Colors and shapes are just
floating around you.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.370
Why are we not disturbed
by that?

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.030
Because we're not attending
it to start with.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.800
Because it's like you didn't
notice the letters were there.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.530
Well, then you're
not bothered.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.970
They're just free floating
information.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.390
You're not paying attention
to it to start with.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.410
But that's what's happening
in your mind all the time.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.330
And these experiments
demonstrate that empirically

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.180
and directly.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.370
There's also interesting
temporal constraints.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.040
I'll describe this experiment
because it's too

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.000
hard to pull off here.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.470
So there's a phenomenon called
the attentional blink.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.020
What's weird about these
things, right?

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.280
Why is our minds like this?

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.630
You can speculate on that, but
it's really well documented.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.340
We attend to a small
percentage of

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.540
what's around us.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.275
And we need a lot of resources
to know something well or

00:25:15.275 --> 00:25:16.170
learn something well.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.720
So here's another example.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.800
What participants see is letters
presented very quickly

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.600
one after the other--

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.260
E-L-H. Their job is to report
any numbers that they see.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.920
So you go, boom, boom,
boom, boom.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.300
What were the numbers?

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.480
Pretty fast, but humanly
possible.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.520
The interesting question is,
what's the time gap between

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.630
the two numbers that you see?

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.360
There's usually two numbers.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.490
We'll call this one the
first one, time 1.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:41.970
The second one, time 2.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.230
What's the gap between them,
and how does that influence

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.000
whether you're likely
to report them?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.450
So here's what's called the
attentional blink and a

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.760
slightly scary graph
that I'll tell you.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.830
And let me tell you what it's
like, the metaphor, and then

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.060
let me show you the result.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.860
The metaphor is this.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.930
Your mind, moment to moment to
moment, is kind of like if you

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.820
could imagine you're next to a
stream, a big stream with a

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.120
lot of fish zooming by.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.290
You have a fishnet.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.110
You dip into the stream.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.260
You catch something
at that moment.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.740
But if a fish comes by just as
you pull your fishnet out,

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.925
will you catch that one?

00:26:19.925 --> 00:26:22.530
No.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.320
So here's what happens.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.320
Here's the time between
the presentation.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.570
If there's approximately three
numbers between them, a couple

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.820
hundred milliseconds, you're
almost a chance for the

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.970
possibility of reporting
the second digit.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.010
It's sort of like the fish you
can't catch because you just

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.860
took your net out.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.110
Except it's your mind, it's
not a physical limitation.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.160
So here's what it's like.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.100
So this is perfect
performance.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.530
This is chance performance.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.710
If it immediately follows, one
number immediately follows the

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.480
next number, you're
going to get both.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.850
And the way to think about that
is, it's kind of like

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:00.740
fishnet again.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.590
You just put in your fishnet.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.460
You got one fish.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.170
And if you're lucky, while
you're kind of pulling it out,

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.410
the next fish just
swims in there.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.180
You got two.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.720
Now your fishnet's out.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.650
And if something else comes, and
something else comes, and

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.910
something else comes, you're
pretty bad at recognizing it

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.180
was there at all.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.440
A little bit of time comes back
and you put your fishnet

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.520
back in and you're catching
everything again.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.640
About 1/2 second.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.900
But how weird is that that your
mind works like that for

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.370
spotting the digits?

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.690
That it has to take a break?

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.030
There's a part of your mind
that's getting the digits.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:37.180
And once it's gotten a digit,
for the next couple of hundred

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.090
milliseconds, it's not going to
have room to pay attention

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.170
to the following digits.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.090
How weird is that?

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.620
It's because our mind has all
these kind of limitations on

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.860
what we perceive in
the environment.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.830
Here's another sort of
fun example of that.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.080
So here's a task.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.030
One of these dots
are going to--

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.520
One dot is going to blink.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.250
And your job is to keep
your eye on that dot.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.090
You know when they say, keep
your eye on the ball.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.260
Keep your eye on the dot.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.055
And when it stops moving, notice
which is the one you've

00:28:07.055 --> 00:28:07.800
been keeping your eye on.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.275
So the first one's going
to be easy, but it

00:28:09.275 --> 00:28:09.970
will give you a feeling.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.200
And then you'll see the
answer given to you.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:11.890
Ready?

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.260
People call this object
tracking.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.976
OK, here we go.

00:28:15.976 --> 00:28:17.226
See that one blinking?

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.185
Now, let's try it one thing
moving, but even faster.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.650
So let's try tracking
four things.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.870
Last example.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.590
So here's a graph with
a high level of

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.970
performance how people do.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.390
So two things matter, and you
might have felt that.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:27.070
How many are viewing the
number of targets?

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.800
And under many circumstances,
people seem to be able to do

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.780
about three to four.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.120
But also, the speed
matters, too.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.990
You might have felt that, too.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.480
Both things contribute.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.560
There's a lot of interest in
this three to four limit that

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.410
people seem to have for things
that they track,

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.420
three to four items.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.000
And there's a lot of work,
at Harvard actually, in

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.680
developmental psychology
and related.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.670
Let me just say a word
about that to you.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.270
There's a thought that pretty
young when you're a kid, you

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:52.920
get to about this three
to four things.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.510
That our minds naturally
contract about, or notice, or

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.490
keep a count of about three to
four things in the world.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:03.130
And so people who study, for
example, math and the way that

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.960
humans perform it, think that we
have in us, in our brains,

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.180
approximately two systems that
are physically different and

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.090
culturally different.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.455
And there's lots of debates
about this, I

00:31:11.455 --> 00:31:12.760
should tell you this.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.430
But one of them being something
like accurate

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.020
counting up to about
three or four.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.580
And then, cultures that don't
have a organized system of

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.780
math, the next answer is many.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.240
You've heard this, right?

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.580
It's like one, two, three, maybe
four, and then a lot.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:35.220
Now, we don't stop counting at
four, but we might if we were

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.600
in a true state of nature and
we didn't have an organized

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.460
system of math.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.200
And weren't taught that
in how it relates to

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.610
our language abilities.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.780
So there's a lot of debate about
the exactness of this.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.690
But there's something
fascinating about this idea

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.910
that our minds can have about
four units of information kept

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.195
in mind, kept active,
that we can track.

00:31:51.195 --> 00:31:55.750
And that lots of things in the
world reflect that limitation.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.360
Including, for example,
exact counting.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.730
And without the cultural
invention of mathematics, we

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.540
would count one, two,
three, four, lots.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.690
But there's debates about this
because exactly how you

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.080
measure it can influence
how you think about it.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.420
Now, can attention be trained?

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:14.550
Could you be trained to have
much more attention?

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.730
So in many ways, we don't
think you can.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.290
But in some ways, you can.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.140
And part of this has come out
of this ironic line of

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.640
research about things that are
supposed to be bad for us.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.340
Some of them might
be OK for us.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:27.620
Video games, OK?

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.310
If you're in my generation,
people are going, oh, boy,

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:35.060
those video games are messing
up all these kids.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.950
Isn't that what you
guys think?

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:38.690
No.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.160
OK.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.030
So Daphne Bavelier at Rochester
has done a series of

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.310
studies showing that if you play
certain kinds of video

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:48.700
games, you actually do expand
your attentional capacity to

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.600
practice on those games.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.490
Because they make you
practice a lot.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:52.700
So here's what she did.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.120
She took people who didn't
have experience

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.080
playing video games.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.170
And now we're specifically
talking about first-person

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:00.940
shooter video games.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.340
And had them do 30 hours
of practice.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.210
And she looked at their ability
to do multiple object

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.880
tracking of the kind you just
saw, those dots whizzing

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.950
around, before and after.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.390
So the games, as you know,
are very different.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.340
But they involve keeping
track of lots of things

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.520
happening at once.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.920
And here's what she found.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.830
That these people who played
30 hours, these were people

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:28.210
who were not gamers beforehand,
got better at

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.480
performing these tasks
of keeping

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.410
track of multiple objects.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.130
Of all things, a group that's
super interested in that is

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:36.410
the military.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.078
And why do you think that is?

00:33:39.078 --> 00:33:40.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.400
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.800
There was just a paper published
recently that if

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.320
they take a brain image of your
brain, they can predict

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.520
how good a gamer you'll
become if you haven't

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.360
been a gamer before.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.570
These are adults.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.050
If you have bigger basal
ganglia, you'll become a

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.420
better gamer in the next week
starting from scratch.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.540
The military's interested
because you may know this.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.560
An increasing amount of warfare
is video game-like.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.320
Which is kind of the
haunting thing.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.360
Because this is real people
really being killed.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.550
But, do you know the whole
thing with the drones?

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.960
Have you followed this,
some of you?

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.560
OK.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.600
So the US has had a lot of
success, and there's a lot of

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.670
debates about the ethics of
this, in sending in unmanned

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.949
small airplanes into
the Middle East.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:28.110
And using that to
kill opponents.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.310
The person sitting in
Washington, DC, or somewhere

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:34.020
else, is watching kind of like
a video game when they make

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.270
that decision about
whether that's

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.530
somebody to be attacked.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:40.400
So a lot of operations now are
computer-based and they're

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.909
kind of like a video
game at one level.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:45.830
And they're real-life hard
decisions at another level.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.620
So video games, they're becoming
more and more, as you

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.340
can sense, a part of real world
decisions and controls.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.350
If you play Tetris because it
doesn't require that kind of

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:58.360
fast thought stuff, you
don't get any benefit.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.670
There could be other benefits,
but not this one.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:04.040
So it's not just video games,
it's the mental processes that

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.150
are practiced in the video games
that give you certain

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:11.140
talents or not, or abilities
you didn't have before.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.170
OK, the last experiment I want
to tell you is this.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.060
So everything we've talked about
now, except a little bit

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.670
about the stuff in the second
year when you're shadowing,

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:25.670
has been about this idea that we
don't pay much attention to

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.180
what's around us.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.320
We don't get much in our mind
compared to what we think we

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.270
would, even if it's right in
front of us, even if it's all

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.910
over the place.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.520
Even if we've seen a
penny 17,000 times.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.870
But there are some studies
that have shown something

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.030
pretty interesting also, which
reveals something very

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.650
paradoxical about
the human mind.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.155
That we can sometimes know
things without seeing.

00:35:44.155 --> 00:35:46.290
And people call that subliminal
perception.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.120
So how this experiment
works is this.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.545
And let me show you one
example behaviorally.

00:35:49.545 --> 00:35:51.690
I'm going to show you
one brain example.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.070
So here's what happens.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.260
Let's pretend you have
to read words aloud.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.450
And we measure, to the
millisecond, how fast

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.780
you read the word.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.820
If I show you this word and I
show you this word, and I

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.080
measure how quickly you read
the word "doctor," you're

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.380
slower than if you read the word
"nurse" and then you read

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.610
the word "doctor." Because
these two are related.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.270
And something in your
mind gets warmed up

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.430
when you see this.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.730
It doesn't get warmed up
in a relevant way when

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:17.260
you see this word.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.240
Does that make sense?

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.090
You see one word and then
you read the next one.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.340
If they're related semantically
or conceptually

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.400
by meaning, you're faster
for the second one.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.330
OK, that's easy.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.000
And it's not too surprising.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.390
The clever discovery was this.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.600
What they do is they do
something call-- they present

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.450
these words under what they
call masked conditions.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.510
On the computer monitor you
get something busy, like a

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.620
roll of X's.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.700
For 10 milliseconds only,
ten-thousandths of a second,

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.770
the word appears, and then
there's a bunch of X's again.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.740
So it's like a flash of X's.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.930
And people, they create
situations--

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.440
and I'll show you this
again in a moment.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.490
They create situations where
people say, I'm not sure

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:55.410
anything was there.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.780
I certainly don't
know what it is.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.150
You have to be there and you
have to convince yourself, as

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.810
a scientist, that you've
done that.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:02.780
And then they have
you read the word

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.480
"doctor" in full view.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.250
And in these circumstances where
people cannot tell you

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:10.310
that they saw a word, and they
certainly can't tell you what

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:14.820
the word was, you still
get faster.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.910
So they don't know that they saw
"church" or "nurse," but

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.110
something in their
mind picks it up.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.170
And what's picked up in the
mind under the subliminal

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:28.250
presentation changes the
behavior when you have an

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:30.830
overt act of behavior reading
the next word aloud.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:34.380
So this is hardcore empirical
evidence that your mind is

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.990
able to pick up stuff at
the level of meaning.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.400
Think about the paradox.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.350
You think when I read a word, I
see it and then I understand

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.530
its meaning.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.170
Here it's flashed in such a way
that you don't feel like

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.380
you see it, but you extract
its meaning anyway.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.290
And we know that because it
makes you read the next word

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:53.410
faster only if they're
related in meaning.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:55.630
So your mind is subliminally
primed.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:38:00.050
Now, some years ago people used
to worry that advertisers

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.720
could do this really cleverly
and make you go do stuff.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.960
The famous example is
historically, can they make

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.890
you buy popcorn?

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:08.480
Which is now, since it's $48,
that's harder to do.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.420
But can they make you buy
popcorn at the movie theater?

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.770
Or can they make you buy a
Ford, or a Chevrolet, or

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.570
something like that, with the
right subliminal message and

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:18.730
that kind of stuff?

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:21.900
Every experiment that's been
done to ask whether subliminal

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.680
messages of this kind would
make you get up and go do

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.320
something, like buy a car, or
change what country you live

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.500
in, or something,
it never works.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.740
It never works.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.110
Nobody's ever been able
to show that in any

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.380
experimental condition.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.090
Which doesn't prevent some
companies from selling these

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:41.310
products to store owners that
are thinking they're getting

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.130
their sales up.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.390
But there's been never any
evidence that these kinds of

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.270
subliminal presentations make
people do something big and

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:51.140
complicated, like get up and go
buy popcorn, or choose one

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.410
product over another.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.390
People have never been able to
show that under controlled

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.970
experiment.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.490
But they have been able to show
these kinds of changes in

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:01.060
behavior that last a moment.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.270
So what's happening
in your brain?

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.720
So this is the last
experiment.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.240
Again, they're presenting these
things that in the same

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.260
place in the computer monitor
all these things

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.870
to fill your eyes.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:16.080
And then they present a word
for either 29 milliseconds-

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.840
they present it either very
briefly or in full view.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.410
OK, so here it's visible
because they remove the

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.060
confusing visual information
just before and after it.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.120
Here, people don't
report seeing it.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.810
And scientifically, it's really
important because you

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.300
just say, oh, people
didn't see it.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.630
But it's really important
in our field to

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.090
say, we're so convinced.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.520
And why are we so convinced?

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.590
Because we say, was there
any word present?

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.290
Because sometimes there's a
word present and sometimes

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:41.790
there isn't.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.470
Just is there a word present?

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:45.780
If you could see the word,
because these things were a

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.350
little bit away in time and you
could see it, you almost

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:49.980
always got it if
it was visible.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.130
You almost never got
it if it was here.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:54.770
You almost never said there
was a word present.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.660
And could you name it?

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.060
Yes, if you saw it like this.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.300
You couldn't name it if it was
presented brief-- if it was

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.590
surrounded by this
visual stuff that

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.030
makes it hard to see.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.170
If they give you a memory test
for it, if you saw it fully in

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.320
full view, you got it.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.400
If it was hidden like
this, you didn't.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.730
And finally, they give
you a fourth choice.

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:13.820
They say, did you see the word
"note" or did you see the word

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.900
"coat?" Choose between
the two.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.510
People are still at
chance 50-50.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.790
They're really pushing
people to say,

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:22.260
really, did you see anything?

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:22.950
Do you know what it was?

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:25.610
There are completely a chance
they don't remember anything.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.980
They can't even tell if
a word was there.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.800
But we know it influences
their mind.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.890
And now let me show you what we
know of how it influences

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.090
your brain.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.610
So what's shown here in green
are parts of your brain that

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:39.230
respond when a word is shown
that you can see.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.680
And what's shown here in red
are the parts of your brain

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.320
that respond for that
subliminally presented word,

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.860
the word that's presented but
you can't tell that any word

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.870
was there, never mind
what word it was.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.290
So at first you can see there's
a lot more brain

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:57.750
response for the visible than
the masked or subliminal word.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:59.190
But that makes a lot of sense.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.240
You see something, you think
about, you know it happened.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.480
But you can measure what's
happening in the brain.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.860
It's very small.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.510
Take this spot.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.400
Here's the response if
it's in full view.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.350
Here's a tiny, tiny, tiny,
tiny response when it's

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:13.080
presented in that
minimalist way.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.910
But it's measurable
and it's present.

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:18.020
And we know that it's enough
for you to figure out

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.960
unconsciously what the meaning
of that word was.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.540
So then, we ended with this
paradox, which is on the one

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:27.480
hand, we live in a world where
we only notice a small

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.050
fraction of what's around us.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.960
What we focus our attention
to because we have limited

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.780
attentional capacity.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.860
On the other hand, there are
channels of information that

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.580
sneak into your mind.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.860
That probably influence you only
for a few moments in the

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.180
unattended ear, in the
cocktail parity.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.240
You're actually picking up that
conversation because if

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.330
they say your name,
you'll get it.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.620
Here's an example where your
brain is responding to a word

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.310
you cannot identify or know
that it was presented, and

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.840
those things can slightly move
your behavior around.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.800
But not in a science fiction or
marketing dream that they

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.770
could make you go do something
really big.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.260
OK, that's never been shown
and people have

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.370
tried to show that.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.770
So attention is really weirder
than you think.

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.120
You don't notice a lot of stuff,
but a few things you

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.680
don't think are influencing you
are influencing you here

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.360
and there all the time.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.610
Thanks very much.
