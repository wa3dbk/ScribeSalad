00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.870
PROFESSOR: So last week
Melissa told you--

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.140
or a couple days ago--

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.510
about vision.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.780
And if there's two huge
messages, I think, out of that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.210
lecture, it's first that even
the most simple aspects of

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.150
perception are based on a
synthesis between what's out

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.000
there and the rules
by which your mind

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.130
interprets the world.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.510
And what you ultimately see
is that interaction, that

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.010
synthesis, that dialogue, that
construction between what's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.620
out there and how your mind
chooses to interpret it.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.990
The second big point is there's
a lot of organization

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.890
of the visual system
in our brain.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.240
And we can track its
organization from the first

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.460
moment that photons enter your
eyes all the way through until

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.940
you recognize a loved one, a
word, or an object out there.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.040
And we said that in the
neocortex, the world is

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.190
divided into two big channels
of visual processing, which

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.990
are what things are and
where things are.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.220
So now I'm going to pick up on
that a little bit today.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.370
As you go around and see things
all the time, what is

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.850
it that you mostly see?

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.430
On an average day, you wake
up in the morning.

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:54.910
I know you're all like,
what's he looking for?

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.140
What's the answer?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.260
But just in everything.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.740
You see people a lot.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.070
So faces, we'll talk
about that.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.790
You see objects, chairs,
tables in the morning.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.690
A toothbrush and soap
is useful, right?

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.980
You see objects.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.070
And another huge use of your
visual system is reading.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.040
You see words, right, on
books, on computers.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.050
So we're going to talk a little
bit about how we see

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.310
what things are, objects in the
world, faces in the world,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.790
and words so that we can read.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.480
And we'll talk about both some
processes that go on in our

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.610
mind and brain that let us
become terrific at recognizing

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.080
what's out there and knowing
who we're talking to, what

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.110
we're reading, what we're
holding, and so on, and then

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.540
about disorders in the brain
that illuminate, I think, a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.990
little bit about those
processes.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.970
So let me start with objects
and agnosia.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.110
Agnosia means not knowing.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.680
So we're going to talk about two
ways in which people seen

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.440
to not know.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.910
And that gives us a hint,
then, about how

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.980
we actually do know.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.630
And they've been called
apperceptive

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.990
and associative agnosias.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.400
Apperceptive seems to be people
see the parts, but they

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.640
don't pull it together.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.500
Associative agnosia,
they see the whole

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.830
thing pretty decently.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.390
But they can't figure out what
it means, what it is in a

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.640
practical sense.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.880
And, lastly, I'll talk to you
about a very surprising

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.070
finding where people lose
knowledge of some kinds of

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.180
objects in the world but not
others, and sort of give us a

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.170
new insight into how our brain
organizes knowledge.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.400
So agnosia is a
modality-specific inability.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.840
So we'll talk today
about vision.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.050
There's agnosias in audition,
and in touch, and so on.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.210
But I'll focus just on vision,
modality-specific.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.880
These people are fine
if they hold

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.730
something or hear something.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.520
And it's not explained by things
like you don't see so

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.600
well, or you're not paying
attention, or you can't speak.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.640
It seems to be just that you
lose the ability to recognize

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.960
by sight what something is.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.510
So again, apperceptive agnosia,
will link it to the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.460
right hemisphere and associative
agnosia to the

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.555
left hemisphere.

00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:58.400
And let me show you examples
of what these patients do.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.620
So here's patients with right
hemisphere damage.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.430
We're attempting, simply, to
copy this triangle or copy

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.930
these things.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.760
It's right in front of them.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.830
They're copying it.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.040
And you can see that it's as
if they have almost no

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.660
appreciation for what the
thing is out there.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.620
This is a pretty miserable 3.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.740
Right in front of you, it's as
if the whole thing weren't

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.899
cohering for anything.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:22.680
Even a shape is just a
mysterious bundle of stuff.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.010
Or we can make it
multiple choice.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.210
Well multiple choice,
we know it's easier.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.400
So all they have to do is cross
out which of these four

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.770
things looks like this.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.360
And they picked the
circle here.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.610
Or instead of the x,
they picked the o.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.010
They're really not getting
almost anything about the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.140
quality of the shape.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.790
They're really not recognizing
what they're looking at.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.920
Or they'll see this.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.120
But they'll read it as, when
they get this, 7415.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.420
They won't take the first
interpretation, but will come

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.670
up with some other.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.170
When these patients copy
something, they see, right in

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.780
front of them, that elephant.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.920
You can label things.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.780
But it's a pretty bad copy.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.120
It's not just bad artistry.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.100
It's a bad sense of what the
coherent shape is right in

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.600
front of them.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.510
And their vision is
basically fine.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.920
It's just the shape of it
doesn't make any sense.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.000
Not surprisingly then, maybe
these patients also struggle

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.510
when you make things
a little harder.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.640
So what letter is this?

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.400
You can get that.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.590
You'd have to look a
little bit harder.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.340
Or you might get that this is
a cow, or this is a car.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.610
These patients are terrible
at those things.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.630
As soon as you make
it a little bit

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.120
hard, they're finished.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.400
They're also bad if they have
damage in the right

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.460
hemisphere, posteriorly,
at what they

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.770
call an unusual view.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.760
So often we see something like
a stapler from this view.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.770
We rarely quite see
it this way.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.720
But if I showed you this, you
could probably make it out.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.560
It might take you a
moment by itself.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.520
An unusual view of an object
that you see, psychologists

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.280
call it a canonical view,
which is the usual one.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.130
And what happens to patients who
have damage in the right

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.060
posterior cortex?

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.680
They're terrible at making this
unusual perception of a

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.090
common object.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.300
They're also terrible if they
have to see something that's a

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.160
little bit challenging.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.280
Again, like here's some
hats but with shadows.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.090
Now normally, we don't
think about

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.770
shadows as a big problem.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.590
It is for computers that
are meant to see.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.535
And it is also a big problem
for patients with damage to

00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:27.970
the right posterior cortex.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.590
It's as if they can't pull out
the object from the shadow.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.570
It's all one big glob to them.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.920
Compare that difficulty just
getting basically what's there

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.180
to patients with left hemisphere
damage who can't

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.750
recognize an object.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.160
So here's a patient who was
shown pictures of a key, a

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.980
pig, a bird, a train, and
was asked to copy them.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.590
And the copies are actually
excellent.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.970
I mean, they're much better
than I would do.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.050
They're excellent
copies, right?

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.100
But even after the patient has
made that excellent copy of

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.530
the key, he's asked
what is that?

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.970
And the patient says,
I don't know.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.130
Good copy of a pig, "Could be
a dog or any other animal."

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.680
That's a dog, but that's it.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.120
The bird is kind
of interesting.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.050
He draws a pretty good bird,
his copy, right?

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.540
But then he says, "It could be
a beach stump." And when you

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.630
say that, you can see that.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.990
But you and I would never
come to that conclusion.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.860
And the train, he gets
a little bit of wagon

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.840
or car of some kind.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.260
It's a larger being pulled
by a smaller.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.670
He vaguely knows
it's something.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.070
But it's not quite
right either.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.910
But he really gets what
it is, the shape.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.350
But it's as if it's stripped
of meaning.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.170
It just doesn't mean
anything to him.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.035
Now we're going to do
a video in a moment.

00:07:39.035 --> 00:07:41.320
All right, Tyler?

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.580
I'm going to show you
some videos today.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.640
The problem is that these videos
are sort of grainy.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.650
And there's not really high
quality Alan Alda talking on

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.550
Scientific American videos
of these patients.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.100
So the unfortunate thing is
in a visual disorders

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.010
demonstration, it's almost as
if I'm forcing upon you that

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.950
same visual disorder.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:59.140
OK?

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.580
Because you're looking at it,
and you go, like, gee.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.840
No wonder he can't
recognize it.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.650
I can't recognize it.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.750
So let me tell you.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.110
In a couple moments he's
going to look at a

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.930
picture of a clarinet.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.060
And if it were a really
good video, you

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.800
would see it clearly.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.820
But there's just not many
of these around.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.870
And these patients are rare
that are this perfect.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.770
So I'm going to make
this dark.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.030
And we'll see-- thank
you, Tyler--

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.060
a patient with visual agnosia.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.770
And you should be impressed
by two things.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.600
First, he's very verbal.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.280
He's speaking.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.350
He's smart.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.000
A lot of his brain is
working just fine.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.590
And second, you're going to
see something kind of

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.940
interesting, which is
we talked about the

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.580
where system last time.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.130
And sometimes people call
the where system,

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.169
the system for action.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.580
Because pretty much like where
you grab something, where you

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.060
move, that has a lot to do with
the action, the physical

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.030
action in the world.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.050
So you're going to can see this
man unable to recognize

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.120
by his what system, what
he's looking at.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.150
But a little bit of information
is going to sneak

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.850
into his where system, and move
his hands in a way that

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:01.600
you'll see appropriate.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.850
So thanks.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.240
So it's so funny if
you work in--

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.250
this idea that we only
use 10% of our brain.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.010
I can assure you this man has
95%, 98% of his brain.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:19.615
He can speak.

00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:21.145
He can move.

00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:22.610
He can make jokes.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.230
He can curse at the end
there a little bit.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.810
He can do almost everything
that everybody can do.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.980
But he cannot identify what
an object is by vision.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.700
Because the injury has occurred
in the part of the

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.120
brain that's essential for that
final step of figuring

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.310
out what you're looking for.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.670
It's a very specific
part of the brain.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.490
And without it, the rest of
his brain can't figure out

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.970
what it's looking at.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.260
So his sensation is fine.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.525
He sees where it is.

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:51.020
And he gets the shape
even roughly.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.530
He thought it was a pen.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.290
There's something vaguely
about the shape.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.020
His naming is fine.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.060
But it's as if, again, this idea
of a perfect example of

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.840
what we call associative
agnosia.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.990
He has all the shape information
it seems like you

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.270
ought to have, all the language
information you have.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.170
But he can't make that move
from piecing together what

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.350
something is to knowing
what it means.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.380
And if he doesn't know what
it means, he can't

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.710
come up with the name.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.400
If he smells it or holds it,
he says, apple or pipe.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.640
He knows the name.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.450
But if he has to look at
something and then know what

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.450
it is to name it, if I show you
a piece of paper and ask

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.920
you to name it, you have
to say, what is it?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.640
Then I name it.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.140
He can't make that move in
vision to what it is.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.100
Because so much processing
has to occur in your

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.030
brain to get there.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.590
Even though it seems
instantaneous

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.840
and trivial to you.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.400
It's instantaneous and trivial
to you because your brain is

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.050
so brilliant that it
accomplishes it.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.170
Now, there are things out
there in the world like

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.130
animals that occur naturally.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.440
Because they're from an
evolutionary tree, they share

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.960
a lot of shapes.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.660
And there's things out there
that are not living, either

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.790
that occur like the moon and
the mountain-- they're out

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.800
there sitting--

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.700
or what we call manufactured
objects, things like locks,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:17.330
pencils, motorcycles, bulbs,
things that humans have made.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.620
And, of course, humans make
shapes as they need to

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.730
construct things.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.920
They're not constrained by
evolutionary forces about what

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.960
shape something is.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.610
We make a shape as we need it.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.220
But it was still an amazing
discovery in the 1980s that

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.020
they found individual patients
who lost the ability to

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.640
recognize things and various
specific categories.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.220
This seems so much like old
style, silly phrenology.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.450
That I can tell you, my
colleagues sort of make fun of

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.990
me when I told them people in my
field were following this.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.190
So they found patients who
could define by pictures

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.350
manufactured objects, things
like pencils, or typewriters,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.290
or computers.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.350
But they couldn't identify
foods or animals.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.700
And then they found patients
just the opposite who could

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.870
identify foods and animals but
not manufactured objects.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.200
So that's really weird.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.870
That's as if you had organized
in your brain the manufactured

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.380
section here like in
a supermarket.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.520
And here's the animal section.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.560
And here's the fruit section.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.660
Really, is that how our mind
is organized, like a

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.690
supermarket?

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.390
But then there were some
exceptions to these.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.740
And there are the exceptions
that helped us

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.650
inform us on the rules.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.740
So here's some patients who are
really good at identifying

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.740
manufactured things-- again,
pencils, things like that--

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.126
bad at foods and animals.

00:12:35.126 --> 00:12:36.230
But now think about this.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.030
They were good on body parts.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.290
How were they good on body parts
when they were bad at

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:41.830
foods and animals?

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.950
Body parts are natural, right?

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.750
And they were bad a musical
instruments even though they

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.310
were good on other manufactured
things like

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.850
pencils and computers.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.910
So these were two
wrong things.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.270
And I'm going to try to convince
in a moment that the

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.270
way we now understand this is
they're good at body parts

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.750
because we know how
to use our body.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.160
And they're bad at musical
instruments because musical

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.500
instruments look an awful lot
like one another just like

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.280
four-legged animals look
a lot like one another.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.810
That's a funny category for us
if we start to divide up

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.330
instruments.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:23.260
So the problem is not so much
one of natural versus

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.610
unnatural things.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.960
It's things that we know through
vision versus things

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.690
that we know through physical
action and use.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.640
And here's another example.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.970
The patients who are bad at
objects that we use every day,

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.420
like pencils and stuff like
that, were pretty good on

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.320
things like billboards
and mountains.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.140
Now only in science fiction
movies do you have creatures

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.770
big enough that they're picking
up billboards and

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.400
throwing it at helicopters
from the military.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.940
You see that all the time.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.530
You have the big creature.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.800
And they pick it up,
and they hurl it.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.410
OK.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:14:00.110
So we don't mostly pick up huge
things like mountains and

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.380
large outdoor objects
like flag poles.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.240
They're not things that
we pick up and use.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.320
So it seems like the principle
of what's good or bad is more

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.080
about how we experience things
through sight or through

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.940
physical action.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.280
So how do we know things in
the world through visual

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.410
experience?

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.160
Unless we're alligator
wrestlers, we don't get that

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.540
near that many animals.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.660
And most of us have other things
that we use all the

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.860
time, like bulbs, and pencils,
and things like that.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.350
And evidence for
that was this.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.190
They put humans inside a scanner
and looked at their

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.440
brains as they named either
line drawings or words.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.960
So let's think of words.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.730
So it's just words, and you're
naming things like elephant

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.540
and tiger--

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.600
that's the animal--

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.670
or tools that you use, like
pliers or hammer.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.330
Visually, they're words.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.130
But what happens in the brain
as you're naming animals?

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.090
It seems like you turn on
the visual parts of

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:54.800
your brain a lot.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.170
There's no animal in there.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:56.980
There's not even a picture
of an animal.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.630
It's just the word elephant
or the word cat.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.860
What happens when you're
naming tools?

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.820
In the left hemisphere, we see
turned on an area here that's

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:11.240
involved in visual motion, and
here, in physical action of

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.740
moving things in the world.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.900
All you're doing is
naming words.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.050
But it's as if the knowledge for
naming them is located in

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.560
the part of your brain that
uses that information.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.410
If there's things I recognize
by sight, the abstract

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.350
knowledge about those things
is near my visual system.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.360
If there's things I recognize
by action, using them, the

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.100
abstract knowledge of that is
located in your brain near

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.710
parts of your brain that move
things and pick up things.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.760
So all of a sudden, it makes
sense that you can get

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.360
separation in these forms
of knowledge.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.310
Because they reside in your
brain near the parts of your

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.400
brain that use them and
communicate with them.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.160
So again, this idea that if
it's a [INAUDIBLE] like a

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.775
scissors, your knowledge about
scissors will reside in the

00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:57.300
parts of the brain that
act upon scissors.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.540
If it's something like a bird
that you mostly see, knowledge

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.540
about that bird, not just how it
looks, but everything, will

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.120
reside in parts of the brain
that are focused on vision.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.940
So it's as if your knowledge
is moved to the part of the

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.040
brain that interacts with
the form of knowledge.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.360
So now let's talk about faces.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.170
Faces are a huge thing for us.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.370
There's at least two huge
things we do with faces.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.140
We recognize who people are
and what their moods are,

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.760
angry, happy, nice, and so on.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.500
So here's one person.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.660
Here's another person.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.870
When I first used this picture,
he wasn't a governor.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.570
He was a movie star.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.690
And now he's an ex-governor.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.250
And you have the problem
that you have to

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.630
recognize a lot of people.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.440
Because you have all your
classmates, and friends, and

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.930
family members, and a lot
of people out there.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.670
And not only that, you have
to recognize the various

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.940
expressions they have, which are
terribly important for how

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.900
we communicate with people
moment to moment all the time.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.120
So we could say with faces,
our big job is who are we

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.260
looking at.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.420
A friend, or foe, somebody
loved, somebody we don't know.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.600
Who is that person?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.609
And then what's the expression
that we can

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:05.470
read from their face?

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.140
That's a huge part of our lives
as social animals, as

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.300
people who interact
with other people.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.460
So you saw a film last time of
a patient with prosopagnosia.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.940
Your book, this time, talks
about a Dr. P. He's the man

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.829
who mistook his wife
for a hat.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.810
So he has bigger problems in
vision than simply faces.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.500
But faces are very impressive.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.120
He fails to recognize his
students by their face.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.020
But he can recognize them
by their voice,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.450
modality-specific.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.080
His general vision is OK.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.840
When Oliver Sacks visited him
in his house, he tries to

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.950
reach out his hand and took hold
of his wife's head, tried

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.585
to lift it off to put it on.

00:17:42.585 --> 00:17:46.880
He had apparently mistaken
his wife for a hat.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.440
His wife looked as if she
was used to such things.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.260
You can see the head and the
hat, they're kind of close.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.560
But not if you have
typical vision.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.490
He might pat the head of water
hydrants and parking meters

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.740
mistaking them for the
heads of children.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.190
There's a little bit of logic.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.315
But it's pretty wrong
what he sees.

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:04.765
And it's pretty meaningless
to him.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.850
So let me show you a
film of an example.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.100
You saw one last time.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:14.750
So let me say a word
about this.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.920
Imagine that if you couldn't
recognize people

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.770
as you walked up.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.960
So much of how we recognize
people-- we don't think about

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.930
this, because we instantly,
easily recognize

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.050
those we know well--

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.040
is by their faces.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.390
So I want to say a
couple of things.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.990
Usually there's posterior
cortical lesions

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.710
like in this woman.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.800
I knew one man who was a
Unitarian minister, who I

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.760
worked with, actually, a couple
blocks away here,

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.120
He went up to Dartmouth for
the winter carnival.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.960
He came back in a small
Volkswagen.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.870
It turned over turned
over on the ice.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.505
He had a huge brain injury
and became prosopagnosic.

00:18:45.505 --> 00:18:47.900
He could only recognize his wife
by asking her to wear a

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.700
yellow bow in her hair.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.660
Because otherwise he
couldn't pick her

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.370
out from other people.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.740
When he went down the street
and passed his brother, he

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.410
completely failed to
recognize him.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.510
Then the brother spoke.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.420
Then he recognized him.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.740
And he said-- and this was his
subjective experience--

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.400
because you wonder what
do these people

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.670
feel like they see.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.810
He said that what it felt like
for his brother was, do you

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.340
when somebody has some bad
handwriting, and you can't

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.480
make it out at all?

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.830
And then somebody tells
you what it is.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.280
And you go, oh yes.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.260
That's that word.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.730
Any now you see it.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.120
He said, that's what it felt
like as he heard his brother's

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.990
voice and realized it
was his brother.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.320
It's hard to know how to
relate these things.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.180
But the ability to recognize a
person is completely wiped out

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.610
of these individuals.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.270
In the last six or seven years,
something else has been

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.570
discovered.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.570
Now let me tell you
a word about this.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.560
Instead of people with acute
lesions that they got because

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.810
of a brain injury.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.440
It turns out there's a couple
percent of our population

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.590
that's really bad at recognizing
faces, not the

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.630
occasional social embarrassment
that many of us

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.880
have when we see somebody, we
know we should know them, but

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.560
they're really, really,
really bad.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.250
There's websites you can go to
that let you test yourself.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.570
Because researchers want you
to work with them if you're

00:19:58.570 --> 00:19:59.800
one of them.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.500
It's about 1% of
the population.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.200
They're really, really,
really bad.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.480
There was one woman described
as, she says,

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.690
they can't watch movies.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.070
Because all the characters
look pretty

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.320
much the same to them.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.570
You can imagine that.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.600
One parent who has this problem,
really terrible at

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.480
faces by formal testing, says
that when her kid comes out of

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.800
school, her own kid, if he is
not wearing the clothes that

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.270
she knows he's wearing, she
can't pick him out from the

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.300
other children very easily.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.390
And these are not people with
big brain injuries.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.820
These are people who have some
unusual difficulty in

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.870
recognizing faces.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.440
So in a classroom this
size, there easily

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.200
could be one of you.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.640
We don't understand
what that is.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.740
It's not a brain injury.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.490
Just like some of us can't carry
a tune, some individuals

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:54.390
are really terrible at
recognizing faces, really bad.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.560
So there's a lot of research
into that to understand what

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.740
that reflects.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.870
So let me tell you what we do
understand about the neural

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.680
circuitry in the typical brain
for recognizing a face of a

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.820
loved one, a person that
you care about.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.960
So this is the fusiform gyrus.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.060
It's a structure in the back of
the brain that extends from

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.170
the occipital into the
temporal lobes.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.620
And that's an anatomical
description of this region.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.540
Within that region, there's a
functional area that seems

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.660
very important for
face perception.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.930
And Nancy Kanwisher, who's in
our department, pretty much

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.900
discovered this specific
functional area in the typical

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.250
human brain.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.340
And so she did experiments where
she would present things

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.110
like faces or objects.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.870
In this picture, left is right,
and right is left.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.270
There's a spot in the fusiform
cortex that has

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.580
this following property.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.280
Here's faces.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.070
That turns on.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.065
Here's objects which have
similar properties.

00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:47.530
It has a lot of visual
information like a face.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.740
But it's not a face.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.420
It's part of the brain region
not so interested, faces,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.310
objects, faces, objects.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.970
So whenever faces come on--

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.860
this is, by our understanding--
the first part

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.630
of your brain that says,
I'm looking at a face.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.130
Up until then, it's just treated
like other stuff.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.710
This is the first part of your
brain that recognizes, I'm

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:05.870
looking at a face.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.890
I'm starting to identify who
I'm looking at and what

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.950
feelings they might have
by their expression.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.970
And Nancy and her colleagues did
all kinds of very clever

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.450
experiments to show the
properties of this.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.450
Let me pick one.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.970
You could say, well, it's
not about faces.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.420
But faces are about humans.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.550
Maybe it's a part of the brain
that tells you when there's a

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.970
human around you.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.870
So they compared faces
versus hands.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.670
Here's hands.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.060
This part of the brain is
not that interested.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.900
Faces, hands, faces, hands.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.770
You see every time it moves to
faces, this part of the brain

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.280
gets very strongly engaged.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.330
It's very much about faces
by many research studies.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.030
So let me tell you a little bit
about what we understand

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.750
about faces in terms
of development

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.430
and things like that.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.920
Because faces are such a big
part of our lives from the

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.420
first few moments we're born.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:55.870
In fact, a colleague of mine,
Pawan Sinha, did a kind of a

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.760
biographical research study that
was on the front page of

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.030
The New York Times and earned
MIT faculty the continuing

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.560
names of being Frankenstein
faculty.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.240
There was a number of faculty.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.400
And what he did, kind of very
cleverly, was he put on his

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.360
newborn infant's head
a little camera.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.150
And he said, if I leave
it on there and

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.240
record it all the time--

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.950
and apparently there was some
debate with his wife whether

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:17.770
he was allowed to do this.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:18.410
But they checked it out.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.640
It seemed OK by the
pediatrician.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.020
He said, if I have the camera
on the infant's head, I can

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.050
see what the infant's experience
is like moment to

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.180
moment in the first months
of its life.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.350
And I can also play with the
video so that it has, roughly

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:39.540
speaking, the properties of the
infant's visual system,

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.955
which is it can't see very
far after its birth.

00:23:42.955 --> 00:23:45.070
They can only see very close
by, and not that well.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.333
Over the next several months--
we'll talk about

00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:46.910
this later in class--

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.860
he gets better and better
at seeing at a distance.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.230
So here's the infant sitting
in his or her crib.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.000
And this video makes incredibly
clear, beautifully

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.900
and fascinatingly clear,
something that I never thought

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.140
of until Pawan did this study,
this examination.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.800
So the infant sitting there,
it can't move very much.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.480
It can't go very many places
as a newborn infant.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.410
So what does it see?

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:12.630
What gets close enough to it to
be visible to the infant?

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.430
People's faces.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.825
Because all the other cute
things in the nursery, all the

00:24:16.825 --> 00:24:19.070
other things that are there,
they are too far or too blurry

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.410
for the infant to process
almost at all.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.290
Almost the only thing that
happens is the parent, the

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.430
grandparent, the siblings, the
friends that come over and go,

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.610
what a cute baby.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:29.870
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.190
The face comes in.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.430
The person's done, gone.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.350
Now you're just sitting
in a world of blur.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.790
Here comes another face.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.090
So besides certain issues
related to perhaps the

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.430
feeding, the only thing
the infant sees are

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.660
faces all the time.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.460
So it's a very important
social cue of who it's

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.600
interacting with and
what's out there.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.680
And it's almost the only
one available to it.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.330
So psychologists have known for
some time that if you show

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.850
a very young infant a face
versus something like an

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.430
object, like a car or anything
like that, they're much more

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.980
interested in faces if you put
them next to each other where

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.440
the infant can see them.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.330
And they've been saying,
well, is the brain

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.130
born to process faces?

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.770
And it might be.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.100
And I'll show you evidence
to suggest in some

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.510
general sense it is.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.290
What is that infant's
brain drawn to?

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:19.100
What does it find fascinating
to learn about in the world?

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.370
And so they notice that one
thing about a face is in terms

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:27.720
of features, eyes, nose,
mouth, top-heavy.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.800
Because we have two eyes, and
everything else is one and

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.470
one, the nose and the mouth.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.750
So here you can move the
features like this.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.020
And it turns out not only are
infants more interested in

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.300
this kind of face than this--
and they know that because

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.390
they'll put the two up, and
they'll measure how long the

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.760
infant looks at one versus the
other, which is interesting.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.730
And the infant picks this one.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.590
But get a load of this?

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.540
The infant also picks this one
versus this, this one versus

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.200
this, and this one
versus this.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.710
Now these look very little
like a face.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.490
But they're top-heavy.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.500
It's as if maybe the infant's
brain to start with, maybe,

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.380
looks for some interesting,
top-heavy things and that

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.640
pulls it into the
world of faces.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.500
Here's some more experiments
like that.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.040
So here's an upside down,
right-side up.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.960
Baby looks more at this
kind of face.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.240
OK.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.790
You could say, well, that's
a normal face.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.840
But it's also top-heavy.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.900
Then they'd make these kind
of scary-looking faces.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.860
And now the baby, even though
these are nothing like a face

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.540
the baby ever sees, it
still likes this one

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.260
because it's top-heavy.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.740
Now how about this one?

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.930
This is like a face they see.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.110
This is a really weird face.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.490
Right?

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.020
They'll never see a face like
this except in this

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.160
experiment.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.150
Top-heavy.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.180
Top-heavy.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.700
And now the infant looks at
both of them with equal

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.970
interest and delight.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.860
So that's a very clever
experiment to suggest that the

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.500
infant's mind is looking
for top-heavy things.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.040
And you could say, is
it really top-heavy?

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.260
Or Is that what the infant's
mind and brain can look for?

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.480
And it goes with faces.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.830
And evolution picked that.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.850
It's hard to know how to think
about these things.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.500
But it looks like the
top-heaviness draws an infant

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.960
to be fascinated by faces.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.880
And luckily, you don't get
many faces like this to

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.920
confuse you in the real world.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.120
Another thing that people
have studied a lot

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.590
about faces is this.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.040
They use the word configural.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.230
The relations among the parts
are more important than the

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.230
parts themselves.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.540
So I need a volunteer
in their seat.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.850
And this is going to be really
easy if you know the alphabet.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.270
You have to put up your
hand and help me out.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:35.490
OK.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.240
Thank you very much.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.410
I'm going to describe to you
a letter by its features.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.190
OK?

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.470
It has a big line at the top.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.510
And in the middle, there's
a line that

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.150
goes down to the bottom.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:45.140
What's the letter?

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.610
AUDIENCE: T.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:45.980
PROFESSOR: Awesome.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:46.430
OK.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:47.490
Featural description.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.600
Now I'm going to describe to you
a super famous movie star.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.790
And this person has two eyes to
the left and to the right,

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.150
a nose right below that, and
a mouth right below that.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.450
And who is it?

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.290
Angelina Jolie.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.390
So what's my point here?

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.210
It's the stuff that helps us
in many things, like the

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:06.770
letters-- thank you.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.240
That was excellent.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.010
We can describe those
by the parts.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.560
And the parts pretty much
define the whole.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.640
That's not true for faces.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.930
It really is the precise
relations between eyes, and

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:17.210
nose, and mouth that tell us.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.120
And there's an experiment that
shows this in a very empirical

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.030
direct way.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.870
So they would show people
a face like this with a

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.420
particular nose or a house
like this with

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.440
a particular door.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.000
And then they would test your
memory for that nose or that

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.910
door by itself as features or
with the whole face or a whole

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.840
house present.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.920
And here's what happens for
people's performance.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.570
The nose by itself, the door by
itself, the nose when you

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.370
see the whole picture, which
could be his nose.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:47.650
It could be another nose.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:48.290
Here's the door.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.310
It could be that door
or a different door.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.520
And here's what happens
in performance.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.560
If it's houses, people are good
for doors, about the same

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.880
whether they've identified the
door by itself or the door in

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.980
the context of the house.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.540
If it's noses, they were
a lot better off

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.100
seeing the entire face.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.080
It's as if how we analyzed even
the parts of the face are

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.110
really integrated immediately
into the other

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.890
aspects of the face.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.250
They don't stand alone.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.230
They're a part of a context
all interacting together.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.080
Now here's something pretty
striking and interesting.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.430
And we'll talk about some social
implications of this at

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:27.230
the end of the lecture.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.920
You can't ask infants
many things.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.070
But you can record their
behavior and learn some things

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.360
about what their minds are
representing and thinking.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.480
And here's how they test an
infant at say six months of

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.180
age, can't talk, can't walk,
can't be instructed to push

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.130
buttons or fill out surveys.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.720
How do they get inside the mind
of what an infant knows?

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.960
What they'll do is they'll
show a face.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.080
And pretend they show this
face all by itself.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.680
Infant looks for a little bit.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.240
Face disappears, and then they
see the face they just saw and

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.910
a new face.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.940
And infants who saw this face
a few moments ago will spend

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:04.580
more time looking at the new
face than the old face.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.690
You can track where
their eyes are.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.140
And that's the evidence they
remember the face they saw

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.580
before, because they selectively
spend more time on

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.830
the new face.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.230
And also they're hungry to
look at the new face.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.350
I've seen this face, been
there, done that.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.310
New face, check out
this person.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.700
If you test them at six
months, they'll have a

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.360
preference for the new face.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.810
But if you show them two
different monkeys--

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.110
and this might feel hard for
you to tell these apart--

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.895
if you show them two different
monkeys, they'll behave the

00:30:34.895 --> 00:30:38.440
same with monkey faces as they
do with human faces.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.720
They'll prefer the novel face,
which shows you they remember

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.710
what face they saw before and
want to look at the new face.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:49.330
And at six months, it's the same
for humans and monkeys.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.070
And don't forget, most of these
people are interacting a

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.600
lot with adults, and siblings,
and caretakers.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.330
Not many of them are hanging
out with monkeys.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:01.520
They start to get much more
accurate for human faces.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.420
The experience they have with
human faces starts to make

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.920
them much better that.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.490
At birth, faces from
one species

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:09.700
are as good as another.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.240
But with practice and
experience, they become human

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.030
face specialists.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.130
And they become much
better at that.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.810
So it's not in our genes to
be awesome at human faces.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.430
But there's something
about faces.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.790
And then a lot depends
on what we see.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.140
And we grow that part of
our mind and brain.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.070
So here's a remarkable
experiment, that you couldn't

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.860
do with people, that was done
with infant monkeys.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.030
These monkeys, after they were
born, were given no exposure

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.890
to faces, depending on the
monkey, for six to 24 months.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.120
That's not quite completely
true.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.430
Because at their birth,
they saw some faces.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.090
So they couldn't start this
experiment at the

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:45.980
first moment of birth.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.650
But as soon as they could from
birth, for six to 24 months.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:53.350
So when they were being fed,
this is what they saw.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:55.010
They were given an interesting
environment

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:56.550
to see lots of stuff.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:57.730
And they would live in
something like this.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.660
So they could not see
another monkey.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.610
They could not see a human.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.710
They never saw a face
except for the

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:03.960
first moments of birth.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.790
Before they saw any living face
on a monkey or a human,

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.680
they would do these kinds of
experiments that you just

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.590
heard with infants.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:18.030
And they would show that these
monkeys would preferentially

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.040
look at faces, both human
faces and monkeys.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.110
And they had no preference
between them.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.830
They would always go for a face
compared to an object, a

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.120
monkey face or a human face.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.900
And they could do these kinds
of discrimination.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.730
The first moment before they had
ever-- except for whatever

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.020
happens right a birth--
seen one.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.640
So they never practiced
on anything.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.540
Because they had not been
allowed to see a face.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.480
But the first moment before they
saw any living face, they

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.040
already had this preference for
faces for both humans and

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.230
monkeys, as if it's in our genes
to be drawn to faces.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:55.040
And what the mechanism is, the
top-heavy, something else, we

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.040
don't quite know.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.440
But it's in our brain
to go for faces.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.220
They're so important for us.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.410
Then some monkeys hung
around people.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.180
And some monkeys hung
around monkeys.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.650
And what happened is really
quite striking.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:13.440
They got better at the species
they hung around.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.320
So if you did these kinds of
tests, the monkeys who hung

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.970
around monkeys got better
and better at monkeys.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.830
And the monkeys that hung around
people got better and

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.740
better at people.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.150
So what does that mean?

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:26.440
That means it looks like there's
a genetic preparation.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.080
The first face that they see
with the slight asterisk of

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.700
the moment of birth, they are
already preferring faces.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.800
The very first one they see,
even though they've gone six

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.020
months to two years without
seeing any face at all.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.390
And then they get better
selectively on the species

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:41.900
they're exposed to.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.200
So there's a genetic preparation
and then kind of a

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.940
sensitive period where you build
up a representation of

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.980
the species that you're
living with.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:54.840
So let me slide there for
a moment to now writing.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.830
As long as there's been mammals,
as long as there's

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:00.535
been people, we've been born to
things around us with faces

00:34:00.535 --> 00:34:03.960
and interacted with people
who have faces.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.960
So that's deep in our
evolutionary history.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.890
Not deep in our evolutionary
history

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:09.730
is writing and reading.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.909
The first visual language
of any kind is

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.620
about 4,000 years ago.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:17.409
Not until the Gutenberg
Bible--

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:21.159
and that's about
600 years ago--

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.739
did large numbers
of people read.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:26.860
So unlike faces and objects
which have been around

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:31.510
forever, not only for us, but
for other species, writing and

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.080
reading have been around only
for a few hundred years.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.320
Our brains are not evolved
to be reading brains.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.880
It's just an unbelievably
powerful cultural invention.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.610
And people can read fast.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.550
A typical reader can do this.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.199
This is kind of amazing.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:48.370
Most of us know somewhere
between

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:51.580
50,000 and 100,000 words.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.610
We don't know all
of them well.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:53.850
We can't spell all of
them correctly.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.690
But we kind of can get
them if we see them.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:59.750
And if we show you one word in
50,000ths of a second, you can

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.210
recognize which word you saw.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.720
It's kind of amazing.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.830
People read about 200 to 250
words per minute, a typical

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.000
reader cruising along when
they're focused.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.980
These things can be measured
relatively simply.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.020
Here's one that's a
little trickier.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:13.560
But let me tell you.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.480
Again, it shows you how
experiments can tell us

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.960
something we could not have
guessed without the

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.210
experiment, about how you read
every moment you've read

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:21.730
throughout your life.

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:24.450
So I'm going to tell you now
that you read about 12

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:25.470
letters at a time.

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:26.680
And then you move your eyes.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.320
Whatever you're reading, a book,
on the computer, you'll

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.970
read about 12 letters.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.300
That's where you're fixated.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.820
Those will only be visible to
you, and then you'll move your

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.890
eyes to get the next set of
letters you need to read.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.260
Now you go, no.

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.030
There's text there.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.320
I'll give you, I move my eyes.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.660
But what's really happening, let
me show you how blind you

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.080
are to everything but 12
letters at a time.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.590
So here's the experiment
from McConkie &amp; Raynor.

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.390
And many people have
found this since.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.200
They tracked people's
eye movements.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.620
You can have a machine that
tracks where your eyes are

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.890
fixated, where you're looking.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.970
Every time you moved, what they
did is they took the text

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:08.640
that was written across a
monitor, they kept about 12

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.900
letters where you're looking.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.690
And they made everything else
on the monitor x's.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:14.460
You don't know this.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.140
You're just reading.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.460
So you're reading "people of."
This is where your eyes are.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.010
The computer makes everything
else an x.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:23.870
You move your eyes.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:24.910
Now this becomes x's.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:26.030
And these are x's.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.800
You move your eye.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.990
These become x's.

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.210
You move your eyes.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.015
These become x's.

00:36:31.015 --> 00:36:32.260
Does hat make sense?

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.970
Every time you move, where you
land, they give you the words

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:35.740
and letters.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.400
But everything to the left
and right are all x's.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.980
And the astounding thing is
nobody ever says hey, why are

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.540
there all the x's.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.570
Because when you're reading,
unbeknownst to you, you only

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:52.300
see with good acuity 12
letters at a time.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.350
And everything else, you barely
notice it's there.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:57.160
You notice something is there.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.410
If there's nothing there,
you would notice it.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:03.190
But your mind is not really
seeing it at all.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.700
And so people have tried
to represent this.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.320
This, when you read, is
something like this.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.780
Where you look, in your fovea,
or your high acuity, you see

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.030
about 12 letters.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.320
Everything else is like this.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.670
And that's why if I flip it to
x's, you don't even notice.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.730
Because it's all pretty
crummy how you see it.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:22.885
You notice something is there.

00:37:22.885 --> 00:37:26.420
But it's pretty crummy.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.560
You can say, I don't
believe it.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.520
But people have done
this experiment

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.530
over and over again.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.650
And when they flip everything
to x's to the left and right

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.800
of about 12 letters that you're
looking at, people just

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.550
don't know.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.490
Because they don't really see
it as they read anymore.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:38.510
Does that make sense?

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.980
12 letters at a time.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.440
So again, we're trying to
understand some of these

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.560
things in regards to
difficulties people have.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.710
So it turns out there's a part
of the brain that's also

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.880
involved in reading where, if
you damage, you get what's

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.020
called word blindness.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.330
So these are adults
who are good

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:56.860
readers, no problem reading.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.690
They get a stroke Hts left
visual cortex around here.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:03.470
The most famous original case,
in 1887, all of a sudden one

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:06.020
day after a headache, this
man was unable to read.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.310
His vision was otherwise
perfectly good.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.240
He could hear words
and speak words.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.030
He could see numbers.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.720
He could write down words.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.490
His writing was kind of
slow and laborious.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:17.230
It wasn't typical writing.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.610
But then you could show him a
few moments later what he had

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:22.570
written, and he would not be
able to read it aloud.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:26.740
So here's a pathway where stuff
out there in the world

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.670
in vision meets how we read.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.200
Amazing.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.920
Now it turns out, just like
there's a spot in your brain

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.020
that's the first moment where
something you see is a face.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:48.240
There's a part that's shown here
in red that's near that.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.150
It's bigger in the left
hemisphere, the language

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.950
hemisphere.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.330
It's pretty specific relatively
specific for words

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:56.240
compared to other things.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.690
And so we end up with a
picture like this with

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:02.070
relatively specific areas in the
back of our brain that are

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:06.800
highly specialized for
recognizing where things are.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.020
I didn't talk too
much about that.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:12.350
But there's that area, faces,
words, and objects.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.300
And if you have damage to any
of these pathways, for

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.740
whatever reason, the rest of
our brain can't compensate.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.106
And it's all a big mystery, who
am I looking at, what word

00:39:20.106 --> 00:39:23.540
am I looking at, what
object do I see?

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.340
Now, you might imagine that
for things like faces or

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.880
locations, we've had
evolutionary pressure for

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.270
forever to be good at that.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.110
Where are we?

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:33.630
Who are we with?

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.960
Whereas things like words, or
nonsense words, and letters,

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.080
or chairs--

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.950
which are a recent cultural
invention--

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.040
our brains are not genetically
predisposed to those specific

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.460
categories.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.310
So there's a very clever study
from Ted Polk in Michigan.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.270
So we took twins.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.350
And we'll talk more
about this.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.370
But the way people try to get
at until we know the real

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.410
genes involved in things,
they'll compare twins who are

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.695
identical twins with the
identical genes and twins

00:39:58.695 --> 00:40:02.160
which are so-called fraternal
twins who are born to the same

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.870
family but don't have
the identical genes.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.990
And to the extent the identical
twins are more

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:10.290
similar to each other than the
fraternal twins, that's a

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:13.420
suggestion there's genetic
influences on whatever you're

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.680
looking at.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.210
So what they did is they had
these people look at faces,

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:20.760
places, letter strings,
and chairs.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.630
And they calculated how similar
was one twin to

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:28.140
another, either identically
genetic or not.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.200
And what they found was that for
the faces and the places,

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.100
there was much more similar,
significantly more similarly

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.110
between identical twins
than fraternal twins.

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.910
That's the genetic
predisposition, in some way,

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:44.600
of how you will see a face
or know where you are.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.640
If they compare reading
nonsense words, letter

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.540
strings, or chairs, the
two kinds of twins

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.110
were just the same.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.990
It's as if there's no genetic
predisposition in you to know

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.960
where in your brain
you're going to

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.360
process words or chairs.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.370
But that makes sense.

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:03.770
Because a couple thousand years
ago there were no words.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:05.020
And a few more thousand
years than that,

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.330
there were no chairs.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.870
So that's we don't have
the genes for recent

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.140
inventions in the world.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.340
But our brain is brilliant at
becoming good at things like

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.425
reading as we invent them.

00:41:15.425 --> 00:41:17.930
For the last part of the talk,
I want to talk about face

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:18.470
recognition.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:22.090
So all of us know that when
we learn to read it was

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:22.900
a pretty big deal.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.300
It was a while ago.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.360
If you are a typical reader,
you're passionate.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.550
If you're a struggling
reader, that can be

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.600
a persistent problem.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.520
But you got through it,
and you're a reader.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.210
None of us went to third grade
and said, today is the day

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:35.346
that we study faces.

00:41:35.346 --> 00:41:37.810
And your parents are going, I
hope you're going at faces.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:40.390
Because we really want you
to go to MIT someday.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.270
This is the moment to get
ready for the face SAT.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.250
But what I'm going to show you
is that in fact, through

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:48.040
experience, you're educated
for faces.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.750
And there's some social
consequences for the faces

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.340
you're not educated
on, on average.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.170
So let's talk about that.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:59.210
So one way we see faces is we
see faces that are right-side

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:01.580
up, overwhelmingly.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.210
So I'm going to show you
this upside down face.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:05.380
I'm going to reverse it.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.070
And that's what it is.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:08.840
That's gruesome, right?

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.220
But can you tell that
when that turns,

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.800
it's going to be this?

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.930
So the way that we interpret
the weirdness of face

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.780
inversion, the fact that
we process upside

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.030
down faces so badly--

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.230
we don't have any hint of
what's really there--

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.800
it's because we didn't
practice on them.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.310
It's as if I gave you a test in
a language that you never

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:31.030
spoke or read.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:32.920
Well you can do badly.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.845
So that shows you that
faces, it's a

00:42:34.845 --> 00:42:36.510
so experienced dependent.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.520
It's because you see upright
faces you get

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.470
good at upright faces.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:41.000
All we have to do is turn
it upside down.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.230
And all the knowledge and skill
you have, it's as if I

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.920
tested you in a different
language.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.530
It's that specific.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.450
Here's another example, side by
side, looks pretty similar.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:52.700
But that's what you're
really seeing.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.220
It's unbelievable.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:03.400
Turn your head to believe me
in case you're suspicious.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.650
This is legit.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.830
We're so bad at upside down
faces because we don't

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.270
practice on them.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.640
So what we are good at in faces
is so much dependent on

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.930
what we practice.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.240
You may recognize this
person or not.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.690
These are less dramatic.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.670
People don't become as good
as they get at faces

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:32.870
until about age 16.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.680
We don't consciously
practice it.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.890
But the social experience
we have is practicing,

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:40.240
practicing, practicing how
you perceive a face.

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.530
One fun study from a Susan Carey
now at Harvard is she

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.580
took dog show judges.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.300
Now, I don't know too much
about dog shows.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.850
Some of you might
know something.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:53.510
But a little bit of what
I know is this.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.670
Sort of like in sports, you have
judges who work their way

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.260
up a ladder of experience
and reputation.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.620
So in sports things, you
have the local judges.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.940
And the really good ones
become the ones

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.810
for the bigger leagues.

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:06.660
And the big ones get to go to
the Super Bowl and World

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.620
Series who are really skilled
and thought to be excellent.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.120
Dog show judges, similarly,
start locally.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.420
The ones who seem pretty good
and persistent at it then

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.480
become the state judge show.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.940
And then they go to the
big one in New York.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.870
And so they did these face
inversion experiments on dog

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.970
show judges, people who were
just beginning to be a dog

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:27.300
show judge, people who have done
it for a while, people

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.790
who've done it for
a lot of years.

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.320
And they asked, when do you
get so much better at a

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.270
right-side up dog face than
an upside down dog face?

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:38.350
Now, most people are about
the same to start with.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:40.830
Because we're not that
good at dog faces.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:41.990
You might know a dog or two.

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:45.060
But you don't know hundreds
of dollars.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.660
It took eight years for dog show
judges-- and they were

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.910
dog enthusiasts for many
years before they

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:52.490
became a dog show judge--

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:56.480
eight years of seeing many,
many dogs at dog show

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.600
competitions to develop the
upright face expertise that we

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.720
all have for faces as adults.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.750
So for an adult, you have to
practice eight years to get

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.140
this kind of expertise.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.930
You can't just do
it by cramming.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.430
It's practice, practice,
practice in the most brutal

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:13.680
fundamental sense.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.410
Now I'll say one last thing
about this then

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:19.850
go to the last topic.

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.940
The other thing is that we
understand also-- and we've

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.312
mentioned this before, but I'll
say it one more time--

00:45:24.312 --> 00:45:28.700
that imagination and perception
use the same neural

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.170
territory in your mind.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.610
So here's a study from Nancy
Kanwisher again.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.760
Here's a part of the brain that
responds to faces, seeing

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.600
a face, seeing a house, seeing
a face, seeing a house.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.380
Now, imagining a face, imagining
a house, imagining a

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.720
face, imagining a house.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.460
So seeing one drives the
brain more strongly

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.910
than imagining it.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.030
But when you imagine a face, you
seem to use the same brain

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:56.600
network as when you see it.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.230
It's just not as vivid
and powerful.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:02.280
So perception is the stuff
literally in your mind of

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.000
imagination.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.870
You can imagine things, because
you've seen them

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.450
before, literally in
your brain It's the

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:11.090
same part of the brain.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.620
So the last topic I want to talk
about is a sensitive and

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:14.370
difficult one.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.220
So I'm going to do
it right, I hope.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.250
But it's one that's a
practical one, and a

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:23.240
consequence, we believe, of the
fact that you're good at

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.120
faces that you practice.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.600
So we're going to talk about
in these studies people

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.950
perceiving faces of European
Americans, or white Americans,

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.940
or African Americans.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:37.630
And there's a huge amount
of research

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:39.120
that shows the following.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.920
That whatever racial group you
see a lot of, you're pretty

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.240
good at remembering
those faces.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.790
At whatever group you see
less, you're far worse.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.950
We interpret this as a
consequence of the practice

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:55.720
that you have.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.900
But social psychologists worry
it has a second consequence.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.150
Let me tell you the
practice story.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.540
So we did a study.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.120
This is from us.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.800
But it's very similar to other
people in terms of the

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.500
conclusion.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.500
There's literally like 1,000
of these studies that show

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.480
that people are superior at
recognizing in an experiment

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:14.950
faces from their own group
than from other groups.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.300
And here, an experiment that
was done with Stanford

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.850
students, a look in their mind
and then in their brain.

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:21.930
So these are Stanford students
just some years ago, maybe a

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:23.180
lot like you in many ways.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.550
They saw some faces, and then
they got a memory test.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.790
This is their performance
on the memory test.

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:35.050
So we had both European American
and African American

00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.650
faces that they viewed.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:40.410
And the participants in the
research were both African

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:42.470
American and European
American.

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:46.370
OK so there were white faces,
white subjects, black faces,

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:48.070
black subjects.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:49.800
And what you can see is this.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.820
The higher the bar, the
better the memory.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.440
In both groups, they're better
in performance at remembering

00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.420
faces from their own group.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.350
But there's more to
it than that.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:05.590
If you look at these bars, these
are the memory for the

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:06.695
white faces.

00:48:06.695 --> 00:48:09.240
And it's about the same
in the two groups.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.120
And look at the big
difference for the

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.190
African American faces.

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.360
So two things are
happening here.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.610
One of them is there's superior
memory from faces

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.630
from your own group.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:25.480
And the second story is that for
what we believed, and from

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.740
other research as
well, is this.

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.670
If you're a minority group,
you're still pretty good at

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.420
the majority faces.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.460
If you're a majority group,
you're not so good at the

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:35.790
minority faces.

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:38.580
So these are European American
Stanford students.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.990
And look how a miserable their
memory is for these African

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:43.240
American faces.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.920
This is a difficult topic for
us, in part, because race is a

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.980
different topic for
good reasons.

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:56.560
But social psychologists worry
that the lack of practice that

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.170
many of us have on other groups
growing up at home, in

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.370
our community, and schools--

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:03.410
and it varies for people,
but on average--

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:06.710
makes us less able to
individuate in our memory one

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.420
person from another
in other groups.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.460
And now this is not about
racial attitudes.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:17.280
This is simple, objective
recognition of faces.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.880
But it could certainly support
consideration of other groups

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.670
as if they were all the same.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.490
Because they look
all the same.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:26.430
I remember I had an
African American

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.690
colleague at Stanford.

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.680
And he was a dean.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.190
And he went to China with a
Nobel laureate who is now the

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:37.140
Secretary of Energy
in the Obama

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.230
administration, Steve Chu.

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:41.980
And, of course, Nobel laureates
are a pretty big.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:45.540
So this dean went to this Nobel
laureate all the time.

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.610
We're meeting Stanford donors
and other things.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:49.710
He said they got on the plane.

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.570
They went to China,
the two of them.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.390
And he went into a reception.

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:57.870
And he knew Steve Chu
was in there.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.500
The African American dean said,
I could not pick him out

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:01.700
for my life.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:05.540
When I saw him now, not with
other people I know, but with

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.790
a 500 other Chinese people
in a large reception.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:12.180
So it's not about bad attitudes
in this case.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.610
It's just literally the
experience you have.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:19.960
And in the brain, this part of
this FFA, responds more to

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.600
groups from your own--

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.350
on average--

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:24.390
from your own racial group than
the other racial group.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.600
And we think that's promoting
the ease with which to

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.130
identify individuals in your
group and the difficulty with

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:34.340
which you can identify I
individuals in another group.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.650
And so we have strong reason
to think that this is all

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:38.910
about this particular phenomenon
about your

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:40.340
experience.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.810
So let me tell you why.

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.400
One thing is we know that this
is not present at birth.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.040
People have done these kinds of
experiments with infants.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.300
These racial biases in what
kinds of faces we can remember

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.390
are not present at birth.

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.100
So they're not in our genes.

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.850
They're from our experience.

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:57.510
But they are present
by three months.

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:01.180
But by then you've seen a lot
of people in your family.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.840
And the kind of experiment
that's very telling for this

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.980
is a study where there
were Korean children.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.230
They were three to
nine years old.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:10.850
They were adopted by European
Caucasian families, so, in the

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:12.950
sense, a cross-racial
adoption.

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:15.290
And then they tested their
memory for faces.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.960
And for these Korean children
adopted by European Caucasian

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.900
families, they had better
memory for the Caucasian

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:26.370
faces, because that's who they
saw around them all the time.

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:31.810
And they were just like their
French peers who also saw

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:33.530
Caucasian faces all the time.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.680
And the opposite of the findings
that you've got with

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:39.780
Korean children in
South Korea.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:43.820
The inversion one is kind
of funny, amazing.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:48.250
The fact that we can struggle
to individuate in memory one

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:51.130
African American from another,
or one Asian American from

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.530
another, or one Caucasian
American from another

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:55.970
depending on the environment
that we grew up in and were

00:51:55.970 --> 00:52:01.180
exposed to, that could be
facilitating stereotyping and

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:04.750
lack of individuation of
people in other groups.

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:06.160
So the very last thing I want
to do-- and this is just a

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:06.910
couple minutes--

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:09.270
is talk about expression
in faces.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:10.150
And I'll come back to
this in detail.

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:16.730
I just want to give you one last
example of recognition in

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.130
the amygdala and fear.

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:20.050
So we'll come back to this
in some detail later on.

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:23.680
But most researchers argue
there's about six basic

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.040
emotions that people around the
world transmit with their

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.060
facial expressions, happiness,
sadness, fear, anger,

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.620
surprise, and disgust.

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:36.470
You can show these pictures to
people around the world, and

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:39.610
they'll be, to some degree,
consensus about what they are,

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:43.220
universal expressions of
feelings transmitted by facial

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.240
expressions.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.950
Now let's talk about
fear faces.

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:48.310
I'll just talk about
fear today.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.560
And we'll talk about
the amygdala.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.280
So we have one on the left and
one on the right, it's a very

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.730
small structure, almond shaped,
one inside each of the

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:58.050
temporal lobes right next
to the hippocampus.

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:00.610
So that's a view from the side
of where that's located, one

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.540
on the left and one
on the right.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.360
And we know from a lot of animal
research-- and I'll

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.490
come back to this again--

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:09.270
the amygdala is essential
for learned

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:11.590
fear, for learned fear.

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:14.520
So here's an experiment
that shows you that.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.430
One thing that mice know
is cats are bad news.

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:18.930
It's survival.

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:20.290
What they did in this
experiment is they

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:21.660
anesthetized the cat.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.690
That's why the cat looks
glassy-eyed.

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:29.220
Obviously the experiment would
end too quickly for the mouse,

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:32.200
if the mouse had to come out
and play with the cat.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.660
The experiment would be
brutal, and ugly,

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.360
and over too quickly.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.150
But if the cat is breathing, the
cat's eyes are open, it's

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.510
anesthetized.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:40.070
But it can't move.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:44.550
Now a typical rat or mouse
will typically

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:45.670
still avoid the cat.

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.110
It's not worth figuring
out exactly what's

00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:47.910
going on with the cat.

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:48.970
Are they faking me out?

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:51.620
I'll just go that way.

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:55.775
But this is not the mouse who
has the amygdala removed.

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.980
It's not fearful of what it
ought to be fearful of

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:04.260
anymore, even survival.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.670
What we believe the most
important role of fear is not

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:09.530
fear of SATs or midterms.

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:11.600
Although we live
in that world.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.950
It's fear of what injure
you and kill you.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:14.960
Those are the things to learn.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.940
Be fearful of what
can kill you.

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:18.740
Be fearful of what
can injure you.

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.490
Without the amygdala,
you lose that fear.

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:24.390
But here's the other-- this is
my last slide-- amazing thing.

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:26.610
There are humans who have
injuries selectively to the

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.620
amygdala, very few.

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.190
But there's a few.

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:32.550
And not only do they have some
problems with fear learning.

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:35.640
But they can't recognize
fearful

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.195
facial expressions anymore.

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:42.350
If they ask them to say, what
is this, without the word

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.440
present, they're very
bad at telling you

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.820
that's a fearful face.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.180
They can recognize all the other
expressions pretty well

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:51.680
but not the fearful ones.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.160
also

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.480
They're good of faces.

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.360
They're not prosopagnosia.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.160
They're fine at faces.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.030
They recognize their family.

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.360
But they can't recognize
fearful expressions

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.970
selectively.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:05.440
This is actually a very good
drawing happy, sad, surprised,

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.400
disgusted, angry.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.875
When she's asked to draw a
fearful facial expression,

00:55:09.875 --> 00:55:12.140
this patient draws this,
a baby being afraid.

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.210
She understands the concept.

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.430
But it's not only that she
can't recognize it.

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:20.020
She can't imagine what a fearful
face looks like.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:23.410
And we saw this over
and over again.

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:25.060
And there's one last
message in this.

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.850
Somehow our knowledge about
what a fearful face looks

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:29.550
like, we're not scared
of this.

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:31.130
You don't look at this
and go, oh my gosh.

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.030
I can't believe he showed
that in class.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:37.250
I'll never sleep for 48 hours.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.530
That's a social signal for
somebody telling you, whoa.

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:41.000
There's something terrible
happening here.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:41.670
Look around you.

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:42.200
We better run.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.550
It's a social signal.

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:46.780
And the part of your brain that
learns what can kill you

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:51.160
also is where the knowledge is
stored to recognize a social

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.160
signal about something that
could be very dangerous.

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.560
The same idea that we put our
knowledge in the parts of

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.180
their brain that act
upon the world.
