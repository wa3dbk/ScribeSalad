00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.580
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.930
In the last lecture we talked
about the remarkable human

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.937
brain, and how it empowers our
thoughts, or feelings, or

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:42.920
desires, or actions in the
world, and how we began to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.376
understand this remarkable
complexity, or at least grasp

00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:47.798
something of the complexity.

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:51.890
How we understand the potential
for things like

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.570
moral character,
and judgments.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.250
The case of Phineas Gage, to
produce language, to speak our

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.250
feelings and thoughts that's
blocked in a patient like

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.350
Broca's patient, with
Broca's aphasia.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.650
We talked about the fact that
split brain patients show us

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.550
not only to the left and right
hemispheres of the human brain

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.130
mediate separate mental
abilities, but that they also

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.220
seem to have almost independent
forms of

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.070
consciousness, or they
don't have to be

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.580
aware of one another.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.670
And so my focus today is to say
we would learn from very

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.480
unusual clinical cases.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.250
And I'm going to focus today on
tools we have to study the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.580
typical human brain.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.860
And what is it that we can do to
understand how your brain--

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.060
without having a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.830
hemispherectomy or a big stroke--

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.380
how does it operate, and what
are the principles of human

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.280
brain function they gave
rise to the human mind?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.260
So what are the ways we can
learn about the human brain?

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.370
And one thing we can't do is
when animal researchers can

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.510
do, we can't literally go inside
the brain except in

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.280
very rare clinical situations.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.460
I'll talk about them, but it's
a rare source of evidence.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.390
So there's a million ways in
which are trying to understand

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.190
which part of the brain is which
part of the mind, and we

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.280
talked about the fact that
phronology was a big misstep

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.990
in assigning the functions of
mental life to different parts

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.750
of the brain.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.990
And so we hope we can do
a bit better than that.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.030
And I'm going to review with
you today some of the core

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.620
methods, and there's
a number of them

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.250
studying the human brain.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.130
The reason there's a number
is none of them

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.560
are the magic answer.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.470
All of them are limited in their
own ways, and we sort of

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.630
need all of them to begin
to grasp how your

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.830
brain makes your mind.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.210
There's three huge ways in which
we now have the human

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.990
brain organized.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.690
Lesions, injuries to the brain,
stimulation when you're

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.390
allowed to stimulate
the brain--

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.140
rarer, but we'll talk
about that.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.330
And the most common, the one you
see all the time in books

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.360
and magazines, recording,
functional MRI, EEG, methods

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.750
where we record brain
activity, and try to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.800
understand how that relates to
the life of the human mind.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.400
And so we're going to go through
these things a little

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.800
bit and show you how they're
applied in some ways that I

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.600
hope that you'll find
interesting.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.100
We'll come back to many of these
things as we go through

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.080
the semester, and as we talk
about aging, or child

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.040
development, or personality,
or other

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.300
topics, social cognition.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.980
We'll use these tools to
understand the brain bases of

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.690
those kinds of aspects
of our mental lives.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.010
So what's a big injury
you can have?

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.470
You can have a stroke, where
tissue in the brain no longer

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.030
receives its vascular supply
that it depends on so greatly.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.980
And a lot of different things
like hypoxia, lack of oxygen,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.310
the brain is very sensitive
to oxygen.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.030
Tumors can grow, you could have
degenerative disorders

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.120
like Alzheimer's, Huntington's,
Parkinson's, and

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.190
others, epilepsy.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.010
So there's lots of different
ways in which you can end up

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.740
with brain injury, and
ultimately neuronal death.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.050
What's the strength of this
form of evidence?

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.940
Well first of all,
it's causal.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.880
We've talked about the
difference between causal and

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.260
correlational sources of
evidence, causal ones be more

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.980
powerful for scientific
explanation.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.100
A certain part of the brain is
injured in you no longer can

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.180
speak, you change your
character, you no longer can

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.370
make memories.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.600
We're pretty sure that part of
the brain in some way is

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.340
required, or causal, for
that part of your

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.300
mental life to operate.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.090
The deficits you see following
brain injuries can be amazing,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.480
we talked about Phineas Gage
changing his character, unable

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.820
to produce language, unable
to make new memories.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.579
We'll talk a little bit about
patients with Prosopagnosia,

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.110
it's a good big word to go home
on spring break and if

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.570
your parents ask what have you
learned about, you say

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.270
Prosopagnosia.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.730
That just means a deficit
in recognizing faces.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.310
Patients with Prosopagnosia will
be unable to recognize

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.540
their own spouse
by their face.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.720
They'll recognize it by the
voice, by the physical

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.780
movements, but not
by their face.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.940
We learn amazing things about
the brain that until it

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.300
happens we didn't know that
could happen, what people like

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.370
to call counterintuitive.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.020
So we'll talk later in the
course in a couple times about

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.420
blindsight, patients who say,
I see nothing, but their

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.850
behavior shows some part of
their brain sees something.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.920
We'll talk about category
specific deficits where

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.900
patients all of the sudden can
no longer name living things,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.100
but they can name nonliving
things.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.220
So you wouldn't have
thought of that if

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.730
you didn't see that.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.310
And we get separations
in the brain

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.090
between different things.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.040
We talked about the difference
between the left hemisphere

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.840
being important for
local features,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.250
the right for global.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.320
The left thinking in terms of
functional things in the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.320
world, the right in terms
of appearances.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.780
We talked about that already.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.150
We'll talk about other things,
the hippocampus is important

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.690
for knowing that, knowing a
piece of information but the

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.170
Basal Ganglia is important for
learning how to do things,

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.930
mental skills and
physical skills.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.070
We'll come back to all of those,
it gives us way to

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.800
organize things.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.170
Much of our most solid
understanding of the human

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.320
brain still comes from
the history of

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.170
neurology and lesions.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.390
But what are its limitations?

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.500
First, brain injuries don't
follow anatomical boundaries,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.630
they sort of crossover things
depending on the injury.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.770
So they're not going to
selectively damage one part of

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.850
the brain and not touch an
adjacent one they could be

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.520
doing something different.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.430
People can be variable
in their response.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.150
Nearby systems, if you have two
things in the brain that

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.050
are next door to one another,
do quite different things.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.170
Injuries are likely to injure
them both, and you will have a

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.930
wrong conclusion about
the architecture

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.280
of the human brain.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.940
When we test a patient and ask
them to do things after a

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.910
brain injury, we don't really
test the part of the brain

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.390
that's not there.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.340
We really test a part of the
brain that is there, people do

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.820
the best they can.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.530
So there's secondary
degeneration to an injury,

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.930
there's recovery from
injury, there's

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.010
compensation from an injury.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.650
When you test a patient with a
brain injury, you're testing

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.970
what the rest of the brain can
do in the absence of one of

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.820
its companions.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.510
And finally can offer
limited views of

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.990
normal brain function.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.200
Let me pick one and we'll
come back in the course.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.320
We're very interested in
variation in people--

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.160
individuality--

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.340
what's the neurology
of individuality?

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.580
That's very hard to study in
lesion cases, because we don't

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.490
see enough of a lesion.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.760
we don't have enough Phineas
Gages to ask would that injury

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.762
look different if you grew up in
one culture or another, if

00:07:00.762 --> 00:07:03.610
you were outgoing versus shy.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.120
Those kinds of things
are very hard to

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.260
answer patient by patient.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.080
But we can test large groups of
people with imaging and ask

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.940
what's the influence of
culture on your brain

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.860
organization?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.985
What's the influence of
personality on how your

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:16.690
brain's organized?

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.220
And you'll see later on in the
semester evidence about those

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.750
sorts of things.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.650
So let's go back to Paul Broca,
the neurologist who

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.030
they gave a name to Broca's
area, because he sought a

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.220
patient like this,
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.630
That this patient had a big
injury in this area could no

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.510
longer speak.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.100
And every course you ever take
about the brain almost will

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.370
include a discussion
about Broca's area.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.570
So I'm going to warp your world
in a very narrow way,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.330
but maybe a shocking way, and
tell you we don't even know

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.170
how to think about Broca's
area once we get more

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.860
scientific than that.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.930
So because this is MIT
so we're willing to

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.100
tell the truth, OK.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.780
So some years later Nina
Dronkers said the following

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.150
thing, she studied a large
group of patients who had

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.170
Broca's aphasia by behavior.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.100
That is they had trouble
speaking, but the

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.160
comprehension was pretty good.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.660
And then she made maps of
their injuries and she

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.050
overlaid those maps.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.120
And she said who has Broca's
aphasia, and if you have

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.520
Broca's aphasia, what's the
one part of the brain that

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.690
every patient with Broca's
aphasia has damage to.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.650
Because these patients--

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.090
what you see on these maps is,
some patients have damage

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.620
here, or here, or here.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.220
But you line them all up and you
say, what's the one spot

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.179
that you have to have injured
to have Broca's aphasia?

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.549
And it's not this area that you
saw in the picture, it's

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.364
this area, in yellow, an area
called the Precentral Gyrus of

00:08:38.364 --> 00:08:39.975
the Insula.

00:08:39.975 --> 00:08:42.860
The Insula is a fascinating,
mysterious little structure--

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.490
you have one on the left,
and one on the right--

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.590
that runs along from the
temporal lobe, up to the

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.230
frontal cortex.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.310
Just a couple years ago there
was a paper reporting that

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.860
patients who had stroke in
posterior insula instantly

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.670
gave up smoking, and never
wanted to smoke again.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.120
There's huge research efforts
to help people quit smoking,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.250
just because it's such a
difficult health problem.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.520
Nobody is doing insula lesions
to help people

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.710
stop smoking, OK.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.090
But it just stopped the smoking,
and their desire to

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.290
smoke, just like that.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.770
This is now more towards the
front of the brain, this is

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.730
not what anybody in a book or
a course will tell you is

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.850
Broca's area, that's out here.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.110
But it turns out this is the hot
spot, and you could say,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.230
well what about the
original patient?

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.530
So kind of creatively Nina
Dronkers went back and they

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.285
did an MRI of the brain of the
deceased original Broca's

00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:32.910
aphasic patient.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.150
They still had his brain, they
put it in a scanner and they

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.870
ran a structural MRI.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.010
And what they found was sure
enough he had damage way

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:46.040
inside the exterior limit of
this damage, in as well as in

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.010
white matter that
connects to it.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.740
So even now imaging evidence
lets us rediscover what is the

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.370
true basis of your ability
to speak, or its

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.840
vulnerability to injury.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.520
And it turns out not
to be exactly what

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.300
Broca thought it was.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.750
He saw big lesion and he said,
this is the part of matters.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.870
It turns out, as far as we
understand, it's a slightly

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.700
different part that he thought
was just at the

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.440
edge and not important.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.050
So we can get better even going
back to 150 years of

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.590
imaging a brain, we don't have
many of those brains around.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.950
Stimulation, so you like to go
in the brain is stimulate.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.260
People who do animal work will
go in and stimulate a neuron

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.860
and see what happens.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.030
It's rare, you only get into the
patient's brain when they

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.440
have a neurosurgical procedure
and they're considering a

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.880
resection, or removal
of tissue.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.820
You can also do recordings
by putting grids on

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.260
top of those brains.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.610
And Penfield did famous studies
for patients with

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.230
epilepsy, where he would
stimulate and map things that

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.920
contributed a lot to our
thinking about the brain.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.720
But that's a rare source of
evidence, as you can imagine.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.630
Another one that's much more
common-- there's one of these

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.340
devices down the street
in building 46--

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.660
is Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation, or TMS.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.062
So this is one in which people
are allowed ethically, and

00:10:56.062 --> 00:10:58.980
responsibly to give you a
virtual lesion for a few

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.180
moments, if you volunteer
to do so.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.990
So they put some sort of
wire, there's different

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.460
configurations, over your head
in a targeted location.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.642
It generates a magnetic field
that passes through the skull

00:11:10.642 --> 00:11:12.540
and induces a current.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.050
And what happens is the
current drives lots

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.660
of neurons to fire.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.440
Turns out, this is kind of
interesting, if all your

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.580
neurons are firing at the same
moment, in one sense it's as

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.420
if none of them were, because
there's no information.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.810
There's a lot of different ways
you could think about

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.670
that, but for example if on your
300 channel television

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.030
you had all the channels on
simultaneously on the same

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.410
screen, it wouldn't be
very easy to watch,

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.180
something like that.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.910
All the neurons firing pretty
much wipes out the

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.460
function of that area.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.580
People do feel a little bit of
a physical sensation, if

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.360
you're prone to epilepsy it's
not a good idea to try this,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.240
so it does require some
careful supervision

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:49.930
experimentally.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.270
But you can do this with healthy
people, and if for

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.480
example you do it on this side
of the motor cortex, people

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.630
twitch or say they felt
somebody touch them.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.220
Nobody touched them, but the
part of the brain that codes

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.510
for touch just got turned on.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.900
If you put it on the occipital
cortex, visual cortex, and you

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.220
turn on at a certain moment,
you could put a word up and

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.690
word down, and the person will
say they saw nothing.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.570
You'll make them functionally,
cortically

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.960
blind for a few moments.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.430
People have done experiments
like this to suppress

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.140
activity, to enhance activity,
sometimes it makes people even

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.160
faster, like naming pictures.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.550
And it's also been used there's
still experimental

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.310
studies of whether it can be
helpful for treatments of

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.870
neuropsychiatric disorders.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.770
It's not invasive, in a sense of
you're not going literally

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.620
inside, you have a causal thing
because turning the

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.290
brain on or off.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.530
It's not very well targeted, it
can't go into subcortical

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.270
areas, but it's a very
interesting tool.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.670
Let's talk about recording brain
structure for a moment.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.730
It's really important to
separate this concept between

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.400
recording structure, which is
a picture of anatomy, or

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.340
function, which is a picture
of physiology.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.880
So there's old ones angiography,
and things like

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.940
that, I'll show you two.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.410
Computed Tomography, and MR
and a really cool measure

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.650
called Diffusion
Tensor Imaging.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.910
And then, dysfunctional
measures, and we'll talk about

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.710
those, EEG, PET, fMRI, MEG.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.670
So here's some different
images you can

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.920
get from the brain.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.120
This is a post-mortem brain,
this is a cut brain, here's

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.960
the front, here's the back.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.000
If a brain was open in
front of you, this is

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.620
what you would see.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.890
So here's an MRI, Magnetic
Resonance Imaging, and it's

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.120
pretty good, and I'll show you
some more pictures, in showing

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.070
you lots of information.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.700
Not as good as if you were in
there, but pretty good.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.120
Here's a CT scan, Computed
Tomography.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.840
It's not as good, it's
more blurry.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.430
And this thing that looks really
sad, it looks like get

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.810
your camera to focus, that's
actually the quality of the

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.040
picture that we see that
underlies maybe the most

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.290
widely used tool these days for
understanding the human

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.720
mind and brain, Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.830
It's a very smudgy picture,
but it has some really

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.660
interesting properties.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.970
So here's the kind of thing you
go into for an MRI, both

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.550
structural or functional.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.040
Some of you have almost
certainly been participants in

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.690
research or experiments,
or studies, stick up

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:05.870
your hand if you have.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.930
Oh, a lot of you, OK, so you'll
speak up on this, is it

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.110
quiet or noisy?

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.570
It's super noisy, so you have
to have ear plugs in.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.980
And this is why people doing
experiments with this

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.320
Functional MRI want to do
visual studies, because

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.300
auditory ones are tricky.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.030
So Tyler, your head TA, likes
auditory stuff, it's 10 times

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.420
harder to pull off those
experiments.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.700
Everybody tries to do visual
stuff, so you don't have the

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.940
noise problem.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.485
But you get some beautiful
pictures, here's Computed

00:14:33.485 --> 00:14:35.250
Tomography.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.160
And here's an MRI structural
scan from the brain, the

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.500
ventricles, here's
Basal Ganglia.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.570
With an MRI, beautifully you can
see the difference between

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.460
white and gray matter.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.080
I'm always impressed that
the gray matter is

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.520
just this thin ribbon.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.580
Cortex really means bark,
it's just like

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.860
the bark on our tree.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.600
And when you look at the brain
this way, look at how much

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.350
white matter there is.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.500
Here's your frontal cortex, look
at all that white matter

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.490
and then this thin, cortical
mantle, or ribbon, or bark.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.070
That's what we think of as the
smarts of language, and social

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.380
planning, and things
like that.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.970
So that's a structural
picture.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.370
And then these two pictures
are sort of fun.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.750
This is just recorded down the
street, we're going to fly

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:32.550
through your brain from
one ear to the other.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.940
And you get amazing resolution,
it's not the same

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.230
thing like being inside
the brain.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.890
There's things that you don't
see, we know that,

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:43.960
but you see a lot.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.210
Isn't that cool?

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.640
Let's examine what
you can see now.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.120
Only about 40 years ago, you
would have to have a person

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.970
die to see this.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.540
This is a patient with
Huntington's disease, we'll

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.630
come back and talk about
that disorder.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.770
Here's a healthy person,
top of the brain.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.290
This is the caudate here, part
of the Basal Ganglia.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.870
And you could see in a patient
who has passed away that part

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.850
of the brain is completely
withered away in

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.720
Huntington's disease.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.530
You would have to wait until
person passed away to see

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.960
something like that.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.640
Here's a healthy person
top of the brain,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.140
again lining the ventricle.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.310
This is the caudate.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:22.160
And here in a living
Huntington's patients you can

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.490
see the great withering away.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.110
Some of cortex 2 in later
stage of disease, but

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.360
especially in the
Basal Ganglia.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.470
Here's a healthy older person,
about 70 years of age, top of

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.940
the brain, bottom of the
brain, the ventricle.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.700
Here's on the left and right
of the hippocampus, the

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.900
structure we'll talk about,
without which you can cannot

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.870
learn any new fact,
or remember any

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.220
event in your life.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.090
So powerful for almost every
sense of learning.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.990
And look what happens the
structure in the same aged

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.510
patient with Alzheimer's
disease.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.120
It's virtually gone, it's
greatly weathered.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.190
You see it's much wider here,
because the tissue's greatly

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.290
shrunk in the Alzheimer's
patient.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.599
So we can see these kinds of
changes in living people, for

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:12.089
both research purposes and
clinical purposes.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:14.530
Here's one that's more cheerful,
and more reflecting

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.740
your experience.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.400
Here are studies of brain
changes from age four to 21.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.700
So they follow a large number
of people at NIH

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.890
from age four to 21.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:27.940
And what this shows is this
color coding is the thickness

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.360
of the cortex.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.810
And you might imagine that as
you get older, and smarter and

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.890
go through grade school, and
middle school, and high

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.340
school, and MIT college, and
as you head towards grad

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.960
school, your brain will
get thicker, and

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.290
thicker with cortex.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.050
It's exactly the opposite.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:43.950
Ever since you were about five
years old, you've been

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.280
shedding neurons by the
millions, and connections

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.980
among them by the trillions.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.530
And you're still going
to do that until your

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.630
probably about 22 or 23.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.930
Then you peak, and you decline
and become faculty members.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.450
But that's really interesting,
we'll come back to this, that

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.750
what happens as your brain
get smart, experienced,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.820
knowledgeable, all the
differences between you now,

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.390
if you're 17, 18, 19, 20, and
when you were four, it all

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.970
goes with your cortex
getting thinner.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.690
And we'll come back to that
and how people think about

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.240
that, but let's see if I can
get this next movie to run.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.930
There's also an ordering-- and
we'll come back this but I

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.640
want to show you this movie.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.090
So the more blue you are, the
thinner you are, the more

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.670
advanced you are in terms
of ultimate young adult

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.900
development.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.740
Here's visual cortex,
vision coming in.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.150
This is Somatomotor Cortex, how
you feel, your body, and

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.580
how you move yourself.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.200
And what you see is, as you go
from age four to 21, the blue

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.960
spreads, that spreading is your
brain maturing in higher

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.510
thought areas.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.755
So we're going to review your
life on average right now,

00:18:55.755 --> 00:18:57.005
here you go.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.020
And now you're ready
to graduate.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.540
It's kind of an amazing story
of fantastic brain changes

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.240
that move you from what you
could do and not do at four,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.910
to what you can do and
not do at age 21.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.600
And we couldn't see these
things, we couldn't begin to

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.230
see these things, until just
a few years ago in any

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.360
scientific sense.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.990
All these things are like
miraculous sources of

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.540
information.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.080
So let's pick another
thing, and we'll tie

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.620
it to school work.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.300
Here's the structure we
said, the hippocampus.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.790
So important for the formation
of new memories on an everyday

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.210
basis, everything that's
important and that you learn.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.060
So here's a fun study they
took, and as you hear it,

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.130
think about its scientific
limitation, but it's fun as

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.740
students to think about.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.900
They looked at students in
medical school in Germany.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.080
They looked at the measure of
an anatomic thickness of the

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.790
hippocampus before and after
they studied like crazy for a

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.600
huge exam over some
number of periods.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.260
This is the difference between
the two, and what they're

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.650
showing you is that as you
study, your hippocampus got

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.980
thicker as you crammed
for your test.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.350
So will there be a day where
instead of having to give you

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.910
tests we could just measure
the thickness of your

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.910
hippocampus to know how much
you studied, and you could

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.520
just zoom in and out of a
scanner, I don't know.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.660
But one cool thing about it is
it's showing you that we can

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.950
see structural changes not just
on a giant scale from

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.990
when you're four to 21, but from
some number of months of

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.770
experience, we can see a
physical change in your brain.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.100
Now that's trivial for animal
researchers, they can show

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.410
amazing things in seconds, but
you see the human brain

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.740
physically changing.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.870
So let's take a look at another
one, slightly more

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.590
controlled, we'll look
at two more examples.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.850
London taxi cab drivers.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.650
If you've travelled in various
cities, and have gone in

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.370
various taxis, you may have
had better or worse

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.630
experiences whether the taxi
driver knows where he or she

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.720
is going exactly.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.120
London is famous for having a
very high code, taxi drivers

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.650
have to take big exams to get
their official taxi license,

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.980
they create a very
demanding thing.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.020
And when they ask this in the
hippocampus if you learn lots

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.315
of routes, if you know tons of
routes in London, what happens

00:21:16.315 --> 00:21:18.100
to the hippocampus as
it's memorizing all

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.170
these special routes?

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:23.180
And what they saw, that taxi
drivers had bigger hippocampi,

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.660
and the longer they drove,
the bigger it was.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.830
So is this a causal or

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.085
correlational source of evidence?

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.490
It's correlational right?

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.560
So let's start with this, they
have bigger hippocampi, and

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.870
now maybe that's simply
because, what?

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.300
Maybe somebody who has an
awesome hippocampus is ready

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.940
to go to be a taxi driver.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.630
Maybe they pass the test, and
the one who got lost all the

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.940
time, and was driving to the
wrong airport and stuff, small

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.080
hippocampus, never became
a taxi driver.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.290
So the size of the hippocampus
is the cause of your success,

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.660
not the consequence.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.560
Because the longer you drove,
the bigger it got, that kind

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.960
of goes with that.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.620
But you could do a causal
experiment this way.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.280
They taught people to juggle
three balls, they practiced

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.470
every day for three months.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.760
Three months juggling
every day.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.413
What you see in yellow are parts
of the brain-- that's a

00:22:15.413 --> 00:22:17.400
statistical map--

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.260
parts of the brain that
significantly got thicker in

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.295
three months of practice.

00:22:22.295 --> 00:22:24.730
So they could compare directly
before and after, it's a

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.050
causal experiment.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.730
And these are areas that are
involved in the visual motion,

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.190
and it makes sense that areas
involved in visual motion

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.140
would somehow change.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.490
But the fact that we can see
three months of experience

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.340
change the structure of your
brain, it's kind of remarkable

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.580
in they way that we can measure
and scientifically

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.760
scrutinize.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.550
You might be curious if you did
three months of this and

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.150
you were a pretty good juggler,
you're impressing

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.700
your friends at parties, your
brain scan is different.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.790
What do you think happened--

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.070
they followed these people
up-- after the juggling

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.150
requirements stopped?

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.490
They kind of stop, most of the
people, they were too busy.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.300
They would show off here and
there, but that was it.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.060
They measured their brain's
again about six months later,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.890
and this change was gone.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.210
It came in, and it went out
with the activity, it's

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.210
activity dependent.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.710
So depending on what you do,
you could think about every

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.090
activity you do-- mental and
physical that you do-- is

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.710
constantly slightly changing
your brain.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.440
And if you do a lot of it,
you're fundamentally changing

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.510
it like in these individuals.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.320
But if you stop doing it you
go right back to where you

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.460
were, because you're going to
be doing something else.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.210
And another fun measure that's
kind of beautiful and

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.110
intriguing is Diffusion
Tensor Imaging.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.020
Now every [INAUDIBLE] we talked
about so far has been

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.470
gray matter of the brain,
the neurons and then the

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:38.820
circuits they form.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.310
We're going to turn to white
matter, which is the

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:44.720
myelinated axons that are
the super conducting

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.750
highways of the brain.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.270
And what Diffusion Tensor
Imaging does, it shows you

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.100
something about the organization
of that white

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.360
matter, measuring directly the
movement of water at very,

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.850
very tiny distances.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.740
This is a cross-section of
a myelinated nerve fiber.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.170
Those are the fibers that are
covered with white matter that

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.550
have to go some distance.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.470
And the myelin protects the
quality and speed of that

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.310
signal through your brain.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.000
And you could see at the level
of, if you're a tiny, tiny

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.570
drop of water, or smaller than
that, this is a pretty big

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.670
bump in the road.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:21.770
So imagine you're a little drop
of water moving a little

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.530
bit, and you bump up against the
myelin, you go oh, can't

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.200
go that way, and you go
back this way, and

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.005
you go with the flow.

00:24:27.005 --> 00:24:30.180
You go parallel with a myelin,
it's hard to cross it at that

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.000
microscopic scale.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.360
But we can measure that movement
in areas where it's

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.290
highly constrained, and that's
a property of the water.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.980
Here cerebral spinal fluid,
things can go anywhere.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.970
Here's where there's a lot of
white matter, and the water

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.930
tends to flow along parallel
with the white matter, just

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.960
for physical reasons it
can't cross it over.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.530
And here for example, is a
statistical map comparing this

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.760
measure of white matter
organization between adults,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.780
who either in their childhood
had a diagnosis of dyslexia,

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.060
reading was difficult for
these individuals.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.370
Or people who typical reading
development, where you learned

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.440
to read and wasn't particularly
difficult.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.610
And you can see that in this
area around the Temporal

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.670
Parietal Cortex, there's a
significant difference.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.400
But we can do one more thing.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.540
These are reading scores this
way, this is the measure of

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.110
the white matter organization
from the

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:23.970
Diffusion Tensor Imaging.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.630
Each of these as an individual
person now.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.380
So the open dots are the people
who had typical reading

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.940
development.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.550
The filled dots are the people
who had poor development, and

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.600
you can see it's pretty
continuous.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.950
Even in the people with the open
circles who never had a

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.280
problem, the better they
read, the more the

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.930
organization is here.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.570
So this is not just the
difference between good and

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.040
bad readers, it's a difference
between really good readers,

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.710
and medium readers, and poor
readers, right, continuous.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.000
So now, cause or effect?

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.180
Were those of you who at three,
who had awesome myelin,

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.480
were you going, reading's
a snap.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.880
I love this stuff, where's
War and Peace, mom?

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.960
Or, were you like the jugglers,
and you were reading

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.210
a lot, and you were exercising
this part of the brain, and

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.240
altered its physical
structure.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.200
And the answer is
we don't know.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.080
How could we know?

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.330
How could we know?

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.400
If you were scientists and were
given a pot of money to

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.010
do this, how could you know?

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:30.670
Well--

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.679
yeah?

00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:36.170
AUDIENCE: Track the entire
lives of multiple people.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, do a
longitudinal study and start

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.190
like, before people read.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.950
And you could see is
it different then?

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:47.130
Are we born to be big readers,
or by being big readers do we

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.740
alter the architecture
our brain.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.510
What's the effort, and what's
the talent, or what's the

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.350
predisposition at birth, and
what's the time you put in

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.010
creating this part.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.500
We don't know that yet, but we
have a place to look at that.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.940
And then you can create these
kinds of beautiful pictures,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.240
and I'll say a word
about this.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.350
So this is an individual
person's white matter

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.910
organization.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.150
So we could take this picture
of you, or anybody you know

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.870
who wants to go in a scanner.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.450
And what's color coded here in
blue are fibers that are

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.690
running up or down, we can't
tell with the fibers which

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.110
direction they're going,
but we can tell other

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.850
orientations.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.150
Up and down, left and right in
red, up and down in blue, and

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.400
green is front to back.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.320
Pretty cool, huh?

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.146
I can tell you that I'll
say a word about this.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.000
Should we do that again?

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.180
I like it, but I work
in this area.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.210
This is fantastic, this is an
individual person's white

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.050
matter organization.

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.750
As information is flowing around
in your mind, here's

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.520
the paths that it's flowing
around in as you just do

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.790
anything that's interesting
in your feelings

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:02.440
or thoughts or anything.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.250
It's fantastic.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:08.840
I can tell you that the
algorithms that are used to

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.450
create these maps, there's
some debate

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.880
about the better ones.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.990
So the last steps of this are
a bit debated, and a bit

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.570
depending on how cool you are
as a visual engineer.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.310
But there's a lot of things
that's right about Diffusion

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:24.340
Tensor Imaging, there's
a lot of things that

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.590
are right about it.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.870
Function, so most of all we're
interested in structure, not

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:36.510
just for itself, but how is it
makes your mind do the things

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.490
you could do.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.290
And when we think about
different functional measures

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.930
that are available to
neuroscientists or

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.047
psychologists, we often think
in two dimensions, Spatial

00:28:44.047 --> 00:28:47.100
Resolution, and Temporal
Resolution.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.370
How precise are we where we are,
and what's the time scale

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.150
that we're measuring in,
milliseconds, are we averaging

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.460
over many seconds, many hours.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.020
We know mental operations,
roughly speaking, occur at the

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.640
millisecond level, or maybe
10 milliseconds.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.260
There's no answer to that, but
we know lots of things happen

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.020
that fast in the mind.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.410
So if you look at this here you
can see that, for example,

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.880
if you're in animal work,
looking at size, you can get

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.730
down to the Synapse
or the Dendrite.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.980
We can't touch that in humans,
we can't touch

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.660
that cellular stuff.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.010
And it's not until we get up
to here, which is like big

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.720
patches of the brain, that we
can state things about people.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.530
That's why it's always going
to be fundamental in

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.590
neuroscience to link the human
work to the animal work,

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.620
because we can't get to the
neurons or anything like that

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.210
in a person almost ever.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.900
That has to come from animal
work, where you can do

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.030
invasive work.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.630
So we have to look at
a pretty big patches

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:42.830
of the human brain.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.040
How about time?

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.950
Well, we can get down to
milliseconds in time in the

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:47.910
human brain.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:51.190
Functional things like PET and
MRI are here and in the order

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.850
of multiple seconds, I'll
come back to this.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.360
But you can see all these
things have strengths.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.690
Now you don't always want to be
down to a single synapse,

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.870
it's not clear that we would
understand much of the

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.500
organization of the brain at
the level of the synapse.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.510
There's things happening in the
synapse, but a thing like

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.650
knowledge, or love, or something
like that probably

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.240
we can't study at the level
of the synapse.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.590
Effectively, yet.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.290
Bigger units are probably
more interpretable.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.180
So here's a fun one, EEG's,
Electroencephalography.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.370
So they put on your head some
sort of a cap with electrodes,

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.760
and they measure changes in
electrical activity that are

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.070
being picked up through
the skull.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.860
And you're picking up huge
changes in hundreds of

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.510
thousands of neurons, but
you're able to do it

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.950
millisecond by millisecond
at the speed of thought.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.270
The same electrical signal for
EEG and ERP, that evoke

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:46.280
response potentials, with EEG
you just watch it over time.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.210
So you can see these different
rhythms that go with a person

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:53.870
in coma, or in deep sleep,
asleep, drowsy, relaxed.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.480
You can see these characteristic
rhythms that

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.190
people can measure.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:02.480
If you do an experiment, you can
time lock these moment by

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.140
moment to some stimulus or
task you give the person.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.800
So here we're going to time lock
these, and then you get a

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.470
thing like this that says,
here's a response, maybe the

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.220
first moment after I see a word,
a second moment after I

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.050
see a word or something
like that.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.430
So you can time lock
large electrical

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.890
responses in the brain.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.550
And you get some studies like
this, and we'll come back to

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.030
this, but here's a fun one
in language for example.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:30.270
You read a sentence like, It was
his first day at work, OK

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.850
that's the baseline condition in
purple, not a particularly

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.195
exciting sentence.

00:31:34.195 --> 00:31:35.730
Although, your first day at
work is actually pretty

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.140
interesting-- but to
read the sentence.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.090
How about this one: He spread
the warm bread with socks.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.130
You go, Socks?

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.280
I'm shocked, that makes
no sense at all.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.350
What happens as you read it,
here's in broken blue line,

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.670
you go wow, and that's
called the N400.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.730
But that's kind of cool, that's
400 milliseconds after

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.100
you saw that word you said, I
get it's socks but it doesn't

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.960
make sense.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.180
So you're violating semantics.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.920
And then they have to do
a control experiment.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.050
And a lot of psychology, in a
course like this, we can't

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:06.950
devote enough time to this.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.720
But I can tell you high quality
research in psychology

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.170
is high quality thoughtfulness
like in any other field.

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.580
You could say, well maybe it's
not the word "socks" that's

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.220
bothering you, maybe just
because it's odd, just like a

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.260
weirded out signal, it's
a weirded out signal.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.070
So they do this, She put on
her high-heeled shoes, but

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.970
they put shoes in big print
that you didn't expect.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.650
So now you're weirded out,
but it makes sense.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.540
So what happens in your
mind, you a very

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.320
different response here.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.700
So here the meaning is wrong,
here the size is wrong.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.950
And see you can read a person's
mind in this sense,

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.650
millisecond by millisecond as
they understand something like

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.420
a sentence.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.500
You can do it with babies,
which is pretty cute, and

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.410
incredibly exciting too.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:51.230
So we can measure to
the milliseconds.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.420
Lots of people can take doing
it, it's relatively

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.720
inexpensive.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.550
Why don't we just run
around and do that?

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.060
And we do that at MIT, and lots
of places do this too.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.000
Well, Spatial Resolution is
really problematic, we don't

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.230
know where in the brain
the signals are

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.070
really coming from.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:08.060
We know where the electrode
is on the head, but that's

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.330
picking up a lot of stuff below
it, we don't know where

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.010
the brain is coming from.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:14.050
The way I think about it a
little bit, imagine you went

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.000
to a football game, and you
were on the outside of the

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.410
stadium, and you heard big
cheering on the side that you

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.150
knew was MIT.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.270
You might think something good
happened to MIT, then you hear

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:25.340
big cheering on the side where
CalTech team is sitting, and

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.310
there's fans, it'd be
the usual Rose Bowl.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.755
You might figure something good
happened at CalTech, but

00:33:33.755 --> 00:33:35.510
you don't really know exactly
what happened, and exactly

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.380
where it happened.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.230
So we don't know where the
signals are coming from in a

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.560
very precise way.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.770
There's another method that's
sort of very intriguing too,

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.260
and we're just installing it
at MIT, and you could be

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.240
amongst the first generation
of participants, if you so

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.380
choose to be.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.330
This is called
Magnetoencephalography, active

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.230
neurons produce small
magnetic fields.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.630
You can use a superconducting
quantum device to measure this

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:01.210
tiny, tiny change to the
magnetic field, they're

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.400
secondary to the
neurons firing.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.390
These signals are problematic
to measure because they're

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:08.900
estimated to be 100 million
times smaller than the earth's

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.710
magnetic field.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.389
And all these measures we have
in human brain function, all

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:16.650
of them, the signal is terrible
compared to the

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.270
noise, it's terrible compared
to the noise.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.710
And MEG might be the worst,
there's a number of places

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.750
that installed MEG, and had to
take it out because the local

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.270
traffic on the road was too big
relative to the difference

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.620
between the earth's magnetic
field in the signal they get.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.920
Signal to noise is terrible in
every noninvasive human brain

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.250
measure we have.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:37.889
But you get something
beautiful.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:42.230
Now, any mental thought we have
of any interest of any

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:45.370
kind, we pretty much understand
to be the property

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.150
not of a single part of the
brain doing its thing, but a

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:52.210
remarkable concert, different
parts of your brain playing or

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.750
interacting with one another.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.920
It's a symphony orchestra doing
anything interesting in

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.180
the human mind, and MEG can
show that beautifully.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.770
So here's an individual's
structural MRI that's been

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:05.070
inflated, they've sort of blown
it out like a balloon so

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.400
it's sort of easy to look at.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.360
And what you're going to see now
from Dale &amp; Halgren in an

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.520
MEG measurement millisecond by
millisecond of what your brain

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.550
does, roughly speaking, when
you read a single word, OK

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.800
here we go.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.490
See, back and forth, back and
forth, and there's all this

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.050
interaction feeding forward from
when you see it, feeding

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.040
being backward from parts of
your brain that say, I think I

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.970
know what it is, let's
double check.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.040
Back and forth, back
and forth.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.080
Let me do it one more time,
because I think

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.920
it's just so cool.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.580
Anything interesting that your
brain does is an incredibly

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.070
complicated millisecond by
millisecond interaction

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.810
between large scale
brain networks.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.620
So here we go again, reading a
single word, arrives in the

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.340
back of the brain, front's
thinking about back, front,

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.210
back, front, back front.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:53.460
We read the word.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:59.280
It's just amazing, and MEG is
one of the better measures for

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.470
us to see this time based
way in which your mind

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.720
accomplishes things.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.070
The strengths are it has great
temporal resolution,

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.600
noninvasive, Spatial Resolution
is it maybe better

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.510
than EEG, or perhaps better, not
as good as a fMRI, we'll

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.470
come to that.

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.200
And it only can measure neurons
in the cortex that are

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.900
parallel to the skull, so we
can't see lots of things like

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.385
support local structures
like the hippocampus.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.410
So now we're moving to the
measures that you most often

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:32.080
see, but these other ones
all help us a lot.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.280
And they are all derived from
the following things.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.400
Sadly, for PET or fMRI, the most
widely used studies to

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.170
understand how your mind works,
we can't interrogate

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.650
the neurons to compute your
mind, we can't, they're off

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.050
bounds to us.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.810
The other measures you just
saw are based on neurons.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.690
What we have to do is we have to
look for gossipy neighbors,

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:54.440
that is the vasculature that
surrounds and supports the

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.500
neurons that compute the mind.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.470
And we know the neurons require
oxygen and glucose,

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.860
metabolically to do their
work, the cellular life.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.190
And the brain area's active,
there's increased blood flow,

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.900
and increased energy supplies
that come to that.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.790
So it's all the sort of
inference by the secondary

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:13.270
consequence of neurons
doing their business.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.310
So the brain is about 3 and 1/2
pounds, it's about 2% of

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.310
your total body mass.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:22.980
So it has a tenfold, 20% extra
demand of body oxygen, your

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.880
brain cries out for oxygen
at every moment.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.390
So 2% of your body, but 20%
of the oxygen demand.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:32.060
And it's so sensitive that only
10 minutes of loss of

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.260
oxygen can often cause
irreversible brain damage,

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.950
especially in structures
like the hippocampus.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:46.030
The first discovery that blood
changes that are going with

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.150
brain changes, blood changes
that are the sort of the

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:52.240
echoes, if you will, a secondary
consequence, is low

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.360
tech character current
machines.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.140
This is work from Angelo Mosso
in the late 1880's, and he saw

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.105
a patient who had a unusual sort
of malformation, so he

00:38:00.105 --> 00:38:02.950
had almost no skull here.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.970
And he put on it something that
measured the pressure

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:09.760
there, and he also measured--
and what's shown here in red

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:15.690
is this pressure as a control
thing, that's pretty clever--

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:19.890
pulses of blood in the forearm,
so those are in blue.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.850
That's the control, that's not
just blood everywhere.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:24.770
And what he did is, the guy's
still sitting there, nothing

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:28.070
happening, and he noticed that
when the church bells rang

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:33.660
nearby, boom, this device picked
up increased pressure

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.960
over this part of the head.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.530
That's pretty cool, it has to
be blood, it's not neurons,

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.260
OK, it's blood.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:43.560
But now he has the signature of
mental life in your brain,

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.520
the blood consequence
of a thought, which

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.970
is I hear the Church.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.850
They asked the guy, does it have
to be something that you

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.740
hear, he says, did you
make your prayers

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.060
today, your Ave Maria?

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.620
Again nothing happening
peripherally, but boom, as he

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.730
gives his answer, a change
in blood pressure there.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.800
Or do math problem, boom,
a change there.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.380
So all of the sudden, blood
changes of a part of the brain

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.120
become the witness to that part
of the brain supporting

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.110
the mental operations
to do that task.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:13.513
And here's a PET study, the
first weighted Positron

00:39:13.513 --> 00:39:16.400
Emission Tomography, which is
basically used to measure

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.280
local brain activity by looking
at the consequences of

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.590
photons disintegrating as
they're measured in this sort

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.090
of a device.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.860
And here's the way they use this
task to discover which

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.370
parts to map the neural
organization

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.040
of the human mind.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.140
So I need somebody who's willing
to do a task at their

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.460
seat, and it's just going to be
reading words, or coming up

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.560
with words.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.240
OK, thanks.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.330
Here you go, ready?

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:45.560
Look at that, in our field we
call that fixation, you're

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.330
just looking, OK,
just looking.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:48.720
Alright, good job.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.750
Ready for something else?

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:52.830
Alright, now just look
at these things,

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.260
OK, you see the words?

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.670
The technical word is reading.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.030
Alright, now imagine we did one
more thing with you-- and

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.130
actually if you were
in a PET scanner

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:00.940
here's what would happen.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.510
If in a PET scanner, you'd be
sitting down there like that,

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.070
there'd be a physician in their
lab coat like this.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:09.460
There'd be physicist in the
basement making up some sort

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.110
of a tracer they're going
to inject into you

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.330
every round of this.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.470
Because that's what they need to
sort of track this, and it

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:20.690
comes up an elevator, and people
take turns running down

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.180
the hall with it, because it has
a pretty short half-life.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.915
The shortness of its half-life
is what makes you able to do

00:40:25.915 --> 00:40:27.300
these multiple measures.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.200
This is a pretty big deal
process, and in fact the one

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.935
or two PET sessions I ever
attended, you would rotate who

00:40:32.935 --> 00:40:35.360
would run down the field with
the radioactive substance, so

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.490
you would share the radioactive
substance.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.540
So now you've done that, and
you feel like, I'm doing

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.050
pretty good.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:44.940
So now they come and
they say, are you

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:45.960
ready for another injection?

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.010
They have a catheter running
into your arm, and they inject

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.870
you again, here comes the
radioactive stuff, the oxygen.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.440
And now they ask you to read the
words aloud presented one

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.330
at a time, why don't you
just read aloud one

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:57.411
at a time, go ahead.

00:40:57.411 --> 00:40:59.616
AUDIENCE: Rose, cat,
apple, pen, plane.

00:40:59.616 --> 00:41:01.553
PROFESSOR: OK, and they say
thank you very much, and we're

00:41:01.553 --> 00:41:03.510
going to do one more injection
if that's OK with you, of

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.430
radioactive substance.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.070
And now we're going to ask you
to do one thing, and this is

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:11.490
harder, as you see each word
tell us a verb that describes

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:13.710
what you might do with that
object, or what a person might

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.110
do, so go ahead, for
rose tell us.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:19.519
AUDIENCE: Smell, pet,
eat, write, fly.

00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:20.670
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.490
Yeah, I can tell you that in the
experiment they present a

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.190
lot of these, and a lot of
subjects after while just go

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:29.800
use, use, use, use, hold,
hold, hold, hold.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.050
But you did a good job, OK.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.040
This is just looking at
something, this is looking at

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.900
a word, which is reading.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.890
Now don't forget, we're the only
species that ever read,

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:43.050
reading has been around in our
culture only for about 700

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:46.840
years on any scale, and reading
is an incredible thing

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.710
to work correctly.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.990
And you saw the whole brain
flicker to get it right.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:52.560
But now you're going to say
the word in the next

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.580
condition, so you're not just
looking at the word, but

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.030
you're also saying it.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.430
And now finally you're not only
saying a word and looking

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:00.270
at it, but you are thinking
about it to come up with

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.500
smell, or pet.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.150
So they say, what we're going
to do is we're going to do a

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:08.160
hierarchy of your mind, just
looking, reading, reading and

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.490
talking, reading and talking
and thinking.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.500
And by comparing those different
conditions, we'll

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.050
subtract them against each
other, and pull out the part

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.090
of your mind that sees a word,
that speaks a word, and that

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:20.790
thinks about a word,
and we'll separate

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.700
those out in the brain.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.340
So basically the subtraction
method.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.920
So when we compare looking at
fixation versus looking at

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.950
words, we'll see what part of
your brain discovers that it's

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:33.490
a word, knows how to read words,
looking at words versus

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:34.440
repeating them.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.490
We'll discover the basis of
speech, speaking a word versus

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:41.150
coming up with the verb,
thinking about stuff, their

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.970
meaning, and coming
up with an answer.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.930
So again the idea is if you're
saying something like pet for

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.910
the cat, you're doing
all these things.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.770
Or you might just be reading
it aloud, and

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.080
we'll subtract them.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.540
In both these conditions, here
you saw a word and read it,

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:06.010
here you saw a word and came
up and produced a verb, you

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.980
subtract these two and
you end up with a

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.320
statistical image like this.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.350
This is not a raw image of
blood, all these you ever see

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.200
those are statistics of the
areas that differed by some

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.540
statistical criterion between
one condition and another.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.890
They're all statistics, they're
not blood, or raw

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:24.780
blood, that underlies it, but
what you see is a statistic,

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.110
and here's the statistic.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.740
Now in both of these cases,
you saw the word.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.520
In this case you simply read it,
in this case you read it

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.110
in your head and you came
up with a verb.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:36.710
But why don't we see
anything back here?

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.550
Why don't we see the seeing of
the word, even though the

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:40.960
seeing occurred in
those conditions?

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.370
Why isn't it visible in
this brain picture?

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.750
Because it's been
subtracted out.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.130
So always in these brain imaging
experiments, for

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.570
reasons I'm about to tell you,
we almost always have to do

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:53.600
some kind of subtraction.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.590
And I'll tell you why, but that
subtraction is very big.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:00.040
Because what you subtract out,
that's the heart of the

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.060
experiment, and your decision
about what's a legitimate

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:03.850
subtraction.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.610
And the reason we have to
do it is this, look

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:07.330
at these two things.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.190
Here's one condition, and here's
the other condition.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.950
Do you see that they look
pretty similar?

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.450
Again, signal to noise.

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:18.700
Your brain is busy all the time,
now we ask you to do

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.300
something and see
the difference.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.820
And the difference is very tiny
by the way we measure it.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.860
It's not tiny mentally, it's
not tiny in terms of the

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.700
consequences for civilization
in the world.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.770
It's tiny because of the weird
way we have to measure it.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.760
I can tell you that if I've
put on an optimal

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.600
checkerboard, the
psychophysicists have said,

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.690
this turns on your
visual cortex.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:44.010
I'll get about a 3% to 5% change
in your brain signal.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:48.530
If you wave your arm, I can get
3% to 5% signal change in

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:49.870
your cortex here.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.400
If I ask you to do everything
in between seeing something

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.250
and moving your lips or hand,
everything about thought,

00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:00.690
emotion, memory, desire,
motivation, everything that's

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:03.650
big in our life will get
something like that one tenth

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.290
of 1% of the signal change.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:08.395
One tenth of 1% of the
signal change.

00:45:08.395 --> 00:45:11.420
Yeah, Tyler's like yeah, that
means you have to test a lot

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.660
of subjects, and work 40
years on your Ph.D.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.280
So we have to do that
subtraction, because if we

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.880
just take a picture of what's
going on in your head, it's so

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.200
much that we can't tell what's
going on at all.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.980
And if we have you do something
that's pretty big,

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.310
like seeing like a really
provocative picture, we'll

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:29.220
just get one tenth of 1%
of the signal change.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.380
So we have to do the subtraction
to have a hint.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.540
And then we do one other weird
thing, we don't have to but we

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.420
often do it.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.630
We want to average people to
make some general statement

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:40.060
about humanity, as far as we can
do it, based on the 10 MIT

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.510
students we test.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.030
So we scrunch everybody's
brain into common space,

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.540
everybody's brain's a little
bit different, like their

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.750
bodies are a little
bit different.

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:50.320
We scrunch everybody to line
them all up so we have a

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.820
common physical space.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.250
So by the time you see this
picture, it's a statistic on

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:57.000
an average of people in
most cases, but you

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.020
get an amazing story.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.810
Which up until these
pictures--

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:05.060
about the late 1980s, it was
unimaginable that you could go

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.390
inside a living person's brain,
and see what it is that

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:13.020
allows you to hear a word in
auditory cortex, to see a word

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:18.910
in visual cortex, to move your
mouth to speak, or to think,

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:21.820
what's the verb that goes
with that word?

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.800
Unimaginable at your--

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.900
OK, now I have to do the quick
math, but you'll help me out--

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.710
what year were you born in?

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.410
'82?

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:32.920
'92?

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.320
I know, at my age it
all blends. '92?

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.580
OK, so just a year or two before
you were born-- this

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.550
was 5 years before you were--
unimaginable that you could

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:42.750
see such a picture.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:44.830
When I was a graduate student at
Harvard, and the people at

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:46.370
Washington St. Louis
University--

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:47.600
who did the first of these--

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.930
did an incredible service
to the field.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:51.880
Here we saw, oh my gosh, it was
like landing on the moon.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.320
Going inside the human brain,
and knowing which part of the

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.500
brain endows us with
human capacities.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.600
Now, we can be appreciative
or we can be skeptical

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.600
scientists, and we can say this,
let's pick this one.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.820
Let's compare seeing a
word like "board,"

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:07.970
versus seeing a fixation.

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:11.610
We do that subtraction, and
that's seeing a word.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:15.200
Just by common sense, what's
wrong with this comparison?

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.460
It's OK it's not terrible.

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.419
How can you control it better?

00:47:20.419 --> 00:47:25.180
To understand what this part of
the brain is really doing?

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.426
I heard something?

00:47:28.426 --> 00:47:31.000
Well partly it's a meaningful
word, versus something that

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.390
doesn't mean anything
to a plus.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:35.460
But what else could you say
is different between them?

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.362
Yeah?

00:47:36.362 --> 00:47:37.346
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:37.346 --> 00:47:39.810
GUEST SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:43.100
PROFESSOR: In this case, oh my
gosh, yes, and I'll come back

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.960
to that, but let me not do
that one for the moment,

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.690
because that's a giant story
which I can't fit in today.

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:50.070
Yes your mind can be
all over the place.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:52.210
So that's definitely the case,
so that's a good one.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:52.700
Yeah?

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.972
GUEST SPEAKER: You could replace
the plus, which is

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.090
like really small,
with [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:58.882
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's perfect,
OK that's the way I

00:47:58.882 --> 00:48:01.480
was going-- the other one's
great too, two great comments.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.140
Yeah you could say like, maybe
this is a part of your brain

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:04.850
it goes with five things,
or something this

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:05.920
big versus this big.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.340
No you go, that's not so
interesting, the part of your

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.360
brain that looks at something
this big, versus this big.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.150
But that's just as legitimate
a conclusion here.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:16.590
How about this, five different
things, versus only this.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.400
There's a lot of different ways
in which you could say,

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.620
what is the mental operation
that I've discovered in the

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.730
human brain and mind, it all
comes down to the comparison.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:26.880
So here's what they did to
try to do a better job.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.080
They showed you a more
complicated thing that doesn't

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.000
mean anything.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.490
A bunch of letters that you
can't pronounce, a bunch of

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.330
letters that you can pronounce,
but it's not a real

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:41.190
word, and here's the
real world itself.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.130
So if you want to say, what do
you think this part of the

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:45.760
mind is doing?

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.160
What part the mind does this
part of the brain allow to

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.870
happen in humans, and only
humans on this planet?

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:54.150
And every word you ever read
only happens because this part

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:55.880
of the brain does
what it does.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.360
What is that part of
the brain doing?

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.090
Is it just simply responding
too complicated

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:01.372
things, five of them?

00:49:01.372 --> 00:49:04.260
No, not much, a little
bit, but not much.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.470
How about letters, letters are
pretty interesting, but there

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.760
can't be a word by English,
you can't pronounce this.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.270
Not too interested?

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.930
A word, a set of letters you've
never seen together

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:17.290
before, but you can pronounce
by the rules of English.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:18.710
Boom.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.870
That's what I do, says this
part of the brain,

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:22.360
that's what I do.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:25.080
I say, I see something, and it's
possibly a word and I can

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.780
say it by the rules
of English.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:27.900
And by the way, if it's
a word I've done

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.430
before, I do that too.

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:31.600
I'm pretty flexible, I can do
new words, I can do words I've

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.030
known before.

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:39.180
It matches what you see with
language, that's reading.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.870
Only our species can take our
visual system, and the

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:44.730
language you learn as a child,
and put them together, and

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:47.180
allow our civilization
to read.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:52.400
And this is a part of the brain
where those roads meet.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.570
And by the way, we talked about
local and global, the

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:56.470
forest and the trees.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.416
And consistent with what we
talked about the split brain

00:49:58.416 --> 00:50:00.932
patients, looking at global
stuff right hemisphere, if

00:50:00.932 --> 00:50:02.640
you're looking at local stuff,
left hemisphere.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.270
So we like it when the
information we have from

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:07.170
split-brain patients, or stroke
patients aligns with

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.210
healthy people doing a task
as they typically do.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:11.600
Because then we sort of believe
there's something

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.590
right about that.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:18.610
So PET, pretty good spatial
resolution, I mean, depends

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:19.750
what you mean by good.

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:22.860
My neuroscience colleagues
dismiss everything we ever do

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.310
as sort of pathetically
imprecise.

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:27.380
But 5 to 10 millimeters,
not as good as fMRI.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:32.160
The temporal resolution is very
poor we can only take one

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.560
picture that lasts about
a minute, and averages

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.770
everything across that.

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:40.280
You have to inject people with
radioactive stuff, and it's

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.120
correlational.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.880
But it has one other thing
that's really, really

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.020
interesting, Positron
Emission Tomography.

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.240
Because you're injecting a
radioactive label, you can

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.510
create different kinds of labels
that go to different

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:52.620
parts of the brain.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.830
So here's Parkinson's disease,
which involves damage the

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:57.840
Substantia nigra, and
the Basal Ganglia.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.770
Here's a healthy persons
Substantia nigra, and here's a

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:02.640
person with Parkinson's disease,
where these cells

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.210
have died away.

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:06.760
Typically, at least 80% of these
have to die before a

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:11.410
person shows Parkinson's disease
symptoms clinically.

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.200
Here's an injection of
radioactive stuff using PET

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.840
that binds to Dopamine
receiving neurons.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.210
And you can see that in the
living Parkinson's patient,

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.710
this tremendous reduction
in these

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.960
receptors waiting for Dopamine.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.040
In a living patient

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.410
specifically Dopamine receptors.

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:30.860
So that's a disease.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.550
Here's why video games are
taking over the world.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:34.160
Oh no, not yet.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.530
We can do one more thing.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.550
We can track the disease from a
typical person, to a person

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:41.680
with moderate Parkinson's
disease or severe.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.850
Within the disease, we
can see differences.

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:46.860
But here's why video games are
taking over the world, because

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.670
if we take a healthy person,
young adults, give them this

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:53.640
kind of Dopamine binding tracer,
and have them play a

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.680
video game, two things happen.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:59.150
A, the parts of your brain that
are involved in reward,

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.020
Dopamine, is the strongest
to reward

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.100
neurotransmitter that we know.

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:07.430
Things go crazy, and what this
graph is showing you is the

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:10.260
better you do, the more
rewarded you are.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.900
This is why you will go for the
next level, because to get

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.720
that dopamine fix, you
got to keep going.

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:20.210
And we think these reward
mechanisms underlie

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.330
everything, in many ways they
relate to everything.

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:26.890
Why do you do whatever you do,
because at some level, in some

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:28.910
way, you find it rewarding.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:33.070
And the data is very compelling
that way.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:36.570
The last method I'll talk about
is functional MRI, and

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:39.310
it's the one that's most
widely visible.

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:42.256
So you sit in a scanner, stimula
are presented to you

00:52:42.256 --> 00:52:43.360
to perform a task.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.700
We do a lot of stuff in our
lab with children, we show

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.640
them how the frog would do it.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.680
For those of you who've done a
functional MRI experiment,

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.280
because there were so many
hands that were put up.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.570
Do any of you want to say a
word about your experience

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:56.850
doing that?

00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:59.280
What was it like, easy,
huge fun, recommend,

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.200
no, not so much fun.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.720
It will vary a little bit.

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.970
We said noisy.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.174
Some people find it
claustrophobic.

00:53:12.174 --> 00:53:13.108
GUEST SPEAKER: I dont know, I
didn't really do anything.

00:53:13.108 --> 00:53:16.380
I just had to sit there for a
really long time and not move.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.030
PROFESSOR: Oh, so they didn't
ask you to do a task, maybe.

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:20.716
GUEST SPEAKER: Well, for
a big part of it, I

00:53:20.716 --> 00:53:21.890
was watching a movie.

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:25.840
PROFESSOR: So for the student
they were watching a movie not

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.242
doing anything,

00:53:27.242 --> 00:53:29.990
GUEST SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:31.640
PROFESSOR: You were doing
yes or no clicks.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.380
So that would be typical
functional MRI kind of

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.110
experiment, some of them are
more obnoxious, some are less,

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:40.000
some are funny, some
are not as funny.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.340
Any other experiences?

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:46.830
Was it comfortable, not so
comfortable, medium.

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.755
Anybody else want to share?

00:53:49.755 --> 00:53:50.530
No, OK.

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:51.780
OK.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.940
So how does this work?

00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.370
Functional MRI takes advantage
of MRI but it focuses on

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:03.260
hemoglobin, the stuff that
carries oxygen in your blood.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.920
And it rests on the fact that
after oxygen has been

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.060
extracted it's more sensitive
to the magnetic field than

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.470
oxygenated hemoglobin.

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.960
So it's like this.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:19.160
Here's basically capillaries and
veins, arteries and veins.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.050
And as you go through the
capillary bed, the smallest

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:25.400
vessels, neurons are extracting
oxygen to support

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.700
their physical life.

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:31.260
What happens when this part of
the brain gets active, is that

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.070
more oxygen is extracted to
support the active neurons.

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:40.140
So we call this BOLD effect,
blood oxygen level dependent.

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:43.560
So we're measuring the change in
blood, changes the ratio of

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:46.420
oxygenated to deoxygenated
hemoglobins, that changes the

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.430
magnetic field as
we measure it.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:51.100
And that's what we directly
measure, not the neurons.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.770
So if the neurons are using up
oxygen, why does the BOLD

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:57.570
signal increase, why does
this ratio go up?

00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:00.480
Because intuitively you'd
think it would go down,

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.940
because oxygen is being
extracted at a higher rate.

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.140
If you look at oxygen being
extracted, right after

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:13.440
something happens, 10
seconds, there's an

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.730
initial dip of oxygen.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:17.830
That's the neurons extracting
oxygen to replenish themselves

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:20.750
from their activity, their
activity has been to give your

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:23.490
mind its life.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:27.950
Then what happens is there's
this vast oversupply for much

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:30.180
longer time.

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.420
Intuitively, it's as if we
said it's so important to

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:35.730
metabolically support the
neurons that make up our

00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:39.580
minds, that if some areas
demanding a lot of blood, we

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:43.990
send over way too much extra
as soon as we can, from a

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:47.480
distance to make sure
everything's OK.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:51.720
And because our measurement is
so sad, we almost can never

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.720
measure this initial dip.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:58.470
We almost always measure the
sustained oversupply of oxygen

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.470
to that part of the brain.

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:04.040
So you could say it's such
a house of cards.

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.690
The oversupply of the blood
going to a part of the brain

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:10.840
changes the balance of
oxygenated to deoxygenated

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.950
hemoglobin that changes
the magnetic property.

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.440
And that's how we try to figure
out what that part of

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.950
the brain is doing
for your mind.

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:22.000
But it works pretty well
in some cases.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.820
Decent Spatial Resolution, no
injection, you can zoom in a

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.710
scanner and do a lot of
different things.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.500
Modest Temporal Resolution,
because it's not milliseconds,

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.960
it's always on the order of
seconds, that's correlational,

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.560
not causal.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.150
But you get some amazing
results, I'm just going to

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:40.300
present to you two or three.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.800
So here's one, a thing we're
very interested about humans

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.420
is empathy.

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:48.500
How much we understand and feel
other people's happiness,

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.200
or sadness, or pain.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.430
So the "observation or
imagination of another person

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:55.420
in a particular emotional state
automatically activates

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:58.660
a representation of that state
in the observer," empathy.

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:02.780
And how do we understand how
another person feels, and we

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:04.570
think that's a big thing
in how we relate to

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.680
one another as humans.

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:11.250
So Tania Singer did the
following experiment, we

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:12.280
talked about this
before a little

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.960
bit, embodied cognition.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:17.420
That we understand others out
there by the feelings

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.590
we know within us.

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:20.620
We don't know their feelings,
but we know our

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.470
feelings inside us.

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:25.390
So here's what she did, she
brought in pairs of people who

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:28.920
were friends, or romantic
partners.

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:33.650
And she either had them get
some pain, it was a shock,

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:38.090
within ethical boundaries, but
not pleasant, that's the pain.

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:41.780
Or, you got to watch through a
video camera, while you're

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:44.730
being imaged, your partner
getting the shock.

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:47.370
So think about somebody you
care about and think about

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.960
them getting something painful,
and how you would

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.490
feel at that moment.

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:54.330
And they asked in the brain,
what's similar and dissimilar,

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:56.940
and we'll focus on what's
similar right now, between

00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.250
feeling pain yourself, and
observing pain in somebody you

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:05.140
care about, emphasizing with the
pain you see them having.

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.900
And what they found is two
areas, something of an

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.270
Anterior Cingulate, and
something in the Insula, which

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:13.500
we talked about before, where
there was a lot of overlap.

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:17.110
So this phrase, I'm feeling your
pain, in your brain when

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:20.800
you feel for somebody else's
pain in this physical sense,

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.910
you turn on some of the same
brain areas as when you feel

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:25.660
physical pain directly.

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.690
It's as if the basis to imagine
another person's

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:31.290
feelings is the feelings you
know so well yourself.

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:33.600
And this is literally shown
now by the brain imaging.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.430
It could've been a story, a
metaphor, an argument, this is

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:40.350
scientific evidence that
supports that likelihood.

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:43.970
So we're going to expend it
in a slightly fun way.

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:46.970
There's been a lot of study in
neuroeconomics thinking about

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:50.120
how we think about, for example,
things like trust.

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.210
So one game, and there's a
number of them, is called the

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:53.000
ultimatum game.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.260
And many people probably
know this, but let me

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.520
remind you of this.

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.900
This version of it has
two players, a

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.520
proposer, and a responder.

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.210
And what they do is they give
to proposer a certain amount

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:11.450
of money, and the proposer is
allowed to make an offer to

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:13.500
the responder.

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:17.990
If the responder says, No,
nobody gets any money.

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:20.620
Usually people offered about
50%, so let's make this

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.050
concrete just for a moment.

00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:24.620
Can I pick you for a second?

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.870
You can decline.

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:34.080
Imagine if Tyler came over to
me and give me $10, and I

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:37.710
said, how would you feel if I
gave you five and I kept five.

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:39.400
What do you think?

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.240
Might you go for It?

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.010
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, sure.

00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:43.620
PROFESSOR: I mean, you go, I'm
$5 dollars ahead, you're $5

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:47.440
ahead, Tyler won't eat this
month because graduate student

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.480
stipends are modest, but it's
a zero sum game in the end.

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:57.270
So now Tyler comes over hands
me 10 more dollars, and I

00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:59.300
offer you one.

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.950
What's your first feeling
assuming that I wasn't your

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.200
teacher grading you?

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:08.660
He saw me get ten,
I say here's one.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.972
What's your feeling?

01:00:09.972 --> 01:00:11.780
Think about it just for--

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.136
GUEST SPEAKER: You'd feel
kind of cheated.

01:00:13.136 --> 01:00:14.040
PROFESSOR: --yeah.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.490
You don't have to, by purely
economic perspective, would

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.690
you be ahead by taking
that dollar?

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:21.530
Yeah.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.140
A dollar's a dollar, $2
is $2, but people

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.430
have a sense of fairness.

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:32.410
Even to their own detriment,
if you offer $2 and lower.

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:35.990
Even knowing that you're just
ruining $1 or two you would've

01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:38.630
gotten for nothing, except
saying yes, people half the

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:40.500
time will say no.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.540
It's like, you are so unfair--

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:45.210
you were saying to me, I would
never say this to you-- you

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:47.960
are so unfair, that we're going
to take us both down,

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.750
rather than you have the
pleasure of the $8.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.620
OK It's so unfair,
that my sense

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.860
of fairness is disturbed.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.010
It's an interesting way to
think about it, imagine a

01:00:57.010 --> 01:01:00.215
friend of yours is handed $10,
and they offer you half, and

01:01:00.215 --> 01:01:02.810
if you say no, nobody
gets anything, so

01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:05.210
it's a trust game.

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:07.310
They had the people in the
scanner playing this game with

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:09.490
two people they saw on
a video monitor.

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:11.930
The two people they're playing
with are set up.

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:13.690
The person in the scanner is
the real participant, the

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:16.490
people out there they see,
are confederates,

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:17.700
they're play actors.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.890
And one is a fair person, here's
$5, thank you, here's

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:22.430
$5, thank you.

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:26.160
Here's $6, oh, you're awesome,
we can get along, And then

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.450
there's an unfair player,
here's $1.

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:31.300
And you go, why is
this guy a jerk?

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.210
How about $2?

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:36.670
And after a while, you go the
fair player was very decent,

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:38.070
this unfair player--

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:40.450
who you believe is part of the
experiment, but is a set up--

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:42.310
and you're just thinking, why
is this person such a jerk?

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:45.300
They're constantly getting $10,
and constantly giving me

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.380
one or two.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.630
No, no, no thank you.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.870
Now, you get a shock, and you
see these two strangers, one

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:58.210
of whom was a wonderful, fair
player, and one of whom was an

01:01:58.210 --> 01:01:59.780
absurdly unfair player.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.350
You see them get a shock.

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:04.300
And they had both men and women
in the scanner watching

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.220
these things happen.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:07.450
And here's what happened,
and it's kind of

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:09.280
funny, but you know.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.830
For the women they had overlap
again between the parts of the

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.710
brain to turn on in here in the
insula, when they got a

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:19.240
shock, and when either the fair
player got a shock, or

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.350
the unfair player.

01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:23.150
They felt bad for both
by this measure.

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:25.840
Look at the men in the study.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.730
I feel bad if the fair guy gets
it, but this part of the

01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:31.950
brain's like, yeah, give
it to 'em, can

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:35.370
you push up the voltage?

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:37.590
It just came out this way,
whether it would work that way

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:40.930
under all circumstances, all
ages, all societies, other

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:42.250
groups of men and women,
don't know.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:45.610
But in this sample in
the United Kingdom,

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:49.050
the men had no empathy.

01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:51.480
It's worse than that, it's
worse than they had no

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.520
empathy, let me show you this.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.940
If they asked to indicate their

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.020
desire for revenge against--

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.390
this is a behavioral response--
their desire for

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:03.370
revenge against the
bad player.

01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:06.390
I don't think they pursued the
unfair player down the street,

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:07.760
but just that feeling.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.550
And the women said, a little
bit, the men said yes, if only

01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.550
I could take down this person,
that would be great.

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:15.160
And here's the amazing thing,
we'll come back to the

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.520
structure called a nucleus
accumbens.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.450
It sits in the bottom of
the Basal Ganglia.

01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:22.590
It's the structure that in the
human brain is most identified

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.675
with reward and pleasure, most
identified with reward and

01:03:25.675 --> 01:03:27.540
pleasure by fMRI imaging.

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.280
Look at the nucleus
accumbens when the

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.930
unfair player gets zapped.

01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:37.770
The women, nothing much, the
men boom, big reward.

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.380
Revenge is rewarding
in their brain.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:44.260
No sympathy, and lots of revenge
satisfaction for the

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.260
unfair player.

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.870
Now you can decide on your own
life who this applies to or

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:50.880
not, but it's sort
of fun to explore

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.680
these different things.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.140
How we form ideas about empathy,
trust, whether they

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:57.490
are in a society
we grow up in.

01:03:57.490 --> 01:04:00.120
Somewhat different on average
men and women, huge ranges

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.840
within men huge ranges
within women.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.530
So it's a sort of fun
thing to explore.

01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:07.540
Let me end with something that's
much more difficult and

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:10.050
disturbing, but another place
where imaging is giving us

01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:14.260
insights that you could not
imagined having some time ago.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.760
So this is a very difficult
case, I don't know if any of

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.370
you gone through it, I don't
wish it for you.

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:21.220
Some of you probably have, and
many of you will at sometime

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.930
in your life, when you have to
make an end of life decision.

01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:30.380
And amongst the most famous of
these cases was Terry Schiavo.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.990
Now I don't know that name even
rings a bell for you, but

01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:36.670
it got very, very famous amongst
these kinds of cases.

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:39.260
So she had a cardiac arrest,
she had took a lot of diet

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.700
pills, and that may
have contributed.

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.820
In February 25, 1990, she went
into a coma, and then a

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:44.750
vegetative state.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.860
So a vegetative state is when
a person seems to be kind of

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.430
awake, but when you talk with
them, they're not very aware,

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:51.990
they're not responsive, they're
not noticing, they're

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.270
not talking.

01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:54.230
But their eyes are open, and
they're awake, their eyes are

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:57.040
not closed, so that's
what she is.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.650
And they put in her a feeding
tube, because without that she

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:04.580
wouldn't live, she couldn't
eat and feed herself.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.270
It was a heartbreaking
difference of opinion between

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.510
her husband and her parents.

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:13.460
Her husband petitioned some
years later, actually eight

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.680
years later, to remove
the feeding tube and

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.330
let her pass away.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.750
The parents opposed that, they
said that's not her wishes,

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.730
she would want to keep on going
with the feeding tube.

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:23.620
The husband said no, I don't
believe that's her wishes.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.950
So you have this very tragic
confrontation between the

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:29.350
parents who loved her, and the
husband who presumably loved

01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:33.270
her having different ideas about
what to do with her,

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:35.440
whether to end her
life or not.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.470
So finally her tube was removed,
but then the parents

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:40.770
went to court, and a judge
reversed it, and they

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:41.820
put the tube back.

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:45.850
She became, sadly, kind of
back and forth, living

01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:48.220
nonliving, on judicial
decisions.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.630
Her case became particularly
famous, for a bunch of

01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:55.290
reasons, and it went back and
forth from court, to court.

01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:58.440
Moving up in the state courts,
and there were several US

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.590
Supreme Court decisions about
whether to remove the tube, or

01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:03.980
keep the tube in.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.520
And it's a tragic thing, it's
a tragic choice between the

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.860
parents and the husband.

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:10.170
It got to the US Congress,
in the US Senate.

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:14.840
President Bush signed a bill
to keep her alive.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:18.380
Everybody got involved, with
various opinions, finally the

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:21.520
Supreme Court made a series
of decisions.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.680
It was disconnected in
2005, and she died in

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.200
March 31 of that year.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.450
So tragic difficult decision,
and a tragic family situation

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.180
that became kind
of a political,

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.260
and judicial football.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.610
So what's going on in the mind
of somebody like this, and how

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.215
could we even begin to interpret
it for a person who

01:06:37.215 --> 01:06:40.620
can't speak for themselves
and can't respond.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:41.760
So let me tell you about
a different case, we

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.790
don't know her case.

01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:48.640
So, again a vegetative state is
one where you appear to be

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.100
awake, but there's no
sign of awareness.

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.790
Eyes are open, but the person's
not talking or

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.300
responding to anything
in their environment.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.700
So here's a different woman, 23
years old, in 2005 she had

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.460
a road traffic accident, severe
traumatic brain injury.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:02.120
Five months later she's
un-responsive, but she has

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.970
preserved sleep-wake, like
she's waking up going to

01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:04.930
sleep, waking up
going to sleep.

01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:09.650
Eyes open, but un-responsive
in every other way.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:12.810
They put her into an fMRI
scanner, as well as healthy

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:15.550
comparison people, and
they have them do to

01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:19.060
mental imagery tasks.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.130
they read instructions to her.

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:24.940
But you go into scanner, and
you're told to imagine two

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.300
different things.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.120
Playing tennis, so imagine in
your mind's eye you playing

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.040
tennis for a moment,
imagine that.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.880
Or imagine visiting all the
rooms of your house starting

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.790
with your front door, in the
house that you are living in

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:38.930
now, or where you grew up.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.870
Imagine those two things
in your mind.

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:42.820
First of all, just a pure
cognitive neuroscience level,

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:45.250
and we'll come back to that,
imagination is a really

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:46.480
interesting thing.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.290
And it turns out when we imagine
things, again we use

01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:52.340
the parts of our brain that
does them, imagination is

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.820
perception run backwards.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.700
We can see imagination
in the human brain.

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.680
And depending on what you're
imagining, you use the same

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.570
systems that you see with.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:02.610
If you imagine something you're
looking at, it will

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:04.120
turn on your visual system,
it's even more

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.590
specific than that.

01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:08.500
So let's first look at what
happens with the controls.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.810
When they imagine they're
playing tennis, they turn on

01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:14.010
the supplementary motor area,
that's a part of your brain

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:16.960
that plans your physical
movements.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.830
You're not moving, but you're
thinking about it, this is

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.640
imagination of movement.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.120
When you plan a movement.,
you turn that on.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.819
When you go around your house,
you turn on spatial areas that

01:08:26.819 --> 01:08:30.529
are in the parahippocampal
cortex, and similar areas,

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:32.710
parietal cortex, and
parahippocampal cortex.

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:35.080
They're turned on if we show
you a movie where you're

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.189
moving around in spaces.

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:39.479
If you see spaces, you turn
those on, if you imagine

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:40.439
spaces, you turn them on.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:44.229
So imagination in the brain is
perception run backwards, or

01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:47.640
physical action run backwards,
you're not actually doing it.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.050
But look at this patient who
got in the scanner, who was

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:53.910
non responsive, you read her the
instructions, and see what

01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:56.500
she does, and look
at her brain.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.859
Asked to imagine tennis,
asked to imagine the

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:01.270
rooms in her house.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.920
It looks just like that.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.569
What does that mean, just
in a common sense,

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:07.260
what does that mean?

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:10.319
Did she understand the
instruction, at some level

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:14.279
yes, she wouldn't turn on those
parts of the brain if

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:18.335
she didn't understand the
instruction, she imagines the

01:09:18.335 --> 01:09:20.950
thing you ask her to instruct.

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:22.340
So this guy on the front page
of the New York Times said

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:25.310
fMRI could tell you the internal
mental life of a

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:27.609
person could no longer
speak, or communicate

01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:29.470
with any other way.

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:33.270
Now it's turned out since then,
that when they put in

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:35.490
other patients into the scanner,
most of them don't

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:37.170
show this pattern.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:40.830
So it's not that every patient
in a vegetative state this is

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:43.149
full of mental life
like this person.

01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:45.359
And a deeper way, we don't
really understand what this

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:46.740
mental life is like.

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:49.422
We don't know whether she
simply understands some

01:09:49.422 --> 01:09:51.899
things, but doesn't have
feelings, or plans, or

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:53.830
desires, or whether
she has those too.

01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:56.860
We don't understand really the
full range of mental life, but

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.950
we know that she can understand
an instruction, and

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:01.760
her brain follows
through with it.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.480
Most patients, it turns out,
don't look like that in

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.850
vegetative states.

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:08.840
So again, brain imaging has
taken us inside the mind of

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.120
somebody who cannot communicate
for themselves and

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.060
let us say something about
what it is that's

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.340
going on in that mind.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.800
In conclusion, we've talked
about different ways of

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.680
learning about the brain,
different methods to record

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.920
structure and function that
vary in their temporal and

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.280
spatial acuity.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.480
And incredibly different ways in
which we can understand the

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.190
organization in time and space
of how the brain supports the

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:32.440
human mind.
