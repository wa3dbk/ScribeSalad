00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.660
PROFESSOR: I've prepared
some slides, of course,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.820
but I don't know, please
interrupt at any time

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.230
and ask questions, OK?

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.370
I've sort of got a big panorama
of things to talk about.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.110
It's basically impossible
to cover everything, OK?

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.140
I mean, basically I
advertise this talk

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.830
as an outlook for the
future, and of course, that's

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.710
too broad.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.300
So I've picked a
few things which

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.100
are of special interest
to me, and what

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.930
they are are the possible
pathways to nuclear war.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.500
Now, as you know, what
I talk about often

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.940
is in comparing the danger
to the planet, and of course,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.160
its population, of climate
change and nuclear war.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.290
So climate change is just--
I think the probability is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.330
pretty close to 100%.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.070
I don't know how to quantify
it, but it's fairly certain

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.730
that we are into an
era of global warming

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.860
and its consequences.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.960
And this is a slow,
steady thing in terms

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.153
of probability of occurrence
with all its ramifications.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.670
Nuclear war is much
easier to avoid,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.419
but if it happens-- and
of course, every day

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.890
the probability is very low.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.030
That's what I call the
probability structure.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.190
So the probability of a nuclear
war any specific day is low.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.050
The cumulative probability
is higher, of course.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.520
And if that event occurs,
it's catastrophic.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.360
So what happens is the
destruction just starts in.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.690
The destruction, of course,
is local in the place

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.240
where the weapon blows up.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.660
The destruction, it depends
how many bombs go off

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.210
and how much soot
goes into the air,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.670
but we could have
global consequences

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.450
if there are enough of them.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.010
A so-called nuclear winter.

00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:06.770
So having said that, I
just want to talk about--

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.240
and this is the fear, of course.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.250
And that's what keeps some of
us worrying about this problem

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.040
and working on it.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.750
So basically I want to talk
about the possible pathways

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.450
to nuclear war.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.680
I'll talk a little bit
about proliferation

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.630
and the
Non-Proliferation Treaty.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.380
I'll say just a few words
about the possibility

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.205
of nuclear weapons abolition.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.460
I'll talk a wee bit about
Obama's record and the outlook.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.570
That's a pretty
ambitious agenda.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.470
There are endless debates about
the utility of nuclear weapons.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.980
Some people are at
least pro having them.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.620
Not using them, but having
them, because, of course,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.080
they were pro in the one
case that they were used,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.025
and of course, we used them
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.300
One group of people
says that actually saved

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.470
lives because the war ended
more quicker that way.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.830
I think that's highly
debatable, but it's

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.360
a point of view which is held.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.880
So it actually saved casualties
and it prevented World War III.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.230
These are some of the arguments.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.010
I'm not trying to
give all of them,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.960
but these are arguments that
you can find in the literature.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.770
And you can find books, and
this just goes back and forth.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.130
And of course, the
counter argument

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.770
was that the use of
atomic weapons in Japan

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.755
was not necessary.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.130
What was really
necessary was to agree

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.920
that the Emperor could
stay on, and that

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.200
turned out to be the
key that people argue.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.540
And certainly almost
everyone agrees

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.040
that the use of the
second bomb in Nagasaki

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.390
was something that should
not have been done.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.060
I think there's much
more agreement to that.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.100
There are books that
this use was actually

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.805
the first step of the Cold War.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.370
Of course, many
Japanese civilians

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.514
were killed, several
hundred thousand,

00:05:54.514 --> 00:05:56.720
and two cities were destroyed.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.810
On the other hand, we destroyed
almost all the major cities

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.860
in Japan by
conventional weapons.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.030
And of course, Japan did not
have an unblemished record

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.260
in Korea and China and so forth.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.840
I'm not going to go into
that, but the moral dimensions

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.145
of World War II are
pretty horrible.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.230
I'll stop there.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.720
The inhibition about
killing civilians

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.810
pretty much disappeared
in World War I

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.400
and was just totally ignored
in World War II, I would say.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.890
And in the post-war
era, the argument

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.760
is that you didn't
need nuclear weapons

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.930
to prevent a war between the
United States and the Soviet

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.720
Union.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.665
I pretty much think
that's the case myself.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.910
So here are the questions.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.520
There have been no nuclear
wars since the first two

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.400
weapons were used.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.350
Of course, there have
been many explosions,

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.310
but they were tests.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.920
So was that deterrence?

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.200
There's a theory
about nuclear taboo

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.200
because they're
morally so awful.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.790
I'm a bit skeptical,
but it's a theory

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.810
that's out there by an
important Yale sociologist.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.330
Is it luck, other
reasons, and so forth.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.240
So many of us-- well, I'll
give you some of my conclusions

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.930
at the end, but the
crucial question

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.170
is does the possession
of nuclear weapons

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.520
make a country more secure?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.050
You heard this in
the case of Ukraine

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.770
when the Russians took the
Crimean, when they basically

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.630
have their stealth invasion
of the Ukraine, which

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:08.280
is going on as we speak.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.730
Would a Ukrainian nuclear
weapon deter them?

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:22.430
And when the Soviet Union
broke up in the end of 1991,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.070
there was a lot of discussion
about what would happen

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.000
to all the nuclear weapons.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.650
They were mostly in Russia,
Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.860
And we managed to
persuade the Ukrainians--

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.720
they were the toughest--
and the Kazakhs

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.060
to give all those
weapons to Russia.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.540
But in fact, one of the
things-- and there's

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.180
a lot of history here-- but
one of the best articles

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.200
that I've read, and I
think it's obviously true,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.650
states that in fact the Ukraine
and Kazakhstan never really

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.690
owned those weapons.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.060
They were really owned
by the Soviet Union.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.620
The Ukrainian army was
not prepared to take them

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.880
in any way.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.320
They really didn't have an army.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.460
They hardly have an army now,
20 years later or something.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:31.210
So there's no realistic
way that the Ukrainians

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.410
had a nuclear weapon
that could be used.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.810
They had possession
of nuclear weapons,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.980
but not the actual
ability to use them.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.110
So it's a very funny thing.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.410
It's a very special case,
and it's a very funny thing.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.195
But that argument is heard.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.450
I would say more important,
or at least as important,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.620
is is the present
situation stable?

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.440
This is a key question.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.430
Many people doubt it
that our good fortune

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:14.490
in not having any nuclear
exchanges since 1945

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.600
is purely deterrence.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.000
if there isn't an element of
luck or other issues involved.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.830
And each specific
case is different.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.260
So it's hard to generalize.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.450
I mean, one of the issues,
one of the differences

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.990
between physics
and arms control,

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:41.280
is how the lack
in arms control is

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.640
the lack, really, of science.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.690
How much more difficult the
situation is to evaluate.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.890
And of course, now
with relationships

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.010
between the United
States and Russian,

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:06.290
in fact, the whole west and
Russia at a low point, probably

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:11.370
a few decade old low point,
the future of arms control

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:16.580
seems bleak at this
moment, I have to say.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.600
It's hard to maintain optimism.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.970
And finally there's
this perennial question

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.110
about abolishing
nuclear weapons, which

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.850
is certainly more and more
remote as time goes on.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.010
But I think as
academics we should

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:37.150
think about it, because these
are very important issues.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.510
So we should think long-range
is what I'm saying.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.450
It's not going to happen
quickly, obviously.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.170
If at all.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.226
But is it desirable?

00:11:48.226 --> 00:11:49.600
There are two
separate questions.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.830
Is it desirable and
is it going to happen.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:03.040
So immediately after the
development of the atomic bomb,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.250
there were intense discussions
inside of the Manhattan Project

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.630
before the public knew about it.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:16.100
And there was this
famous Franck Report,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:21.010
and the conclusions of the
Franck Report are here.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.270
Use the bomb for a
demonstration, not on cities.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.020
Share the secret.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.580
The secret-- not necessary
the details of how to make it.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.220
I don't think anyone
ever proposed that.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.240
What's meant here is share
the secret of its existence

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.620
before its use.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.910
That's what they're
talking about.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:48.810
Because the use without notice,
particularly without notice

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:53.290
to the Soviet
Union, would ensure

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.310
the start of a war, a Cold
War, and a nuclear arms race.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:02.280
And that's exactly what
the scientists predicted.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.400
These were very
sophisticated people.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.670
Franck was a Nobel
Laureate from Germany

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.040
who escaped from Hitler.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.210
And there were many other
things that happened.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.110
The scientists banded together.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.540
They formed the Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists,

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.520
the Federation of Atomic
Scientists, which still goes on

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.600
although it's not
as strong as it was.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:40.155
And they developed this
Acheson-Lilienthal plan,

00:13:40.155 --> 00:13:43.530
in which Oppenheimer
played a major role.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.950
And it ended up as the
Baruch plan, which was not

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:52.960
really what was proposed, and
it was turned down immediately

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.110
by the Soviet Union
for various reasons.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.430
I can go into them, but I won't.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:09.480
So the era of possible
arms control in 1945,

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:18.260
1946, collapsed in the beginning
of the Cold War period.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:24.860
And what the scientists
feared the most happened.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.940
And the other thing
is-- and you hear this

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.240
from the people who
first developed the bomb

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.030
and then worked as actively
as they could against it,

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.910
and many of them were at MIT.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.100
Some of the names
you know very well.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.710
Victor Weisskopf.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.840
There was Hans
Bethe from Cornell.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.060
And there was just a
whole group of people,

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.290
very prominent scientists.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:58.720
And Hans Bethe-- both Viki
Weisskopf and Hans Bethe

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.490
told me personally, but they
said it many times in public,

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.730
that when we realized
in about 1946

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.760
that there was no agreement
was going to happen,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.580
we asked ourselves, what is the
worst thing that could happen?

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.880
And they said, we would
build a hundred weapons.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.950
100.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.080
And the Russians would
build 100 weapons.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.160
And then we would face each
other down with 100 weapons.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.590
That was the worst these
sophisticated, bright men could

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:39.540
imagine in 1946.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.400
So what did people expect?

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.740
First, the atomic
scientists, they

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.970
thought that the nuclear
weapon was so horrible

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.200
it would change the
behavior of mankind.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.880
And politicians like
Churchill and Roosevelt

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.870
believed that this
powerful weapon

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.990
would allow England
and the United States,

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:11.760
with their monopoly,
to be able to say

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.395
the way the world evolved.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.100
So both sides were wrong.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.130
Typical.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:29.170
So the influence that it had
has been reasonably small.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.350
We never got the Russians
to agree to almost anything

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.680
we wanted them to do.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.500
For example, they took
over Eastern Europe.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.600
We hated that.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.560
They did it.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.220
Et cetera.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.230
You know, it just
goes on and on.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.630
The Communists took China.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.665
We hated that.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:54.840
The list of things-- I just
mentioned a few major ones.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.870
So that's what I mean by
its coercive influence.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:02.390
Its possession became a status
symbol almost right away.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.970
But there is some
deterrence in it.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.700
Deterrence isn't
completely useless.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.960
Deterrence and abhorrence,
a combination of the two

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.710
of them I think,
works to some extent.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.170
So there's been a non-use.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.450
Now, I want you to
look at this graph.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:29.470
This is the buildup of
nuclear weapons between us

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.790
and the Soviet Union.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.115
And you notice this scale?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.550
5,000, 10,000.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.320
100 is down here.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.430
The Soviet Union blew
up their first bomb

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:54.720
four years after we
did, as predicted.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.450
Not only was it predicted
that they would get the bomb,

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.310
but that it would take
them three to five years.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.290
That was the number that was
given by the atomic scientists.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.510
And it was hotly disputed
in Washington, but so what.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.570
And again, we built up
to astronomical numbers.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.410
Tens of thousands of weapons.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.070
And finally we
have a slow decline

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.300
through nuclear arms
control agreements

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.810
and through terrifying events,
like the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.560
And the spirit of
that build up is,

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.760
I think, exemplified
in this great cartoon,

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.131
which you can read for yourself,
from the middle of the Cold

00:18:43.131 --> 00:18:43.630
War.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.290
And I think this says the story.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.050
AUDIENCE: Is that
the only reason?

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.025
PROFESSOR: Fear.

00:18:52.025 --> 00:18:52.500
AUDIENCE: Fear is
the only reason?

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.780
PROFESSOR: Fear.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.270
Well, I mean, they developed
all kinds of fancy strategies,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.550
but at the heart of it was fear.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:05.790
Just plain fear of a
devastating first strike.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.670
And then you had to build up
counterforce capabilities,

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.030
be able to absorb
the first strike,

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.970
and able to destroy the
enemy after the first strike.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:23.870
But the astronomical
number was mad.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.450
And it was called MAD,
Mutual Assured Destruction.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.330
It was literally called MAD.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.290
Those of us looking
from the outside--

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.200
but we weren't really
on the outside,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.130
because we would have been the
victims-- thought it was mad.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:45.030
But you know, logic
is in a certain sense,

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.600
irrelevant in this situation.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:55.220
I mean, there's such a
grip of fear on both sides.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.250
And it's really true.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.270
I sat through the
Cuban Missile Crisis

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.140
personally with a
dedicated Russian

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.840
Communist who had actually
come to work in my laboratory.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.980
It was a very
interesting experience.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.130
He thought it was all the
fault of the United States.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.700
Most of the people
thought it was

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.860
the fault of the Soviet Union.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.830
Most of the people here.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:29.870
But I thought they were
both at fault. You know,

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.960
I thought-- not that they
were equally nice people,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.320
but that they were just
operating from too much fear.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.400
So they overdid it.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.640
You know, this business
of a hundred weapons.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.840
I often ask students in class
how many weapons are enough,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.210
and nobody knows how to
answer that question.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.850
But then I say,
well, how many cities

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.190
are you willing to give up?

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.120
You now, in the case of
the Russians, is it Moscow?

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.730
Leningrad?

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.630
That's two cities.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.430
And there's a famous exchange
between Jerome Wiesner, who

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:09.570
was ex-president of
MIT, and also a science

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.860
adviser the Kennedy, with
Gorbachev where he asked them

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.060
exactly this question.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.540
And Gorbachev was just amazed.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:25.740
So well, there you go.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.440
So I think it's fear
and distrust, of course.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.180
Fear and distrust,
they go together.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.590
And that's very important.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.890
I just want to point out that
one of our nuclear submarines--

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.460
this is the maximum
loading, by the way.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.660
They're loaded a little less
now, but it doesn't matter.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.170
I don't change this slide.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:54.450
But basically they have 100
and 300 kiloton warheads.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:59.320
So in order of magnitude,
larger than the Hiroshima weapon

00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.935
on Nagasaki.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:07.570
And each submarine has a
maximum loading, it should say,

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.680
of 96 warheads.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.090
They're independently targeted.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.870
You can destroy 96 targets.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:21.670
After firing, it takes 10 or
15 minutes to reach Russia.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:26.700
So you could-- it's
kind of staggering.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.640
So the total explosive
power is three times that

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.680
of World War II.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.579
One submarine.

00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:35.245
It's incredible.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.590
This is the present global
inventory, more or less.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.350
You can see-- this is
the number that counts.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:53.950
These are the
strategic warheads,

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.210
and you can see there
the order of 1,500, which

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.960
is this new START Treaty limit.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.350
We're just about at
that limit anyway.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:06.920
And that all the other countries
have typically a few hundred

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.360
at the most.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.730
This is all guesswork
as to the numbers.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.580
It's not known.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.570
I think 10 for North
Korea is probably

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:24.020
a factor of two to
three high, but it

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.230
gives an order of magnitude.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.930
This is guesswork, frankly,
because these are all secret.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.390
So people do the best they can.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.830
This is a table from Hans
Kristensen and the Federation

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.590
of American Scientists who keeps
track of these things as well

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.300
as he can.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.180
AUDIENCE: How can they
make these guesses?

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.170
PROFESSOR: Oh, they
look at the literature

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.150
and they look at
budgets and they

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.850
look at satellite pictures.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.770
They do their best.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.970
I think they have the
right order of magnitude,

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.790
but nobody claims they
know the exact number.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.620
I mean, if you talk to Hans
Kristensen, who's very good,

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:08.990
and who knows what he's doing,
he's very smart and competent.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.170
He'll tell you this
is educated guesswork.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.280
But it's more or
less-- it's enough.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.910
You know, I mean, 90
or a hundred weapons.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:25.208
It's all-- a hundred
weapons is overkill.

00:24:25.208 --> 00:24:26.707
AUDIENCE: But is
it usually the case

00:24:26.707 --> 00:24:30.906
where the countries would
want to make that number

00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:33.880
look higher or lower than that?

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.878
PROFESSOR: They want it
to be higher so that--

00:24:35.878 --> 00:24:36.794
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.540
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:44.050
Except for Israel, which doesn't
want to admit it has any,

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.130
but they want it known anyway.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.820
So it's a complex game.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.240
But for most of the
other countries,

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.330
they say it's for deterrence.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:25:00.570
So it's better to let your
adversary know what you've got.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.870
China is also very coy
about their numbers,

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.600
because they have
relatively few numbers,

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.770
and they want to keep this--
positions secret and all

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:11.280
of that.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.110
So they don't want to have-- and
they don't keep their missiles

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.710
on alert either.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.090
China's a very
interesting country

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.120
with respect to nuclear weapons.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.240
And perhaps exceptional.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:37.020
So the pathways to nuclear
escalation and war,

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.450
as I've stressed, is fear.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.340
Fear, to me, is
the biggest factor.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.490
I'm sure people
will argue with me.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.140
Every point I'm
making at some level

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.480
as controversial, by the way.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.830
I'm not trying to
hide it, but it's

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.570
just I can't give
you every nuance.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.450
You know, it's one hour.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.070
People write books
about each subject.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.140
So, you know, have
to oversimplify it.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:16.660
But anyway, I consider the
two possible pathways to War.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.750
One is an accidental launch
between the United States

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:22.660
and Russia.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.460
And the other is escalation
from conventional war

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.610
in India and Pakistan.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:36.220
Now, somewhat less likely is
North Korea's use of a weapon,

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.050
but I suspect they
won't, because I

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:47.230
think that they are constrained
by other military reasons

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.520
on the Korean peninsula.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.920
So North Korea wants to
rattle the sword, so to speak,

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.560
but they, I think, really
want it for both deterrence

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.000
and, as far as I can tell,
for the survivability

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.830
of the regime.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.020
Which is a whole
other-- but that

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.440
comes into all these things.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.260
That's why each case is special.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.440
North Korea's a
very special case.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.386
It's a very odd
government, and so forth.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.020
Now, we had-- Vipin Narang
talked about escalation

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.630
from conventional war, and he
talked about the deployment.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.870
One of the things
he talks about,

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.040
which I think is very
sound, is that this whole

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.710
issue when you talk
about deterrence,

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.170
it isn't just numbers.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.960
There's a whole other
dimension, at least.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.940
And one is the
deployment posture.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.170
And Pakistan has a very
aggressive deployment posture,

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:55.310
because they feel inferior in
conventional weapons to India.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:28:01.900
And they feel threatened
by India in many ways.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:06.540
And they've already been
partitioned by India

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.730
when the country broke up into
the eastern and western part,

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.820
Bangladesh and India.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:18.610
So there's a historic enmity
between the two, which

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.700
needs to be-- and I want
to-- it needs to be fixed.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.540
And I have to say,
personally, that I

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.390
was very disappointed
with Obama's visit

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.720
to India in many respects.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.960
You know, I look at
the nuclear issue,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.410
and that's one of my lenses.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:47.360
It isn't my sole lens, but
it's an important focus for me.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.110
And what I see is Obama talks
about the climate, which

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:58.940
is excellent, then he gets
on this very poor policy

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:08.040
of selling nuclear energy,
nuclear reactors, to India

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.260
and not exempting India
from the restrictions that

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:18.210
used to be in place
before the Bush

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:24.556
administration of exempting
India from the restrictions

00:29:24.556 --> 00:29:25.930
we've placed on
them because they

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:30.990
violated the Non-Proliferation
Treaty and tested weapons.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.130
Now of course,
Pakistan did so, also.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.520
But the point is that
we just aggravate

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:45.750
the Indian-Pakistan tension.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.930
As far as I can tell, and
I just read The New York

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:58.140
Times, you know, and listen to
the BBC, as far as I can tell,

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.810
the subject of
treating Pakistan,

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:07.300
of defusing the tension with
Pakistan, did not arise.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.270
As far as I can.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.170
At least these there was
no public mention of it.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.490
And I was very disappointed.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:20.370
And Obama's also trying to
draw-- India is more concerned

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.500
with China than with Pakistan.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:28.030
This is a sort of
three-way dance,

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.320
if you want to put it that way.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.790
And so it's more complicated
than a bipolar interaction.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:41.520
It's a three-way game where
China frightens India, India

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.830
frightens Pakistan.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:49.450
China ends up helping
Pakistan with nuclear issues

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.870
and nuclear weapons issues.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:55.570
They originally gave Pakistan
the design for the bomb.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:00.410
So this is something
that if India

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:05.360
wants to solve this
issue of Pakistan's

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.000
aggressive deployment,
they either

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.180
have to do it by force,
which won't work,

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.090
because India has been deterred.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.580
Or they have to do
it through diplomacy,

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.700
and it always ends
up with this message.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.260
You can use force,
which won't work,

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.240
or you can use diplomacy,
which has a chance.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.500
Which is difficult,
but has a chance.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.270
Those are the two ways
to solve the problem.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:44.490
So how could a war start by
accident between US and Russia?

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:50.330
Well, basically the
most likely path

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:53.765
is a malfunctioning of
the Early Warning system.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:06.540
So here's a chilling quote
from Vice President Cheney,

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.460
when he was Vice President.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.160
I'll just let you
read it for a minute.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.540
The famous football
he's talking about.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.120
Or black box.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.010
And this is carried around
wherever the President

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.000
of the United States goes.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:45.120
There's somebody a few doors
down, 24/7, who can say,

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.665
Mr. President, we're under fire.

00:32:48.665 --> 00:32:49.415
Here's the button.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.760
Now, it actually isn't
a physical button,

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.330
but that doesn't matter.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:03.110
That's irrelevant.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.760
It's the equivalent
of a physical button.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.080
It's a virtual button.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.210
So this is chilling.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.330
And you ask, what
about the Constitution?

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:16.800
What about consulting?

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.220
What about anything?

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.040
No, because of the 10-minute,
the 30-minute launch time

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.100
and the 10-minute warning time.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:34.260
So we have roughly
a thousand missiles,

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.430
and so does Russia,
on hair trigger alert.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.040
They're ready to be
fired at minutes' notice.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:48.840
The number's probably
closer to 900, but so what.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:53.120
I mentioned the delivery
times and decision times.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.110
So the probability of an
error is not negligible.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:07.370
It is true, this is a complex
physical, emotional system.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.010
It's a human system with fear.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.310
I keep emphasizing
this, because there

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:20.469
is fear, a very basic fear.

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:26.820
And each side-- what hawks don't
realize is that on each side

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.340
is vulnerable to
the other's system.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:33.050
You cannot stop the attack.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.466
All you can do is retaliate.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:42.870
In other words, it's
deter or revenge.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.750
Those are the two
modes of operation.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:49.440
This is chilling, but
that is the world we've

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.770
been living in for 50 years.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.310
Literally.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.820
People don't think about
it, but it's pretty awful.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.250
Now, the fact is that the
Russian system is less robust.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.730
So we are actually
more vulnerable

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.270
than they are, except that
we'll fire if they do.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.840
And of course,
why does it go on?

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.850
Each side does it because
the other side does it.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.560
It's sort of nutty.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.220
This is not logic.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.840
This is not normal logic.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.390
This is a tight circle.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:36.120
And so the latest that has
surfaced in the last few years

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.420
is cyber attack.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.750
So you ask how this can happen.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.130
Well, a cyber attack.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:47.370
Just imagine, somebody
hacks into the system,

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:52.970
somebody who really wants
the United States and Russia

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:59.530
to destroy each other,
hacks into the Early

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.530
Warning system of either side.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.109
Just imagine that.

00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.900
That's a nightmare.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:15.180
So the irony, as I mentioned,
is that the safety of each side

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.260
depends on the other
side not launching.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.470
And then of course, there's
the political question,

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.400
why do we persist?

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.840
Obama promised to do
something about it

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.360
when he came to office,
but he has given it up.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:38.690
He's clearly given it
up without explanation.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.262
But it was one of his promises.

00:36:41.262 --> 00:36:41.762
Yeah?

00:36:41.762 --> 00:36:43.970
AUDIENCE: You would think
even with the tensions that

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.700
exist that we would both be
better off if this system were

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.200
up.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.190
PROFESSOR: Of course.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:54.070
The more tension there is,
the more scary this is.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:58.550
It's less scary when there's
no tension, obviously.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.920
It's fear, again.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.830
And all the things
that go with fear.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.922
AUDIENCE: And distrust.

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:05.880
PROFESSOR: Fear-- yeah.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.540
I'm going taking them
almost as synonymous.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.450
Distrust because the other
side has the capability

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.190
to destroy you.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:20.630
And a second strike
capability, in the language

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.980
of Cold War-- you
know, you ask why

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.450
it happens with all
this strategic doctrine,

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:30.300
but a second strike capability
and launch on warning

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.595
are physically identical
with a first strike posture.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.070
So you cannot tell.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:45.640
I mean, the other side
tells you, we love you.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.590
But it's like having a
guest over for dinner

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:53.850
when the guest comes
with a loaded Uzi.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:38:00.580
Not just a pistol, but a
high-powered weapon, and

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.290
says, oh, yes.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:01.967
We're pals.

00:38:01.967 --> 00:38:02.800
I'm here for dinner.

00:38:05.692 --> 00:38:09.760
You know, what kind
of pals are these?

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.585
Right?

00:38:10.585 --> 00:38:13.820
I mean, it's a little nutty.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:18.140
But maybe who am I to judge?

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:23.450
So I want to talk a little bit
about the Non-Proliferation

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:29.060
Treaty, because I think it's--
one of the things that's very

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:34.990
important in this world is that
nuclear weapons don't spread

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.960
to other countries.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.580
And the cornerstone of that is
the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:48.360
And, honestly, I think in
the nuclear weapons states,

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.910
particularly in the
United States and Russia,

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:57.640
the NPT is not taken as
seriously as it should be.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.490
And I think it's very important.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:07.460
The NPT is taken seriously
for half of what it does.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.340
Namely, it says that
people should not

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.210
acquire nuclear weapons.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:17.300
But it is not taken seriously,
because it obligates

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.470
the five nuclear powers,
established nuclear powers,

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:26.050
to give up their
nuclear weapons.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.770
And this is really the heart of
abolition of nuclear weapons,

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.560
because it's built-in.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.930
It's Article VI of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.590
It obligates us to do it.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.790
And so there's a
tremendous tension.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.620
I'll come back to
this in a minute.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:47.290
But the tension is
between the countries who

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:53.370
gave up aspirations for
nuclear weapons saying

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:58.650
to the nuclear weapons powers,
OK, you are obligated to do it.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:02.600
But the nuclear
weapons countries say,

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.210
we're doing it very
gradually and responsibly.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:12.240
And now-- I'll talk more about
this-- the non-nuclear weapons

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.230
states want,
really, a timetable.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.150
So there's a lot of
tension over this.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:23.440
And I'll come to
this in a minute.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.130
So the cornerstones,
as I mentioned,

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:30.490
Article VI nonproliferation,
disarmament.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.840
And I write disarmament
and in black,

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.400
although they're all
extremely important.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.660
I do this for a US audience.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.920
But the last point is that
there's a five-year review.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.280
Every five years
there's a review.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.555
The next one will be
this May, and there

00:40:54.555 --> 00:40:56.450
are going to be fireworks.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:57.724
So I'll talk about that.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.270
So how effective is the NPT?

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:15.120
So there are four states outside
the treaty, Israel, India,

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.120
Pakistan, North Korea.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.610
There was this AQ Khan
Network from Pakistan,

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:25.380
which was shut down.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.180
It's never been
absolutely clear how much

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.780
the Pakistani state
was involved or if this

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.090
was a private venture.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:39.580
Scott Kemp talked
interestingly about how

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:45.460
the actual material that was
sold by the AQ Khan Network

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:52.525
actually setback
countries like Iran

00:41:52.525 --> 00:41:54.530
and their development
of centrifuges.

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:59.890
Because what was sold
was a technology which

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:03.033
was obsolete and inefficient.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.810
So it's very ironic.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:16.420
So a few countries have given
up their bombs-- oh, excuse me.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.970
And many countries have given
up nuclear weapons programs.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.950
I've listed some of them.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.870
There are many
nuclear-capable countries

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:27.840
that don't have weapons.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.380
Japan is one of them, of course.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.310
Not surprisingly.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.100
Canada.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.790
Our friends in Canada.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:44.050
But even South Korea, that feels
very threatened by North Korea,

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:45.130
has no bomb.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.350
But they are quite capable.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.650
And the main point
I want to make

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:56.040
is that fewer countries have
nuclear weapons that were

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.720
predicted in the early '60s.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:09.690
Like, famously, Kennedy, JFK,
said aloud that in a few years,

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.230
15 to 25 countries would
have nuclear weapons.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:16.680
And he was reflecting
what the US intelligence

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.240
agencies told him.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.730
He wasn't making this up.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:22.920
It wasn't just a speech.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.015
He was reflecting
what he was told.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.740
And right now,
the political norm

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:34.180
is to renounce nuclear weapons
and press the ones that

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.090
have it to disarm.

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:43.160
And that is a big plus and
one that needs encouragement.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.380
There are problems with
the NPT, of course.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.180
Life isn't perfect.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.780
North Korea, in my view, is
the most serious problem.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:59.000
Well, Pakistan-- I haven't
even written it down here,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.690
but Pakistan and India
are bigger problems

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:05.430
because of the possible
pathways to war.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:06.810
I already said that.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.090
I didn't want to repeat it.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.390
That's why it's
not on the slide.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.450
But the whole issue with Iran.

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:21.490
There's no question that Iran's
enrichment capabilities exceed

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.340
what they can do for power.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.860
In other words, they are very
well-suited for making weapons

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:32.680
and not for power, because they
don't produce enough enriched

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.930
uranium for power needs.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:37.460
But they do produce
enough for weapons.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:41.710
And that's been clear since
the beginning of the program,

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.010
despite what is said.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:51.670
And so there's been a
tremendous tension there.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:58.350
I just want to talk a little bit
about the ongoing negotiations.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:02.610
They're making a
lot of news now.

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:07.720
It's very important, because
we have an interim agreement,

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.190
and this is the
time, six months--

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.780
it's really four months
on the political level

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.690
and six months on
the technical level,

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:18.400
to reach a final agreement.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.140
That's what was set up.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.694
I mean, the first one was
supposed to be six months.

00:45:22.694 --> 00:45:23.360
It was extended.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.530
Well, excuse me.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.620
The first phase agreement
was for six months,

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.660
and then it's been
extended-- it's not on here--

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.150
but it's been extended
for six more months.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.280
So the deadline for
the political agreement

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:45.310
is in March, and then
in June, I think,

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:49.010
is the deadline, the
official deadline.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:53.720
People are skeptical,
but I don't know.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.205
There are some technical issues.

00:45:56.205 --> 00:45:59.520
The Iraq reactor can
produce plutonium.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.890
But there are a simple
solutions to that.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.690
There are simple
technical fixes,

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:08.050
and Iran has agreed to
them, as I understand it.

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:11.900
So that the amount of plutonium
production from the Iraq

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.610
reactor will be small.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.430
In the interim
agreement there's not

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:24.550
supposed to be any
additional sanctions.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.850
That's very important in
terms of the US Congress,

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:33.010
because bills have circulated
demanding new sanctions.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:36.470
But they're probably in
abeyance, fortunately.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.800
There are really four
parties involved,

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.810
the two official
parties and then the

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:52.470
hardliners on both sides.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:55.440
So this is a
complex negotiation.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:59.850
Within each side it's complex.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.780
I can't go into all of it.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:09.670
And I think people know
what's going on better

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.900
here on the American side.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:19.750
But the real issue, as far as
I can see it, in terms of Iran,

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:25.890
what Iran wants is
to have, I think,

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:31.560
the Ayatollah said something
like 15,000 centrifuges.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:36.585
The West, the most hardline
people in the West say zero.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:41.100
Netanyahu, for example.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.256
Zero is the only acceptable
number of centrifuges.

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.790
And that's why he's
campaigning so hard against it,

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:53.060
because he knows
that there will be

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.420
no deal with zero centrifuges.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:00.930
So he already knows in
advance that what he wants

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.360
is not possible.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.867
AUDIENCE: How many do
they need to really power

00:48:05.867 --> 00:48:09.030
a nuclear power
plant in the future?

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:12.430
PROFESSOR: Well, they need
probably 20,000 advanced ones.

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:18.190
Advanced ones, not what they
have, the so-called P1s.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.710
Ones that work really well.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.980
I don't know off
the top of my head,

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.260
but to supply-- what is it?

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:29.910
Bushehr?

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.220
Is that the right
pronunciation?--

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.560
the Bushehr reactor.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.310
Which they don't
need, by the way,

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:38.350
because Russia's going
to supply the fuel.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.124
But they don't quite
trust Russia, of course,

00:48:41.124 --> 00:48:45.270
for reasonable reasons, I think.

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:49.970
But anyway, this whole
business is so murky,

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:51.520
in my personal opinion.

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:59.170
It's hard to tell facts
from motive, in my opinion.

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:01.920
I don't think I can
do it, honestly.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.220
I'll talk with you
privately if you want,

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:10.000
but I don't think I can
really evaluate it in a way

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.930
that I would consider
satisfactory.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.090
I can speculate.

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:18.120
That's what I can do.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:25.420
But the point is-- you
know, there's an old saying

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:31.730
that the ideal solution gets in
the way of the good solution.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:34.840
The good solution,
in my opinion,

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:40.280
is pretty much to continue the
interim agreement that we have.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.150
Why is that good?

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:46.680
Because what people are not
talking about in the United

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:53.590
States is the best thing
about the whole negotiation.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:58.270
Namely, that Iran keeps
saying they don't want

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:00.920
to develop nuclear weapons.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.860
And there's a fatwa.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:06.060
That's excellent.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:14.710
Second, Iran says that they
want to be part of the NPT.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:18.890
They are enduring-- and
I'm going to use that word,

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:21.700
enduring-- the most
rigorous inspection

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:28.050
regime that the IAEA, that's
the international agency that

00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:31.300
inspects, the
International Atomic Energy

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:37.100
Agency-- they are enduring
the most rigorous inspections

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.440
that any country ever endured.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.710
Those are two excellent things.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:47.720
There are people on the
ground all the time.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.240
People say, well,
they can break out.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.090
Yes, they can break
out if they want to.

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:59.170
They will only
agree to all of this

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:02.080
if it's in their self-interest.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:07.515
Nobody can expect anything
more of them or us.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:16.710
So I think what we've got is the
best possible solution that's

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:18.590
feasible.

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:24.110
And if they kick inspectors out
and decide to go for a bomb,

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:29.070
because it's close to
impossible for them

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:36.520
to do a bomb without kicking
the inspectors out, and--

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.370
AUDIENCE: Even if they
have hidden sites?

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.830
PROFESSOR: Well, they
would have to then develop

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:44.140
so many thousand
more centrifuges

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:47.180
and have that material
and no news could leak out

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.860
and all of that stuff.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.380
There are opposition groups.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:54.150
We found out about some of the
sites-- I forget which one.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:55.410
The one that's underground.

00:51:55.410 --> 00:52:01.200
I forgot the name of it--
through dissenters in Iran.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.430
It always can happen.

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:08.160
The Soviet Union found out
about the Manhattan Project

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.370
in a most remarkable way.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:12.290
I want to talk about
that for a minute,

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:14.700
because that's really important.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:19.530
In 1940, a Soviet
nuclear physicist,

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:23.260
a very good one named
Flyorov, realized

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:26.430
that all the publications
about fission

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:31.920
in the United States, England,
and France had stopped.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.230
And he went to Stalin
and said, the West

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:38.820
is developing an
atomic bomb, based

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.740
on what was not appearing
in the literature.

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.450
This is remarkable.

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:47.090
And it's a fact.

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:50.900
Of course, the Soviet
Union had spies,

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:53.130
and they found out about
the Manhattan Project

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:54.460
through the spies.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:53:02.040
But Flyorov, just reading
the physical review--

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.240
this is a remarkable story
which should not be ignored.

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:14.590
So I think we'd find out.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:17.980
Maybe slowly, but, you know.

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.340
And if they really want
the weapon as a deterrent,

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.800
they've got to show
us that they have it,

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.200
like North Korea's done.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.120
There are all kinds of
steps, and one weapon

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.550
isn't good enough.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.660
I mean, I wrote an
op ed with Jim Walsh

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:38.580
that this whole break out
time thing is too short.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:41.750
You know, the calculations,
because it assumes one weapon.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:44.650
So I have an op ed in
Reuters about this.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:47.050
So there are all
kinds of arguments.

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:48.960
I mean, you could argue forever.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.830
I mean, I don't
expect people who

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:54.730
are what I would call
hardliners to adjust

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:57.950
agree with me because
I've published an op ed.

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:06.420
But I'm just saying-- it's not
so simple, is what I'm saying.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:07.740
There are arguments.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.330
You have to decide which
is right, because these

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:13.660
are very complicated issues.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:21.380
So anyway, we have our
Menendez-Kirk bill,

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.540
which is in the Senate.

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.800
It seems to be in abeyance
for a couple of months.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.350
There's a grace period.

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.370
People are working
hard against it,

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:34.460
so it's a very political
thing in both countries.

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.150
I know it.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:46.820
So I sort of wound together the
discussion of two things, Iran

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.140
and the NPT.

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.950
So I want to come
back to the NPT,

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:54.830
because I embedded the
Iranian discussion in the NPT

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:56.000
discussion.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.680
Because it came up
naturally, that's why.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:02.390
But so to come back to
it, the next thing that's

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:06.100
going to happen, and
I'm just quoting here,

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:12.170
Stormy weather predicted for
the NPT review in May at the UN.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:14.386
So I'm actually
quoting an article

00:55:14.386 --> 00:55:17.880
from Daryl Kimball of the
Arms Control Association.

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.790
I didn't have time to
make all the points,

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:27.070
but in 2005 we had a
disastrous NPT review.

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:33.230
That was under George Bush,
and the nonaligned countries,

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:37.600
Egypt and Sweden and
Denmark and Ireland

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.900
and a whole bunch of
countries were very angry.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:46.510
Particularly at the United
States and George Bush.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.220
It was a disastrous conference.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.930
2010, Barack Obama had
delivered his speech

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:55.460
that he wanted to
eliminate nuclear weapons.

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:59.870
The United States
was very welcome,

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:02.840
and it was a
productive conference.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:08.570
And they had 22 interrelated
disarmament steps.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.420
I'm not even going to
try to repeat them.

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:15.880
The two major ones were that
the nuclear weapons countries

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:21.820
should give a timetable
for going to zero.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:23.770
A timetable.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:27.080
And the second
thing is that they

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:34.930
should convene a
conference in the Middle

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:39.530
East looking towards a
nuclear-free zone in the Middle

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:40.790
East.

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:43.490
That's very delicate,
because getting Israel

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:47.530
to come, getting Iran and Israel
to the table at the same time

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:52.180
is difficult. The whole thing
is difficult, and not just Iran.

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:56.380
AUDIENCE: But the concept was
originally started by Iran

00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:02.020
and, I think Egypt, but Israel
was a party to it at one point,

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:02.695
too.

00:57:02.695 --> 00:57:03.570
PROFESSOR: They were?

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:05.450
AUDIENCE: They were interested.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:08.390
They were considering.

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:12.540
PROFESSOR: In my
personal humble opinion,

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:15.400
Israel's interests
are best served

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.220
by a nuclear-free zone
in the Middle East.

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.700
If you ask me.

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:25.130
I carry zero weight in
Netanyahu's cabinet.

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:27.800
Believe me.

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:32.120
I probably carry-- no, that's
an exaggeration of my influence.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:42.200
Zero weight is better
than what I have.

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.550
So anyway, I'm not even going
to go through any of those,

00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:53.660
but the follow through on these
steps have been disappointing.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:57.090
They've basically
been nonexistent.

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:01.680
There's been basically no
follow through on the 22 points.

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:05.270
And so that's one of
the reasons everyone

00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:09.230
who knows anything about
this is predicting that it's

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:15.110
stormy weather ahead, especially
for the nuclear weapons states.

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:19.400
So you can look forward to
some interesting news in May.

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:28.790
I'm kind of running out of
time, so basically Obama

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:31.780
raised a lot of hopes
with his Prague speech

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:35.740
in 2009 talking
about the possibility

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:40.050
of a nuclear-free world.

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:44.220
Of course, he hedged right away,
it won't be reached quickly.

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.870
And the US, as long
as the weapons exist,

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.320
we're going to have
our little toys, too.

00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:59.810
But anyway, it was still the
most forthright statement

00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:04.950
since 1945.

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:09.280
I mean, so it was a
breath of fresh air.

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.920
And he won the
Nobel Peace Prize.

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:18.240
Probably prematurely,
but who am I to quibble?

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:28.230
So there are many arguments
against nuclear weapons

00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.960
abolition.

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.230
I'm just going to pick one.

00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:37.650
Because it eliminates
deterrence, and to me

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:41.890
that's the biggest
argument against it.

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:44.210
And it cannot be achieved.

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:48.120
That's a different kind of
argument, but in my opinion

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.150
that's even stronger.

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.660
I wouldn't say cannot, but
my personal statement is

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:57.980
it's unlikely.

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:00.500
But that doesn't mean
it's not desirable.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.370
And that doesn't mean that
academics, in particular,

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:05.390
shouldn't talk about it.

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:07.710
That's one of the things
that I have in mind,

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:11.900
and we should have a
long-range view, academics.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.860
That's one of our luxuries.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.340
We can try to look ahead.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.840
And so there are
really two questions.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:28.550
One, is it desirable in view
of all of the difficulties

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:30.960
with it conceptually?

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.150
And then, is it achievable
if it is desirable?

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:38.540
You should only ask
the second question

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:44.060
if the answer to the first
is yes, it's desirable.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.080
And I can't go through
all the arguments,

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.420
but deterrence is a very
interesting question.

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:56.620
I think I'm going to convene
a little working group on it.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:00.290
I've been thinking about it
a lot for the last few years,

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:07.980
and I'm ready to do some more
serious research in this arena.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:13.090
But the point is that
it's never worked

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:17.660
in the sense of coercing
others to do what you want,

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:22.150
which is the way it's often
used in US diplomatic circles.

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:27.970
I don't know about Russia, but
it's certainly used in the US.

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:32.400
And another problem
with it, as we

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.050
heard about India
and Pakistan, is it

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:39.870
enables brinkmanship,
low-level brinkmanship.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:49.640
In other words it
introduces instabilities,

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.090
is what I'm saying.

01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:55.490
Deterrence isn't what
it's cracked out to be,

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:59.560
because by having
the weapons, you also

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.160
introduce instabilities
in the system,

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.125
especially if you have
aggressive basing mechanisms.

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:09.800
This is very important.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.340
And Pakistan certainly
is an example of that.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:17.070
They have deterred India, but
with a very aggressive basing

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:20.600
mode and threatening verbally.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.570
So, yes, they've deterred,
but is it stable?

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:27.170
How will it last?

01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:31.520
They have delegated
command and control

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:38.230
of these local tactical
weapons to field commanders.

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:42.520
Suppose you get a
rogue field commander

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.640
who wants to create mischief.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.570
Like you had somebody from
Pakistan goes to Mumbai,

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:59.240
and shoots everyone in
the hotel and so forth.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.010
Or when they entered the
Indian parliament a few years

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:03.930
before that.

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:09.770
So these are actions which don't
introduce love or stability

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:10.625
between countries.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.870
Putting it mildly.

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:19.410
And of course, deterrence
requires rationality,

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.250
which is in short supply.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.450
My view.

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:29.430
Accidental use, which
we've talked about.

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:31.720
And of course, it won't
work against terrorists.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:38.390
They want-- a real terrorist
who's a suicide bombardier

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:42.530
wants death and destruction.

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:46.770
So, boy, that's a bad mixture.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:55.650
And I think one of the points
that people should not forget

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:58.430
is deterrence requires a
small number of weapons.

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.200
AUDIENCE: How many is small?

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.420
PROFESSOR: Well, I would
say a hundred is overkill.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:05.440
So it's less than a
hundred in my view.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.670
I've been giving a number,
and I'll keep giving it.

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:15.840
I have zero weight in
Washington or Moscow,

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.140
but that's what I think.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.530
So should we try to
abolish nuclear weapons?

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.680
Really is it a good idea?

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:35.010
And so the answer is,
there's no risk-free world.

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:37.730
What you have to
do, when you look

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:39.960
at the arguments
against abolition,

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.760
and I've done my best to
look at what I consider

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:50.410
the serious ones,
papers typically

01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:57.700
criticize going to zero
because it's risky.

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.790
But the question
is what they never

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:03.205
do is talk about
the relative risks.

01:05:03.205 --> 01:05:06.290
In other words,
minimizing risks.

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:08.610
How do you minimize the risk?

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:11.440
You're never going
to eliminate risks.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.570
It's impossible.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:19.090
So the right question is
not to eliminate risks,

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:20.770
you have to ask
the right question.

01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:23.540
Every scientist knows that.

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:28.610
The right question here
is minimization of risk.

01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:29.770
That's the right question.

01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:32.030
How do you minimize risk?

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:34.160
Do you stay on
the present course

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:39.310
or do you try to do
something more creative?

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:43.180
And this is one of
the creative things.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:52.150
And so the other thing is
that abolition in by itself

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:53.600
is an important goal.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.690
And if we want the
NPT to be healthy,

01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:59.600
we better be serious about it.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.510
And those are the fireworks
that I'm talking about.

01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:06.020
And the nuclear weapons
states had better

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:09.310
take this into account.

01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:13.100
If you want to look
long-range, how patient

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:17.577
are the NPT states going to be?

01:06:17.577 --> 01:06:18.410
It's very important.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.680
So, yeah, Obama
has a mixed record.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.790
He's inspired great hopes.

01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:31.440
He's done the new START Treaty.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:33.175
He's improved nuclear security.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.990
He tried to engage
Russia for of the steps.

01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:43.140
Actually, that's a dated slide.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.900
Those efforts and now dead.

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:49.320
The Russians effectively
said no, by the way.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.880
So this is bigger than Obama.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:56.630
You know, Putin can veto
negotiations easily,

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:59.170
as you know.

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:00.650
The nuclear posture review.

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:02.500
In my view, this
is very important.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:07.520
This is our deployment strategy
was only slightly modified

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.945
from earlier years.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:19.545
We still have too many
warnings on hair trigger alert.

01:07:19.545 --> 01:07:21.790
With respect to
North Korea, he talks

01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:25.500
about strategic patience,
which is head in the sand,

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.230
as far as I'm concerned.

01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:35.870
I'm very critical of the North
Korean lack of engagement.

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:37.855
There I'm very
critical of Obama.

01:07:37.855 --> 01:07:40.060
AUDIENCE: They're asking
us right now, aren't they?

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:41.300
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:44.190
They're asking again,
and we're ignoring them.

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.050
And I think it's dumb.

01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:50.360
And the last thing, again, this
has a lot to do with Congress,

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:54.840
is they're modernizing
nuclear weapons.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.690
Which, again, in
the NPT review is

01:07:57.690 --> 01:08:01.440
going to come up for tremendous
criticism, and it should.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.300
And in this day and age
of budgetary restraints,

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.070
it should be criticized.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:09.640
And in terms of
strategic stability,

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.480
it should be criticized.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.270
So there are two buzz words.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:21.479
One is "modernization," and
the other is "maintenance."

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.160
So if you have
nuclear weapons, you

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.060
have to maintain that
they're usable and safe--

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:33.200
that's maintenance--
without testing.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.430
That's important.

01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:38.229
And the other is to
modernize the weapons,

01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:42.490
make them more
accurate, and so forth.

01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:44.920
And that really
should not be done.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.359
And the two get fused
together, and it's very hard

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:51.280
to tell the detail because
it's all classified.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.725
It's the typical trick
of large bureaucracies.

01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:04.939
So anyway, I find some
reason for optimism.

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:08.582
The CTBO, I want
to talk about that,

01:09:08.582 --> 01:09:10.040
and I just want to
say a few words.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.120
That is the-- what is it?

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.399
The-- I forgot
what it stands for.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:20.330
It's the worldwide
monitoring system for tests.

01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:25.020
It's basically an
international thing.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:27.470
It's technically fabulous.

01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:30.000
I mean, I am really impressed.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.240
They have seismic detectors.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.630
They look for
radioactivity in the air.

01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:44.020
And they look for--
there's one more thing.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.779
I'm sorry, I'm blanking.

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:51.330
But anyway, they detected a half
kiloton blast in North Korea.

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:57.160
An unannounced half kiloton
three stations triangulated.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.180
They can tell it
from earthquakes

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.865
and conventional explosions.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:08.150
What happens, just
briefly, is it's the rise

01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:10.700
time in the seismic signal.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:14.610
See, from a chemical-type
explosion, it's slower.

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:17.760
And the instruments have
a fast enough response

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:23.900
time so you could see
the initial overpressure.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.420
It's quite wonderful.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:29.450
And in several, I think
two out of the three

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:33.280
of the North Korean
tests, all unannounced,

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:36.500
they detected
radioactivity in the air.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.940
I think one of
the xenon isotopes

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:41.190
from the explosion,
which is long-lived.

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:46.500
And so finally, and
I outlined this,

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.630
public opinion does count.

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:55.160
So that's one of the things
I take some comfort from.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.930
There are many arms
control organizations.

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:03.300
I'm on the board of the
Council for a Liveable World.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:10.930
The Arms Control Association
is a wonderful organization

01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:13.340
in terms of giving
out information.

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:18.010
And their journal
is quite excellent.

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:23.120
And Peace Action
is a grassroots.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.770
It's all to the good.

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:30.320
I think I've given the answers.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.170
Is the present situation stable?

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:35.245
And my answer is with luck.

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:43.605
And I gave my answer about
abolition of nuclear weapons.

01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:54.090
So anyway, there's plenty to
do, and why don't I just stop.

01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:55.890
You can look at it.

01:11:55.890 --> 01:12:01.170
I'm sure this is only a partial
list of all that can be done.

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:07.880
Some of it can't be done
without Russia, but some can.

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:18.520
For example, we could
reduce, more rapidly,

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:23.320
to the level that Russia has
of launchers and the new START

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.140
Treaty.

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.840
Russia, for example,
just as an example,

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:31.110
Russia is below the limits
imposed by the START Treaty.

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:34.000
Those limits go
into effect when?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.630
In something like six or
eight years or something?

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:37.160
I forget.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.330
Do you remember?

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:40.630
When they go into effect?

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:44.830
But we could accelerate
those numbers.

01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:47.060
You know, like typical
arms control treaties

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.990
they go into effect almost
the day they expire.

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:56.240
So it's always too slow
for arms control people.

01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.290
You know, it's always
welcome, but always too slow.

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:02.455
But you take what you can get.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.000
But again, I want to
just repeat one thing.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.510
The new START Treaty, the
big success of the new START

01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:17.000
Treaty, in my
view, which was not

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.530
stressed by the newspapers
or the commentators,

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:24.220
is the fact that the
inspections are going on.

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:29.070
And the inspections, in my
view, are much more critical

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:29.990
than the numbers.

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:35.090
There's such overkill whether
it's 1,000 or 1,500 weapons.

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:38.340
I mean, again, this
100 number is overkill.

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:44.460
So to me, it's almost
irrelevant except symbolically

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:48.150
whether you have a
thousand or 1,500.

01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:50.210
Below a thousand,
you get into issues

01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:53.780
with how many does China
have, and so forth.

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:54.900
I showed you.

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.350
So a thousand is roughly
the critical point

01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:05.790
in which all the
nuclear weapons states

01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:08.940
have to negotiate
with each other,

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.350
not just the US and Russia.

01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:14.950
Of course, Russia's
critical there.

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.270
OK, I'm going to stop.

01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:18.270
And of course, there's
been a lot of questions,

01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:22.310
but I'm happy for more
discussion or whatever.

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:23.546
Yeah?

01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:26.210
AUDIENCE: You argued that
it's typical to abolish

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:32.706
all the nuclear weapons because
it is used as deterrence.

01:14:37.188 --> 01:14:47.148
If it's true, isn't
there another way

01:14:47.148 --> 01:14:52.626
of deterrence that would
replace the nuclear weapons?

01:14:52.626 --> 01:14:54.120
What is your opinion?

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.880
PROFESSOR: Well, first of
all, we already have it,

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.770
and it's conventional
smart warfare.

01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:01.480
I haven't talked about it.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.110
The United States
calls it Global Strike,

01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:05.730
which we're developing.

01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:08.210
And that's a whole
other dimension.

01:15:08.210 --> 01:15:12.380
It's not the nuclear arms
race, but it was too much

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:13.570
for me to get into that.

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:16.480
But, yes, you're asking
a very good question.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:22.350
And our conventional military
powers are incredible.

01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:26.000
And we can do now,
in many respects,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.450
with conventional
weapons what we

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:33.450
could have done only with
nuclear weapons 20 years ago.

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:35.530
Or even 10 years ago.

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:38.950
And this Global
Strike, which is a way

01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:43.010
to strike across the
world with precision,

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:50.200
with conventional weapons, with
missiles, with cruise missiles,

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.320
and so forth, is incredible.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.630
And it's all sophisticated
command and control

01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:59.150
stuff plus guidance.

01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.040
Yeah?

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.000
AUDIENCE: So in your
opinion that could

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.440
replace the nuclear
[INAUDIBLE] in the future?

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.130
PROFESSOR: Well,
replace it in the sense

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.630
that you don't have
nuclear weapons.

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:13.750
But then other people are
just as scared as before.

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:19.380
So it's also an aggressive
military posture.

01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.680
And maybe, in the day
and age when we're really

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.480
trying to replace that,
then we can no longer

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:32.950
distinguish between conventional
arms control and nuclear arms

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:33.890
control.

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:36.050
They will become
merged, I think,

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:40.970
as an intellectual subject as
well as a practical matter.

01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:44.720
But I'm looking ahead
probably at least 10 years.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:47.510
But in my view,
that day will come.

01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:50.460
So you're really asking
a great question.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:52.140
AUDIENCE: Disturbing.

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:52.980
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:53.670
Disturbing.

01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:55.710
The peace action will
have plenty of work

01:16:55.710 --> 01:17:00.160
to do for plenty of time.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:00.700
I'm afraid.

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:05.310
What can I say?

01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:11.022
I'm not happy about
that, but it's a fact.

01:17:11.022 --> 01:17:12.918
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about one thing.

01:17:12.918 --> 01:17:16.550
Do you know who in
India or Pakistan

01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:18.330
presses that actual button?

01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:19.778
PROFESSOR: No, I do not.

01:17:19.778 --> 01:17:22.622
AUDIENCE: The reason I'm asking
is is it delegated to some

01:17:22.622 --> 01:17:24.520
[? war-grade ?] people or some--

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.160
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.570
In India-- look,
here's what I know.

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:31.870
I don't know more
than I do know.

01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:36.190
What I think is true in India
is that the armed forces

01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:37.720
are under civilian control.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:45.570
But in Pakistan,
that is not true.

01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:52.550
So Pakistan is not what you
would call a unitary state.

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:57.130
OK There is no single
command authority.

01:17:57.130 --> 01:17:59.870
I mean, there is
officially, but de facto

01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:05.850
we know that the Pakistani
military is at least

01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:08.620
equal to the civilian branch.

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:13.430
But this ISI, whatever it
is, the security thing,

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:16.940
it seems to be
quasi-independent.

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:19.550
I'm not sure.

01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:22.370
So you can see.

01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:24.770
But what I'm afraid of
is with this aggressive--

01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:26.720
I said it before,
but I'll just repeat

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:35.670
it-- is this aggressive
first strike military nucleus

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:41.520
posture of Pakistan is leading
to delegation of authority

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.860
to low-levels where
there's a great danger

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.820
of a rogue commander.

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:51.280
So I see Pakistan as
the place with the most

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:53.205
danger of a rogue commander.

01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:01.903
And I think I'm not the only
one who thinks this, by the way.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.160
AUDIENCE: Again,
how many weapons

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.820
do we think that Pakistan has?

01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:12.170
PROFESSOR: Roughly
between 100 and 200.

01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:15.792
It's more than 100 now.

01:19:15.792 --> 01:19:17.750
AUDIENCE: And they're
making more all the time.

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:19.240
PROFESSOR: They're
making more all the time.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.950
They're making them
as fast as they can,

01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:24.470
as far as we can tell.

01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:26.797
AUDIENCE: The same
in India, also?

01:19:26.797 --> 01:19:27.380
PROFESSOR: No.

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:31.260
India seems to be
more relaxed about it.

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:33.670
Both in terms of their
aggressive policy--

01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:35.660
they say they won't fire first.

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:41.350
India has a much more
reasonable stated policy of use.

01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:44.020
They're much more laid back.

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:46.385
They say they won't
use them first.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:56.600
They say the Pakistanis are
just going much, much too far.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.600
But on the Indian side,
the problem that I see

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.250
is they're not trying for
the political solution.

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:10.350
In other words, their deployment
posture is more sensible,

01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:11.920
but they're focused on China.

01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:19.450
But they are not-- India--
my big criticism of India

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:24.260
is they are not
solving the problem.

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:26.007
I'm going to come back to that.

01:20:26.007 --> 01:20:29.302
AUDIENCE: They're not
initiating any kind of--

01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:30.010
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:20:30.010 --> 01:20:33.690
They're being much
too slow in trying

01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:40.460
to heal problems like
Kashmir and other irritant

01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:43.859
points in the relationship.

01:20:43.859 --> 01:20:45.900
I mean, they're not going
to disappear overnight,

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.915
but they could do things.

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.050
And I can point to
some literature,

01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:56.920
but I'm not a real
expert, by the way.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:00.290
The United States is
not being evenhanded,

01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:02.900
and that's a mistake.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:07.220
That's a basic American mistake.

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:11.480
So, you know, I've been
critical since the beginning.

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.930
I'm not the only
one on this basis.

01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:19.910
I think the predictable
is happening.

01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:24.130
They're just spurring Pakistan
into a more frenzied state

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:26.445
of nuclear weapons development.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.614
It's unfortunate.

01:21:31.614 --> 01:21:34.160
But we're doing something
we don't want to see happen.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:41.360
We deplore it on one hand,
and then we encourage it

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.420
indirectly on the other.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:45.773
So it's a contradictory policy.

01:21:45.773 --> 01:21:46.481
It's unfortunate.

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:56.400
They should know better,
but there they're

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:00.750
letting commercial
interests override this.

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:04.875
This is a tug of war.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.870
The United States
says many interests.

01:22:13.868 --> 01:22:15.868
AUDIENCE: Are you saying
the commercial interest

01:22:15.868 --> 01:22:19.190
with respect to
power plant sales?

01:22:19.190 --> 01:22:20.092
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:22:20.092 --> 01:22:22.743
AUDIENCE: It's sort of
interesting in that this

01:22:22.743 --> 01:22:24.430
got started what?

01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:26.316
In 2005 or 06?

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:27.565
PROFESSOR: Under Bush somehow.

01:22:27.565 --> 01:22:28.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:22:28.670 --> 01:22:29.451
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:22:29.451 --> 01:22:31.159
AUDIENCE: And in the
meantime, of course,

01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:32.608
all the American
companies are now

01:22:32.608 --> 01:22:35.506
owned by Japanese
or French companies.

01:22:35.506 --> 01:22:37.921
So what we're doing--

01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:46.040
PROFESSOR: Well, we also
make military hardware sales

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:49.150
to India, which is increasing.

01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:52.430
That was-- oh, that was one of
the other things from the Obama

01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:58.390
visit, the sale of conventional
military equipment to India

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:03.220
is going up for the first
time in a long time.

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.614
So that was a big
success, I guess.

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:09.030
AUDIENCE: So that was a
part of the recent trip?

01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:10.160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.390
Yes.

01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:14.620
I forgot to mention that.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.709
You reminded me.

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:26.120
Thank you.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.270
Thank you for coming.
