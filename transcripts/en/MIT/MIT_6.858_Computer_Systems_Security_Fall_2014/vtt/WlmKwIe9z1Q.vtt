00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:28.290
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.220
So let's get started
with the second lecture

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.790
in our stunning series
on web security.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.740
So to start off the
class today, I actually

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.220
want to go over
some quick demos.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.937
So as you know, demos
almost never work.

00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:46.270
So hopefully, you won't just
be seeing my empty terminal

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.770
up here.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.360
But the basic idea
is that I first

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.815
wanted to show you an
example of the Shellshock bug

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:52.940
that you may have heard of.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
This has been a pretty
sort of popular topic

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.320
in the security literature.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.200
And people were
saying that Heartbleed

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.265
was like a 10 out of
10 security [? bug. ?]

00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:03.640
But people were saying, like,
we should not have reserved

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.972
10 out of 10 for Heartbleed.

00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:06.055
This is potentially worse.

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:06.620
All right?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.280
And so I thought that this would
be a great idea for you guys

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.790
to see some living history, and
for you to tell your parents

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.165
that, you know, they're getting
their tuition's worth out

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:13.710
of MIT.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.350
So what is the basic idea
behind the Shellshock bug?

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.890
Well, it's a really
great example

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.760
of why it's so difficult
to build secure web

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.520
applications that span
multiple technology

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.060
stacks, multiple languages,
multiple OS's, so on and so

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.740
forth.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.100
So the basic idea
is that Shellshock

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.620
is going to take
advantage of the fact

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.610
that the attacker can
craft a special HTTP

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.860
request to a server and
control the headers that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.230
are in that request.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.502
And so I've written
an example up here.

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:46.210
It's very simple.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.940
So let's say that the attacker
wants to send some GET query.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.890
They're going to send that
query to some CGI interface.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.890
And then there's going
to be some question mark.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.389
The person wants
to search for cats,

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:59.165
because that's all
that people search for.

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:01.320
And then there's some
standard headers here,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.730
like host, for example.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.610
So this is saying
that this URL here

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.750
is hanging off of example.com.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.360
Now, note that the attacker can
also specify custom headers.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.860
Right?

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.485
So the attacker can
just say, I want

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:16.300
it to find some
application-specific header

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.122
called Custom-header, and I want
to specify some value there,

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.580
because you can imagine that
a web application might define

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.996
certain functionalities
that can't

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:25.811
be expressed using the simple,
pre-defined HTTP headers.

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:26.310
OK.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280
So that all seems
fairly innocuous.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.000
But what ends up happening is
that in a lot of these CGI web

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.640
servers, they will actually
take these custom header values

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.430
and use them to set
environment variables for Bash.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.070
OK?

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.480
So they will use this header
to create a Bash variable name

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.320
custom header.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.970
Then they will take
this value here

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.440
that the attacker
has supplied, and use

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.360
that to be the value of
that Bash variable, right?

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.290
And then once that
variable is set up,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.110
then the CGI server
will do some processing

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.940
in the context of
that environment.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.440
Right?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.550
So this is clearly bad.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.440
You can probably see
where this is going.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.020
Web servers should not be
taking these arbitrary values

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.000
from arbitrary unwashed masses.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.780
So in the particular example
of the Shellshock bug,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.470
what ended up happening is that
if you set your Bash variable

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.280
to this, this kind of malformed,
evil-looking thing, then

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.070
there's going to be
insanity that happens.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.730
Basically, this is a malformed
[? Select ?] function

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.597
definition in the Bash
scripting language.

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:26.680
You don't have to worry
about the specifics of it.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.020
But what was intended to
happen, if Bash were correct,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.650
is that this part over
here wouldn't be executed.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.335
So basically, you just defined
some stupid function here

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:36.376
that doesn't do anything.

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:38.330
And in the [INAUDIBLE]
terminate here.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.370
But this sequence of
characters actually

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.006
confuses the Bash parser.

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:44.380
And so what ends up happening
is that it sort of stumbles

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.180
through this nonsense here.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.430
And then it says, oh, I
might as well keep on parsing

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.680
and execute some
commands here, right?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.262
And so in this case, this
just does the bin/id command,

00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:55.220
which displays some
information about the user.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.080
But this could be
any code right here.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.267
So that's the heart
of the vulnerability.

00:03:59.267 --> 00:04:01.100
So I'll give you a very
simple example here,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.650
so you see up on the screen.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.400
So basically, we've got a very
simple Python server here,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.400
just the dumbest one you
could possibly imagine.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.380
It's got this do GET method.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.200
And so with the
do GET method, it

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.709
is going to basically iterate
through all of the HTTP headers

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.450
in the request.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:19.950
OK?

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.270
So that's what this four
key value for the header

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.787
and the value in this request.

00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:28.120
And then it'll just print out
the headers that it finds.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.900
And then in this
dirt-simple example,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.691
it's going to do
something very dumb, which

00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:34.960
is execute the system
call and just directly set

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.640
the environment value to the
value specified in the header.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.390
So that's the whole
root of vulnerability.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.465
So if I come over here and I
start my victim web server--

00:04:45.465 --> 00:04:48.190
OK, so it's now ready
to accept requests.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.140
And then I can write my special
Shellshock client like so.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.530
And this is actually
pretty dirt-simple.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.900
So here, I just define one
of these malformed strings.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.856
So I have these kind of janky
characters at the beginning.

00:05:01.856 --> 00:05:04.230
And then I know that everything
after this is essentially

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.250
going to be executed on my
behalf on the server side.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.834
So in this case, I
pick something that

00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:10.083
was actually pretty innocuous.

00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:11.720
It just says, echo,
I own your machine.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.670
But this could be anything here.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.170
You could start another Bash
shell kind of like I do here.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.680
And then, echo attacker command,
where in the real world,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.890
that could actually be
something very dangerous.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.364
So then I set the headers
and my custom request.

00:05:27.364 --> 00:05:29.655
And then I just use Python
to create an HTTP connection

00:05:29.655 --> 00:05:31.047
and just send it to server.

00:05:31.047 --> 00:05:32.130
So what ends up happening?

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.190
So I execute my
Shellshock client here.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.900
So it's saying that
I had a 404 here,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.400
because it doesn't matter
what file I requested.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.760
So I just put in some index,
an HTML that doesn't exist.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.070
But if we look over here, this
is the output for the server.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.450
And so what you see is
that you have this output,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.690
I OWN UR MACHINE,
and ATTACKER CMD.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.400
And that's because as the
server got that header,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.120
it set the Bash variable.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.020
It set it with this
weird thing here.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.310
And as a result, an
ATTACKER-controlled command

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.800
got the run.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.422
So does that all make sense?

00:06:06.422 --> 00:06:12.714
AUDIENCE: So does this happen if
the program is run under that?

00:06:12.714 --> 00:06:14.774
I'm still unclear on, like--

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:15.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.840
So the specifics of how
the attack works actually

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.600
depends on are you running
Apache, like what exactly

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.900
your web server looks like.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.900
So in this example, it's
a little bit contrived,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.890
because I actually called
[INAUDIBLE] explicitly spawned

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.932
off another Bash shell, set the
environment variable in there,

00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:31.140
and then we were ready to go.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.440
But you could imagine that
if you were spawning off

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.827
a different process for
each incoming connection,

00:06:35.827 --> 00:06:38.160
you could set the environment
variable for that directly

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.660
if that guy was using--
was living inside

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.905
of a Bash environment.

00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:44.244
AUDIENCE: So if you go back
to your web server code,

00:06:44.244 --> 00:06:47.600
it seems that you have a
much worse vulnerability

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.386
than the Shellshock, because
you're calling [? though ?]

00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:50.886
a system.

00:06:50.886 --> 00:06:55.117
And I can execute a command just
by setting the custom header

00:06:55.117 --> 00:06:56.200
to something [? that I ?].

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.032
I wouldn't have to use the
Shellshock bug in this example.

00:06:59.032 --> 00:07:00.115
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:07:00.115 --> 00:07:00.230
Yeah.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.480
So in this particular web
server, which is something

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.150
I wrote just for sort
of teaching value,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.233
yeah, this thing you
shouldn't trust for anything.

00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:07.790
AUDIENCE: But the
Shellshock exploit

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.677
was on assigning something
malicious to an environment

00:07:10.677 --> 00:07:12.760
variable using [? set N ?]
or something like that,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.420
which is something [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.724
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:14.840
So that gets back
to his question.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.410
That's right.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.954
So if you had, like,
let's say, Apache up here,

00:07:17.954 --> 00:07:19.995
Apache's a little bit
tricky to sort of configure

00:07:19.995 --> 00:07:21.350
in a way that's obviously
what's going on.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.391
But you're exactly right.

00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:24.580
So Apache would
call Set nth, which

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.970
is another way that you can
directly set the environment

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.845
value for whatever
particular service [? I ?]

00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:29.745
process you have.

00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:31.370
But you also actually
have some servers

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.690
like this that you can
imagine that they actually

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.370
do a spawn of a separate process
and do something very morally

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.220
equivalent to this.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.803
But you're exactly
right, that the way

00:07:38.803 --> 00:07:41.070
that a patch in
particular was violated

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.580
was the way that you described.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.790
So does it all make sense?

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:49.240
OK.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.725
So that's sort of a
quick and dirty example

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:55.310
of Shellshock stuff.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.210
And so another example
I wanted to give

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.460
you was an example of
a cross-site scripting.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.031
And so the Shellshock
bug was sort

00:08:03.031 --> 00:08:06.885
of an example of how content
sanitization is very important.

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:09.010
So as we'd just been
discussing, you shouldn't just

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.700
take inputs from
an arbitrary person

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.000
and them use them directly
in commands of any type.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.490
So cross-site scripting
attacks are another example

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.550
of how something can go wrong.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.670
So in this example,
I have another sort

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.950
of dumb CGI server here.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.000
And if we look at
this CGI server,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.450
so what is it going to do?

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.580
So once again, I've written
something very simple

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.532
in Python.

00:08:32.532 --> 00:08:33.990
This is going to
be the handle that

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.792
executes when a request
comes in from the client.

00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:38.250
And so essentially,
what happens is

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:42.701
that up here, I'm going to print
some headers for the response.

00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:44.159
So I'm going to
say, my response is

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.250
going to be of type text HTML.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.934
This line here we'll
actually explain in a second.

00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:51.350
So as it turns out, browsers
have some security mechanisms

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.250
to try to prevent the attack
that I'm about to show you.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.560
So I put this example-- I
put that header line in there

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.060
to turn some of the
protections off.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.640
And then what the
CGI script does

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.625
is it gets access to all of the
fields and the CGI requests.

00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:09.180
So imagine that everything
in a query string

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.140
after this question mark-- like
these header and value things,

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.740
that's what goes into
that form example there.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.510
And so what the CGI script
does is something very simple.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.960
It just directly prints
the value of something that

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.280
was passed from the attacker.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.150
So same basic idea.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.600
This is a bad idea, because
this Print statement,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.200
it's printing directly
into the HTML itself.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.840
So what can happen
is as follows.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.740
So let's say that I have a
bunch of queries I want to run.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.760
So in this first query here, I'm
just setting the message value

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.350
to Hello.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.567
So if I go over here
and I run that page,

00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:52.900
well, then you're going to
see that this Hello shows up,

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.983
because once again, the
server was taking directly

00:09:54.983 --> 00:09:55.740
what I pass to it.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.140
And it prints Hello.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.150
So no big surprises there.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.890
Now let's say I realize
that I can actually

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.950
pass arbitrary HTML in there.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:09.930
So now I actually try to
embed some styling in there.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.550
So I say, h1 and
then Hello again /h1.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.550
So that worked, right?

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.310
So once again, we're printing
directly into the [? pake. ?]

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.410
So now you might think,
OK, we're in business now.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.951
This is cool.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:23.530
So let's just directly embed
some JavaScript code in there.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.030
All right.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.761
And so I do this.

00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:28.010
And here, I've actually just
put in-- for the message,

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.050
I put script.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:34.067
And then I want it to just
alert XSS and then script.

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:35.150
So now that's interesting.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.220
So it seems like something
didn't quite work.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.320
So I don't see any output.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.569
I didn't see the alert either.

00:10:39.569 --> 00:10:43.840
And if I actually look at the
output for the web server--

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.700
and what I see is
that here, the web

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.950
server itself didn't actually
get that trailing script tag.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.190
So it seems like the
browser itself has somehow

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.470
detected something evil
even though I tried

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.244
to disable the XSS filter.

00:10:58.244 --> 00:10:59.160
So that's interesting.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.805
We're going to come to this
defense mechanism a bit

00:11:02.805 --> 00:11:03.430
in the lecture.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.429
But suffice it to say,
it seems like the browser

00:11:05.429 --> 00:11:07.822
is trying to resist this
cross-site scripting attack.

00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:09.530
But of course, what
we can take advantage

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.730
of is the fact that HTML,
and CSS, and JavaScript,

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.910
they're extremely
complex languages.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.910
And they compose in these very
difficult to understand ways.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.510
So here, this is what I've been
setting my attack string here.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.380
This is malform URL.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.350
I'm saying, image, and
then three quotation

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.340
marks in a row, and
then a script tag.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.330
Like, this shouldn't
actually parse.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.900
But what's going
to end up happening

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.740
is that the browser's
going to get confused here.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:38.560
So it's built-in cross-site
scripting detection

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.210
actually fails here.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.710
And so what ends up happening
is that now you see the alert.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:43.230
OK?

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.146
And what's interesting
is that if you actually

00:11:45.146 --> 00:11:48.130
look at the contents of the page
now, it's kind of messed up.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.520
Like, where did this quotation
mark and brace come in?

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.690
If we do a Control,
U, we can see

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.574
that this does not make the
browser happy in some way.

00:11:57.574 --> 00:11:58.740
That's a little bit unclear.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.430
But it doesn't matter
if we're their attacker.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.009
We saw that alert.

00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:04.800
That means that
[? our code ?] got the run.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.750
And from the perspective
of the attacker, who cares

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.041
that the page is messed up now?

00:12:08.041 --> 00:12:09.660
Because I could
have used that code

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.932
to steal the cookie
or things like that.

00:12:11.932 --> 00:12:13.140
So does that all make-- yeah?

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.137
AUDIENCE: What's the
cross-site aspect?

00:12:15.137 --> 00:12:15.720
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.200
So the cross-site aspect is that
if the attacker can convince

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.220
the user to go to
a URL like this,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.270
then the attacker's the
one who's specifying

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.820
that stuff in the message.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.610
It's the attacker who's
specifying the alert XSS

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:31.660
or something like that.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.160
And so essentially,
what's happening

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.890
is that the victim
page is executing code

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.110
on behalf of someone
that is not that page.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.535
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
exactly what the browser roles

00:12:42.535 --> 00:12:44.554
are for sanitizing
[? games ?] for [? play? ?]

00:12:44.554 --> 00:12:45.470
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.844
So we'll get to
that in a second.

00:12:46.844 --> 00:12:49.750
So we'll get to
that in a second.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.300
OK.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:55.745
So that is all for story time.

00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:57.110
And let's see here.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.644
So I guess I can
turn this guy on.

00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:07.991
And maybe he will
[INAUDIBLE] guy here.

00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:08.589
This guy here.

00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:09.464
AUDIENCE: Front wall.

00:13:09.464 --> 00:13:10.214
PROFESSOR: Ah, OK.

00:13:10.214 --> 00:13:11.745
There you go.

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:12.245
All right.

00:13:12.245 --> 00:13:13.245
Eighth time's the charm.

00:13:13.245 --> 00:13:14.365
OK, thanks.

00:13:14.365 --> 00:13:14.865
OK.

00:13:14.865 --> 00:13:17.565
So yeah, so those are just two
quick demos to sort of show you

00:13:17.565 --> 00:13:19.810
the filthy and dirty world
that we live in right now.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.090
So why is cross-site
scripting so prevalent?

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.780
Why are these problems
such a big deal?

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.745
Well, the reason
is that websites

00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:29.740
are increasingly more
and more dynamic,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.940
and they want to incorporate
a user content a lot of times,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.610
or they want to incorporate
content from other domains.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.810
So think about the Comment
section on a news article.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.895
Those comments come
from untrusted folks,

00:13:40.895 --> 00:13:41.520
from the users.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.950
So somehow, these sites
have to figure out,

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.710
what are the rules for
composing those types of things?

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.410
And also, the websites might
host user-submitted documents,

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.280
a thing like Google Docs
or Office 365, for example.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.010
Those documents all come
from untrusted folks,

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.946
but somehow, they have
to live with each other

00:13:58.946 --> 00:14:00.320
and with the large
infrastructure

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.530
from Google or from
Microsoft or whatnot.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.740
So what are some of the
cross-site scripting defenses

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.240
we can use?

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.827
This kind of gets
to your question.

00:14:08.827 --> 00:14:10.660
So we'll actually look
at some of those now.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:21.120
So one type of defense
is to basically

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.600
have cross-site scripting
filters in the browser itself.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.730
And so these filters
will essentially

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:38.090
try to detect when there's a
potential cross-site scripting

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.360
attack.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.490
And so we actually saw one
of those filters in action.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.560
And I think that was the third
example that we looked at.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.140
If you have some website--
or some URL-- excuse me--

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.850
that looks like
this-- so foo.com.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:59.280
And then you have some question
mark and then some query string

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.300
you're going to submit.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.830
This is very similar to the
example that I tried third.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.660
So I just set this
source to something like

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:22.150
evil.com/cookiestealer.js.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.900
And so what ended
up happening was

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.940
that when I tried an
example similar to this,

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.460
the browser actually
rejected it out of hand.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.380
So we saw that it
didn't even work.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.820
And the reason
why it didn't work

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.330
is because the browser
looked and said,

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:40.451
is there an embedded
script tag in a URL?

00:15:40.451 --> 00:15:42.200
So basically, it's a
very simple heuristic

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.860
for figuring out if something
evil's probably going on,

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.570
because no legitimate
developer-- or no developer

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.752
that's sane-- should be
doing stuff like this.

00:15:49.752 --> 00:15:51.710
So there's actually these
configuration options

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.209
in your browser you can use to
turn these things on and off.

00:15:54.209 --> 00:15:55.900
Occasionally, this
is useful for testing

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.941
if you just want to inject
some JavaScript really

00:15:57.941 --> 00:15:58.940
quick and dirty.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.530
But this is almost always
assigned [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.925
So for example, Chrome and IE
have a built-in filter that

00:16:03.925 --> 00:16:06.290
will look at your URL
value in the address bar,

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.240
look for things like this.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.530
And if it's there, they will
do things like maybe delete

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.910
this whole thing completely.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.420
They will maybe change
the source to be empty,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.357
stuff like that.

00:16:16.357 --> 00:16:18.190
And so essentially, to
get to your question,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.310
there's a bunch of heuristics
that the browsers have

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.940
to identify things like this.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.750
And if you look
at the OWASP site,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.509
they actually collect
examples of heuristics

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:29.300
you can use to detect
cross-site scripting,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.906
as well as tricks you can
use to bypass those filters.

00:16:33.906 --> 00:16:34.780
So it was very funny.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.360
So the first thing I
wanted to do for the demo

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.320
is do something like
this, and it didn't work.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.060
So then I went to the
OWASP cheat sheet.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.170
I looked at, like, the
third thing they suggested,

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.586
and the third thing
they suggested

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:47.460
worked, which was that sort of
broken image syntax type stuff.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.702
So the basic problem
with just relying on this

00:16:50.702 --> 00:16:52.910
is that, like I said, there's
a lot of different ways

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.710
to force the CSS and HTML
parsers to mal-parse something.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.080
So these things are
not complete solutions.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.980
They don't have the
perfect coverage.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.630
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't this
just be like the lead-in

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.379
from the browsers?

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:07.449
Because it seems like not
the browser's job to do this.

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:09.365
PROFESSOR: You mean it's
not the browser's job

00:17:09.365 --> 00:17:10.795
to sanitize this kind of stuff?

00:17:10.795 --> 00:17:11.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.280
PROFESSOR: I mean,
you could imagine

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.119
sort of having a browser sit
atop a proxy, for example.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.290
And maybe the proxy did
sort of cleaning like this.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.029
I mean, intuitive reason
why it might make sense

00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:21.945
to do it inside the
browser is because so many

00:17:21.945 --> 00:17:25.519
of the legitimate parsing
engines are inside the browser.

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:28.060
So presumably, if you're closer
to where the actual parsing's

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.070
being done, it's better.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.778
But you're right.

00:17:29.778 --> 00:17:32.316
In practice, you can imagine
there being sort of defense

00:17:32.316 --> 00:17:33.190
in layers, basically.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.606
AUDIENCE: I think
what he might be

00:17:34.606 --> 00:17:37.198
saying is that it's the
web developer's job,

00:17:37.198 --> 00:17:39.960
not the client's job
to sanitize this.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.480
PROFESSOR: But, I mean, that's
kind of like saying-- so

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.730
in a certain sense, we could
say that about processes,

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.360
too, in Unix or Windows.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.460
So we could say it's
sort of developers' jobs

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.150
to make sure those
things stay isolated.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.090
But in fact, the
OS and the hardware

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.840
as well has an
important role to play,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.087
because [INAUDIBLE] trusted
whereas any two arbitrary

00:17:57.087 --> 00:17:59.170
programs developed by any
two arbitrary developers

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.670
may or may not be trusted to
sort of implement security

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:02.180
correctly.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:02.971
But you're correct.

00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:05.100
And in fact, frameworks
like Django or whatnot,

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.891
they actually try to
help you to get around

00:18:06.891 --> 00:18:08.860
some of these problems.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.350
So anyways, so yeah, so filters
are not a perfect solution.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:18.460
And also, filters
can't prevent what's

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:27.120
known as a persistent--
persistent-- cross-site

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.590
scripting attacks.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.430
This is known as sort of a
reflected or transient one,

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.290
because this script code just
sort of lives in the URL.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.460
Then once the user's
closed that URL,

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.941
basically, the attack's gone.

00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:40.440
But you could imagine
that you could

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:51.510
have someone who-- user puts
malicious HTML in the Comment

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.285
section for a website.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:03.570
And if the web server actually
accepts that comment is valid,

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.950
then that comment, with
this malicious payload,

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.580
can essentially
live there forever.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.330
So whenever any user
goes there, they

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.280
would be exposed to
that malicious content.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.000
Another example,
which is sort of

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.750
funny and sad, as
all these things,

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.985
is if you look at
dating websites.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.790
So some dating
websites actually allow

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:29.600
users to put full-blown
HTML in their profile.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.740
So what does that mean?

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.860
So when someone else is
lonely, presumably, or looking

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.200
to find their one true soul
match, they go to your website.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.210
They're going to
run HTML that you've

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.450
crafted in the context
of their session.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.390
And so that can also be a
very damaging attack as well.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.040
So just doing these
kinds of filters

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.901
don't protect against
things like that.

00:19:49.901 --> 00:19:52.065
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
in the Comments

00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:55.673
section presumably does
that by setting a post--

00:19:55.673 --> 00:19:58.879
the information goes to the
server in a post variable

00:19:58.879 --> 00:20:00.290
or something like that?

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.220
PROFESSOR: So there's a
bunch of different ways

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.210
you could imagine doing it.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.495
Yeah.

00:20:02.495 --> 00:20:04.494
So one way you could
imagine doing it is a post.

00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:06.795
Another way you could imagine
doing it is a dynamic XML

00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:07.516
HTTP request.

00:20:07.516 --> 00:20:08.450
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.597
But if it's like a post, why
can't you just scan through it

00:20:11.597 --> 00:20:13.430
and do the same thing
that you have in the--

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.830
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.040
So you're exactly
correct about that,

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.831
and we'll discuss some
of that in a second.

00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:18.915
But you're exactly
correct that the server

00:20:18.915 --> 00:20:20.290
side of the
application should be

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.246
very defensive and
mistrustful of this stuff.

00:20:22.246 --> 00:20:23.245
So you're exactly right.

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:25.860
So you could imagine that
when the server maybe

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.560
saw something like
this, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.315
even if the browser did not.

00:20:30.315 --> 00:20:32.400
You're correct about that.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:32.900
All right.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.740
So that's basically a survey
of these cross-site filters

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.410
in the browser.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:43.510
So another defense against
cross-site scripting

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:49.480
is something known
as HTTP-only cookies.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.430
And so the basic
idea behind this

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.550
is that a server can
actually tell the browser

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.380
that client-side
JavaScript should not

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.970
be able to access a
particular cookie.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.000
And so basically,
the server can just

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.187
send a header value in response
in the set Cookie field.

00:21:10.187 --> 00:21:12.270
It can say, hey, don't let
clients like JavaScript

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.070
manipulate this cookie.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.570
So only the server
could do this.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.020
And so this is only a
partial defense, though,

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.820
because the attacker can
still issue requests that

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.310
contain the user's cookies.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.450
So this was the
cross-site request forgery

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.130
that we looked at
in last lecture.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.891
So even if JavaScript code
can't manipulate cookies,

00:21:33.891 --> 00:21:35.766
the attacker can still
do things like conjure

00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:39.700
up a URL to some e-commerce
site, let's say buy.com.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.150
The attacker can put whatever
item the attacker wants to buy.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.710
So puts a Ferrari, for example.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:52.040
And then the attacker can then
say, who should this go to?

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.281
This should go to the attacker.

00:21:55.281 --> 00:21:57.030
And so even though
clients like JavaScript

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:58.789
can't access the
cookie, there's nothing

00:21:58.789 --> 00:22:00.830
that prevents the attacker
from just conjuring up

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.130
a URL like this.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.671
This is what some
of the CSRF tokens

00:22:04.671 --> 00:22:06.170
help to prevent
against, which we'll

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.230
talk about a little bit later.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.330
So another thing
that you can try

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.090
to do to prevent these
cross-site scripting attacks

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.810
is privilege separation.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.670
And so the idea
here is basically

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:36.630
that you want to use a separate
domain for all the content that

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:37.225
is untrusted.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:46.400
And so for example, a lot of
the online server providers

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.200
were things like email or
online productivity suites.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.620
So think Google Docs, Office
365, so on and so forth.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.790
They actually use
a separate domain

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.570
to host user-submitted content.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.990
So Google, I think
they still use this.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.940
They used to put all
the stuff that users

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.782
submitted into
some special domain

00:23:04.782 --> 00:23:05.990
called googleusercontent.com.

00:23:11.492 --> 00:23:13.270
And so here, they
would put things

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.880
like cached copies of pages,
your Gmail [INAUDIBLE],

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.320
and things like this.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.430
And at least as of
a year or two ago,

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.990
this is like one of the top 25
[? Alexa-visited ?] domains,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.970
because Google services
were so popular.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.670
And so what's the advantage
of putting stuff in here?

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.740
Well, the hope, at
least, is that if there

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.700
is some type of cross-site
scripting vulnerability

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.810
or something like this in
a user-submitted content,

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.240
then hopefully, the
daemons would just

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.700
be limited to that domain.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.122
It wouldn't actually affect
the full-blown google.com.

00:23:46.122 --> 00:23:48.185
This isn't a perfect
defense, though,

00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:50.590
because user-submitted
content may have references

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.695
to things from google.com.

00:23:51.695 --> 00:23:53.480
And so once again,
this is only sort

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.326
of a partial fix for a much
more pervasive problem.

00:23:58.326 --> 00:23:59.700
Now, another thing
you could do--

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.430
and this gets back to the
gentleman's suggestion

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.740
over here is that
we can actually

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.695
do content sanitization.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:21.570
And so the idea here is that,
essentially, whenever you--

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.170
where you can be the browser,
where you can be the web

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.730
server, or whatever-- whenever
you receive untrusted content,

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.930
you don't trust it at all.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.230
And so you go through it, and
you do things to sort of render

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.210
it sort of neutral such
that it can't actually

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.530
execute code or subvert
your system in any way.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:45.820
And so an example of this is
the Django template system.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.896
And so Django is an
example of a web framework.

00:24:53.896 --> 00:24:55.645
So basically, the
high-level web framework

00:24:55.645 --> 00:24:59.560
is something that helps
to automate and secure

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.700
some of the sort of tedious
tasks of developing a website.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.740
So it will help you with
making database access easier.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.380
It'll help you with doing
things like session management.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.520
And it will also help you with
maintaining a consistent look

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.847
and feel across your website.

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:18.180
And so one way to maintain
that consistent look and feel

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.040
is to use this
notion of templates.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.490
So all of your
pages automatically

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.510
start out with the
same CSS and things

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.700
like that, the same styles.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.420
But then there's these
portions in the web page

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.840
where you can specialize
it with the particular news

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.420
article that's at the top of
everybody's mind that day,

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.630
or something like that,
or user-specific content.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.780
So for example, in Django,
you can look at a template,

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.950
and it might look like
something like this.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.790
So you have a bold tag.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:48.350
It says, Hello.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.850
And then you have these braces
here, these double braces.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.815
And it says, name.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.360
And so essentially,
what this means

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.000
is that this is like a
placeholder variable.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.410
So essentially, these pages
get dynamically generated.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.780
So when the user goes
to a Django site,

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.310
the Django server says,
OK, well, this name

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.850
is going to be somewhere,
who knows, in the cookie.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.120
Maybe it's going to be in
a CGI string, whatever.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.100
And so as the Django
server dynamically

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.990
generates the page
[? to return ?] to user,

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.470
it replaces this
special reference here

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.339
with whatever the value
of this variable is.

00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:24.630
So it's pretty straightforward.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.630
This is kind of like that
dinky CGI server I showed you.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.480
So just reflecting
user-submitted content

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.320
right here.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.930
But Django actually does it
better than the silly CGI

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.260
server that I showed you,
because it uses this notion

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.620
of content sanitization.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.387
So Django expects that
users may be adversarial.

00:26:41.387 --> 00:26:42.970
So it's not just
going to directly put

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.680
the value of the
name variable here.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.460
Instead, it is going to
encode it in such a way

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.583
that this content will
never be able to escape out

00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:53.292
of the HTML context
and execute JavaScript

00:26:53.292 --> 00:26:54.250
or something like this.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.666
So for example,
one thing it'll do

00:26:55.666 --> 00:27:00.180
is it'll take the
angle brackets,

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:05.350
and it will translate them
into these HTML entities.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:09.380
So the less than character
gets transformed into this.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:16.060
The greater than character
gets translated into this.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:24.720
Double quotations get
translated into ampersand quote,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.950
and so on and so forth.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.200
And so what this ensures is
that if the content the user put

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.520
in name actually tries
to contain angle brackets

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.367
or things like this, then
it'll basically be neutered.

00:27:35.367 --> 00:27:36.950
And it'll be translated
into something

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.890
that would not be
interpreted as HTML

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.540
on the client-side browser.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.740
So does that make sense?

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.361
So now I know that this is not
a completely foolproof defense

00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:50.360
against some of this
cross-site scripting stuff.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.610
And the reason, as we
showed in the example,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.800
is that these grammars for
HTML, and CSS, and JavaScript

00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.320
are so complicated that
it's very easy to confuse

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.490
the browser's parser.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:07.020
So for example, let's say that
you had something like this.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.880
And this is a very
common thing to do

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.510
in frameworks like Django.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.350
So you have some div.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:20.380
And then you want to set
its class dynamically.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:26.692
So you set its class to some
var, so on and so forth.

00:28:26.692 --> 00:28:28.650
So the idea is that when
Django processes this,

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.540
it should figure out what the
current styling is and then put

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.360
it in here.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.850
Well, one thing
you can do is maybe

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:38.740
the attacker supplies something
like a string like this.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.690
So attacker will say, class 1.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.400
OK, so far so good, because
that seems like a valid CSS

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.052
expression.

00:28:46.052 --> 00:28:47.510
But then the attacker
will then try

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:51.210
to put some JavaScript here.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:57.980
So it might say, onclick
equals-- and then put

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.400
JavaScript URL.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:06.740
And then put some
function call here.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.650
So this is malformed.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.787
The browser should probably
just do a fail-stop here.

00:29:12.787 --> 00:29:14.370
But the problem is
that if you've ever

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.550
looked at the HTML for a
real web page, all of it's

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.250
broken, even for like
legitimate, benevolent sites.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.960
People just can't hack HTML.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.500
So if the browser
were to be fail-stop,

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.910
literally, no site that you
enjoy would ever work ever.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.990
If you ever want to be
disappointed by the world

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.120
if I haven't helped
you do that enough,

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.620
open up your JavaScript console
when you browse a website

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.710
and see how many
errors get spit out.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.400
Like, go to CNN and just see
how many errors get spit out.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.725
CNN basically kind of works,
but it's very disturbing,

00:29:44.725 --> 00:29:46.600
because if you were to
open up Acrobat reader

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.650
and you're just
constantly throwing

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.220
null pointer
exceptions, you would

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.390
feel a bit cheated by life.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:53.072
But in the web, apparently,
we've learned to accept this.

00:29:53.072 --> 00:29:55.530
So because browsers have to be
so tolerant of these things,

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:57.940
they will actually try
to massage malformed code

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.490
into something that
seems reasonable.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.239
And therein lies a
security vulnerability.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.120
So I guess the
take-home point for this

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.666
is that content
sanitization kind of works.

00:30:12.666 --> 00:30:14.290
So it is literally
better than nothing.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.240
It can actually
catch a lot of cases.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.140
But in many cases, it
is not a full defense.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.970
And so one thing you might
actually think about doing

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:28.200
is-- actually, let's
put this over here.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:36.808
You might think about sort of
using a less expressive markup

00:30:36.808 --> 00:30:37.308
language.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.540
So what do I mean by that?

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.200
So HTML and CSS and JavaScript
are [? touring ?] complete.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.721
They allow you to do all kinds
of fun things, but-- yeah?

00:30:49.721 --> 00:30:50.970
AUDIENCE: Sorry to bother you.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.151
When does content
sanitization not work?

00:30:54.151 --> 00:30:55.400
PROFESSOR: When does content--

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.140
AUDIENCE: In many
cases, it doesn't work.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:57.610
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.200
So like in this
case, for example,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.630
Django will probably not be
able to statically determine

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.730
this is a bad thing.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:04.980
Like, in this particular case.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.450
But in the case where I inserted
that malformed image tag--

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:10.374
I basically said--

00:31:10.374 --> 00:31:11.790
AUDIENCE: In that
particular case,

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.100
I would expect the
class=assignment to be

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.600
in quotes and then for that
thing to not have any effect.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.830
So Django could enforce
codes that [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.330
PROFESSOR: Well, see, there's
a little bit trickiness there,

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:28.000
because if we assumed that
all pages were written-- well,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.380
pull me back up a little bit.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.010
If we assume the HTML
grammar was well specified

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.080
and the CSS grammar
was well specified

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.920
and so on and so
forth, then you could

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.620
imagine a world in which
perfect parsers would

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.060
be able to sort of
catch these problems

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.490
or somehow convert
them to normal things.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:46.940
But in fact, the HTML
grammars and the CSS grammars

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.860
are not well specified.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.930
And then on top of that,
browsers don't implement specs.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.010
So it's like Babushka
dolls of terror.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.219
So I mean, this, in fact,
gets into this notion here.

00:31:57.219 --> 00:31:59.135
Because I think essentially
what you're saying

00:31:59.135 --> 00:32:01.650
is, well, look, if we have
the grammar for something,

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.420
that should mean something.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.220
And as it turns
out, if you stick

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.346
to a less expressive grammar,
then it is actually much easier

00:32:09.346 --> 00:32:10.470
to do content sanitization.

00:32:13.704 --> 00:32:14.620
There's some language.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:20.740
It's called Markdown
instead of markup.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.550
[? Wall, ?] right?

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.310
And so with Markdown,
the basic idea

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.100
is that it's designed
to be a language that

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.750
allows, for example,
users to submit comments,

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.415
but it doesn't actually have
things like the blank tag,

00:32:32.415 --> 00:32:34.530
and applet support,
and stuff like that.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.700
And so in Markdown, it's
actually much easier

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.360
to do what you suggested, which
seems like a reasonable thing

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.910
at first glance.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.580
Just define the grammar
unambiguously and then just

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.880
enforce that grammar.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.930
So it's much easier
to do sanitization

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.410
in a simple language than
in the full-blown HTML, CSS,

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.035
and JavaScript.

00:32:53.035 --> 00:32:54.630
And in a certain
sense, think about it

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.680
like the difference between
understanding gnarly C

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.110
code versus gnarly Python code.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.710
There's actually
a big difference

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.820
in trying to understand that
much more expressive language.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.670
Because it can do
many more things.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.427
By constraining
expressivity, you oftentimes

00:33:09.427 --> 00:33:10.135
improve security.

00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:13.820
Does that all make sense?

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:17.940
All right.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.900
So another thing
that you can imagine

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.270
doing to protect against
cross-site scripting attacks

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:31.040
is to use something called
CSP, Content Security Policy.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.560
And so the idea behind
CSP is that it's going

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.295
to allow a web server to-- oh.

00:33:43.295 --> 00:33:45.878
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm just curious
about this Markdown language.

00:33:45.878 --> 00:33:50.864
So all browsers know how
to parse this language?

00:33:50.864 --> 00:33:51.780
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.030
So what happens with a lot
of these types of languages

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.640
is that you essentially--
you can convert them.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.080
You can pile them down to
HTML, but they're not natively

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.700
understood by the
browser, typically.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:09.120
So in other words, you've got
some comment submission system.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.840
It internally expresses
stuff in Markdown.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.819
But then before it can
be rendered to the page,

00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:16.224
it essentially goes to
the Markdown compiler.

00:34:16.224 --> 00:34:18.265
The Markdown compiler then
translates it to HTML.

00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:19.017
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:34:19.017 --> 00:34:20.508
Thanks.

00:34:20.508 --> 00:34:23.725
[INAUDIBLE] Markdown
might not be

00:34:23.725 --> 00:34:25.300
the best trick
[? to use Markdown ?]

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.934
[INAUDIBLE].

00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:28.850
PROFESSOR: So Markdown
does allow inline HTML.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.750
As far as I know,
there's a way to disable

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.844
that in the compiler.

00:34:31.844 --> 00:34:33.010
I could be wrong about that.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.595
But I believe that
there's a flag

00:34:34.595 --> 00:34:36.790
you can pass to get rid of it.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:37.770
But you're correct.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.565
If you use a
constrained language

00:34:39.565 --> 00:34:42.380
but then you embed an
unconstrained language,

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.219
then that-- I mean, the
terrorists have won.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:47.360
So you're right about that.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:47.900
OK.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:48.400
Yeah.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.480
So another thing you can
do to improve security

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.550
is this thing called
Content Security Policy.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.230
So like I was saying, what
this allows the server to do

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:01.140
is to tell a web browser
what types of content

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.470
can be loaded in the
page it's sending back,

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.510
and also where that
content should come from.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:10.270
So for example, in
an HTTP response,

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.060
the server might be able
to say something like this.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:20.640
It'd include the Content
Security Policy header.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.390
And then it might say
something like the default

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:31.220
source is going to equal self.

00:35:34.811 --> 00:35:39.250
And it will also accept things
from asterisk mydomain.com.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.860
So what does this mean?

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:50.300
So essentially, the server
is saying the content

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.680
from this site should
only come from whatever

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.250
it is that the domain is
for the particular page.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:01.210
And any other subdomain
from mydomain.com.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.640
So what that means,
basically, is

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.745
that let's say if self
was bound to foo.com,

00:36:07.745 --> 00:36:11.039
let's say, that's the origin
of the server that's sending

00:36:11.039 --> 00:36:12.330
this thing back to the browser.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.540
So if, somehow, there is
a cross-site scripting

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.325
attack and the page tried
to generate a reference to,

00:36:17.325 --> 00:36:19.490
let's say, bar.com,
the browser would say,

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.960
OK, bar.com is not self.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.695
Bar.com is also not in this
sort of set of domains.

00:36:25.695 --> 00:36:27.320
So therefore, the
browser can just say,

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.390
I will not allow that
request to go forward.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:33.960
So this is actually a
pretty powerful mechanism.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.450
And you can actually specify
more fine-grained controls

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:36.950
here.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.880
You can say, my images
should come from here.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.700
My scripts should come from
here, so on and so forth.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.150
This is actually pretty nice.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.610
And one nice thing
about this, too,

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:50.440
is that it actually
prevents inline JavaScript.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.856
So you can't have script tag
and then some literal JavaScript

00:36:53.856 --> 00:36:54.730
and close script tag.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.350
Everything has to come from
a script tag with a source.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:59.850
So it can be validated
through this.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.150
And also, a Content
Security Policy

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:05.230
prevents these danger
statements like eval.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.840
So eval basically
allows a web page

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.200
to check dynamically
generated JavaScript code.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.070
And so if the CSP
header is specified,

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:17.720
the browser does
not execute evals.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.358
So does that all make sense?

00:37:19.358 --> 00:37:21.848
AUDIENCE: So since it's a
kind of ad-hoc set of things,

00:37:21.848 --> 00:37:26.247
is that like a complete set
of things that it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:26.247 --> 00:37:26.830
PROFESSOR: No.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.490
So there's a whole
list of resources

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.100
that it actually protects.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.057
So this is sort of like the
most blanket type protection

00:37:34.057 --> 00:37:34.640
you could get.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.000
But like I said,
it actually allows

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.230
you to specify, I think,
like, where CSS can come from,

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.586
like a bunch of
different things.

00:37:39.586 --> 00:37:41.404
AUDIENCE: But on preventing
evals, that seems

00:37:41.404 --> 00:37:42.654
like the system's [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:42.654 --> 00:37:45.050
Are there are other
things [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:46.540
PROFESSOR: So yeah, there are.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.540
So there's always this
question of completeness.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.610
So for example, eval
is not the only way

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:56.240
JavaScript can actually
generate code dynamically.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.250
There's the function
constructor, for example.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.250
There's certain ways you
can call a set timeout.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:01.270
You pass in a string.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:03.000
You can evaluate code that way.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.590
So I believe that CSP actually
shuts down those vectors

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.410
as well.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.580
But if you're asking, is this
provably complete in terms

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.746
of what it isolates, no.

00:38:11.746 --> 00:38:13.620
And I don't think that
any of these solutions

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.830
are provably complete.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:18.830
AUDIENCE: One really
interesting thing about CSP

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.860
is the fact that you can set
it to disallow all inline

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.194
[? dom ?] script on a page.

00:38:23.194 --> 00:38:23.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.401
That's right.

00:38:24.401 --> 00:38:24.901
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:24.901 --> 00:38:27.234
AUDIENCE: Which [? helps ?]
[INAUDIBLE] to be sanitized.

00:38:27.234 --> 00:38:27.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:32.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
prevents an attacker from--

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.160
PROFESSOR: So that
helps with some things.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.400
But that still would allow,
like, [INAUDIBLE] to use eval.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.530
So that's why it's
important to try to get rid

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.340
of all of those dynamically.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.102
All of those interfaces
[? use dynamic ?]

00:38:44.102 --> 00:38:44.829
code generation.

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:47.245
AUDIENCE: If you list your tag
with a source but then also

00:38:47.245 --> 00:38:50.260
inline code, is there like
standardized [INAUDIBLE] that

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.764
all browsers do with--

00:38:52.764 --> 00:38:53.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:57.960
So what should happen
is that the inline code

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.320
should be ignored.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.660
The browser should
always get the code

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.940
from the source attribute.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.290
I actually don't know
if all browsers do that.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.850
I've actually
personally experienced

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.490
browsers exhibit different
behavior [? in that. ?]

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:14.280
This was a couple years
ago, so I'm not sure.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:14.780
And so yeah.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.840
So one thing to keep in
mind about doing work

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.780
in web security is
that in a sense,

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.450
it's almost like
a natural science.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.180
So it's like people
actually propose theories

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.390
about how browsers work.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:26.914
And then you go
seeing them do that.

00:39:26.914 --> 00:39:28.830
And so that can be a
little bit disappointing,

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.790
because we're taught, yay,
algorithms, and proofs,

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:32.660
and stuff like that.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.940
But these browsers are
so ill-behaved that a lot

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.440
of times, the answer
is maybe or maybe not.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.140
And then [? you go ?]
see, as we'll see.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.390
They keep on adding features.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.890
It gets back to
your question about,

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.530
are these things
provably complete?

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:52.260
I think web vendors have punted
on this notion of creating

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.840
a browser that is
provably [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.345
Basically, what
they try to do is

00:39:56.345 --> 00:39:58.386
just try to keep one step
ahead of the attackers.

00:39:58.386 --> 00:40:00.944
And we'll see some examples of
that further in the lecture.

00:40:00.944 --> 00:40:01.828
So yeah.

00:40:01.828 --> 00:40:04.310
So CSP is actually pretty cool.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:09.920
Another thing that's useful is
that the server can set this

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:16.500
HTTP header called
X-Content-Type-Options,

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.266
and then can say, nosniff.

00:40:19.266 --> 00:40:23.395
And so what this means is
that this prevents the browser

00:40:23.395 --> 00:40:26.570
from doing some of those, quote,
unquote, helpful optimizations,

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:29.595
like we discussed last lecture,
where it will say, a-ha,

00:40:29.595 --> 00:40:31.936
there's a mismatch
between the file extension

00:40:31.936 --> 00:40:34.560
and the actual [? bytes ?] that
I have sniffed in the contents.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.660
So let me somehow
massage this content

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.120
to some different thing.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.996
And then all of a sudden, you've
given the barbarians the keys

00:40:39.996 --> 00:40:40.620
to the kingdom.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.453
So you can set this
header to basically say,

00:40:42.453 --> 00:40:43.555
browser, do not do that.

00:40:43.555 --> 00:40:45.180
And so that can be
useful in mitigating

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.430
some types of attacks as well.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.930
All right.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.850
So that's kind of a
quick survey of some

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:55.352
of these cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities.

00:40:55.352 --> 00:41:03.030
So now let's look at another
popular vector for attacks.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:08.524
And that vector is
going to be SQL.

00:41:08.524 --> 00:41:15.440
And so you've probably heard
of these SQL injection attacks.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.910
And so what these attacks do is
they take advantage of the fact

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.720
that on the back end,
for a lot of websites,

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.295
there's some type of database.

00:41:24.295 --> 00:41:26.170
And so to dynamically
construct a page that's

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:27.720
shown to the user,
there have to be

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.190
some database queries that are
issued to that back-end server.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:37.370
So imagine that you have some
query that looked like this.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.850
So you do a SELECT asterisk.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:45.600
So give me all the values
from this query FROM

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:58.970
some particular table,
WHERE the User ID field

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:07.820
is equal to something
that is specified

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:13.986
over the web from some
potentially untrusted source.

00:42:13.986 --> 00:42:16.680
So at this point, I may think
we all know how this story ends.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.430
It ends very badly
There are no survivors.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:20.990
So basically, if this comes
from someone untrusted,

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:23.780
then you can do all kinds of
[? chicaner ?] stuff here.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:27.380
So one thing you could do
is if you want to be a jerk,

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:32.520
you could just set
this to the string, 0

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.070
and then something
like DELETE TABLE.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.270
So what happens here?

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:44.575
So basically, the database
server's going to say,

00:42:44.575 --> 00:42:48.249
OK, I'll set the user ID to 0;.

00:42:48.249 --> 00:42:49.540
Here's a sort of a new command.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.320
DELETE TABLE.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.114
OK, cheers, there
goes your table.

00:42:52.114 --> 00:42:52.780
And you're done.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.320
And in fact, there
was a viral image that

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.410
went around a couple years ago.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.993
It's unclear if it
was true, like many

00:42:56.993 --> 00:42:57.930
of these viral images.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:59.750
But it was that
people in Germany

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:03.830
had license plates that
actually said 0; DELETE TABLE.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.460
Because the idea is that
the security cameras,

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:11.160
they would use OCR, Optical
Character Recognition,

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.270
to figure out what your license
plate was, and then put it

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:15.505
in a SQL database.

00:43:15.505 --> 00:43:17.365
And there were images
floating around.

00:43:17.365 --> 00:43:19.250
These Volkswagens,
people would have

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.586
this as their license plate.

00:43:21.586 --> 00:43:22.710
I don't know if that works.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:23.070
It's funny.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.570
So I like to believe
that it's true.

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:26.036
But who knows.

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:27.660
But you get the basic
idea behind that.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.860
So once again, the
idea is you want

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.210
to be sure to sanitize this
content that you're getting

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:35.880
from these untrusted sources.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.040
And so note that
there may be some sort

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.062
of straightforward things
that don't quite work.

00:43:40.062 --> 00:43:41.603
So you might think,
OK, well then why

00:43:41.603 --> 00:43:46.720
can't I just put another
quote here and then

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.650
put another quote here
such that whatever

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:52.490
it is that the attacker
submits, it's going

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:54.014
to be enclosed in a string?

00:43:54.014 --> 00:43:56.430
So this doesn't work, because
then the attacker can always

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:59.080
just put a quote inside
his or her attack string.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.150
So a lot of times, these
sort of half-hearted hacks

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:04.680
don't really get you the
security you think they might.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:10.470
So the solution here
is that you need

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:14.335
to rigorously encode your data.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.640
And once again, that just means
that when you get information

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.360
from an untrusted source,
don't just stick it

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.420
in the system sort of as it is.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.300
Make sure that, for
example, it can actually

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.880
escape from whatever
sandbox or whatnot you think

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.390
you're actually putting into.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.750
So for example, you want to
put in an Escape function that

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.360
would prevent
maybe the semicolon

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.850
operator from showing up in a
raw form and things like this.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.350
And so a lot of
these web frameworks

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:52.850
like Django will actually have
built-in libraries to do things

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:54.770
like character escaping
for SQL queries

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.600
to try to prevent
some of this stuff.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.210
And a lot of these
frameworks actually

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:00.740
encourage developers not
to ever directly interface

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:01.664
with the database.

00:45:01.664 --> 00:45:03.330
So it's like Django
itself would provide

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.280
some high-level interface which
does sanitization for you.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.160
It takes care of some of
these icky corner cases.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.011
But performance,
performance, performance.

00:45:12.011 --> 00:45:14.010
Sometimes people think
that these web frameworks

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:14.720
are too slow.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.928
So you will still see, on
the back end a lot of time,

00:45:16.928 --> 00:45:20.590
people will still make
these raw SQL queries.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:23.330
And that can lead to problems.

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:25.050
So you can also
imagine that there

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:33.280
are problems if the web
server takes in path names

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.840
from untrusted images.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:38.430
So imagine that
somewhere in your server,

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:39.640
you do something like this.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.644
You have an open call.

00:45:40.644 --> 00:45:42.060
And then you say
that you're going

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.355
to read from the WWW directory.

00:45:44.355 --> 00:45:49.500
You're going to read from the
images subdirectory in there.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.020
And then you're going to read
from some file name that, once

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.110
again, is supplied by the user.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.700
So as we saw in some of the
discussion of [? Troot ?]

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.270
and things like this, what
if this file name maps

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:08.475
to something like a bunch
of instances of the dot dot

00:46:08.475 --> 00:46:08.975
character?

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:17.610
So if you're not careful,
then the untrusted entity

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:20.984
can specify basically
glub, glub, glub, glub,

00:46:20.984 --> 00:46:22.442
and go down to etc
password and may

00:46:22.442 --> 00:46:24.180
be able to do some evil here.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.950
So once again, if you want
to be able to use the web

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:29.140
server or the web
framework, you need

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.320
to be able to detect these
dangerous characters,

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.470
escape them in
some way to prevent

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:38.150
sort of those raw
commands from executing.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.300
So yeah, it's all
pretty straightforward.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:40.800
OK.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:45.760
So let's move on from
the discussion of content

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:49.310
sanitization, and now let's
talk a little bit about cookies.

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:56.290
So cookies are a
very popular way

00:46:56.290 --> 00:47:02.620
to do session
management, to bind

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:07.920
the user to some
set of resources

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.086
that exist on the server side.

00:47:10.086 --> 00:47:12.460
And so a lot of frameworks
like Django, like [? zoobar ?]

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.300
that you see in this
class, they actually

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.520
put a random session
ID inside the cookie.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:23.630
And so the idea is that
this session ID is the index

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:27.770
into some server-side table.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.410
So you just supply
the session ID there.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:35.120
And this is where
your user info lives.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.690
And so as a result, this session
ID and cookies, by extension,

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.034
are very sensitive entities.

00:47:43.034 --> 00:47:44.450
And so that's why
a lot of attacks

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:46.860
involve stealing of
the cookie in order

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.480
to get that session ID.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.600
And so as we discussed
in the last lecture,

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.975
the same origin policy can
help you, to a certain extent,

00:47:52.975 --> 00:47:55.102
against some of these
cookie-stealing attacks,

00:47:55.102 --> 00:47:56.810
because there are
origin-based rules that

00:47:56.810 --> 00:48:00.050
prevent arbitrary
tampering with cookies.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:02.180
But one thing that's
a little bit subtle

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:07.000
is that you shouldn't share
a domain or a subdomain

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.510
with someone that
you don't trust.

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.460
Because as we discussed
in last lecture,

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.500
there are these sort
of very subtle rules

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.950
in which two origins with
the same domain or possibly

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:20.500
some subdomain relationship,
they can actually

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.540
access each other's cookies.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.130
And so if you trust a
domain that you shouldn't,

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:28.020
then that domain may be able
to do things like directly

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:32.390
set the session ID in that
cookie that both of you

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:33.680
can access.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.680
And that can do things
like allow the attacker

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.330
to force the user to use a
session ID of the attacker's

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:39.540
choosing.

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:41.500
And then, for
example-- let's say

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:46.310
the attacker sets the user's
Gmail cookie, let's say.

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:48.680
The user goes to Gmail,
types some emails.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.030
The attacker, later on,
can then use that cookie

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.780
or specifically use
that session ID,

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.870
load up Gmail, and
then access Gmail

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:59.040
as if he or she were the
user who was victimized.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.070
So there's a lot of subtleties
with using these cookies

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:03.720
for session management.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.490
So there's a lot more we
could talk about cookies.

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:08.625
We'll discuss some of it
today and last lecture.

00:49:08.625 --> 00:49:11.250
So you might be thinking, well,
can we just get rid of cookies?

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.765
Cookies just seem more
trouble than they're worth,

00:49:12.765 --> 00:49:15.431
just like [? dribbels. ?] So can
we just not have these cookies?

00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:18.920
So one thing you could imagine
is you could imagine basically

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:25.570
having some notion
of stateless cookies,

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.445
of somehow getting rid of the
notion of sessions altogether

00:49:29.445 --> 00:49:32.631
and preventing this
nasty attack vector that

00:49:32.631 --> 00:49:34.880
seems to be sort of prevalent
in all these discussions

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:35.750
that we have.

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:40.210
So the basic idea here is if you
want to go sort of stateless,

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.780
then this essentially
means you have

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:46.285
to authenticate every request.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.560
Because the nice
thing about cookies

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.820
is that they basically
follow you wherever you go.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.352
So you authenticate
once, and then

00:49:56.352 --> 00:49:57.485
every subsequent
request you make

00:49:57.485 --> 00:49:58.570
has this little token in it.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:01.020
But if you want to get rid of
those things, well then now

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.394
you essentially have to have
some proof of your authority

00:50:03.394 --> 00:50:05.747
in every request that you make.

00:50:05.747 --> 00:50:07.330
And so one way you
could imagine doing

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:13.580
this is by using something
called MAX, or Message

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.600
Authentication Codes.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:23.020
And so the basic way to
think about one of these MAX,

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.410
it's like a hash that
takes in a key as well.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.440
So the method
authentication code

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:34.290
is the hash of some key
and then some message.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:39.410
And so the basic idea is
that the client, the user,

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:43.206
and the server are going to
share some secret key, k.

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:48.060
And so the client uses that
key to produce a signature

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.550
over the message that
it sends to the server.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:52.960
And then the server,
who also knows the key,

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.710
can then use this
same function here

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:58.090
to validate if a
signature is correct.

00:50:58.090 --> 00:50:58.590
OK.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:03.650
So let's look at a very specific
example of how this works.

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:05.950
So one real service
that uses these types

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:09.740
of stateless cookies
is Amazon Web Services.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.280
So like x3, for example.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:21.950
And so basically, Amazon, AWS,
gives each user two things--

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:25.530
gives that user a secret key.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.890
And so this is
equivalent to the k

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:33.420
that we were
discussing over there.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:37.320
And it also gives them
a-- just think of it

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.120
like an AWS user ID.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.700
So this part is not
secret, but this part is.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:49.570
And so every time you want to
send a request to AWS via HTTP,

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:51.970
you have to send it
in a special format.

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:57.040
So you'll have the first
line of the GET request.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:04.680
So you want to
access some photos.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.800
No surprises here.

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:14.370
And then you will put
the host from which

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:15.585
you expect to get it.

00:52:15.585 --> 00:52:16.710
That's not super important.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:19.731
So this is just some
AWS server that's there.

00:52:19.731 --> 00:52:20.605
You'll have the date.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:28.830
So maybe this is Monday, June 4.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.470
Whatever.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:34.215
And then you have this
thing that's essentially

00:52:34.215 --> 00:52:35.390
the Authorization field.

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.620
And this is where the message
authentication code comes in.

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:47.520
So essentially, what
this looks like is

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:51.660
you've got some string here.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:56.368
This represents your
access ID, the user ID.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:03.530
And then you've
got something here,

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:07.470
some other seemingly
random letters.

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:13.350
And then these things
are a signature

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:16.240
that use this Message
Authentication Code here.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:20.730
So what does that
signature look like?

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:24.250
So the details are a
little bit complicated.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:27.630
But basically, this
signature is over a string

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:30.110
that encapsulates a bunch
of details of this request.

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:36.500
So essentially,
the string assigned

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.950
looks something like this.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:43.360
So you put the
HTTP verb in there.

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:47.280
So in this case,
that verb is GET.

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:53.376
And then you put
[? indy5 ?] checksum

00:53:53.376 --> 00:53:55.100
of the message content.

00:53:57.612 --> 00:54:01.335
And then you also
put the content type.

00:54:01.335 --> 00:54:03.760
So it's html or
image or whatever.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.835
And put in the date.

00:54:07.575 --> 00:54:14.915
And then the resource name,
which is essentially the path

00:54:14.915 --> 00:54:16.180
that you see over here.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:19.650
So in other words,
this string here

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:26.620
is the message that you pass
into the H MAC over here.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:32.230
And so note that the server
can see all this stuff

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:34.501
in clear text in the request.

00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:36.000
And so that's what
allows the server

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.270
to validate that that
message authentication

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:39.850
code was correct.

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:43.965
Because note that the server
shares that key with the user.

00:54:43.965 --> 00:54:46.340
So that allows the server to
validate that kind of stuff.

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.065
So does that all make sense?

00:54:49.065 --> 00:54:51.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:51.770
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:53.145
So in this case,
for the content,

00:54:53.145 --> 00:54:55.603
that's probably going to be
nothing, like the empty string.

00:54:55.603 --> 00:54:58.670
But you can imagine there's like
a post or something like that.

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.900
You'd actually have
the data of the HTTP.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:04.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] which
is kind of an unfortunate

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:05.130
choice nowadays.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:07.060
PROFESSOR: So I
believe that they do.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.194
So I checked the Amazon
documentation yesterday.

00:55:10.194 --> 00:55:11.360
So I believe they do use it.

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.734
But I think-- I could be wrong,
but I think they actually

00:55:13.734 --> 00:55:16.056
use a stronger hash here.

00:55:16.056 --> 00:55:17.180
So that helps a little bit.

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.584
But you're right.
[? Indy5 ?] is not the best.

00:55:19.584 --> 00:55:22.686
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
this works.

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:23.380
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:26.060
So allow me to help
you, hopefully,

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.824
even though I'm the
guy who confused you

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:28.615
in the first place.

00:55:28.615 --> 00:55:32.180
So the basic idea
is that we want

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:34.830
to get rid of this notion of
this persistent cookie that's

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:37.100
always following
the user around.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.125
Now, the problem, though,
is that the server

00:55:39.125 --> 00:55:43.330
needs some way to identify
which client it's talking to.

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:44.930
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:49.160
going to ensure that
each client shares

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.470
a unique key with the server.

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:56.260
And so basically, whenever
the client sends a message

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:58.500
to the server, the
client is going

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.965
to send the message
before and then also send

00:56:00.965 --> 00:56:03.340
this special
cryptographic operation,

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.780
the result of this
operation here.

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:08.394
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK. [INAUDIBLE]
and then again, you hash it.

00:56:08.394 --> 00:56:09.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.280
So basically, to
first approximation,

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.000
like imagine in
the regular world,

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.932
like, this would
be some cookie here

00:56:14.932 --> 00:56:16.140
instead of the authorization.

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.556
But now we're getting rid of
the cookie, and we're saying,

00:56:18.556 --> 00:56:20.060
here's this clear text message.

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.880
And then here's
this crypto thing,

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.160
which basically allows
the server to figure out

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.990
who this thing came from.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:30.460
And so the server knows who
the user is, because that's

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:31.656
embedded in the clear.

00:56:31.656 --> 00:56:32.780
That's not a secret, right?

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.490
But this basically
allows the server

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:37.005
to say, aha, I know which
secret key this user

00:56:37.005 --> 00:56:39.795
should have been using
to create this if that

00:56:39.795 --> 00:56:41.345
is, in fact, the real user.

00:56:41.345 --> 00:56:42.706
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:56:42.706 --> 00:56:43.205
OK.

00:56:43.205 --> 00:56:43.929
Thanks.

00:56:43.929 --> 00:56:46.470
AUDIENCE: So what prevents the
attacker from finding the key?

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:47.692
Where is this secret key?

00:56:47.692 --> 00:56:49.358
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:56:49.358 --> 00:56:54.770
So in a lot of cases,
the client for AWS

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:58.150
is not a browser, but some
VM running in the cloud,

00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:59.040
for example.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.200
So you'll see sort of just
VM and VM communication.

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:06.110
You can also imagine,
too, that users

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:10.990
can sort of hand out these links
or embed them somehow in HTML.

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:16.750
So it's like you just have
sort of this-- inside the HTML

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:19.240
or JavaScript source
code, you'd have the code

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.549
to create a request like this.

00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:22.590
So that's almost like me
giving you a capability.

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:24.250
So if I give you
one of these things,

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:27.126
you can make that request
on my behalf, basically.

00:57:27.126 --> 00:57:28.835
AUDIENCE: So would
it be possible to use

00:57:28.835 --> 00:57:32.888
MACs on the normal
clients [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:32.888 --> 00:57:35.000
PROFESSOR: For a normal--
you mean like browsers?

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.470
AUDIENCE: For normal users.

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:38.020
PROFESSOR: Well, I mean,
you get into these questions

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.180
like, where does
the key live, which

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.930
was [? kind of like what ?]
he was asking.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.712
So in a certain extent, the
issue of where the key lives

00:57:43.712 --> 00:57:45.170
is actually super,
super important.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.010
Because if the key can be stolen
just as easily as the cookie,

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.544
well then we're sort
of back to square one.

00:57:50.544 --> 00:57:52.460
So in many cases, this
stuff is actually just,

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:54.200
as I said, sort of
server to server,

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.270
like a VM to VM
somewhere in the cloud.

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:58.185
So the application
developer runs

00:57:58.185 --> 00:58:03.518
a VM that sort of outsources a
bunch of stored stuff to AWS.

00:58:03.518 --> 00:58:06.500
AUDIENCE: So do you
think [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.979
but isn't that kind of like
a bad way of preventing--

00:58:09.979 --> 00:58:11.457
I mean, they have
network latency,

00:58:11.457 --> 00:58:13.623
so it can't be like too
fine-grained of a constraint

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:14.835
that they're putting on.

00:58:14.835 --> 00:58:17.251
If an attacker sends the same
request again really quickly

00:58:17.251 --> 00:58:20.120
after the user, wouldn't
they be able to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.850
So suffice it to say that
secure timestamping is

00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:27.540
like several
people's PhD theses.

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:31.650
But you're exactly right that if
this-- just as a crude example.

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:35.370
So imagine this just
said, Monday, June 4.

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:38.470
Then if, somehow, the
attacker could get access

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:40.040
to this entire
thing and there was

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.860
nothing that was
different about it--

00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.370
so there was no [? knocks, ?]
no random stuff like that,

00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:45.120
then that's right.

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.770
Then that request
could be [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:51.270
Now, one thing that
AWS actually does

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:53.145
is you can actually
include an expiration

00:58:53.145 --> 00:58:55.610
date in these things.

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:58.820
So one thing you
can actually do is

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:05.670
add sort of an Expires
field, essentially,

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:07.097
have that thing be assigned.

00:59:07.097 --> 00:59:09.680
Then I can hand that reference
to a bunch of different people.

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.930
Kind of like I was saying
in response to his question,

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:13.730
it acts as a capability.

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:15.770
The server can then check
that expiration date

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:18.200
from when it actually sees
it and then not actually--

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.658
AUDIENCE: But even if
the expiration date

00:59:19.658 --> 00:59:21.949
is like 200 milliseconds in
the future or something, as

00:59:21.949 --> 00:59:24.518
long as the attacker
has [INAUDIBLE] latency,

00:59:24.518 --> 00:59:27.920
then they might
send two [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.684
two copies instead of one.

00:59:29.684 --> 00:59:30.350
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:31.010
That's exactly right.

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.884
That's exactly right.

00:59:31.884 --> 00:59:35.090
So yeah, if the
attacker can somehow--

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:36.810
like a network
attacker, for example,

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:39.480
is seeing these things go over
the wire-- and you're right.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:43.379
If there's enough wiggle
room in the expiration date,

00:59:43.379 --> 00:59:44.920
then they can exactly
do that attack.

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.810
That's right.

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:49.030
OK.

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:54.260
So that is an overview of how
these stateless cookies work.

00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.900
And so one question
that's interesting

00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:58.790
is you might think, well,
what does it mean to log out

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:00.670
with this type of cookie?

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:03.455
And the answer is that
you don't really log out.

01:00:03.455 --> 01:00:04.880
I mean, you have this key.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.210
And so whenever you want to send
a request, you just send it.

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:10.254
You include this
dude right here,

01:00:10.254 --> 01:00:11.420
and then you're ready to go.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.419
Now, one thing the server
could do, for example,

01:00:13.419 --> 01:00:15.660
though, is revoke your key.

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.100
So the server revokes your key.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.862
Then you can generate
one of these things.

01:00:18.862 --> 01:00:20.570
But when you send the
message over there,

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.320
the server's going to say, aha,
I know what your user ID is.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.310
You've been revoked, so I'm not
going to honor your request.

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:27.894
But it's a little
bit interesting.

01:00:27.894 --> 01:00:30.060
And revocation, as we'll
talk more about with things

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:34.390
like SSL, is always a tricky
issue, because as it turns out,

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:36.101
taking authority
away from human users

01:00:36.101 --> 01:00:38.225
is often much more difficult
than giving it to them

01:00:38.225 --> 01:00:40.550
in the first place.

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:44.795
So that's the basic
idea behind these sort

01:00:44.795 --> 01:00:46.971
of stateless cookies.

01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:50.650
So there's also a
couple other things

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:54.030
that you can use if
you want to avoid

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:58.740
traditional cookies for
implementing authentication.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.572
So one thing you
can imagine doing

01:01:00.572 --> 01:01:17.870
is actually using DOM storage to
hold client-side authentication

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:19.130
information.

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:21.713
This says "alternatives" in case
you couldn't [? read that. ?]

01:01:21.713 --> 01:01:24.240
So one thing you could
do is to use DOM storage

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.500
to hold some of
that session state

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.729
that you would ordinarily
put inside of a cookie.

01:01:28.729 --> 01:01:30.270
So if you remember
from last lecture,

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:33.255
DOM storage is essentially
a key value interface

01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:36.050
that the browser
provides to each origin.

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:39.050
So you can say GET and PUT
in both the key and eval

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:41.654
[? strings. ?] So you could
imagine putting authentication

01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:42.445
stuff inside there.

01:01:42.445 --> 01:01:47.060
Now, the nice thing about this
is that DOM storage actually

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:49.777
has much less wacky
rules with respect

01:01:49.777 --> 01:01:50.860
to the same origin policy.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.605
So if it were
cookies, you can do

01:01:52.605 --> 01:01:55.040
all these tricks with
subdomains and stuff like that.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.410
It got kind of weird.

01:01:56.410 --> 01:02:00.036
DOM storage is actually strictly
tied to a single origin.

01:02:00.036 --> 01:02:01.910
You can't do any of this
subdomain expansion,

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:03.070
all that kind of stuff.

01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:05.610
And so frameworks like
Meteor use DOM storage

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:06.510
for this very reason.

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:08.760
But now, note that if you
want to store authentication

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.450
information in DOM
storage, then you

01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:13.460
have to write JavaScript code
yourself to actually pass

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.660
that authentication
information to the server

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.451
to do the [? encryption ?]
that's necessary

01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:19.320
and so on and so forth.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.700
So that's one
thing you could do.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:24.300
Another thing you
could do is actually

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:28.360
use client-side certificates.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:34.510
So for example, like
an x.509 format.

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:37.240
And so what's nice
about these certificates

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.480
is that, basically, JavaScript
has no explicit interface

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.680
to access these things.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.233
So unlike cookies, where
there's always this arms race

01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:47.646
to find these weird
same-origin bugs,

01:02:47.646 --> 01:02:50.830
there's no explicit JavaScript
interface for that stuff.

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:53.312
So that's very nice from
a security perspective.

01:02:53.312 --> 01:02:55.020
One problem that I
mentioned very briefly

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.145
that we'll look at in more
detail in later lectures

01:02:57.145 --> 01:02:58.940
is that the
revocation [? store ?]

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.140
is kind of hard for these.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.904
So once a user leaves
your organization,

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:04.570
how do you take back
their certificates?

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:07.380
And it becomes a
little bit tricky.

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.014
Also, these things don't
have great usability,

01:03:10.014 --> 01:03:12.180
because who wants to install
a bunch of certificates

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.734
for each site that you go to?

01:03:13.734 --> 01:03:15.900
So as a result, these things
have a lot of friction,

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.785
and these are not super
popular except for in companies

01:03:18.785 --> 01:03:20.910
or organizations that are
super security-conscious.

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:25.460
All right.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:29.860
So that concludes our
discussion of cookies.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:38.130
And so now let's talk about
protocol vulnerabilities

01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:39.340
in the web stack.

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:51.520
And so one kind of
interesting attack

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.620
is that there are all
these bugs in the way

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:58.222
that different browser
components parse URLs,

01:03:58.222 --> 01:03:59.578
for example.

01:03:59.578 --> 01:04:05.710
So how can URL parsing
get us into trouble?

01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:10.220
So suppose that we have a
URL that looks like this.

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:13.080
HTTP comes from example.com.

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:22.620
And then it's got an explicit
port specifies that it's 80.

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.710
And then for some
unknown reason,

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:30.380
it embeds this @ character here.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:34.090
So the question is,
well, what is the origin

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:37.230
of this particular URL?

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:41.710
So as it turns
out, so Flash would

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:49.060
say that the host name portion
of this was example.com.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:55.040
However, when the
browser would parse this,

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.980
it would say that the host
name part of the origin

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.680
was actually foo.com.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.220
So this is clearly a bad
thing, because once you

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.490
have two different
entities who are confused

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:07.540
about the origin of
the same resource,

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:10.220
then you can get into all
kinds of nasty problems.

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:14.717
So for example,
the Flash code can

01:05:14.717 --> 01:05:17.530
be malicious, can download
stuff from example.com.

01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:19.510
If it was embedded in
the page from foo.com,

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:22.245
it could then do some
evil things there.

01:05:22.245 --> 01:05:23.870
And it takes some
code from example.com

01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:25.460
and run it with the
authority of foo.com.

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.210
So there's a lot of
complex parsing rules

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:29.690
like that that make
life very difficult.

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:31.085
This is a continuing theme.

01:05:31.085 --> 01:05:34.650
Like, as we just saw with
the content sanitization--

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:37.150
so the basic idea that
it's oftentimes much better

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:39.534
to have simpler parsing
rules for this kind of stuff.

01:05:39.534 --> 01:05:41.200
It's difficult to do
that in retrospect,

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.380
though, because HTML's
already out there.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.790
So all aboard the wam-bulance.

01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:49.010
So this next one,
this is actually

01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:52.215
my all-time favorite
security vulnerability.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.730
So it basically attacks
the way that the browser

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:03.370
[? rule 1 ?] JAR files,
basically Java applets.

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:06.500
So in 2007, I
think-- yeah, 2007.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.170
So lifehacker.com--
great website

01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:09.280
if you haven't been to it.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.820
Lifehacker.com
basically explains

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:18.330
how you can embed ZIP
files inside of images.

01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:20.190
Now, it's not quite
clear who you're trying

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:21.590
to hide from by doing this.

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:24.210
But Lifehacker says you
can do it, so hurray.

01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:28.480
So basically, what they take
advantage of is the fact

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.200
that if you look at image
formats like GIF, for example,

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.530
typically, the way the
parser works is the parser

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.807
works from the top, down.

01:06:37.807 --> 01:06:39.390
So it finds information
in the header.

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:42.710
And then it sort of computes
on the rest of the bits here.

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:48.330
Now, what was interesting
is that, as it turns out,

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:51.270
programs which manipulate
ZIP files typically

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:53.215
work from the bottom up.

01:06:53.215 --> 01:06:56.250
So they find some information
in the footer of the file.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:59.400
Then they work up to try to
extract what's inside of it.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.030
So what Lifehacker
basically said

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:05.600
is that if you wanted to
hide a ZIP file on a merger

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.130
or something like this, then you
could actually post a GIF there

01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:13.290
that has this ZIP file here.

01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:17.170
It will pass all the validation
checks on Flickr or whatever

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:18.160
as an image.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.850
It will actually display as
an image in your browser.

01:07:20.850 --> 01:07:23.582
Aha, but only you
know the hidden truth,

01:07:23.582 --> 01:07:27.380
that if you take this file
here, you can pass it to unzip,

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.364
and it will unzip [INAUDIBLE]
information there.

01:07:30.364 --> 01:07:32.780
OK, fine, this seems like it's
sort of like a cheap parlor

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:33.279
trick.

01:07:33.279 --> 01:07:34.456
OK, that's nice.

01:07:34.456 --> 01:07:36.080
Now, attackers, of
course, never sleep,

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.371
and they want to ruin our life.

01:07:37.371 --> 01:07:38.660
So what did they realize?

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:45.140
They realize that JAR files
are basically derivatives

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:48.700
of the .ZIP format.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.830
So this meant that
you could actually

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:53.910
create a GIF or
an image that had

01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:56.850
a JAR file, executable
JavaScript code,

01:07:56.850 --> 01:07:58.360
at the bottom of it.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.130
So then people
called this attack--

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:05.940
they called it the GIFAR attack.

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:06.910
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:10.620
Half GIF, half JAR, all evil.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.655
Because this was amazing.

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:15.750
And so what did this
mean that you could do?

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:17.340
Well, it's actually
quite subtle.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.979
Because people first
discovered this,

01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:20.930
they thought it was amazing,
but they didn't quite

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:21.888
know how to exploit it.

01:08:21.888 --> 01:08:24.310
But as it turns out, you can
do things like the following.

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:26.729
So first of all, how do you
make one of these things?

01:08:26.729 --> 01:08:28.170
You just use CAD.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.972
There is literally
no [? trickeration ?]

01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:30.805
that you have to do.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:33.143
Take this, take
this, you CAD it.

01:08:33.143 --> 01:08:34.870
Boom, you've got a GIF/JAR.

01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:36.854
So once you have
that, what can you do?

01:08:36.854 --> 01:08:39.300
Well, there are
some sensitive sites

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.950
that will allow
users to submit data,

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:43.979
but not arbitrary types of data.

01:08:43.979 --> 01:08:45.626
So [INAUDIBLE]
Flickr or something

01:08:45.626 --> 01:08:48.750
like that, it may not allow
you to submit arbitrary ActiveX

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.140
or whatever, arbitrary HTML.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.439
But it will allow
you to submit images.

01:08:53.439 --> 01:08:56.470
So what you could do is
construct one of these things,

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:58.920
submit it to one of these
sensitive sites that does

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.880
allow you to submit images.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.140
And then what can you do?

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.700
Well, the next thing you
need to do is-- so yes,

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:10.700
the first thing you do is you
submit one of these things

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:15.150
to the sensitive [? cycle. ?]

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:17.130
And then the next
thing that you can do

01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:21.022
is if you have an
XSS attack, if you

01:09:21.022 --> 01:09:23.420
have a cross-site
vulnerability, then

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:29.330
you can use the cross-site
scripting to inject something

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:30.060
like this.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.770
And due to poor
board management,

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.630
I will draw this over here.

01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:47.890
So you can inject an applet,
write JavaScript code that has,

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:53.980
as its sort of source,
you just say, cats.gif.

01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:00.740
And so what's
interesting about this

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:04.490
is that this code, because we're
using a cross-site scripting

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:07.620
vulnerability, runs in the
context of the vulnerable site.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:10.600
This has been uploaded to
the vulnerable site's origin.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.220
So this will pass
the same origin test.

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.030
But however, this code was
specified by the attacker.

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:19.130
So now what happens
is that the attacker

01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:23.130
gets to run that Java applet
in the context of the victim's

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:27.290
site with all the
authority of that origin

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:32.440
even though the GIFAR passed
the vulnerable site's image

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.182
validation code.

01:10:34.182 --> 01:10:35.890
Because one of these
things will actually

01:10:35.890 --> 01:10:38.660
parse correctly as a GIF.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.280
But it has this
hidden code in here.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.190
And so [INAUDIBLE]
when the browser tries

01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:43.515
to execute the JAR
part of it, once again,

01:10:43.515 --> 01:10:45.660
it starts from the
bottom, comes up here,

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.580
and just ignores that part.

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.502
So this is actually
pretty amazing.

01:10:49.502 --> 01:10:51.460
And so there's some fairly
straightforward ways

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.520
you can fix something like this.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.490
So for example, you can actually
have the applet loader actually

01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:01.790
understand that there should
not be random junk up here,

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:02.690
for example.

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:05.932
What was happening in many cases
is that there was information

01:11:05.932 --> 01:11:08.390
in the metadata saying, here's
the length of this resource.

01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.852
And then if it said, the
length, it stops here,

01:11:10.852 --> 01:11:12.810
they would just say, who
cares what's the rest.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.010
It's probably zero.

01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.070
But in this case, it wasn't.

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:18.270
What I love about
this is that it really

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:23.150
shows how wide the software
stack is for the web.

01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:27.510
So sort of taking these two
formats, GIF and then JAR,

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:29.510
we can actually create
this really nasty attack.

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:31.315
You can actually do
this for PDFs, too.

01:11:31.315 --> 01:11:32.232
You can put PDFs here.

01:11:32.232 --> 01:11:34.106
I think that was called,
like, the [? PDFR ?]

01:11:34.106 --> 01:11:35.590
attack or something like this.

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:37.664
So people had a field
day with this for a day.

01:11:37.664 --> 01:11:39.455
These vulnerabilities
have been closed now.

01:11:39.455 --> 01:11:42.244
AUDIENCE: So what can
you do with this attack

01:11:42.244 --> 01:11:43.660
that you can't do
with [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:44.530
XSS or your own [INAUDIBLE]?

01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:45.780
PROFESSOR: So what's
nice-- yeah, yeah.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.488
So good question.

01:11:46.488 --> 01:11:49.360
So what's nice about this
is that Java oftentimes

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.660
can be more powerful than just
running regular JavaScript,

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:54.460
because it has slightly
different rules on,

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.740
[? same origin ?] policy
and stuff like that.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.805
[INAUDIBLE] get more
lower-level access

01:11:58.805 --> 01:12:02.270
to the file systems
or things like that.

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:04.960
But you're right, that if you
can do cross-site scripting,

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.130
running JavaScript's
already pretty damaging.

01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:08.530
But the main advantage
of this is, once again,

01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:09.710
running inside the applet.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.340
All right.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:14.840
Yeah.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.235
So like I said, that's my
favorite attack of all time,

01:12:17.235 --> 01:12:20.330
mainly just because it forced
serious-minded security

01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:23.120
individuals to say
GIFAR all the time.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.830
So if you're easily
amused, like myself, then

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.570
this was a bonanza for you.

01:12:28.570 --> 01:12:31.140
So another thing
that's interesting

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:36.320
is that there are
actually attacks

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:41.230
that are based on a time.

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:44.350
So you might not think of
time as a resource which

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:46.390
could be a vector for attacks.

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:51.900
But as I was discussing with
someone a few minutes ago,

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:55.280
yeah, time can actually be a way
that a system can be exploited.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.925
And so these attacks are
called-- the particular attack

01:12:58.925 --> 01:13:00.300
I'm going to talk
to you about is

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:04.080
a specific example of a
covert channel attack.

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:10.390
And so the idea behind
the covert channel attack

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.860
is that, essentially,
the attacker

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.990
has found some way
for two applications

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.100
to exchange information.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.900
And that exchange vector is
not an officially sanctioned

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:21.510
vector.

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:23.980
The attacker is somehow
leveraging some other part

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.210
of the system to pass
bits of information

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:29.520
between two different entities.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.250
So a good example of
some of this stuff

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:39.974
is something called
CSS-based sniffing attacks.

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:48.282
So what is this
attack all about?

01:13:48.282 --> 01:13:57.059
So attacker has a website
that the user can visit.

01:13:57.059 --> 01:13:59.100
And once again, getting
a user to visit a website

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:00.891
is actually usually
pretty straightforward.

01:14:00.891 --> 01:14:01.560
You create ads.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.268
You send them a phishing
email, whatever.

01:14:03.268 --> 01:14:06.810
So the attacker has a
website that the user visits.

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:16.240
And the goal of the
attacker is to learn

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:22.257
what other websites
the user has visited.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.040
And the attacker might want to
know this for several reasons.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.637
Maybe they're trying to figure
out what kinds of search terms

01:14:32.637 --> 01:14:33.595
the user's looking for.

01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:34.500
Maybe they're
trying to figure out

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.291
where that person's
employed, or maybe they

01:14:36.291 --> 01:14:38.620
want to know if they've
accessed some type

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:41.810
of embarrassing material,
so on and so forth.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:44.220
So how is the
attacker going to do

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:46.630
that if the only thing
that the attacker controls

01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:50.130
is a website that he or she
can convince the user to visit?

01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:58.870
Well, the exploit is to
leverage link colors.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.365
So you know like when
you go to a web page

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:05.740
and you click on a link, the
next time you see that link,

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.260
it is now a different color.

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:11.580
So zoinks, that's actually
a security vulnerability.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:15.325
Because what that means is
that in this attacker website,

01:15:15.325 --> 01:15:18.810
if the attacker can trick
you into visiting it,

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:22.900
then the attacker can generate
a huge list of candidate URLs

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:25.180
that you might have
visited and then

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:30.530
use JavaScript to see
what color those URLs are.

01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:34.240
And if the URL color
is purple, that means,

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.430
aha, you have visited that site.

01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:39.760
So this was very subtle.

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.310
And what's
interesting about this

01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:43.995
is that you don't even have to
display the URLs in many cases

01:15:43.995 --> 01:15:45.070
to the user.

01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:47.370
You can just sort of
conjure up a domino that

01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:49.585
has a particular href and
just look at its style,

01:15:49.585 --> 01:15:52.784
and then see if it has
the visited color or not.

01:15:52.784 --> 01:15:54.200
So this is actually
pretty subtle.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.470
So you might be
thinking, well, isn't

01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:57.600
it going to be inefficient
to scan through all

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.250
these candidate URLs?

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:01.340
We can do all kinds of
clever optimizations.

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.850
So for example, you can
have multiple passes.

01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:06.480
In your first pass,
you could only

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.050
see if the user had
visited top-level URLs--

01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:12.340
cnn.com, Facebook.com,
so on and so forth.

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:14.030
If the answer is
yes, you can then

01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:17.120
do sort of a depth-first
search on those hits

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.705
that you found at the top level.

01:16:18.705 --> 01:16:20.205
So you can actually
really constrain

01:16:20.205 --> 01:16:22.410
the search space this way.

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:24.440
So this was really,
really funny, too,

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.160
if you have a demented
sense of humor,

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.370
because it showed that
this very innocuous feature

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.870
that browsers support-- they're
just trying to help you out.

01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:34.471
They're trying to
say, hey, buddy,

01:16:34.471 --> 01:16:34.840
here's where you visited.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.090
It can actually reveal this
very damaging information.

01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:39.350
So what is a solution for this?

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:42.680
So in practice, what the
browser [? runners ?] did

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.240
is that they made it such that
the browser lies to JavaScript

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.440
about the color of links.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.126
So basically, when JavaScript
tries to look at the link

01:16:52.126 --> 01:16:56.230
and look at its styling, the
browser always says, unvisited.

01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:56.840
OK.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.584
So that seems
somewhat unfortunate,

01:17:00.584 --> 01:17:01.750
but it prevents this attack.

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.410
So I guess we can live with it.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:05.790
JavaScript not being able
to read link colors, eh, not

01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:07.080
the end of the world.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.950
So are we done, though?

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:11.689
Does this fix the
problem of the attacker

01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:13.480
being able to figure
out where you've been?

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.280
The answer, of course, is no.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.300
So the next attack that
the attacker can do

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:24.440
is a cache-based attack.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:30.260
And so the intuition here is
that, once again, the goals

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:30.980
are the same.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.896
Attacker wants to know
what sites you visited.

01:17:32.896 --> 01:17:34.970
The exploit vector
is that information

01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:38.270
that has been cached
is quicker to access.

01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:40.470
That, in fact, is the whole
reason why you cache it

01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.170
in the first place.

01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:44.660
So once again, the
attacker can generate

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.650
a list of candidate objects
that the attacker thinks

01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:50.390
you might have visited
and then just time

01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:53.660
how quickly those objects
come back to the attacker.

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:55.525
And so if the objects
come back quickly,

01:17:55.525 --> 01:17:57.150
you know [? you need some ?]
threshold,

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:58.565
the attacker can guess
that you, in fact, have

01:17:58.565 --> 01:17:59.830
been to those objects before.

01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:01.740
So does that make sense?

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.990
Once again, the browser's
just trying to help you out.

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:07.160
But you can leverage these
techniques to figure out

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.380
some evil knowledge.

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.755
And what's
interesting about this

01:18:10.755 --> 01:18:13.790
is that this attack
can actually leverage

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:17.530
some very interesting
geographic location information.

01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:22.090
So imagine that we're doing
attacks on Google Map tiles,

01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:22.780
for example.

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:24.790
So if I detect that
you've actually

01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:26.980
accessed a series
of Google Map tiles,

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.900
that probably means you
are either in that place

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:31.692
or you're interested
in other people who

01:18:31.692 --> 01:18:32.650
might be in that place.

01:18:32.650 --> 01:18:36.080
So it's actually a
pretty powerful attack.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:36.610
So OK.

01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:39.460
So how can you fix this one?

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:43.035
Well, this one is
not quite clear.

01:18:43.035 --> 01:18:45.410
You could have a site that
doesn't cache anything at all.

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:47.150
And then your site's
going to be slow.

01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:48.200
So that kind of sucks.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.480
So it's not quite clear
how you get around this.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.170
But OK.

01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:53.900
Let's suppose that we have the
defense we put in place here--

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:55.570
JavaScript can't
read link colors.

01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:57.200
Let's assume that
the site is super

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.010
paranoid it caches nothing.

01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:03.680
So have we completely defended
ourselves against this attack?

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.310
One second.

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:06.325
So the answer is no.

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:10.675
Because the attacker can
actually launch DNS-based

01:19:10.675 --> 01:19:11.175
attacks.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:18.510
So the intuition is that even if
you don't cache anything, when

01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:21.075
you access a resource
for the first time,

01:19:21.075 --> 01:19:23.450
you have to generate a DNS
request for the hosting that's

01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:25.410
associated with that resource.

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:27.490
So once again, the
attacker can look in time

01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:29.590
and see how long it
takes for the attacker

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:32.420
to access these candidate
objects the attacker thinks

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.400
you may have accessed.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:36.360
And if they come back
quickly, then that's

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.260
perhaps a good hint that
you've resulted the DNS

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:42.290
name for that host before.

01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:46.120
And so this works even if
you don't cache anything,

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.846
because the DNS cache lives with
the OS, not with the browser.

01:19:49.846 --> 01:19:53.060
AUDIENCE: You've mentioned, I
think last class, the ability

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.504
to get JavaScript
to take screenshots.

01:19:55.504 --> 01:19:56.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:58.580
AUDIENCE: So can you just
render the [? link ?]

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.620
as a single pixel, and
then take a screenshot,

01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.234
and [INAUDIBLE] that pixel?

01:20:02.234 --> 01:20:02.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.229
Well-- so you could.

01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:06.270
So rendering stuff is
always a little bit tricky,

01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:07.550
because you have to
play these games.

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:08.910
If you want to show
something to the user,

01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:10.435
it has to flash really quickly.

01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:11.915
Or else they might see
that someone's entering

01:20:11.915 --> 01:20:12.874
this huge list of URLs.

01:20:12.874 --> 01:20:13.581
But you're right.

01:20:13.581 --> 01:20:15.540
If you have access to
the screen-sharing API,

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.040
a lot of this becomes
a lot simpler.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.570
AUDIENCE: And if you just have
some kind of animated image

01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:23.084
that looks mostly
random, then you just

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:25.137
pay attention to
one pixel of it?

01:20:25.137 --> 01:20:26.470
PROFESSOR: You're exactly right.

01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:27.570
I mean, in general, I think
the screen-sharing API is

01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:28.800
a bad idea.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.320
I'm not the president of
the world, so what can I do?

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.080
So anyways, so DNS-based
attacks work even if there

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.190
is no caching that takes place.

01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:38.690
OK.

01:20:38.690 --> 01:20:40.640
So as the final
piece de resistance,

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.825
so you might think, OK, what
if we only use raw IP addresses

01:20:44.825 --> 01:20:46.600
for all of our host names?

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.260
We don't cache a thing!

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.020
OK?

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:52.700
And we're running on an updated
browser that doesn't expose

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.340
link colors to JavaScript.

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.630
So surely we're fine.

01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:58.100
I'm here to tell you
you are not fine.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:01.390
Because what the
attacker can actually do

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:03.850
is take advantage of
rendering attacks.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:13.140
So the basic idea here is
that it is typically faster

01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:16.380
to render a URL that
you have visited

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.446
before for various
wacky reasons that

01:21:18.446 --> 01:21:20.612
have to deal with how
browsers [INAUDIBLE] rendering

01:21:20.612 --> 01:21:21.880
[INAUDIBLE] internal.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.890
And so what the attacker
can do is actually

01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:29.049
create a candidate iframe, let's
say, puts some content in there

01:21:29.049 --> 01:21:31.340
that the attacker thinks you
may have visited, and then

01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:35.720
constantly see if the attacker
loses access to that iframe.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.150
Because as that
iframe is loading,

01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:39.840
the browser typically
thinks that iframe

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.499
belongs to the attacker's page.

01:21:42.499 --> 01:21:44.540
And then as soon as that
different origin content

01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:47.195
comes in, then you'll start
getting these access errors.

01:21:47.195 --> 01:21:49.634
Because now that different
origin [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:49.634 --> 01:21:51.300
So now the attacker
can't touch anymore.

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.750
So the attacker can do
things like this still

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:56.350
to see if there's caching,
rendering information

01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:59.510
[INAUDIBLE] browser for
these candidate sites.

01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:01.700
So anyways, so those are
the only hopes and dreams

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:03.230
I want to crush in you today.

01:22:03.230 --> 01:22:05.210
I believe we're
running out of time.

01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:07.960
But I will see you next time.
