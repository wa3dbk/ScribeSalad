00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.520
PROFESSOR: Now look
at how the web uses

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.770
cryptographic protocols to
protect network communication

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.142
and deal with network
factors in general.

00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:37.600
So before we dive
into the details,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.641
I want to remind you
there's a quiz on Wednesday.

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.350
And that's not in this room.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.730
It's in Walker.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.559
But it's at the
regular lecture time.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:46.600
Any questions about that?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.002
Hopefully straightforward.

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:50.460
Third floor, I
think it is usually.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.220
All right.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.654
So today we're going to talk
about how the web sort of uses

00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:00.570
cryptography to protect
network communication.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.800
And we'll look at two sort
of closely related topics.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.090
One is, how do you just
cryptographically protect never

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.890
communication in a larger
scale than the Kerberos system

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.956
we looked at in last lecture?

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:14.330
And then also, we're going to
look at how do you actually

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.970
integrate this cryptographic
protection provided to you

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.940
at the network level into
the entire application.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.190
So how does the web
browser make sense

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.090
of whatever guarantees the
cryptographic protocol is

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.600
providing to it?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.990
And these are closely
related, and it turns out

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.730
that protecting network
communications is rather easy.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.880
Cryptography mostly just works.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.960
And integrating it in,
and currently using it

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.020
at a higher level
in the browser,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.790
is actually that
much trickier part,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.260
how to actually build a
system around cryptography.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.700
Before we dive into
this whole discussion,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.900
I want to remind
you of the kinds

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.670
of cryptographic primitives
we're going to use here.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.580
So in last lecture on
Kerberos, we basically

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.320
used something called
symmetric crypto, or encryption

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.630
and decryption.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.910
And the plan there is that
you have a secret key k,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.340
and you have two functions.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.070
So you can take
some piece of data,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.220
let's call it p for
plain text, and you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.170
can apply an encryption
function, that's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.210
a function of some key k.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.150
And if you encrypt this plain
text, you get a Cypher text c.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.380
And similarly, there's a
description function called

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.930
d, that given the same key k.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.860
And the cipher text will give
you back your plain text.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.880
So this is the primitive that
Kerberos was all built around.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.240
But it turns out there's
other primitives, as well,

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.360
that will be useful
for today's discussion.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.350
And this is called asymmetric
encryption and decryption.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.520
And here the idea is to have
different keys for encryption

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.260
and decryption.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.505
We'll see why this is so useful.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.380
And in particular, the
functions that you get

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.300
is, you can encrypt to
a particular public key

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.990
with a sum message and
get a cipher text text.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.550
And in order to
decrypt, you just

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.380
supply the corresponding secret
key to get the plain text back.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.400
And the cool thing now as you
can publish this public key

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.320
anywhere on the
internet, and people

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.180
can encrypt messages for you,
but you need the secret key

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.790
in order to decrypt
the messages.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.910
And we'll see how this
is used in the protocol.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.200
And in practice you'll
often use public key crypto

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.960
in a slightly different way.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.050
So instead of encrypting
and decrypting messages,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.510
you might actually want to
sign or verify messages.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.390
Turns out that at the
implementation level

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.162
these are related operations,
but at an API level

00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:42.870
they might look all
little bit different.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.350
So you might find a message
with your secret key,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.160
and you get some sort
of a signature s.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.930
And then you can also
verify this message using

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.340
the corresponding public key.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.040
And you get the message, and
the signature, and outcomes,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.590
and some Boolean flags
saying whether this

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.040
is the correct signature
not on that message.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.460
And there are some relatively
intuitive guarantees

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.630
that these functions provide
if you, for example, got

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.520
this signature and it
verifies correctly,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.710
then it must have been
generated by someone

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.930
with the correct secret key.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.740
Make sense, in terms of
the primitives we have?

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.790
All right.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.690
So now let's actually
try to figure out--

00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:28.385
How would we protect
network communication

00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:30.520
at a larger scale in Kerberos.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.650
In Kerberos, we had
the fairly simple model

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.810
where we had all the
users and servers

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.330
have some sort of a relation
with this KDC entity.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.790
And this KDC entity
has this giant table

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.695
of principles and their keys.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.940
And whenever a user wants
to talk to some server,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.010
they have to ask the KDC
to generate a ticket based

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.340
on those giant
table the KDC has.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.890
So this seems like a reasonably
straightforward model.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.320
So why do we need
something more?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.180
Why is Kerberos not
enough for the web?

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.599
Why doesn't the web use
just Kerberos for securing

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.390
all communications?

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.927
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:16.224 --> 00:05:16.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:24.730
So there a sort of a single
KDC, has to be trusted by all.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.340
So this is, perhaps, not great.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.100
So you might have
trouble really believing

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.420
that some machine out there
is secure for everyone

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.792
in the world to use.

00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:34.250
Like, yeah, maybe
people at MIT are

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.240
willing to trust
someone at [? ISNT ?]

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.640
to run the KDC there.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.140
All right.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.134
So that's plausible, yeah.

00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:43.195
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:43.820
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.520
A key management is
hard, I guess, yeah.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.778
So what I mean in particular
by key management--

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:53.666
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:02.715 --> 00:06:03.340
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.570
It might actually be a hard
job to build a KDC that we

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.990
can manage a billion keys,
or ten billion keys, for all

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.340
the people in the world.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.840
So it might be a
tricky proposition.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.340
If that's not the
case, then I guess

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.920
another bummer with Kerberos
is that all users actually

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.415
have to have a key, or have
to be known to the KDC.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.467
So, you can't even
use Kerberos at MIT

00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:30.425
to connect to some servers,
unless you yourself

00:06:30.425 --> 00:06:33.520
have an account in
the Kerberos database.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.400
Whereas on the web, it's
completely reasonable

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.192
to expect the you walk
up to some computer,

00:06:38.192 --> 00:06:39.733
the computer has no
idea who you are,

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.890
but you can still go to
Amazon's website protected

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.730
with cryptography.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.612
Yeah?

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.058
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:51.900
PROFESSOR: That's our idea.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.530
So there's these kinds
of considerations.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.130
So there's private
forward secrecies.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.546
There are a couple
of other things

00:06:56.546 --> 00:06:58.260
you want from the
cryptographic protocol,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.472
and we'll look at them and
how they sort of show up

00:07:00.472 --> 00:07:01.407
in SSL, as well.

00:07:01.407 --> 00:07:03.490
But the key there is that
the solution is actually

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.170
exactly the same as what
you would do Kerberos,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.514
and what you would do in SSL
or TLS to address those guys.

00:07:09.514 --> 00:07:10.680
But you're absolutely right.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.840
There Kerberos deep
protocols we read about

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.150
in the paper is pretty dated.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.250
So, even if you were
using it for the web,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.860
you would want to apply
some changes to it.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.190
Those are not huge though,
at the [INAUDIBLE] level.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.280
Any other thoughts on why
we should use Kerberos?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.095
Yeah?

00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:30.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:38.110
PROFESSOR: This is
actually not so scalable.

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:41.440
Yeah, recovery.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.790
Maybe registration
even, as well,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.100
like you have to go to
some accounts office

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.050
and get an account.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.406
Yeah?

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:52.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
needs to be online.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
that's another problem.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.620
These are sort of
management issues,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.794
but at the protocol
level, the KDC

00:07:59.794 --> 00:08:01.460
has to be online
because it has actually

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.635
mediate every interaction
you have with the service.

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:07.830
It means that in the web, every
time you go to a new website,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.130
you'd have to talk to
some KDC first, which

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.940
would be a bit of a
performance bottleneck.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.520
So like another
kind of scalability,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.680
this is like
performance scalability.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.900
This is more management
scalability kind of stuff.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.470
Make sense?

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.040
So, how can we
solve this problem

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.160
with these better primitives?

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.330
Well, the idea is to use
public key cryptography to give

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.980
this KDC out of the loop.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.880
So let's first
figure out whether we

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.419
can establish secure
communication if you just know

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.669
some other party's public key.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.710
And then we'll
see how we plug-in

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.840
a public key version of a
KDC to authenticate parties

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.080
in this protocol.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.194
If you don't want
to use a KDC, what

00:08:54.194 --> 00:08:55.652
you could do with
public key crypto

00:08:55.652 --> 00:08:58.190
is maybe you can somehow
learn the public key

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.440
of the public key of the
other value on a connector.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.690
So in Kerberos, if I want
to connect to a file server,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.330
maybe I just know the
file server's public key

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.190
from somewhere.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.510
Like me as a freshman I get
a printout saying the file

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.260
server's public key is this.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.450
And then you can go
ahead and connect it.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.760
And the way you might
actually do this is you

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.552
could just encrypt a message
for the public key of the file

00:09:18.552 --> 00:09:20.010
server that you
want to connect to.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.460
But it turns out
that in practice,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.541
these public key
operations are pretty slow.

00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.040
They are several
orders of magnitude

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.260
slower than symmetric
key cryptography.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.520
So almost always you want to get
out of the use of public crypto

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.440
as soon as practical.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.320
So a typical protocol
might look like this

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.020
where you have a and b, and
they want to communicate.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.990
And a knows b's public key.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.480
So what might happen is
that a might generate

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.445
some sort of session s.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.380
Just pick a random number.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.210
And then it's going to send
to b the session key s.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.550
So this is kind of
looking like Kerberos.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.840
And we're going to encrypt
the session s for b's key.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.860
And remember in Kerberos,
in order to do this,

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.590
we have to have the
KDC do this for us

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.095
because a didn't
know the key for b,

00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:10.720
or couldn't have been allowed to
know because that is a secret.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.197
But only b should've known.

00:10:12.197 --> 00:10:14.280
With public key cyrptor
you can actually this now.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:21.730
We can just encrypt the secret
s using these public keys.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.555
And we send this
message over to b.

00:10:23.555 --> 00:10:25.500
B can now decrypt this
message, and say I

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500
should be using this secret key.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.930
And now we can have a
communication channel where

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.890
all the messages
are just encrypted

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.560
under this secret key s.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.971
Does this Make sense?

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.220
So there are some nice
properties about this protocol.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.280
One is that we got
rid of having to have

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.339
a KDC be online and generate
our session key for us.

00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:48.880
We could just have
one of the parties

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.670
generate it and then
encrypt it for another party

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.040
without the use of the KDC.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.070
Another nice thing
is we're probably

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.480
pretty confident that
messages sent by a to b

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.190
will only be read by b.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.670
Because only b could have
decrypted this message.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.565
And therefore,
only b should have

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:09.640
that corresponding secret key s.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.030
But this is pretty nicely.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.700
Any questions about
this protocol?

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.260
Yeah?

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.146
AUDIENCE: Does it matter
whether the user or the server

00:11:16.146 --> 00:11:18.560
generates the pass code?

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.150
PROFESSOR: Well, maybe.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.760
I think it depends on
exactly the considerations,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.080
or the properties you
want out of this protocol.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:35.320
So here, certainly if a is
buggy or picks bad randomness,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.420
the server then sends some
data back to a, thinking,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.970
oh, this is now the only data
that is going to be seen by a.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.320
Well, maybe that's not
going to be quite right.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.020
So you might care a little bit.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.270
There's a couple of other
problems with this protocol,

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.030
as well.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.226
Question?

00:11:49.226 --> 00:11:52.810
AUDIENCE: I was gonna say
that in this protocol,

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.060
a you could just do [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:58.021 --> 00:11:59.770
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's
actually not great.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.728
So there's actually
several problems with this.

00:12:01.728 --> 00:12:05.660
One is the replay.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.436
So the problem here
is that I can just

00:12:09.436 --> 00:12:10.810
send these messages
again, and it

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.060
looks like a is sending these
messages to b, and so on.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.160
So typically the
solution to this

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.640
is to have both
parties participate

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.470
in the generation of
s, and that ensures

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.230
that the key we're
using is now fresh.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.840
Because here, because b didn't
actually generating anything,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.310
these protocol messages look
exactly the same every time.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.410
So typically, what happens
is that, one party picks

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.630
a random number like s, and
then another party b also

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.417
picks some random number,
typically called a non.

00:12:39.417 --> 00:12:40.000
But, whatever.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.630
There's two numbers.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.877
And then the key they
agreed to use in the thing

00:12:43.877 --> 00:12:45.460
that one party picked,
but actually is

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.610
the hash of the things
that both of them picked.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.890
So you could do that.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.509
You could also do
[? DP Helmond ?] kind of stuff

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:54.050
like we looked at
in the last lecture

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.650
where you get forward secrecy.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.220
It was a little bit more
complicated math rather than

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.117
just hashing two random numbers
that two parties picked.

00:13:01.117 --> 00:13:02.700
But then you get
some nice properties,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.610
like forward secrecy.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.600
So replay attacks
you typically fixed

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:14.350
by having b generate some nons.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.850
And then you set
the real secret key

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.900
that you're going to use
to hash of the secret key

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.267
from one guy concatenated
with this non.

00:13:24.267 --> 00:13:26.350
And, of course, b would
have to send the nons back

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.220
to a in order to
figure out what's

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.850
going on for both of
them to agree on a key.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.670
All right.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:40.060
So another problem here is that
there's no real authentication

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.990
of a here, all right?

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.610
So a knows who b
is, or at least a

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.700
knows who will be able
to decrypt the data.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.390
But b has no idea who
is on the other side,

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.630
whether it's a or some adversary
impersonating a, et cetera.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.741
So how would we fix it
int his public key world?

00:13:58.741 --> 00:13:59.240
Yeah?

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.854
AUDIENCE: You have been assigned
something and [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:01.854 --> 00:14:02.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.390
There's a couple of ways
you could go about this.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.510
One possibility
is a maybe should

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.630
sign this message
initially, because we

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.160
have this nice sign primitive.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:19.040
So we could maybe have a sign
this thing with a's secret key.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.829
And that sign just
provides the signature,

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:22.370
but presumably you
assign it and also

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.400
provide the message, as well.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.750
And then b would have to
know a is public key in order

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.370
to verify the signature.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.229
But if b knows a is
public key, then b's

00:14:32.229 --> 00:14:34.520
going to be reasonably
confident that a is the one that

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.430
sent this message over.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.470
Make sense?

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.050
Another thing you could
do is rely on encryption.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.120
So maybe b could send the
nons back to a encrypted

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.029
under a's public key.

00:14:46.029 --> 00:14:48.070
And then only a would be
able to decrypt the nons

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.366
and generate the final
session key s prime.

00:14:50.366 --> 00:14:52.240
So there are a couple
of tricks you could do.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.110
This is roughly how
client certificates

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.640
work in web browsers today.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.005
So a has a secret
key, so when get

00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:03.550
an MIT personal certificate,
what happens is your browser

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.300
generates a long
lived secret key

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.410
and gets a certificate for it.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.636
And whenever you send
to request a web server,

00:15:10.636 --> 00:15:12.260
you're going to prove
the fact that you

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.970
know the secret key in
your user certificate,

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.540
and then establish the
secret key s for the rest

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.972
the communication.

00:15:19.972 --> 00:15:22.640
Make Sense?

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.180
All right.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.760
These are sort of all fixable
problems at the protocol level

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.820
that are reasonably
easy to V address

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.390
by adding extra messages.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.810
The big assumption here, of
course, that we're going under

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.090
is that all the parties know
each other's public keys.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:47.500
So do you actually discover
someone's public key?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.910
for, you know, it a wants
to connect a website,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.882
I have a URL that I want to
connect to, or a host name,

00:15:53.882 --> 00:15:55.840
how do I know what pub
key that corresponds to?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.660
Or similarly, if I connect to
websis to look at my grades,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.070
how does the server know
what my public key should be,

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.550
as opposed to the public key
of some other at person MIT?

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:13.889
So this is the main problem
that the KDC was addressing.

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:16.180
I guess the KDC was solving
two problems for us before.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.081
One it that is was
generating this message.

00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:20.455
It was generating
the session key

00:16:20.455 --> 00:16:22.490
and encrypting it
for the server.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.480
We fixed that by doing
public key crypto now.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.350
But we also need to get this
mapping from string principal

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.340
names to cryptographic keys
of the Kerberos previously

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.512
provided to us.

00:16:33.512 --> 00:16:34.970
And the way that
is going to happen

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:42.200
in this the https world,
this protocol called TLC,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.200
is that we're going to
still rely on some parties

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.740
to maintain, of to
a least logically

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.920
maintain those giant tables
mapping principal names

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.420
onto cryptographic keys.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.174
And the plan is, we're
going to have something

00:16:56.174 --> 00:16:57.465
called a certificate authority.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.380
This is often abbreviated
as CA in all kinds

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.609
of security literature.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.400
This thing is also going
to logically maintain

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.380
the stable of, here's
the name of a principle,

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:19.319
and here's the public
key for that principle.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.300
And the main difference from
the way Kerberos worked,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.280
is that this
certificate authority

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.450
thing isn't going to have to
be online for all transactions.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.450
So in Kerberos you have
to talk to those KDCs

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.800
to get a connection or
to look up someone's key.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.790
Instead, what's going to
happen in this CA world,

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:43.210
is that if you have some
name here, and a public key,

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.800
the certificate
authority is going

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:51.020
to just sign messages stating
that certain rows exist

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.940
in this table.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.540
So the certificate
authority is going

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.540
to have its own sort of
secret and public key here.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.520
And it's going to
use the secret key

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:09.080
to find messages for other
users in the system to rely on.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.870
So if you have a
particular entry like this,

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.410
in this CA's
database, then the CA

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:19.510
is going to find a
message saying this name

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.750
corresponds to this public key.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.040
And it's going to sign
this whole message

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.225
with CA's secret key.

00:18:31.225 --> 00:18:31.725
Make sense?

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.790
So this is going to allow us to
do very similar things to what

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.020
Kerberos was doing,
but we are now

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.830
going to get rid of
the CA having to be

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.192
online for all transactions.

00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:47.400
And in fact, it's now going
to be much more scalable.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.358
So this is what's usually
called a certificate.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.080
And the reason this is going
to be much more scalable

00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:00.027
is that, in fact, to a client,
or anyone using this system,

00:19:00.027 --> 00:19:01.610
a certificate provided
from one source

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.240
is as good as a certificate
provided from any other source.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.120
It's signed by
the CA secret key.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.700
So you can verify its
validity without having

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.830
to actually contact
the certificate

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.867
authority, or any other
designated party here.

00:19:13.867 --> 00:19:15.950
And typically, the way
this works is that a server

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:19.880
that you want to talk to
stores the certificate that it

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.980
originally got from the
certificate authority.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.339
And whenever you connect
to it, the server

00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:26.130
will tell you, well,
here's my certificate.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.350
It was signed by this CA.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.520
You can check the
signature and just verify

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.020
that this is, in fact, my
public key and that's my name.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.700
And on the flip
side, the same thing

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.060
happens on client certificates.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.790
So when you the user connect to
a web server, what's actually

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.590
going on is that your
client certificate actually

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.780
talks about the public key
corresponding to the secret key

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.221
that you originally
generated in your browser.

00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:49.970
And this way when you
connect to a server,

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.350
you're going to present
a certificate signed

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.780
by MIT's certificate authority
saying your user name

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.680
corresponds to this public key.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.430
And this is how the server
is going to be convinced

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.430
that a message signed
with your secret key

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:09.695
is proof that this is the right
Athena user connecting to me.

00:20:09.695 --> 00:20:10.570
Does that make sense?

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:11.206
Yeah.

00:20:11.206 --> 00:20:12.956
AUDIENCE: Where does
the [? project ?] get

00:20:12.956 --> 00:20:15.470
the certificate [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.819
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes.

00:20:16.819 --> 00:20:18.360
Like the chicken
and the egg problem.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.330
It keeps going down.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.788
Where do you get
these public keys?

00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:22.840
At some point you have
to hard code these in,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.310
or that's typically
what most systems do.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.074
So today what
actually happens is

00:20:27.074 --> 00:20:28.615
that when you download
a web browser,

00:20:28.615 --> 00:20:30.950
or you get a computer
for the first time,

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.930
it actually comes with
public keys of hundreds

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.730
of these certificate
authorities.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.440
And there's many of them.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.660
Some are run by security
companies like VeriSign.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.880
The US Postal Service has
a certificate authority,

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.860
for some reason.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.640
There's many entities there
that could, in principal, issue

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.770
these certificates and are
fully trusted by the system.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.740
These mini certificate
authorities

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.674
are now replacing the trust
that we had in this KDC.

00:20:59.674 --> 00:21:01.090
And sometimes, we
haven't actually

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.910
addressed all the problems
we listed with Kerberos.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.930
So previously were worried
that, oh man, how are

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.180
we going to trust?

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.570
How is everyone
in the word going

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.820
to trust a single KDC machine?

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.850
But now, it's actually worse.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.400
This is actually worse that
in some ways, because instead

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.320
of trusting a
single KDC machine,

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.960
everyone is now trusting
these hundreds or certificate

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.380
authorities because all of
them are equally as powerful.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.390
Any of them could sign
a message like this

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.720
and it would be
accepted by clients

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.650
as a correct statement
saying this principle

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.530
has this public key.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.890
So you have to only break
into one of these guys instead

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.830
of the one KDSC.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.235
Yeah?

00:21:41.235 --> 00:21:43.304
AUDIENCE: Is there a
mechanism to open the keys?

00:21:43.304 --> 00:21:43.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.550
That's another hard problem.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.889
It turns out to be that
before we talked to the KDC,

00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:49.430
and if you screwed
up, you could tell

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.500
the KDC to stop giving
out my key, or change it.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.410
Now the certificates are
actually potentially valid

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.110
forever.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.400
So the typical
solution is twofold.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.410
One is, sort of expectedly,
these certificates

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:05.054
include an expiration time.

00:22:05.054 --> 00:22:06.970
So this way you can at
least bound the damage.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.178
Is This is kind of like a
Kerberos ticket's lifetime,

00:22:09.178 --> 00:22:11.917
except in practice, these
tend to be to several orders

00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:12.750
of magnitude higher.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.740
So in Kerberos, your
ticket's lifetime

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.720
could be a couple hours.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.720
Here it's typically a year
or something like this.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.470
So the CAs really don't want
to be talked to very often.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.240
So you want to get
your money once

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.750
a year for the
certificate, and then

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.795
give you out this
blob of signed bytes,

00:22:29.795 --> 00:22:31.170
and you're good
to go for a year.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.930
You don't have to
conduct them again.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.690
So this is good for scalability,
but not so good for security.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.620
And there's two problems
that you might worry about

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.860
with certificates.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.030
One is that Maybe
the CA's screwed up.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.710
So maybe the CA issued a
certificate for the wrong name.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.190
Like, they weren't very careful.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.856
And accidentally, I
ask them to give you

00:22:50.856 --> 00:22:53.297
a certificate for amazon.com,
and they just slipped up

00:22:53.297 --> 00:22:54.380
and said, all right, sure.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:54.975
That's amazon.com.

00:22:54.975 --> 00:22:56.599
I will give you a
certificate for that.

00:22:56.599 --> 00:22:58.860
So that seems like a
problem on the CA side.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.412
So they miss-issued
a certificate.

00:23:00.412 --> 00:23:02.870
And that's one way that you
could end up with a certificate

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.550
that you wish no longer
existed, because you

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.180
signed the wrong thing.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.375
Another possibility
is that they CA

00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:11.440
does the right thing,
but then the person who

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.110
had the certificate I
accidentally disclosed

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.220
the secret key, or someone stole
the secret key corresponding

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.130
to the public key
in the certificate.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.780
So this means that
certificate no longer says

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.380
what you think it might mean.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.730
Even though this says
amazon.com's key is this,

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.285
actually every one
in the world has

00:23:29.285 --> 00:23:31.201
the corresponding secret
key because posted it

00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:31.910
on the internet.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.425
So you can't really
learn much from someone

00:23:34.425 --> 00:23:36.966
sending you a message signed by
the corresponding secret key,

00:23:36.966 --> 00:23:40.187
because it could've been anyone
that stole the secret key.

00:23:40.187 --> 00:23:41.770
So that's another
reason why you might

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.250
want to revoke a certificate.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.220
And revoking certificates
is pretty messy.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.100
There's not really
a great plan for it.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:56.340
The two alternatives
that people have tried

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.690
are to basically publish
a list of all revoked

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.800
certificates in the world.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.630
This Is something called
certificate revocation

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.550
list, or CRLs.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.800
And the way this works
is that every certificate

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.830
authority issues
these certificates,

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:15.040
but then on the side, it
maintains a list of mistakes.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.460
These are things
that it realized

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.126
they screwed up and
issued a certificate

00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:20.320
under the wrong name, or
our customers come to them

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.070
and say, hey, you
issued me a certificate.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.380
Everything was going great.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.020
But someone then got
rude on my machine

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.370
and stole the private key.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.570
Please tell the world that my
certificate is no good anymore.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.570
So this certificate
authority, in principle,

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:36.260
could add stuff to this CRL, and
then clients like web browsers

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.309
are supposed to download
this CRL periodically.

00:24:39.309 --> 00:24:41.600
And then whenever they're
presented with a certificate,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.100
they should check
if the certificate

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.689
appears in this revoked list.

00:24:45.689 --> 00:24:47.105
And it shows up
there, then should

00:24:47.105 --> 00:24:49.850
say that certificate's no good.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.384
You better give me a new one.

00:24:51.384 --> 00:24:53.200
I'm not going to trust
this particular sign

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.990
message anymore.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.770
So that's one plan.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:57.620
It's not great.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.754
If you really used, it
would be a giant list.

00:25:02.754 --> 00:25:04.920
And it would be quite a lot
of overhead for everyone

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.772
in the world to download this.

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:08.480
The other problem is
that no one actually

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.370
bothers doing this stuff. so
the lists in practice are empty.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.600
If you actually ask all
these CAs, most of them

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.210
will give you back an empty CRL
because no one's ever bothered

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.418
to add anything to this list.

00:25:17.418 --> 00:25:18.610
Because, why would you?

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.330
It will only break
things because it

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.210
will reduce the number of
connections that will succeed.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.210
So it's not clear whether there
is a great motivations for CAs

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.530
to maintain this CRL.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.460
The other thing that
people have tried

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.190
is to query online the CAs.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:39.200
Like in the Kerberos world, we
contact the KDC all the time.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.590
And in the CA world we try
to get out of this business

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.090
and say, well, the
CA's only going

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.280
to sign these
messages once a year.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.280
That's sort of a bummer.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.750
So there's an
alternative protocol

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:52.970
called online certificate
status protocol, or OCSP.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:57.050
And this protocol pushes
us back from the CA world

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.110
to the KDC world.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.840
So whenever a client
gets a certificate

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.300
and they're curious, is this
really a valid certificate?

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.160
Even though it's before
the expiration time,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.660
maybe something went wrong.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.670
So using this OCSP protocol,
you can contact some server

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.760
and just say, hey, I
got this certificate.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.330
Do you think it's still valid?

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:18.220
So basically, offloading the
job of maintaining this CRL

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.520
to a particular server.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.710
So instead of downloading
a whole list yourself,

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.334
you're going to ask
the server, hey, is

00:26:23.334 --> 00:26:24.950
this thing in that list?

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.710
So that's another plan
that people have tried.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:33.710
It's also not used very
widely because of two factors.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:38.990
One is that it adds latency to
every request that you make.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.450
So every time you want
to connect to a server,

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.060
now you have to first
connect, get the certificate

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.370
from the server.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.950
Now you have to talk
to this OCSP guy

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.950
and then wait for him to respond
and then do something else.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.980
So for latency reasons,
this is actually

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.970
not a super popular plan.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:56.980
Another problem
is that you don't

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.800
want this OCSP thing being down
from affecting your ability

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.880
to browse the web.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.369
Suppose this OSCP
server goes down.

00:27:04.369 --> 00:27:06.160
You could, like, disable
the whole internet

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.090
because you can't check
anyone's certificate.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.600
Like, it could be all bad.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.230
And then all your
connections stop working.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.590
So no one wants that.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.030
So most clients
treat the OCSP server

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:21.194
being down as sort
of an OK occurrence.

00:27:21.194 --> 00:27:23.110
This is really bad from
a security perspective

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.790
because if you're
an attacker and you

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.040
want to convince
someone that you have

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.000
a legitimate certificate, but
it's actually been revoked,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.740
all you have to do
is somehow prevent

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.090
that client from talking
to the OCSP server.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.080
And then the client will say,
well, I do the certificate.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.510
I'll try to check
it, but this guy

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.770
doesn't seem to be around,
so I'll just go for it.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.554
So that's basically the
sort of lay of the land

00:27:46.554 --> 00:27:47.720
as far as verification goes.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.150
So there's no real great answer.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.210
The thing that
people do in practice

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.710
as an alternative to this
is that clients just hard

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.500
code in really bad mistakes.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.220
So for example, the Chrome
web browser actually

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.080
ships inside of it with
a list of certificates

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.400
that Google really
wants to revoke.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.570
So if someone
mis-issues a certificate

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.790
for Gmail or for some other
important site-- like Facebook,

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:15.780
Amazon, or whatever-- then
the next release of Chrome

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.950
will contain that thing in
its verification list baked

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.300
into Chrome.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.884
So this way, you don't have
to contact the CRL server.

00:28:23.884 --> 00:28:25.550
You don't have to
talk to this OCSP guy.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.160
It's just baked in.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.910
Like, this certificate
is no longer valid.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.016
The client rejects it.

00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:29.988
Yeah.

00:28:29.988 --> 00:28:30.474
AUDIENCE: Sorry, one last thing.

00:28:30.474 --> 00:28:30.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.418
AUDIENCE: So let's say
I've stolen the secret key

00:28:32.418 --> 00:28:33.876
on the certificate [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:33.876 --> 00:28:35.140
All public keys are
[? hard coded-- ?]

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:35.973
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:28:35.973 --> 00:28:38.730
That's [INAUDIBLE] really bad.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.280
I don't think there's any
solution baked into the system

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.690
right now for this.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.290
There have been
certainly situations

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.810
where certificate
authorities appear

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:51.400
to have been compromised.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.870
So in 2011, there
were two CAs that

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.200
were compromised in the
issue, or they were somehow

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.090
tricked into issuing
certificates for Gmail,

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.790
for Facebook, et cetera.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.290
And it's not clear.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.010
Maybe someone did
steal their secret key.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.150
So what happened is I
think those CAs actually

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.010
got removed from a
set of trusted CAs

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.469
by browsers from that point on.

00:29:13.469 --> 00:29:15.760
So the next release of Chrome
is just like, hey, you're

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.390
really screwed up.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.515
We're going to kick you
out of the sort of CAs that

00:29:18.515 --> 00:29:19.195
are trusted.

00:29:19.195 --> 00:29:20.420
And it was actually
kind of a bummer

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.875
because all of the
legitimate people that

00:29:21.875 --> 00:29:23.875
had certificates from
that certificate authority

00:29:23.875 --> 00:29:25.030
are now out of luck.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.680
They have to get
new certificates.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.440
So this is a somewhat
messy system,

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.190
but that's sort of what happens
in practice with certificates.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.540
Make sense?

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.330
Other questions
about how this works?

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.612
All right.

00:29:39.612 --> 00:29:43.530
So this is the sort of general
plan for how certificates work.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.800
And as we were
talking about, they're

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.510
sort of better than
Kerberos in the sense

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.610
that you don't have to
have this guy be online.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.580
It might be a little
bit more scalable

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.560
because you can
have multiple KDCs,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.200
and you don't have
to talk to them.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.783
Another cool thing
about this protocol

00:29:58.783 --> 00:30:01.220
is that unlike Kerberos,
you're not forced

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.980
to authenticate both parties.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.010
So you could totally
connect to a web server

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.157
without having a
certificate for yourself.

00:30:08.157 --> 00:30:09.240
This happens all the time.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.930
If you just go to
amazon.com, you

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.380
are going to check that
Amazon is the right entity,

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.220
but Amazon has no idea who you
are necessarily, or at least

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.790
not until you log in later.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:20.040
So the crypto protocol level,
you have no certificate.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:20.720
Amazon has a certificate.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.260
So that was actually
much better than Kerberos

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.380
where in order to connect
to a Kerberos service,

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:28.030
you have to be an entry in
the Kerberos database already.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.690
One thing that's a little bit
of a bummer with this protocol

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.640
as we've described it is
that in fact, the server does

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.359
have to have a certificate.

00:30:35.359 --> 00:30:36.900
So you can't just
connect to a server

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.080
and say, hey, let's
just encrypt our stuff.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.920
I have no idea who you
are, or not really,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.540
and you don't have
any idea who I am,

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.940
but let's encrypt it anyway.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.870
So this is called
opportunistic encryption,

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.020
and it's of course vulnerable
to man in the middle attacks

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.170
because you're connecting
to someone and saying,

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:53.120
well, let's encrypt
our stuff, but you

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.536
have no idea who it really is
that you're encrypting stuff

00:30:55.536 --> 00:30:56.290
with.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.664
Both might be a
good idea anyway.

00:30:57.664 --> 00:31:00.309
If someone is not actively
mounting an attack against you,

00:31:00.309 --> 00:31:02.850
at least the packets later on
will be encrypted and protected

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.520
from snooping.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.590
So it's a bit of
a shame that this

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:12.220
protocol that we're looking
at here-- SSL, TLS, whatever--

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.180
doesn't offer this kind of
opportunistic encryption thing.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.910
But such is life.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.380
So I guess the server
[INAUDIBLE] in this protocol.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:24.100
The client sometimes can and
sometimes doesn't have to.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:24.600
Make sense?

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:24.870
Yeah.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:25.995
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious.

00:31:25.995 --> 00:31:27.852
What's to stop
someone from-- I mean,

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:30.487
let's just say that
once a year, they

00:31:30.487 --> 00:31:32.850
create using new name key pairs.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:37.476
So why couldn't you kind of
try to spend that entire year

00:31:37.476 --> 00:31:39.000
for that specific key?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.809
PROFESSOR: Huh?

00:31:39.809 --> 00:31:41.600
AUDIENCE: Why does that
not work with this?

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.840
PROFESSOR: I think it does work.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.048
So OK, so it's like what
goes wrong with this scheme.

00:31:45.048 --> 00:31:46.990
Like, one of the
things that we have

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.440
to do with the
topography of good here,

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.230
and as with Kerberos, people
start off using good crypto,

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.226
but it gets worse
and worse over time.

00:31:55.226 --> 00:31:56.100
Computers get faster.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.010
There's better algorithms
that are breaking this stuff.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.180
And if people are not
diligent about increasing

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.869
their standards, then
these problems do creep up.

00:32:02.869 --> 00:32:05.410
So for example, it used to be
the case that many certificates

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.274
were signed.

00:32:06.274 --> 00:32:07.690
Well, there's two
things going on.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.420
There's a public key
signature scheme.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.080
And then because the public key
crypto has some limitations,

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.510
you typically-- actually,
when you sign a message,

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.360
you actually take a
hash of the message

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.710
and then you sign the
hash itself because it's

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.860
hard to sign a gigantic
message, but it's

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.347
easy to sign a compact hash

00:32:24.347 --> 00:32:25.930
And one thing that
actually went wrong

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:29.390
is that people used to
use MD5 as a hash function

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:34.844
for collapsing the big message
here signing into a 128 bit

00:32:34.844 --> 00:32:36.510
thing that you're
going to actually sign

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.400
with a crypto system.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.930
MD5 was good maybe 20 years
ago, and then over time,

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.770
people discovered weaknesses
in MD5 that could be exploited.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.340
So actually, at some
point, someone did actually

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.560
ask for a certificate with
a particular MD5 hash,

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.880
and then they
carefully figured out

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.610
another message that hashes
to the same MD5 value.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:02.090
And as a result, now you have a
signature by a CA on some hash,

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.964
and then you have a different
message, a different key,

00:33:04.964 --> 00:33:06.380
or a different
name that you could

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.870
convince someone was signed.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.697
And this does happen.

00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:13.280
Like, if you spend a lot of time
trying to break a single key,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.430
than you will
succeed eventually.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.750
If that certificate
was using crypto,

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.456
that could be brute force.

00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:22.830
Another example of something
that's probably not so great

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.067
now is if you're using RSA.

00:33:24.067 --> 00:33:25.525
We haven't really
talked about RSA,

00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:27.465
but RSA is one of
these public key crypto

00:33:27.465 --> 00:33:30.370
systems that allows us to
either encrypt messages or sign

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:31.610
messages.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.560
With RSA, these
days, it's probably

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.965
feasible to spend lots of money
and break 1,000 bit RSA keys.

00:33:38.965 --> 00:33:41.090
You'd probably have to
spend a fair amount of work,

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.850
but it's doable, probably
within a year easily.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:46.140
From there, absolutely.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.720
You can ask a certificate
authority to sign some message,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.850
or you can even take
someone's existing public key

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.680
and try to brute force the
corresponding secret key, or

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.430
[? manual hack. ?]

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:01.630
So you have to keep up with
the attackers in some sense.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.745
You have to use
larger keys with RSA.

00:34:03.745 --> 00:34:05.870
Or maybe you have to use
a different crypto scheme.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:08.031
For example, now people
don't use MD5 hashes

00:34:08.031 --> 00:34:08.739
and certificates.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.167
They use SHA-1, but that
was good for a while.

00:34:11.167 --> 00:34:13.250
Now SHA-1 is also weak,
and Google is actually now

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.010
actively trying to push web
developers and browser vendors

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.712
et cetera to discontinue
the use of SHA-1

00:34:19.712 --> 00:34:21.920
and use a different hash
function because it's pretty

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.489
clear that maybe in
5 or 10 years time,

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.070
there will be relatively
easy attacks on SHA-1.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.000
It's already been
shown to be weaker.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.931
So I guess there is no
magic bullet, per se.

00:34:31.931 --> 00:34:33.389
You just have to
make sure that you

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.650
keep evolving with the hackers.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.908
Yeah.

00:34:37.908 --> 00:34:39.199
There is a problem, absolutely.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.199
Like, all of this stuff
that we're talking about

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:44.330
relies on crypto being correct,
or sort of being s to break.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.166
So you have to pick
parameters suitably.

00:34:47.166 --> 00:34:49.179
At least here, there's
an expiration time.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.800
So well, let's pick
some parameters

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.980
that are good for a year
as opposed to for 10 years.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.820
The CA has a much
bigger problem.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.570
This key, there's no
expiration on it, necessarily.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.770
So that's less clear
what's going on.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.360
So probably, you would pick
really aggressively sort

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.400
of safe parameters.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.160
So 4,000 or 6,000
bit RSA or something.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.570
Or another scheme all together.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.920
Don't use SHA-1 at all here.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:17.380
Yeah.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.500
No real clear answer.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.490
You just have to do it.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:21.990
All right.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.320
Any other questions?

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:24.960
All right.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.740
So let's now look at-- so
this is just like the protocol

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.370
side of things.

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:30.240
Let's now look at how
do we integrate this

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.420
into a particular application,
namely the web browser?

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.640
So I guess if you want to secure
network communication, or sort

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.490
of websites, with
cryptography, there's

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.650
really three things we
have to protect in browser.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.220
So the first thing we have to
protect is data on the network.

00:35:51.922 --> 00:35:55.421
And this is almost the easy
part because well, we're

00:35:55.421 --> 00:35:57.420
just going to run a
protocol very much like what

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.810
I've been describing so far.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.920
We'll encrypt all the
messages, sign them,

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.670
make sure they haven't
been tampered with,

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.410
all this great stuff.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.620
So that's how we're
going to protect data.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.850
But then there's two other
things in a web browser

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.315
that we really have
to worry about.

00:36:11.315 --> 00:36:13.970
So the first of them
is anything that

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:15.340
actually runs in the browser.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.960
So code that's running
in the browser,

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.510
like JavaScript or
important data that's

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.340
stored in the browser.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.950
Maybe your cookies, or local
storage, or lots of other stuff

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:27.005
that goes on in a
modern browser all

00:36:27.005 --> 00:36:29.795
has to be somehow protected
from network [? of hackers. ?]

00:36:29.795 --> 00:36:31.170
And we'll see the
kinds of things

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.390
we have to worry about
here in a second.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:36.920
And then the last thing that you
might not think about too much

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.060
but turns out to be a
real issue in practice

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:43.950
is protecting the
user interface.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:47.472
And the reason for this
is that ultimately,

00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:49.930
much of the confidential data
that we care about protecting

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:50.763
comes from the user.

00:36:50.763 --> 00:36:53.829
And the user is typing this
stuff into some website,

00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:55.620
and the user probably
has multiple websites

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.411
open on their computer
so that the user has

00:36:57.411 --> 00:36:59.760
to be able to distinguish
which site they're actually

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.980
interacting with at
any moment in time.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.690
If they accidentally typed their
Amazon password into some web

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:06.674
discussion forum, it's
going to be disastrous

00:37:06.674 --> 00:37:09.090
depending on how much you care
about your Amazon password,

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:10.680
but still.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:14.550
So you really want to
have good user interface

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.077
sort of elements that
help the user figure out

00:37:17.077 --> 00:37:17.910
what are they doing?

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.500
Am I typing this confidential
data into the right website,

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.590
or what's going to happen to
this data when I submit it?

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:30.360
So this turns out to be a pretty
important issue for protecting

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.380
web applications.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.170
All right.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.080
Make sense?

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.760
So let's talk actually
what the current web

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.890
browsers do on this front.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.510
So as I mentioned, here
for protecting [INAUDIBLE],

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.290
we're just going to use this
protocol called SSL or TLS now

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.000
that encrypts and
authenticates data.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.670
It looks very similar to the
kind of discussion we've had

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.110
so far.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.180
It includes the certificate
authorities, et cetera.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.710
And then of course,
many more details.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.080
Like, TLS is hugely
complicated, but it's not

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.064
particularly interesting
from this [INAUDIBLE] angle.

00:38:06.064 --> 00:38:08.230
All right, so protecting,
[? stopping ?] the browser

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.670
turns out to be much
more interesting.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.950
And the reason is that
we need to make sure

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:19.520
that any code or data delivered
over non-encrypted connections

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.090
can't tamper with
code and data that

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.121
came from an
encrypted connection

00:38:24.121 --> 00:38:26.620
because our threat model is
that anything that's unencrypted

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:30.970
could potentially be tampered
with by a network [? backer. ?]

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:33.730
So we have to make
sure that if we

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:38.250
have some unencrypted JavaScript
code running on our browser,

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.220
then we should assume
that that could've

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.750
been tampered with an attacker
because it wasn't encrypted.

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.077
It wasn't authenticated
over the network.

00:38:44.077 --> 00:38:45.660
And consequently,
we should prevent it

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.790
from tampering with any
pages that were delivered

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.749
over an encrypted connection.

00:38:50.749 --> 00:38:52.540
So the general plan
for this is we're going

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:56.620
to introduce a new URL scheme.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:57.950
Let's call HTTPS.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:02.710
So you often see this in URLs,
presumably in your own life.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:07.640
And there's going to be two
things that-- well, first

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.190
of all, the cool thing about
introducing a new URL scheme

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:13.440
is that now, these URLs are
just different from HTTP URLs.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.560
So if you have a URL that's
HTTPS colon something

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.290
something, it's a
different origin

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:23.420
as far as the same origin policy
is concerned from regular HTTP

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.350
URLs.

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:26.680
So HTTP URLs go over
unencrypted corrections.

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.430
These things are
going over SSL/TLS.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.770
So you'll never confuse
the two if the same origin

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:35.130
policy does its job correctly.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.320
So that's one bit of a puzzle.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.180
But then you have
to also make sure

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:44.040
that you correctly distinguish
different encrypted sites

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.940
from one another.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.420
It then turns out cookies
have a different policy

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.072
for historical reasons.

00:39:49.072 --> 00:39:50.530
So let's first talk
about how we're

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:52.740
going to distinguish
different encrypted sites

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.980
from one another.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.010
So the plan for that
is that actually,

00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:02.965
the host name via the URL has to
be the name in the certificate.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.627
So that's what
actually turns out

00:40:07.627 --> 00:40:09.126
that the certificate
authorities are

00:40:09.126 --> 00:40:10.600
going to sign at
the end of the day

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.150
So we're going to literally
sign the host name that shows up

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:18.510
in your URL as the name for
your web server's public key.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:22.684
So Amazon presumably has a
certificate for www.amazon.com.

00:40:22.684 --> 00:40:24.100
That's the name,
and then whatever

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.000
the public key corresponding
to their secret key is.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.050
And this is what the
browser's going to look for.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.970
So if it gets a
certificate-- well,

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:38.016
if it tries to connect or get
a URL that's https://foo.com,

00:40:38.016 --> 00:40:40.620
it better be the case that the
server presents a certificate

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.570
for foo.com exactly.

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.560
Otherwise, we'll say, well, we
tried to connect to one guy,

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.500
but we actually
have another guy.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.680
That's a different
name in the certificate

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.890
that we connected to.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:54.690
And that'll be a
certificate mismatch.

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.230
So that's how we are going to
distinguish different sites

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.730
from one another.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.229
We're basically
going to get the CAs

00:40:59.229 --> 00:41:01.370
to help us tell
these sites apart,

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.630
and the CAs are going to
promise to issue certificates

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.872
to only the right entities.

00:41:05.872 --> 00:41:07.330
So that's on the
same margin policy

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:11.300
side, how we're going to
separate the code apart.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.050
And then as it turns out--
well, as you might remember,

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:17.475
cookies have a slightly
different policy.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:20.800
Like, it's almost the same
origin, but not quite.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.980
So cookies have a
slightly different plan.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:30.610
So cookies have this secure flag
that you can set on a cookie.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:34.220
So the rules are, if a
cookie has a secure flag,

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:39.940
then it gets sent only
to HTTPS requests,

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.330
or along with HTTPS requests.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:45.700
And if a cookie doesn't
have a secure flag,

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.590
then it applies to both
HTTP and HTTPS requests.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.600
Well, it's a little
bit complicated, right.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.640
It would be cleaner
if cookies just said,

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.080
well, this is a cookie
for an HTTPS post,

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.700
and this is a cookie
for HTTP host.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.470
And they're just
completely different.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.410
That would be very clear in
terms of isolating secure sites

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.007
from insecure sites.

00:42:05.007 --> 00:42:06.590
Unfortunately, for
historical reasons,

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.370
cookies have this weird
sort of interaction.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.250
So if a cookie is marked
secure, then it only

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.660
applies to HTTPS sites.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:16.830
Well, there's a host
also as well, right.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.920
So secure cookies apply
only to HTTPS host URLs,

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.740
and insecure cookies
apply to both.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.310
So that will be some source of
problems for us in a second.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.450
Make sense?

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.080
All right.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.490
And the final bit
that web browsers

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:38.870
do to try to help us along in
this plan is for the UI aspect,

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:43.540
they're going to introduce
some kind of a lock icon

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.660
that users are supposed to see.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.220
So there's a lock
icon in your browser,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.150
plus you're supposed to look
at the URL to figure out

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.150
which site you're on.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.860
Now that's how web
browser developers expect

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.030
you to think of the world.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.100
Like, if you're ever
entering confidential stuff

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.850
into some website, then
you should look at the URL,

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:04.816
make sure that's
the actual host name

00:43:04.816 --> 00:43:06.690
that you want to be
talking to, and then look

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.980
for some sort of a
lock icon, and then you

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.755
should assume things
are good to go.

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:12.735
So that's the UI aspect of it.

00:43:12.735 --> 00:43:13.360
It's not great.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.880
It turns out that many
phishing sites will just

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.800
include an image of a lock
icon in the site itself

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.960
and have a different URL.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.030
And if you don't know
exactly what to look for

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:29.210
or what's going on, a user
might be fooled by this.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.960
So this UI side
is a little messy,

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.790
partly because users
are messy, like humans.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:36.515
And it's really
hard to tell what's

00:43:36.515 --> 00:43:37.640
the right thing to do here.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.110
So we'll focus mostly
on this aspect of it,

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.652
which is much easier
to discuss precisely.

00:43:43.652 --> 00:43:45.290
Make sense?

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.665
Any questions about
this stuff so far?

00:43:47.665 --> 00:43:48.164
Yeah.

00:43:48.164 --> 00:43:49.538
AUDIENCE: I noticed
some websites

00:43:49.538 --> 00:43:51.624
that our HTTPS [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:51.624 --> 00:43:52.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:57.030
So it turns out that the
browsers evolve over time what

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.820
it means to get a lock icon.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.370
So one thing that
some browsers do

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:06.390
is they give you
a lock icon only

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:09.850
if all of the content or the
resources within your page

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:11.462
were also served over HTTPS.

00:44:11.462 --> 00:44:12.920
So this is one of
the problems that

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.680
forced HTTPS tries to
address is this mixed

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:19.910
content or insecure
embedding kinds of problems.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.290
So sometimes, you will be fail
to get a lock icon because

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:23.950
of that check.

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:25.820
Other times, maybe
your certificate

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.820
isn't quite good enough.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.700
So for example, Chrome will
not give you a lock icon

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:34.430
if it thinks your certificate
uses weak cryptography.

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:35.990
But also, it varies
with browsers.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.280
So maybe Chrome will not
give you a lock icon,

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.470
but Firefox will.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:43.000
So it's, again,
there's no clear spec

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.920
on what this lock icon means.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:51.060
Just people sweep stuff
under this lock icon.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.114
Other questions?

00:44:54.114 --> 00:44:55.090
All right.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.830
So let's look at h guess
what kinds of problems

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.082
we run into with this plan.

00:45:01.082 --> 00:45:03.290
So one thing I guess we
should maybe first talk about

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:07.540
is, OK, so in
regular HTTP, we used

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.010
to rely on DNS to
give us the correct IP

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:13.100
address on the server.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:17.595
So how much do we have to
trust DNS for these HTTPS URLs?

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.049
Are DNS servers trusted,
or are these DNS mappings

00:45:24.049 --> 00:45:25.090
important for us anymore?

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:28.860
Yeah.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.860
AUDIENCE: They are
because the certificate

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.819
is signing the domain name.

00:45:32.819 --> 00:45:34.860
I don't think you sign an
IP address [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.170
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:35.390
Yeah.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:37.098
So the certificate
signs the domain name.

00:45:37.098 --> 00:45:38.430
So this is like amazon.com.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.840
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.776
AUDIENCE: Say someone steals
amazon.com's private key

00:45:47.776 --> 00:45:51.220
and [INAUDIBLE] another server
with another IP address,

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.849
and combines [INAUDIBLE]
IP address [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:54.849 --> 00:45:56.640
But then you already
stole the private key.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.030
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.530
Yeah.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.220
So in fact, you're
describing after both

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.880
steal the private key and
redirect DNS to yourself.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.852
So is DNS in itself sensitive
enough for us to care about?

00:46:07.852 --> 00:46:09.310
I guess in some
sense you're right,

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:11.130
that we need DNS
to find the idea,

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:13.615
or otherwise we'd be lost
because this is just the host

00:46:13.615 --> 00:46:15.990
name, and we still need to
find IP address to talk to it.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.830
What if someone
compromised the DNS server

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:19.814
and points us at a
different IP address?

00:46:19.814 --> 00:46:20.730
Is it going to be bad?

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:21.230
Yeah.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:25.019
AUDIENCE: Well, maybe
just [INAUDIBLE] HTTPS.

00:46:25.019 --> 00:46:26.810
PROFESSOR: So potentially
worrisome, right.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.763
So they might just refuse
the connection altogether.

00:46:28.763 --> 00:46:29.709
AUDIENCE: Well, no.

00:46:29.709 --> 00:46:31.810
They just redirect
you to the HTTP URL.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:33.351
PROFESSOR: Well, so
certainly, if you

00:46:33.351 --> 00:46:37.290
connect to it over HTTPS,
then they can't redirect.

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:39.660
But yeah.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.160
Yeah.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.660
AUDIENCE: You can [INAUDIBLE]
and try to fool the user.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.520
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.770
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:49.960
So the thing that
you mentioned is

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.190
that you could try to serve
up a different certificate.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.097
So maybe you-- well, one
possibility is you somehow

00:46:56.097 --> 00:46:57.930
compromised the CA, in
which case all right,

00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:59.470
you're in business.

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:01.434
Another possibility is
maybe you'll just sign

00:47:01.434 --> 00:47:02.600
the certificate by yourself.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.725
Or maybe you have some old
certificate for this guy

00:47:04.725 --> 00:47:08.240
that you gotten the
private key for.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.070
And it turns out
that web browsers,

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.300
as this sort of forced HTTPS
paper we're reading touched on,

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.570
most web browsers actually ask
the user if something doesn't

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.205
look right with the
certificate, which

00:47:20.205 --> 00:47:21.580
seems like a fairly
strange thing

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.850
to do because here's the rule.

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.300
The host name has to match
the name of the certificate,

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.400
and it has to be valid.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.450
It has to be unexpired,
all these very clear rules.

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:34.640
But because of historically the
way HTTPS has been deployed,

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.030
it's often been the case
that web server operators

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.270
mis-configure HTTPS.

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:43.330
So maybe they just forget
to renew their certificate.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:45.380
Things were going
along great and you

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.697
didn't notice that your
certificate was expired

00:47:47.697 --> 00:47:49.030
and you just forgot to renew it.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.368
So it seems to web
browser developers, that

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:52.576
seems like a bit of a bummer.

00:47:52.576 --> 00:47:53.076
Oh, man.

00:47:53.076 --> 00:47:54.020
It's just expired.

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.510
Let's just let
the user continue.

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:57.880
So they offer a dialogue
box for the user saying,

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.610
well, I got a
certificate, but it

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.050
doesn't look right in some way.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.220
[INAUDIBLE] go ahead
anyway and continue.

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.880
So web browsers will allow
users to sort of override

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.785
this decision on things like
expiration of certificates.

00:48:10.785 --> 00:48:13.287
Also for host names,
it might be the case

00:48:13.287 --> 00:48:14.620
that your website has many name.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.440
Like for Amazon,
you might connect

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:21.430
to amazon.com, or maybe
www.amazon.com, or maybe

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:23.220
other host names.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.007
And if you are not careful
with the website operator,

00:48:26.007 --> 00:48:27.590
you might not know
to get certificates

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:30.910
for every possible name
that your website has.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.615
And then a user is sort
of stuck saying, well,

00:48:33.615 --> 00:48:35.240
the host name doesn't
look quite right,

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.020
but maybe let's go anyway.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.070
So this is the reason
why web browsers allow

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:44.560
users to accept more
broadly, or a broader range

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.291
of certificates, than these
rules might otherwise dictate.

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.540
So that's [INAUDIBLE] problem.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:51.484
And then if you
hijack DNS, then you

00:48:51.484 --> 00:48:52.900
might be able to
redirect the user

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.695
to one of these
sites that serves up

00:48:54.695 --> 00:48:56.830
a incorrect certificate.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.270
And if the user isn't
careful, they're

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:03.230
going to potentially approve
the browser accepting

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:07.102
your certificate, and then
you're in trouble then.

00:49:07.102 --> 00:49:12.354
That's a bit of a gray area
with respect to how much

00:49:12.354 --> 00:49:13.520
you should really trust DNS.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.978
So you certainly don't want to
give arbitrary users control

00:49:15.978 --> 00:49:17.890
of your DNS name [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.900
But certainly, the goal
of SSL/TLS and HTTPS,

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.290
all this stuff, is to
hopefully not trust DNS at all.

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:27.940
If everything works
here correctly,

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.150
then DNS shouldn't be trusted.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.794
You can [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:31.794 --> 00:49:33.710
You should never be able
to intercept any data

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:36.612
or corrupt data, et cetera.

00:49:36.612 --> 00:49:37.847
Make sense?

00:49:37.847 --> 00:49:39.430
That's if everything
works, of course.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:42.280
It's a little bit
messier than that.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.990
All right.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:49.230
So I guess one interesting
question to talk about

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:52.880
is I guess how bad
could an attack be

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:57.290
if the user mis-approves
a certificate?

00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:59.150
So as we were saying,
if the user accepts

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:02.110
a certificate for the wrong
host or accepts an expired

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:05.300
certificate, what
could go wrong?

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.870
How much should we worry about
this mistake from the user?

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:10.428
Yeah.

00:50:10.428 --> 00:50:11.594
AUDIENCE: Well, [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:17.671
But it could be,
[? in example ?], not the site

00:50:17.671 --> 00:50:19.490
the user wants to visit.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:24.252
So they could do things like
pretend to be the user's name.

00:50:24.252 --> 00:50:24.960
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.515
So certainly, the user
might then I guess

00:50:27.515 --> 00:50:29.640
be fooled into thinking,
oh, I have all this money,

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.230
or you have no money at all
because the result page comes

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.010
back saying here's your balance.

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.940
So maybe the user
will assume something

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:39.070
about what that bank has
or doesn't have based

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.830
on the result. Well,
it still seems bad,

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:43.520
but not necessarily
so disastrous.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.460
Yeah.

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.810
AUDIENCE: I think
that an [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:51.162
get all the user's
cookies and [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:51.162 --> 00:50:51.870
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:53.367
So this is your fear, yeah.

00:50:53.367 --> 00:50:54.950
This is much more
worrisome, actually,

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:58.000
or has a much more longer
lasting impact on you.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.536
And the reason this works out
is because the browser, when

00:51:01.536 --> 00:51:04.060
it figures out [INAUDIBLE]
makes a decision

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.610
as to who is allowed to get
a particular set of cookies

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:09.640
or not just looks at
the host name in the URL

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.390
that you were supposed
to be connected to.

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:14.305
So if you connect to some
attackers' web server,

00:51:14.305 --> 00:51:18.130
and then you just accept their
certificate for amazon.com

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.175
as the real thing,
then the browser

00:51:20.175 --> 00:51:22.785
will think, yeah, the entity
I'm talking to is amazon.com,

00:51:22.785 --> 00:51:25.810
so I will treat them as I
would a normal amazon.com

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:28.345
server, which means that
they should get access

00:51:28.345 --> 00:51:31.120
to all the cookies that
you have for that host.

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.770
And presumably they could
run a JavaScript code

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:37.880
in your browser in that
same origin principle.

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.780
So if you have
another site open that

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:45.080
was connecting to the
real website-- like maybe

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.650
you had a tab open
in your browser.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:48.400
You closed your laptop,
then you opened it

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.190
on a different network, all of
a sudden, someone intercepted

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:53.480
your connection to
amazon.com and injected

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.614
their own response.

00:51:54.614 --> 00:51:56.030
If you approve it,
then they'll be

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:58.975
able to access
the old amazon.com

00:51:58.975 --> 00:52:01.100
page you have open because
as far as the browser is

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.599
concerned, these
are the same origin

00:52:02.599 --> 00:52:04.656
because they have
the same host name.

00:52:04.656 --> 00:52:06.150
That's going to be troublesome.

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.670
So this is potentially
quite a unfortunate attack

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:11.720
if the user makes
the wrong choice

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.560
on approving that certificate.

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.430
Make sense?

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.430
Any questions about that?

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:19.780
All right.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.480
So that's one sort of, I guess,
issue that this forced HTTPS

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.190
paper is worried
about is users making

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:28.870
a mistake in the decision,
users having too much leeway

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:31.850
in accepting certificates.

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:35.910
Another problem that
shows up in practice

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.010
is that-- we sort of
briefly talked about this--

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.690
but this is one of the
things that also forced

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.890
HTTPS, I think, is
somewhat concerned about

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:50.760
is this notion of insecure
embedding, or mixed content.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.940
And the problem that
this term refers to

00:52:54.940 --> 00:53:00.880
is that a secure site, or
any website for that matter,

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.390
can embed other pieces of
content into a web page.

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:14.020
So if you have some sort of
a site, foo.com/index.html,

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.870
this site might be
served from HTTPS,

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:21.420
but inside of this HTML page,
you could have many tags that

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.860
instruct the browser to go
and fetch other stuff as part

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:25.700
of this page.

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.820
So the easiest thing
to sort of think about

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.772
is probably script
tags where you

00:53:29.772 --> 00:53:36.230
can say script source
equals http jquery.com.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:38.620
So this is a popular
JavaScript library

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.330
that makes it easier to
interact with lots of stuff

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:42.250
in your browser.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:47.150
But many web developers
just reference a URL

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:49.385
on another site like this.

00:53:49.385 --> 00:53:51.010
So we should be fairly
straightforward,

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:53.790
but what's the problem
with this kind of set up?

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:58.170
Suppose you have a secure
site and you just load jQuery.

00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:58.896
Yeah.

00:53:58.896 --> 00:54:00.624
AUDIENCE: It could
be fake jQuery.

00:54:00.624 --> 00:54:01.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.300
So there are actually
two ways that you

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.380
could get the wrong thing
that you're not expecting.

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.630
One possibility is that
jQuery itself is compromised.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.470
So that seems like, well,
you get what you asked for.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.830
You asked for this
site from jquery.com

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:16.140
and that's what you get.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:19.070
If jQuery is compromised,
that's too bad.

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:21.220
Another problem is
that this request

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.960
is going to be sent without any
encryption or authentication

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:24.980
over the network.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:29.150
So if an adversary is in control
over your network connection,

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:30.890
then they could
intercept this request

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:34.404
and serve back some other
JavaScript code in response.

00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:35.820
Now, this JavaScript
code is going

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.480
to run as part of this page.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.560
And now, because it's running
in this HTTPS foo.com domain,

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.630
it has access to your
secure cookies for foo.com

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.740
and any other stuff you have
in that page, et cetera.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.920
So it seems like a
really bad thing.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.482
So you should be careful not to.

00:54:52.482 --> 00:54:53.940
Or a web developer
certainly should

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.470
be careful not to make
this kind of a mistake.

00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:02.180
So one solution is to ensure
that all content embedded

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.340
in a secure page is also secure.

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:07.055
So this seems like a good
guideline for many web

00:55:07.055 --> 00:55:07.930
developers to follow.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:12.435
So maybe you should just
do https colon jquery.com.

00:55:12.435 --> 00:55:17.410
Or it turns out that URLs
support these origin relative

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:21.345
URLs, which means you could omit
the HTTPS part and just say,

00:55:21.345 --> 00:55:29.550
[INAUDIBLE] script source
equals //jquery.com/ something.

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:33.900
And what this means is to
use whatever URL scheme

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.890
your own URL came from.

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:39.300
So this tag will translate
to https jquery.com

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:42.870
if it's on an HTTPS page, and
to regular http jquery.com

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:46.940
if it's on a non-HTTPS,
just regular HTTP URL.

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:50.660
So that's one way to
avoid this problem.

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.210
Another thing that actually
recently got introduced.

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:57.280
So this field is
somewhat active.

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.280
People are trying to
make things better.

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:04.340
One alternative way of
dealing with this problem

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.560
is perhaps to include a hash or
some sort of an [? indicator ?]

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.720
right here in the tag, because
if you know exactly what

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.260
content you want to load,
maybe you don't actually

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.890
have to load it all over HTTPS.

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:17.740
You don't actually care who
serves it to you, as long as it

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.560
matches a particular hash.

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.890
So there's actually
a new spec out there

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:26.430
for being able to
specify basically

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:30.310
hashes in these kinds of tags.

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:34.305
So instead of having to refer
to jquery.com with an HTTPS URL,

00:56:34.305 --> 00:56:35.800
maybe what you
could do is just say

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:41.020
script source equals
jquery.com, maybe even HTTP.

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.890
But here, you're going to
include some sort of a tag

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:47.752
attribute, like
hash equals here,

00:56:47.752 --> 00:56:49.960
you're going to put in a--
let's say a shell one hash

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.800
or a shell two
hash of the content

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.020
that you're expecting to
get back from the server.

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:55.475
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:55.475 --> 00:56:56.308
PROFESSOR: Question?

00:56:56.308 --> 00:56:57.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.220
PROFESSOR: Ah, man.

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.160
There's some
complicated name for it.

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.070
I have the URL, actually, in the
lecture notes, so [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.590
Subresource integrity
or something like this.

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.280
I can actually slowly
be-- well, hopefully

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:18.380
will be deployed probably
soon in various browsers.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.840
Feels like another way to
actually authenticate content

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.980
without relying on data, or data
encryption of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.170
So here, we have this
very generic plan

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.970
using SSL and TLS to
authenticate connections

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.317
to particular servers.

00:57:33.317 --> 00:57:34.900
This is almost like
an alternative way

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:39.160
of thinking of sort of securing
your network communication.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.530
If the thing you just
care about is integrity,

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:43.890
then maybe you don't need
a secure, encrypted channel

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:44.630
over the network.

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:47.048
All you need is to
specify exactly what you

00:57:47.048 --> 00:57:48.173
want at the end of the day.

00:57:48.173 --> 00:57:48.672
Yeah.

00:57:48.672 --> 00:57:51.280
AUDIENCE: So doesn't
this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.620
PROFESSOR: Doesn't this
code sit at the client?

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.030
Well, it runs at the client,
but the client fetches this code

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:58.450
from some server.

00:57:58.450 --> 00:57:59.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:02.384
Can't anybody just [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:02.384 --> 00:58:03.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:06.280
So I think the
point of the hash is

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:13.060
to protect the containing page
from attackers that injected

00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:14.930
different JavaScript code here.

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:16.690
So for jQuery, this
makes a lot of sense

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:18.310
because jQuery is well known.

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:20.819
You're not trying to hide
what jQuery source code is.

00:58:20.819 --> 00:58:23.110
Well, what you do want to
make sure is that the network

00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:25.880
attacker cannot intercept
your connection and supply

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.244
a malicious version of
jQuery that's going to leak

00:58:28.244 --> 00:58:28.785
your cookies.

00:58:28.785 --> 00:58:30.690
AUDIENCE: [? Oh, ?] OK.

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:32.150
PROFESSOR: That make sense?

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:33.820
It's absolutely true that
anyone can compute the hash

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.111
of these things for themselves.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.026
So this is a solution
for integrity problems,

00:58:41.026 --> 00:58:42.025
not for confidentiality.

00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:46.770
All right.

00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:51.450
So this is sort of what I guess
developers have to watch out

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:58.680
for when writing pages, or
including content in their HTML

00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:01.330
pages on a HTTPS URL.

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:05.230
Another worrisome problem
is dealing with cookies.

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:12.130
And here's where this difference
between secure flags and just

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:15.410
origins comes into play.

00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:17.860
So one thing, of course,
the developer could screw up

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.430
is maybe they just forget
to set the secure flag

00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:23.150
on a cookie in the first place.

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:24.170
This happens.

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:29.950
Maybe you're thinking my users
only ever go to the HTTPS URL.

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:31.350
My cookies are
never [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:32.950
Why should I set the
secure flag on the cookie?

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:33.880
And they might
[? also have the ?]

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.970
secure flag, or maybe
they just forget about it.

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.837
Is this a problem?

00:59:38.837 --> 00:59:40.420
What if your users
are super diligent?

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:43.260
They always visit the
HTTPS URL, and you don't

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.655
have any problems like this.

00:59:44.655 --> 00:59:47.540
Do you still leave the
secure flag on your cookies?

00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:48.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.140
Yeah.

00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:53.580
AUDIENCE: Could the
attacker connect to your URL

00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:55.020
and redirect you
to a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:55.686
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:55.686 --> 00:59:59.110
So even if the user doesn't
explicitly, manually

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:02.620
go to some plain text URL, the
attacker could give you a link,

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:06.834
or maybe ask you to load an
image from a non-HTTPS URL.

01:00:06.834 --> 01:00:08.250
And then non-secure
cookie is just

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:10.250
going to be sent along
with the network request.

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:11.833
So that seems like
a bit of a problem.

01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:13.560
So you really do
need the secure flag,

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.934
even if your users and your
application is super careful.

01:00:15.934 --> 01:00:17.967
AUDIENCE: But I'm
assuming there's

01:00:17.967 --> 01:00:19.668
an HTTP URL [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:24.320
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.319
So again, so how could
this [? break? ?] Suppose

01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:27.150
I have a site.

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.810
It doesn't even
listen on port 80.

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:31.560
There's no way to
connect to me on port 80,

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.218
so why is it a problem if
I have a non-secure cookie?

01:00:34.218 --> 01:00:36.009
AUDIENCE: Because the
browser wouldn't have

01:00:36.009 --> 01:00:38.000
cookies for another domain.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.666
So the browser wouldn't
send your cookie

01:00:40.666 --> 01:00:43.660
to a different domain,
but yet it still

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.740
seems worrisome that an
attacker might load a URL.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.842
So suppose that amazon.com only
ever served stuff over SSL.

01:00:50.842 --> 01:00:52.300
It's not even
listening on port 80.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.060
There's no way to connect it.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.080
So in this case,
and as a result,

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.666
they don't set their
secure flag on a cookie.

01:00:59.666 --> 01:01:01.540
So how could a hacker
then steal their cookie

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.546
if Amazon isn't even
listening at port 80?

01:01:04.546 --> 01:01:05.426
Yeah.

01:01:05.426 --> 01:01:07.050
AUDIENCE: Can't the
browser still think

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:09.340
it's an HTTP connection?

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.100
PROFESSOR: Well, so
if you connect to port

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.424
443 and you speak SSL
or GLS, then it's always

01:01:14.424 --> 01:01:15.340
going to be encrypted.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.697
So that's not a problem.

01:01:16.697 --> 01:01:17.671
Yeah.

01:01:17.671 --> 01:01:20.964
AUDIENCE: The attacker can
[INAUDIBLE] their network.

01:01:20.964 --> 01:01:21.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.350
So the attacker can actually
intercept your packets

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:26.960
that are trying to connect
to Amazon on port 80

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.960
and then appear, and make
it appear, like you've

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.720
connected successfully.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.510
So if the attacker has
control over your network,

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:35.760
they could redirect
your packets trying

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.970
to get to Amazon to their
own machine on port 80.

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:39.290
They're going to
accept the connection,

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:41.831
and the client isn't going to
be able to know the difference.

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:44.030
It will be as if Amazon
is listening on port 80,

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:46.931
and then your cookies will be
sent to this adversary's web

01:01:46.931 --> 01:01:47.430
server.

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:49.246
AUDIENCE: Because the
client is unknown.

01:01:49.246 --> 01:01:49.810
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:51.380
Yeah, so for HTTP,
there's no way

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.420
to authenticate the host
you're connected to.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.950
This is exactly what's going on.

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:57.980
HTTP has no authentication,
and as a result,

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.950
you have to prevent
the cookies from being

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.730
sent over HTTP in
the first place

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:05.320
because you have no idea
who that HTTP connection is

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.066
going to go to if you're
assuming a network adversary.

01:02:08.066 --> 01:02:10.624
AUDIENCE: So you need
network control to do this.

01:02:10.624 --> 01:02:11.540
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.560
So either you have full
control over your network

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.518
so you know that adversaries
aren't going to be

01:02:15.518 --> 01:02:16.860
able to intercept your packets.

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.610
But even then, it's
actually not so great.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.580
Like look at the TCP lecture.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.716
You can do all kinds of sequence
number of attacks and so on.

01:02:23.716 --> 01:02:25.700
[? That's going to be ?]
troublesome.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.450
All right.

01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:28.233
Any more questions about that?

01:02:28.233 --> 01:02:28.732
Yeah.

01:02:28.732 --> 01:02:30.130
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry, but
isn't the attack intercepted

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:30.671
in that case?

01:02:30.671 --> 01:02:31.917
Is there like a redirect?

01:02:31.917 --> 01:02:33.750
PROFESSOR: Well, what
that hacker presumably

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.860
would intercept is an HTTP
request from the client going

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:40.939
to http amazon.com, and
that request includes

01:02:40.939 --> 01:02:43.397
all your amazon.com cookies,
or cookies for whatever domain

01:02:43.397 --> 01:02:45.210
it is that you're
sending your request to.

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:47.084
So if you don't mark
those cookies as secure,

01:02:47.084 --> 01:02:49.240
there will be set of both
encrypted and unencrypted

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:49.740
connections.

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.810
AUDIENCE: So how does that
request get initiated?

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:52.600
PROFESSOR: Ah, OK.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.100
Yeah.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:55.360
So maybe you get the user
to visit newyorktimes.com

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.260
and you pay for an advertisement
that loads an image

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.194
from http colon amazon.com.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:02.980
And there's nothing
preventing you

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.120
from saying, please load
an image from this URL.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.950
But when a browser
tries to connect there,

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.858
it'll send the cookies if
the connection succeeds.

01:03:09.858 --> 01:03:10.854
Question back there.

01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:14.174
AUDIENCE: Will it ask
for a change [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:14.174 --> 01:03:14.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.890
So HTTPS everywhere
is an extension

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:20.040
that is very similar to
forced HTTPS in some ways,

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.720
and it tries to prevent
these kinds of mistakes.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.380
So I guess one thing
that forced HTTP does

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:31.760
is they worry about
such mistakes.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.410
And when you sort of opted a
site into this forced HTTPS

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:39.560
plan, one thing that the
browser will do for you

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.270
is prevent any HTTPS
connections to that host

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:44.560
in the first place.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.250
So there's no way to make
this kind of mistakes

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:50.580
of not flagging your
cookie as secure,

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:54.340
or having other sort of kinds
of cookie problems as well.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:57.430
Another more subtle
problem-- so this,

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:58.930
the problem we
talked about just now

01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:00.430
is the developer
forgetting to set

01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:01.974
the secure flag on a cookie.

01:04:01.974 --> 01:04:02.890
So that seems fixable.

01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:04.639
OK, maybe the developer
should just do it.

01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:05.690
OK, fix that problem.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:07.270
The thing that's
much more subtle

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:11.030
is that when a secure web
server gets a cookie back

01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:13.990
from the client, it actually has
no idea whether this cookie was

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:17.020
sent through an encrypted
connection or a plain text

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.819
connection because
when the server gets

01:04:19.819 --> 01:04:21.360
a cookie from the
client, all it gets

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.200
is the key value
pair for a cookie.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:28.650
And as we sort of look at here,
the plan for the [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:31.530
follows is that it'll include
both secure and insecure

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:35.050
cookies when it's sending a
request to a secure server,

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:36.850
because the browser
here was just

01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:39.650
concerned about the
confidentiality of cookies.

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:42.030
But on the server
side, you now don't

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:43.280
have any integrity guarantees.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.762
When you get a
cookie from a user,

01:04:44.762 --> 01:04:46.970
it might have been sent over
an encrypted connection,

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:50.370
but it also might have been sent
over a plain text connection.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:53.390
So this leads to somewhat
more subtle attacks,

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.670
but the flavor of
these attacks tend

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:57.370
to be things like
session fixation.

01:04:57.370 --> 01:05:01.840
What it means is that suppose I
want to see what emails you're

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.490
sending.

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:05.130
Or maybe I'll set a
cookie for you that

01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:06.850
is a copy of my Gmail, cookie.

01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:08.760
So when you go to compose
a message in Gmail,

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.700
it'll actually be saved in
my sent folder inside of your

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:12.531
sent folder.

01:05:12.531 --> 01:05:14.155
It'll be as if you're
using my account,

01:05:14.155 --> 01:05:16.280
and then I'll be able to
extract things from there.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.610
So if I can force a session
cookie into your browser

01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:22.260
and sort of get you
to use my account,

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.340
maybe I can extract some
information that way

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.170
from the victim.

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:32.290
So that's another problem that
arises because of this grey

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:36.060
area [INAUDIBLE] incomplete
separation between HTTP

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:37.523
and HTTPS cookies.

01:05:37.523 --> 01:05:38.022
Question.

01:05:38.022 --> 01:05:40.313
AUDIENCE: So you would need
a [INAUDIBLE] vulnerability

01:05:40.313 --> 01:05:41.670
to set that cookie [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:43.419
PROFESSOR: No.
[INAUDIBLE] vulnerability

01:05:43.419 --> 01:05:44.210
to set this cookie.

01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:46.210
You would just trick the
browser into connecting

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:49.460
to a regular HTTP host URL.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:53.440
And without some extension
like forced HTTPS or HTTPS

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.730
everywhere, you could
then, as an adversary,

01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:59.680
set up a key in
the user's browser.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.470
It's a non-secure
cookie, but it's

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:03.555
going to be sent back,
even on secure requests.

01:06:03.555 --> 01:06:06.013
AUDIENCE: So do you have to
trick the browser into thinking

01:06:06.013 --> 01:06:07.650
the domain is the same domain?

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:08.070
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:08.240
Yeah.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.910
So you have to intercept
their network connection

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:11.280
and probably do the
same kind of attack

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.446
you were talking about just
a couple of minutes ago.

01:06:13.446 --> 01:06:14.090
Yeah.

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:15.970
Make sense?

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:17.390
All right.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:20.390
So I guess there's
probably [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:23.130
So what does forced HTTPS
actually do for us now?

01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:27.100
It tries to prevent some
subset of these problems.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.680
So I guess I should say, so
forced HTTPS, the paper we read

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.930
was sort of a
research proposal that

01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:35.539
was published I guess
five or six years ago now.

01:06:35.539 --> 01:06:37.330
Since then, it's actually
been standardized

01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:38.560
and actually adopted.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:42.410
So this was like a somewhat
sketchy plug-in that

01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:43.665
stored stuff and some cookies.

01:06:43.665 --> 01:06:46.620
Are they worried about
getting evicted and so on?

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:48.770
Now actually, most
browsers look at this paper

01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:49.710
and say, OK, this
is a great idea.

01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:51.126
We'll actually
implement it better

01:06:51.126 --> 01:06:52.350
within the browser itself.

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:55.970
So there's something called HTTP
strict transport security that

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.199
implements most of the
ideas from forced HTTPS

01:06:58.199 --> 01:06:59.490
and actually make a good story.

01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:03.565
Like, here's how research
actually makes an impact on I

01:07:03.565 --> 01:07:07.100
guess security of web
applications and browsers.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.970
But anyway, let's look
at what forced HTTPS

01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:10.980
does for a website.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:15.220
So forced HTTPS allows a
website to set this bit

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.380
for a particular host name.

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:21.005
And the way that forced
HTTPS changes the behavior

01:07:21.005 --> 01:07:24.242
of the browser is threefold.

01:07:24.242 --> 01:07:28.760
So if some website
sets forced HTTPS,

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.300
then there's sort of three
things that happen differently.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:39.110
So any certificate
errors are always fatal.

01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:41.405
So the user doesn't
have a chance

01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:45.780
of accepting incorrect
certificate that

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:49.530
has a wrong host name, or an
expiration time that's passed,

01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:50.480
et cetera.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.810
So it's one thing that
the browser now changes.

01:07:52.810 --> 01:08:01.130
Another is that it redirects
all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:02.840
So this is a pretty good idea.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:08.590
If you know a site is always
using HTTPS legitimately,

01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:10.852
then you should probably
prohibit any regular HTTP

01:08:10.852 --> 01:08:12.810
requests [? website ?],
because that's probably

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:15.110
a sign of some mistake
or attacker trying

01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:17.830
to trick you into connecting
to a site without encryption.

01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:20.080
You want to make sure this
actually happens before you

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.080
issue the HTTP request.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.740
Otherwise, the HTTP request
has already sort of sailed

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.630
onto the network.

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:32.140
And the last thing that this
forced HTTPS setting changes is

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:37.740
that it actually prohibits
this insecure embedding

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:43.910
plan that we looked
at below here

01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:50.149
when you're including a
HTTP URL in an HTTPS site.

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:51.070
Make sense?

01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:55.319
So this is what the forced
HTTPS sort of extension did.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:57.620
In terms of what's
going on now is

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:03.180
that well, so this HTTPS
strict transport security HSTS

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:06.870
protocol basically
does the same things.

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:09.969
Most browsers now prohibit
insecure embedding by default.

01:09:09.969 --> 01:09:12.109
So this used to be a
little controversial

01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:14.970
because many developers
have trouble with this.

01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:20.590
But I think Firefox and Chrome
and IE all now by default

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:23.529
will refuse to load
insecure components,

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:27.649
or at least secure JavaScript
and CSS, into our page

01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:29.051
unless you do something.

01:09:29.051 --> 01:09:29.550
Question.

01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:31.284
AUDIENCE: Don't they
prompt the user?

01:09:31.284 --> 01:09:33.700
PROFESSOR: They used to, and
the user would just say, yes.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.262
So IE, for example, used to
pop up this dialogue box,

01:09:36.262 --> 01:09:37.720
and this paper
talks about, saying,

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.560
would you like to load
some extra content,

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.517
or something like that.

01:09:42.517 --> 01:09:44.413
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
because [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:45.079
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:45.079 --> 01:09:47.500
I think if you try to
pretend to be clever,

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.520
then you can bypass all
these security mechanisms.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.220
But don't try to
be clever this way.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.770
So this is mostly a
non-problem in modern browsers,

01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:58.140
but these two things
are still things

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.510
that forced HTTPS and HTTP
strict transport security

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:02.993
provide and are useful.

01:10:02.993 --> 01:10:03.493
Yeah.

01:10:03.493 --> 01:10:05.284
AUDIENCE: What happens
when a website can't

01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:08.895
support HTTPS? [INAUDIBLE]
change their [INAUDIBLE]?

01:10:08.895 --> 01:10:11.020
PROFESSOR: So what do you
mean can't support HTTPS?

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.457
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:12.457 --> 01:10:13.290
PROFESSOR: Well, OK.

01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:16.330
So if you have a website
that doesn't support HTTPS

01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:19.116
but sets this
cookie, what happens?

01:10:19.116 --> 01:10:20.068
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:20.068 --> 01:10:21.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.790
So this is the reason
why it's an option.

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:25.640
So if you opted everyone, then
you're exactly in this boat.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.140
Like, oh, all of a sudden, you
can't talk to most of the web

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.775
because they don't use HTTPS.

01:10:29.775 --> 01:10:31.900
So you really wanted this
to be selectively enabled

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.974
for sites that really want
this kind of protection.

01:10:34.974 --> 01:10:35.474
Yeah.

01:10:35.474 --> 01:10:36.950
AUDIENCE: But also, if
I remember correctly,

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:39.270
you can't set the cookie
unless the site [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.650
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:41.441
So these guys are also
worried about denial

01:10:41.441 --> 01:10:44.050
of service attacks,
where this plug in

01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:47.300
could be used to cause
trouble for other sites.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.980
So if you, for example,
set this forced HTTPS

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:55.400
bit for some unsuspecting
website, then all of a sudden,

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.920
the website stops working
because everyone is now

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.570
trying to connect
to them over HTTPS,

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:00.890
and they don't support HTTPS.

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:04.779
So this is one example
of worrying about denial

01:11:04.779 --> 01:11:05.570
of service attacks.

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:07.810
Another thing is
that they actually

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:12.120
don't support setting forced
HTTPS for an entire domain.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.900
So they worried that, for
example, at mit.edu, I

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.430
am a user at mit.edu.

01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:20.150
Maybe I'll set a forced HTTPS
cookie for start.mit.edu

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:21.770
in everyone's browsers.

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:25.330
And now, only HTTPS
things work at MIT.

01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:27.510
That seems also a
little disastrous,

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:29.592
so you probably
want to avoid that.

01:11:29.592 --> 01:11:32.730
On the other hand, actually,
HTTPS strict transfer security

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:34.580
went back on this
and said, well, we'll

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:38.930
allow this notion of forcing
HTTPS for an entire subdomain

01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:42.120
because it turns out
to be useful because

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.595
of these insecure cookies
being sent along with a request

01:11:44.595 --> 01:11:48.250
that you can't tell where
they were sent from initially.

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:50.850
Anyway, so there's all
kinds of subtle interactions

01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:52.280
with teachers at
the lowest level,

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:57.320
but it's not clear what
the right choice is.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.570
OK, so one actually interesting
question you might ask

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:05.040
is are these fundamental
to the system we

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.850
have, or are these mostly
just helping developers avoid

01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:09.040
mistakes?

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.000
So suppose you had a
developer that's very diligent

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.820
and doesn't do insecure
[INAUDIBLE] embedding,

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.230
doesn't solve any
other problems,

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:18.640
always gets their
certificates renewed,

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.511
should they bother with
forced HTTPS or not?

01:12:22.511 --> 01:12:23.010
Yeah.

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:23.885
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

01:12:23.885 --> 01:12:27.920
You still have the problem with
someone forcing HTTP protocol.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.502
Nothing stops the
hacker from doing

01:12:30.502 --> 01:12:32.294
[? excessive ?]
[INAUDIBLE] forces the user

01:12:32.294 --> 01:12:33.793
to load something
over HTTP and then

01:12:33.793 --> 01:12:35.140
to intercept the connection.

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:38.130
PROFESSOR: That's true, but if
you feel they're very diligent

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:40.140
and all their cookies
are marked secure,

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:43.542
then having someone visit an
HTTP version of your site,

01:12:43.542 --> 01:12:44.500
shouldn't be a problem.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.364
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:46.364 --> 01:12:47.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.530
So you'd probably have to
defend against cookie overwrite

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:51.860
or injection attacks, and
that's sort of doable.

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:55.089
It's a little tedious, but
you can probably do something.

01:12:55.089 --> 01:12:55.714
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:12:55.714 --> 01:12:58.488
I think her point is that
also, it didn't-- security

01:12:58.488 --> 01:13:00.474
didn't check the
certificate, right?

01:13:00.474 --> 01:13:01.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:01.723
So that's one.

01:13:01.723 --> 01:13:03.830
I think that this
is the biggest thing

01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:06.290
is this first point, which
is that everything else,

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:08.970
you can sort of defend it
against by cleverly coding

01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:10.780
or being careful in
your application.

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.740
The first thing is
something that the user

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.742
has-- or the developer--
has no control

01:13:14.742 --> 01:13:17.200
over because the developer
wants to make sure, for example,

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.375
that their cookie will only
be sent to their server as

01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:22.180
signed by this CA.

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.227
And if the user is allowed
to randomly say, oh,

01:13:25.227 --> 01:13:26.810
that's good enough,
then the developer

01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:28.393
has no clue where
their cookie's going

01:13:28.393 --> 01:13:30.970
to end up because some
user is going to leak it

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:33.420
to some incorrect server.

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.737
So this is, I think, the main
benefit of this protocol.

01:13:35.737 --> 01:13:36.570
Question back there.

01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:38.001
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
second point

01:13:38.001 --> 01:13:40.863
is also vital because the
user might not [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:40.863 --> 01:13:43.407
You might [INAUDIBLE]
of the site, which

01:13:43.407 --> 01:13:44.679
would be right in the middle.

01:13:44.679 --> 01:13:45.156
PROFESSOR: I see.

01:13:45.156 --> 01:13:45.656
OK.

01:13:45.656 --> 01:13:47.970
So I agree in the
sense that this

01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:52.060
is very useful from the
point of view of UI security

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:55.349
because as far as the
cookies are concerned,

01:13:55.349 --> 01:13:57.140
the developer can
probably be clever enough

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:58.570
to do something sensible.

01:13:58.570 --> 01:14:01.510
But the user might not
be diligently looking

01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:04.650
at that lock icon
and URL at all times.

01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:09.790
So if you load up
amazon.com and it asks you

01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:12.090
for a credit card number,
you might just type it in.

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:14.630
You just forgot to
look for a lock icon,

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:18.790
whereas if you set forced
HTTPS for amazon.com, then

01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:20.510
there's just not
chance that you'll

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:24.305
have an HTTP URL for that site.

01:14:24.305 --> 01:14:26.430
It still [? causes a ?]
problem that maybe the user

01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:27.740
doesn't read the URL correctly.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:32.350
Like it says Ammazon
with two Ms dot com.

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:33.670
Probably still fool many users.

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:39.756
But anyway, that is another
advantage for forced HTTPS.

01:14:39.756 --> 01:14:41.510
Make sense?

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:43.020
Other questions
about this scheme?

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.740
All right.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.230
So I guess one
interesting thing is

01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:52.740
how do you get this
forced HTTPS bit

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.470
for a site in the first place?

01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:57.460
Could you have intercepted
that as an attacker

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.780
and prevent that
bit from being set

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:04.310
if you
[? want to mount a fax? ?]

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:05.210
Yeah.

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.653
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] HTTPS.

01:15:06.653 --> 01:15:09.058
I mean, HTTPS, we're
[? assuming ?] [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:09.058 --> 01:15:12.010
protocol [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:13.010
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:14.900
So on one hand,
this could be good.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.430
But this forced
https that can only

01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:21.900
be sent over HTTPS connection
to the host in question.

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:26.160
On other hand, the user might
be fooled at that point.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.810
Like, he doesn't have
the forced HTTPS bit yet.

01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:33.670
So maybe the user will allow
some incorrect certificate,

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:38.400
or will not even know that
this is HTTP and not HTTPS.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.800
So it seems potentially
possible for an attacker

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.220
to prevent that forced
HTTPS bit from being

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.220
sent in the first place.

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:49.610
If you've never been to a site
and you try to visit that site,

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:52.780
you might never learn whether
it should be forced HTTPS or not

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:54.080
in the first place.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:54.580
Yeah.

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:58.000
AUDIENCE: Will the [INAUDIBLE]
roaming certificate there.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.380
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.830
So I guess the way to think
of it is if they did a set,

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:05.370
then you know you talked to
the right server at some point,

01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:07.942
and then you could continue
using that bit correctly.

01:16:07.942 --> 01:16:10.400
On the other hand, if you don't
have that bit set, or maybe

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.300
if you've never talked
to a server yet,

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.930
there's no clear cut
protocol that will always

01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:18.510
give you whether that forced
HTTPS bit should be set or not.

01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:21.686
Maybe amazon.com always wants
to set that forced HTTPS bit.

01:16:21.686 --> 01:16:23.560
But the first time you
pulled up your laptop,

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.406
you were already on
an attacker's network,

01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:27.780
and there's just no way for
you to connect to amazon.com.

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.280
Everything is intercepted,
or something like this.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.120
So it's a very hard
problem to solve.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.850
The bootstrapping of
these security settings

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:36.840
is pretty tricky.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.381
I guess one thing
you could try to do

01:16:38.381 --> 01:16:40.720
is maybe embed
this bit in DNSSEC.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:42.530
So if you have DNSSEC,
already in use,

01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:46.070
then maybe you could sign
whether you should use HTTPS

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:50.960
or not, or forced HTTPS or
not, as part of your DNS name.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.709
But again, it just boils
down the problem to DNSSEC

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:54.250
being secure.

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:56.083
So there's always this
sort of rule of trust

01:16:56.083 --> 01:16:58.551
where you have to really
assume that's correct.

01:16:58.551 --> 01:16:59.453
Question.

01:16:59.453 --> 01:17:00.369
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:04.544 --> 01:17:05.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:07.540
So I guess Google keeps
trying to improve things

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.520
by hard coding it.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.490
So one thing that
Chrome offers is

01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:15.840
that actually, the browser
ships with a list of sites that

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.220
should have forced HTTPS
enabled-- or now, well, this

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:22.720
HSTS thing, which is
[INAUDIBLE] enabled.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.510
So when you actually
download Chrome,

01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:26.220
you get lots of
actually useful stuff,

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:30.650
like somewhat up to date CRL
and a list of forced HTTPS

01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:33.220
sites that are
particularly important.

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:35.779
So this is like somewhat
admitting defeat.

01:17:35.779 --> 01:17:37.070
Like the protocol doesn't work.

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:40.130
We just have to distribute
this a priori to everyone.

01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:42.360
And it sets up this
unfortunate dichotomy

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.565
between sites that are
sort of important enough

01:17:44.565 --> 01:17:46.530
for Google to ship
with the browser,

01:17:46.530 --> 01:17:49.132
and sites that don't do this.

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:50.840
Now of course, Google
right now tells you

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.540
that anyone can get
their site included

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.030
because the list is so small.

01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:55.740
But if this grows to
millions of entries,

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:57.660
I'm sure Google
will stop including

01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.850
everyone's site in there.

01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:00.570
But yeah, you could
totally add a domain.

01:18:00.570 --> 01:18:02.320
And you could email
Chrome developers

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.150
and get your thing included on
the list of forced HTTPS URLs.

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:11.816
Anyway, any other questions
about forced HTTPS and SSL?

01:18:11.816 --> 01:18:12.390
All right.

01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.890
Good.

01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:16.502
So I'll see you guys on
Wednesday at the [INAUDIBLE].
