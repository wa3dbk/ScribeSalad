00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.729
PROFESSOR: How you guys doing?

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:36.620
I don't know.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.329
As Nickolai said,
thanks for inviting us.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.453
It's a real pleasure to
come here and have a chance

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:41.680
to talk to everybody today.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.638
I brought one of
my senior managers

00:00:43.638 --> 00:00:46.360
who oversees the network and
security areas, Dave LaPorte,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.933
who's going to talk
about some of the more

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.224
tactical details of what we do.

00:00:50.224 --> 00:00:52.615
I'm going to talk
about the high level.

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:54.446
Feel free to ask
questions at any time.

00:00:54.446 --> 00:00:56.571
So really your opportunity
free to ask any anything

00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:57.510
you're curious about.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.686
So there's no decorum in terms
of what you guys may ask,

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:03.470
at anytime feel free to engage.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.226
And so I think I was sitting
where you guys are sitting--

00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:09.218
I don't know-- it's
almost 20 years ago now?

00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:09.716
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:11.040
PROFESSOR: [CHUCKLES]
So Nickolai and I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.190
were a lot younger then.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.870
And I was probably a
lot thinner by then

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.800
and had a little bit more hair.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.160
You know, one of the nice
things about overseeing

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.840
MIT's infrastructure
and operations areas,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.061
you can see all sorts
of interesting things.

00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:26.560
And some of the things we'll
talk about, a lot of what we do

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.510
is dealing with
interesting problems.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.230
And you know, there's
no shortage of things

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.620
in an environment like MIT's.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.390
I think what's
really remarkable is

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.490
we run an open network, which
is a little bit of a good thing

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730
and a bad thing.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.374
We don't have a broad campus
firewall, for the most part.

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:44.790
And everything's
pretty much open.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.320
If you guys want to run a
computer in your dorm, right

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.240
here in the lecture
hall, or anything else,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.823
you have pretty much
unfettered access

00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:53.940
to the internet, which is,
compared to other schools,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.255
actually, fairly unusual.

00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:57.380
You know, you may not
realize that as you sit here,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.910
but that's not the norm.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.970
And that brings with it a
whole slew of challenges,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.052
in terms of keeping
things secure.

00:02:05.052 --> 00:02:08.259
So pretty much, we're
wide open to the world.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.690
And that means
anybody, anywhere,

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.051
from whatever country, from
whatever part of the planet.

00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:14.550
If they want to reach out and
touch your device sitting here

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.770
in this room, as you're
sitting here today,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.040
whether it's your
phone in your pocket,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.040
or your laptop that you're
typing on when you're

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.740
sitting here, they can do that.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.045
There's nothing to prevent
them from doing that, right?

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:25.390
And that's kind of scary, right?

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.330
So we did an experiment
a couple of years ago.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.210
And we just took a device out of
box brand new, brand new Apple

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.270
laptop, and just plugged it in.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.550
Registered it for DHCP and just
left it there sitting there

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.670
for 24 hours.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.330
And we left TCP dumps
running to just take

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.370
an inventory of what was
coming into the machine

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.280
for a 24-hour period, just
to see what we would see.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.470
And then we combined
that with, hey,

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.150
let's go and graph all the
various IPs, using GeoIP lookup

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.440
and graphed them, put
them on Google Earth

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.840
and see what that looks like.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.450
And for one 24-hour period,
for an inauspicious or relevant

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.010
host which is just publicly
registered for the internet,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.920
it received connections from
every country on the earth,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.240
except for two.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.650
In one 24-hour period, one host,
every country, except for two.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.150
That's pretty startling, right?

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.110
Does anybody want
to take a guess what

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.390
the two countries that
were not trying to connect

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.002
to this machine were?

00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:24.918
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:24.918 --> 00:03:25.350
AUDIENCE: North Korea.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.220
PROFESSOR: Anyone?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.590
North Korea is one.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.590
Good.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.090
Nope.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.015
China was very
actively represented.

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:32.075
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:34.200
So might have been the
military part, I don't know,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.190
but certainly was very
actively represented.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.460
AUDIENCE: Antarctica.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.459
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.086
Antarctica.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.512
Very good.

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:42.970
So you get the gold
star for today.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.400
It's excellent.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.900
Yeah.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.020
Yeah.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.260
And so, for one
24-hour period, you're

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.200
seeing yourself subjected to
potential attacks, threats,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.985
malware, anything
else everywhere.

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:56.820
For one host.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.540
And the entire MIT campus right
now compromises about, I'd say,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.450
150,000 different devices.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.049
And so, if you do the math--

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.090
you can do that outright.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.270
You're good at
math here at MIT--

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.580
that's a lot of threats, right?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.290
And you know that happens
all day, every day.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.790
Right?

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.370
And that's pretty scary.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.420
And you want to combine
that with something else

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.520
to make a little
bit more scared?

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.320
So Dave and I were sitting in a
meaning a couple of months ago.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.320
This is kind of a follow-up
as to a power outage

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.110
that happened.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.235
Any of you here for the
big power outage a year ago

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:35.400
or a year and a half ago?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.860
It was an exciting time, right?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.309
[CHUCKLES FROM AUDIENCE]

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:40.600
I was here for the big power
outage about 20 years ago,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.349
when the entire city
of Cambridge was out.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.630
Now, that was cool.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.345
Except it was about
100 degrees, so it

00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:46.845
was a good time to
go over to Boston

00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:49.242
and see a movie in
a movie theater.

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:50.825
But one thing that
came out of it that

00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:52.075
was really interesting to us--

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:53.765
I don't know,
let's talk about it

00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:55.931
for a second-- but Facilities
department comes to us

00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:58.615
and says, you know, this
has been really bad,

00:04:58.615 --> 00:04:59.510
this power outage.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.600
We've really had to spend
the last four or five

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.570
months going across the
campus and reprogramming

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.041
all these devices.

00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:07.540
OK.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.880
Well, they must have
some SCADA systems

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.755
that are connected to
their air conditioning,

00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:14.990
or to the lights in the room,
the doors, things like that,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.490
right?

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.490
You would think they do.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.390
It's MIT.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.350
Makes sense.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.850
So sure, you imagine
they're secure.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.600
Talk about that in a second.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.900
And so we figured that was
pretty straightforward.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.010
And they said one of the things
they had a problem with was

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.878
their devices keep
getting knocked off

00:05:34.878 --> 00:05:37.030
the net, have these issues.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.710
And the more you
start talking to them,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.670
you peel back
layers of the onion.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.266
You're like, what do you mean
your devices are on the net?

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:44.891
Say, well, yeah, our
devices are on the net.

00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:45.390
Oh.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.030
You must have some secure,
proprietary control

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.442
system, a control network.

00:05:51.442 --> 00:05:53.400
And they kind of looked
at us with a blank look

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.250
and were like, uh, I
think that's what it is.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.280
That's what the vendor told us.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.610
And this brings up one
of the interesting things

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.195
of the internet of
things or the era

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:06.237
we're moving into is, for the
most part, when I was younger,

00:06:06.237 --> 00:06:08.695
people using the internet had
to be fairly specific, right?

00:06:08.695 --> 00:06:11.480
You had to fairly know
something that you were doing.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.650
Today, everybody's using it.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.067
And the bar to use it used to
be, when you ride the roller

00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:17.816
coaster, thou shalt
be this tall if you're

00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:19.300
going to ride this rocket.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.460
It's gotten a lot
lower, all right?

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.050
And so through the
conversation with them,

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.510
we find out that they have
pretty much everything

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.630
you could think of
connected to the internet.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.955
Everything.

00:06:30.955 --> 00:06:32.580
One of the things
that was interesting.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.996
MIT launched an
energy Initiative,

00:06:33.996 --> 00:06:35.540
I don't know, five,
seven years ago,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.460
when Susan Hockfield
was here as president.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.959
And one of the
things Facilities did

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:42.255
was really grow the
internet of things on campus

00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:45.300
to create these dynamically
managed buildings.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.260
So when a classroom isn't
in use, lights will go off,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.230
heating will change.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.730
It's new.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.840
They're doing things like
that across the campus.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.060
They deployed a gigantic
control network.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.190
Gigantic.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.570
It's actually bigger than
our own campus internet is,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.070
somewhat.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.830
So their control
compromises, I think,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.950
400,000 different
points that they're

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.900
monitoring across the campus.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.790
Over 75,000 to 100,000 places.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.030
And so the next question
you ask yourself--

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.390
Dave asks, with the
big, bright, wide eyes

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.260
is, how you guys securing that?

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.050
They're like, well,
we called you guys up,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.724
and we were going to check.

00:07:20.724 --> 00:07:21.515
And they put it in.

00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:23.780
And they got an IP address
by going through a web form

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.420
and request an IP.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.290
Requested IP, it's working.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.560
And you know we're sitting there
going, yeah, this whole open

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.222
internet thing--

00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:37.125
how are you guys securing that?

00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:39.366
And the question, of
course, which is, you know,

00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:42.110
when your blood pressure
goes up a little bit

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.000
was, well, it's secure, because
you guys take care of that.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.960
So the security's
already taken care of.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.390
And you know our look on
our face is a little bit--

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.650
what do you mean by secure?

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.164
Well, we have
corporate firewalls.

00:07:55.164 --> 00:07:55.830
It's dealt with.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.330
And everything's cool.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.510
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.980
And you know my
next question was,

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.910
can you show me where that is?

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.890
I don't know.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.200
And you know, of
course, the response

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.240
was, well, everybody does.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.426
And of course, we're
a little different,

00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:12.050
going back to the
point I made earlier,

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.200
we operate a fairly
open environment.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.740
And we've always believed
and it's MIT's philosophy

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:22.297
that we believe in defense
and security across the stack.

00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:24.880
You don't want to depend on any
one part of the infrastructure

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.635
to implement security.

00:08:25.635 --> 00:08:27.844
It's something you have to
do at every layer, right?

00:08:27.844 --> 00:08:29.140
You don't just do it
at the infrastructure,

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.348
you do it at the application.

00:08:30.348 --> 00:08:31.799
You do it all sorts of places.

00:08:31.799 --> 00:08:33.049
That's not how these systems--

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.988
you know, the internet of things
on the SCADA side-- get built.

00:08:35.988 --> 00:08:38.340
You know, that's kind of scary.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.469
And so one of the
things we're seeing here

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:42.760
that we deal with, so in
addition to dealing with folks

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.320
like yourself who
are doing all sorts

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.169
of creative and inventive things
that keep people like Dave

00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:49.126
and I up at night.

00:08:49.126 --> 00:08:50.500
You know, the
internet's becoming

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.760
this utility that's used
for all sorts of things

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.750
across the campus.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.530
And it's really
changed the dynamics

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.460
that we have to worry
about, in terms of threats,

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.610
security issues,
all sorts of things.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.340
So now, you know,
when the internet

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.030
used to go down or have an
issue when we were students,

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.102
it was an inconvenience.

00:09:07.102 --> 00:09:07.602
Right?

00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:10.940
It was annoying.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.790
In these most recent
types of event,

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.998
when the internet goes out,
people's air conditioning

00:09:14.998 --> 00:09:15.650
stops working.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.720
Your heat goes out, you know?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.650
So the threats have
really changed.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.201
And so for us, we deal with this
whole broad spectrum of things

00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:25.450
where we operate as a service
provider for the campus,

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.200
providing services to
folks like yourself.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.520
We also provide services
to all sorts of things.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.920
And if you combine that with
our open network philosophy,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.720
it creates a lot of interesting
use cases and threats

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.150
that we have to worry about
on a pretty persistent basis.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.010
And people's expectation of how
the internet is going to work

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.093
and one of the things
that's also been eye opening

00:09:46.093 --> 00:09:48.350
is these systems kind of grow.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.045
When the power
outage happened, one

00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:53.010
of the first questions
they had was,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.680
why did the network
stop working?

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.375
Our response was, well,
there was no power.

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:02.000
And they said, well, that comes
from the batteries on the phone

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.050
system, right?

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.006
It's all taken care of.

00:10:05.006 --> 00:10:05.880
Like, no, it doesn't.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.171
That's analog phone technology.

00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:08.930
Like, well, what's
the difference?

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.510
Well, you guys know a lot.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.910
But there's this expectation
that these things operate

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.610
with the utility
service, whether it's

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.885
at the security level,
resiliency level, or everything

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:18.750
else.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.712
And I love the folks that
have so much confidence

00:10:22.712 --> 00:10:24.920
that these things are being
dealt with at that level.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.020
But that's a big gap from
where we are right now.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.270
And so we spend a majority
of our time trying

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.120
to keep the campus
environment running,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.790
keep everything as
secure as we can.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.670
Dave will talk about that
in a little bit more detail.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.000
He'll give you some interesting
stories about the kinds

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.510
of things we deal with.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.700
But it's an
interesting job, right?

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.470
And we see all sorts
of interesting things.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.910
And I think the problems
just get harder and harder.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.166
And I think the thing is is
the internet kind of expands.

00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:55.040
And the internet of
things is a big buzzword.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.710
How many of you have heard
of that before today?

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.520
You guys have gone to a
Cisco website or something.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.641
Trying to sell you
expensive equipment.

00:11:03.641 --> 00:11:05.390
But this whole phenomenon
where everything

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.680
is internet or
IP-enabled, that's here.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.580
And unfortunately, a lot of the
people writing these systems

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.194
are not as studious as
people who went to MIT.

00:11:16.194 --> 00:11:18.110
They create all sorts
of interesting problems.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.693
So I think, for us,
the real challenge

00:11:19.693 --> 00:11:22.759
is, when you look at security
from a systemic level,

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:24.800
it's just there's a thousand
little bitty pieces.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.350
And it's really, really hard.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.600
And even for us, we have to
deal with service providers

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.476
on the external side.

00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:32.100
We have to deal with
our own customers.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.950
We have to deal with
application providers.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.700
It's this very broad
ecosystem of issues

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.620
you have to worry about to
provide security holistically.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.760
And the challenge is
pretty bumpy at times.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.824
And so from that
point, I guess I'll

00:11:42.824 --> 00:11:44.990
have Dave talk a little bit
about a couple of things

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.720
we've seen.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.345
You guys have any
questions before Dave

00:11:47.345 --> 00:11:51.710
gets set up that you'd like to
ask on anything in particular?

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.700
Anything?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.960
Come on up, Dave.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.668
PROFESSOR: Oh, you've
got a question now.

00:11:55.668 --> 00:11:56.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.780
AUDIENCE: Have you
seen any APT campaigns

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.205
attacking MIT directly?

00:12:02.205 --> 00:12:03.175
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:12:03.175 --> 00:12:04.172
Yes.

00:12:04.172 --> 00:12:06.130
I think what's interesting
is one of the things

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.112
we're seeing more of is--

00:12:10.112 --> 00:12:12.570
you know, one of the things
Dave will talk about now that's

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.610
really hard is visibility.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.900
If I told you the story
about the one laptop,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.217
and we have 100,000 or
150,000 devices, and also,

00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:24.800
if you think of the number of
IP addresses MIT has just having

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:30.160
/8 network, finding the needle
in the haystack is really hard.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.640
So these APTs--
which we do have--

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.302
finding that noise
or that activity

00:12:36.302 --> 00:12:38.135
going on within this
broad stream of traffic

00:12:38.135 --> 00:12:39.150
is very difficult.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.150
One of the things
we've have help with

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.816
is some of the tools we have now
are a little bit more advanced.

00:12:43.816 --> 00:12:45.840
And we'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.381
But one of the things
we also see now

00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:50.260
is law enforcement's help
from the Federal side

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.077
or from other parts where
they reach out to you

00:12:53.077 --> 00:12:54.910
to give you guidance
in some of these things

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.720
where they see things like
that, which is very helpful.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.730
But you know, operating
an open environment,

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.150
we've had a few of
these where I've

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.890
been really surprised that they
were going on, but they do.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.598
And I think one of
the other things we're

00:13:08.598 --> 00:13:11.060
going to see in the
future is-- today,

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.700
we do a lot of research
activity here at MIT.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.530
It's one of our
primary missions.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.650
The Federal funding sources
that provide for that research

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:24.994
don't really have a lot of
rules about how you do it.

00:13:24.994 --> 00:13:27.160
As you'll find out, as you
go into your grad student

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.576
lives and other
things and you get

00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:30.910
Federal grants for research,
whether it's private

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.455
or primarily from
the government,

00:13:32.455 --> 00:13:36.954
whether it's the NSF, NIH, their
requirements are pretty vague.

00:13:36.954 --> 00:13:38.745
One of the things we're
dealing with lately

00:13:38.745 --> 00:13:42.880
is they'll say, we have a data
requirement in the grant that

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.727
says, you should have a data
policy about all the data you

00:13:45.727 --> 00:13:47.810
generate from your grant
is going to be preserved.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.610
All right?

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.120
And the way MIT does that is it
says to the PI, that's great.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.295
We have this requirement.

00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:54.670
Are you going to
take care of it?

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.295
They say, sure.

00:13:55.295 --> 00:13:56.380
I'll take care of it.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.280
Sign the document, right?

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.460
Compliance with that?

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.387
What they did with it?

00:14:02.387 --> 00:14:04.720
It's left to the discretion
of the primary investigator.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.094
So if the government was ever
to come to us and say, hey,

00:14:07.094 --> 00:14:08.560
where's the data?

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.420
Just point to a faculty member
and say, hey, talk to home.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.360
But one of the things
we're also seeing

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.880
is the government
saying, hey, look.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.070
We're investing a lot of
money in doing this research.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.170
We don't want to
spend all the money

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.920
and give the research
to another country--

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.930
in some cases, right?

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.840
So what we've seen on
the legislative side

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.780
or some of the Federal
funding agencies side

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.845
is a lot of them are coming to
us and saying, as an industry,

00:14:28.845 --> 00:14:31.650
I think we some more security
departments for this.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.700
And I think what's
hard for us is

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.860
MIT is very much an incubator.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.360
We have an incredible
number of brilliant people.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.026
And for the
administration at large,

00:14:41.026 --> 00:14:42.900
we serve as sort of a
hosting company, right?

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.010
We incubate that activity.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.705
We provide them lab spaces,
or internet connectivity,

00:14:46.705 --> 00:14:48.942
or all sorts of things.

00:14:48.942 --> 00:14:51.400
But for the most part, it's a
fairly federated environment.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.290
People have a level of autonomy.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.160
And so, as you have more
requirements coming up,

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.990
applying those across the
institution is very hard.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.570
To go back to the
APT thing, there's

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.775
a tremendous amount of
intellectual capital here.

00:15:02.775 --> 00:15:04.400
Tremendous amount of
interesting things

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.605
going on here that folks
outside this country

00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:09.040
are very interested in.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.050
And I don't know if
you guys know this.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.560
What country do you think
is responsible for more

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.420
intellectual property theft than
most any place in the world?

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.888
Anyone want to take a guess?

00:15:18.888 --> 00:15:20.774
AUDIENCE: That's a
dangerous proposition.

00:15:20.774 --> 00:15:21.690
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.370
But I'm serious.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.620
I mean, one of the ones that--

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.210
it was really shocking to me,
because I never expected it.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.126
And that's not to say
they're doing that here.

00:15:28.126 --> 00:15:30.900
But anyone want to take a hint?

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.068
Come on, somebody.

00:15:34.068 --> 00:15:35.980
Anybody.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:36.750
AUDIENCE: China?

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.800
PROFESSOR: Who?

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.254
It's not China.

00:15:39.254 --> 00:15:40.150
AUDIENCE: Russia?

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.592
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:42.175
Wasn't Russia.

00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:43.105
No.

00:15:43.105 --> 00:15:44.304
AUDIENCE: Is it Canada?

00:15:44.304 --> 00:15:44.970
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:45.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.511
You're getting close,
though, but it's in Europe.

00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:48.680
AUDIENCE: France?

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.090
PROFESSOR: France.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.699
France.

00:15:51.699 --> 00:15:52.240
That's right.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.070
AUDIENCE: What was it?

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:53.820
PROFESSOR: France.

00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:58.560
Yeah.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.790
So yeah, you wouldn't
expect that, right?

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.290
But I have a bunch
of folks who work

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:07.079
in the industry side, commercial
sector, in the security area.

00:16:07.079 --> 00:16:08.995
And one of the things
they have to worry about

00:16:08.995 --> 00:16:11.860
is companies, some of them
located in this geography,

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.030
is that's one of
their biggest threats,

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.220
which is kind of surprising.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.110
You would think it's Iran.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.226
You would think it's all
sorts of other places.

00:16:18.226 --> 00:16:19.140
No.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.540
And so, it's interesting, right?

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.950
You wouldn't expect that.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.780
And that's not to say the
US isn't doing it too.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.800
Let's be honest, right?

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.925
We're just doing it better.

00:16:28.925 --> 00:16:31.350
We're not getting
caught, probably.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.760
But needless to say, it's one
of the more interesting things.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.710
Another question?

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:37.600
You ready, Dave?

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.040
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.540
AUDIENCE: What sorts of things
do you log on an IP sector?

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.444
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:44.444 --> 00:16:47.790
PROFESSOR: Turn
the camera off now.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.530
We log some fairly
interesting things.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.760
I'd say, for the most part,
I'll be honest with you,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.440
authentication requests, we log.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.071
So when you log-in
through Kerberos,

00:16:57.071 --> 00:16:58.570
you log-in through
Active Directory,

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.900
you log-in through Touchstone,
through our SAML iVp,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.850
those things get logged.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.936
We have very detailed
retention policies, which

00:17:05.936 --> 00:17:07.186
we're happy to share with you.

00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:09.079
It's published.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:13.780
If you access a web page, if
you check in to read your email,

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.530
things like that, then
one of the problems

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.321
we have is correlating
all that information

00:17:17.321 --> 00:17:18.265
would be fairly hard.

00:17:18.265 --> 00:17:19.981
That's a lot of
different sources.

00:17:19.981 --> 00:17:21.730
Dave will talk about
that in a little bit.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.146
But that's pretty
much what we do.

00:17:23.146 --> 00:17:25.569
We try to keep our
retention period, usually,

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.717
within 30 days.

00:17:27.717 --> 00:17:31.021
AUDIENCE: So MIT runs
its own CA, right?

00:17:31.021 --> 00:17:32.920
There's a root MIT certificate.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.470
Private key [INAUDIBLE] Where do
you guys keep that private key?

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:41.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:42.960
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.950
AUDIENCE: Could you use
tamper-resistant hardware,

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:44.908
or something like that?

00:17:44.908 --> 00:17:46.920
Or do you just put it
on computer somewhere

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.900
running Linux [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.690
PROFESSOR: Well, wow.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.572
Good question.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:53.530
Yes, we run our own CA.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.860
We've been running our own
CA since the late 1990s.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.240
So in a whole world where the
web was doing authentication

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.600
using username,
password over SSL,

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.910
I think MIT was fairly
progressive there, doing PKI.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:07.780
Now, I don't know.

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.107
You guys are a little bit
younger, but back in 1998,

00:18:11.107 --> 00:18:13.440
they were telling me the year
of PKI is just about here.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.569
It's going to be next year.

00:18:14.569 --> 00:18:16.485
And we've been saying
that for about 20 years.

00:18:16.485 --> 00:18:17.879
So hopefully, soon.

00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:19.170
So in terms of how it's stored?

00:18:21.699 --> 00:18:23.615
Tamper-resistant hardware,
that's a nice idea.

00:18:23.615 --> 00:18:25.370
I like that.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.090
That would be great.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.731
That's not how we're doing it.

00:18:28.731 --> 00:18:30.230
AUDIENCE: Is that
how the CAs do it?

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.930
PROFESSOR: So the CA's usually
do it through using USB keys

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.151
or other tokens that have
fairly involved protocols where

00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:39.770
you can only access
information off

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.426
once it's been written,
in terms of you

00:18:41.426 --> 00:18:43.050
could send something
out for signature,

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.410
but you can't actually
get the key off.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.940
So they have a whole
way of doing that.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.800
To be honest, the CA
server we're using now

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.640
was written before any
of those markets existed.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.210
And so we've used, I'd
say, a typical MIT spirit

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.540
of being a little bit creative.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.450
And so it is stored
on the file system.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.005
It's stored in such a way to
make it difficult to recover.

00:19:06.005 --> 00:19:07.380
And it's stored
in multiple ways.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.100
And it's encrypted
with multiple keys.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.610
And there's a variety of
system-specific parameters,

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.749
which I will not get into
every one of them here.

00:19:14.749 --> 00:19:16.790
AUDIENCE: So it's more of
a security by security.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.690
Yes.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.570
So if you know the
specific locations,

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.190
which may not even be files--

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.579
I'll give you a hint to look--

00:19:26.579 --> 00:19:28.120
and you know how
many keys are needed

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.705
and you know how
many bytes to read,

00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:31.431
you might be able
to figure it out.

00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:32.930
But to be honest
with you, if you're

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.462
able to actually get on the
machine, it's game over, right?

00:19:35.462 --> 00:19:37.977
If you're able to get on
the machine, it's game over.

00:19:37.977 --> 00:19:40.018
You know, people who tell
you that they can still

00:19:40.018 --> 00:19:41.726
break into the machine
and not compromise

00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:43.960
the key for some ETA, nah.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.670
I'd be very
skeptical about that.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.040
So we try to be
fairly secure, but--

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.684
anyway, it's not perfect.

00:19:51.684 --> 00:19:52.350
Other questions?

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.920
AUDIENCE: Typically,
what percent

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.260
would you say of
MIT accounts are

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.059
compromised at a given time?

00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:02.100
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.420
Not yours, right?

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.160
I think I'm amazed--

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.960
so does everyone know
what phishing is?

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.430
AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.700
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.105
Good.

00:20:09.105 --> 00:20:11.688
I can't tell you how many talks
I go to where they look at you

00:20:11.688 --> 00:20:14.690
and they say, isn't
that like Seattle?

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.691
But that's a little bit
of an older audience.

00:20:17.691 --> 00:20:19.690
Every time one of these
phishing things happen--

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.981
and they happen quite a bit
where these emails go out--

00:20:21.981 --> 00:20:23.870
I will tell you, it amazes me.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.280
You're the world's smartest
institution, all right?

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.832
As an alum, I'm pretty
proud to believe that.

00:20:29.832 --> 00:20:31.290
You know, we're
the world's leading

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.452
technological institution
in the world, right?

00:20:34.452 --> 00:20:36.660
I cannot tell you how many
people will reply to those

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.130
things.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:38.440
It just always
amazes me how many

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.815
of them reply to
"Dear Help Desk,

00:20:39.815 --> 00:20:42.570
here's my user
name and password.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.090
It shocks me, right?

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.250
And some of them are faculty.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.252
And they call the
help desk and go, hey,

00:20:49.252 --> 00:20:50.710
I wrote back to
your quota message.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.910
How come my quota
hasn't gone up?

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.330
And oh, by the way, like
my inbox is full now.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.630
So what happened?

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.865
Well, they got 200,000 bounced
messages to be in their inbox

00:20:59.865 --> 00:21:02.387
because it's being used
to send mass emails.

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:03.220
So I'm being honest.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.800
I'd say we see 10,
15, 20 to 30 a month.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.090
During one of these phishing
spikes, even larger.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.420
And I think the ones that
have been really interesting

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.550
are the ones we
don't know about, OK?

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.020
And the government came to us, I
don't know, about a year or two

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.500
ago and said, hey, we
won't get into specifics,

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.730
but there's a
marketplace where you

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.650
can buy MIT usernames
and passwords so you

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.640
can access library resources.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.497
And so they're bidding on them
online on these black markets.

00:21:33.497 --> 00:21:35.372
If you'd like to access
all the materials MIT

00:21:35.372 --> 00:21:37.667
has in their libraries
or on campus,

00:21:37.667 --> 00:21:39.500
you can simply auction
one of these accounts

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.860
that they've compromised
off the web page.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.486
And they said, oh, by the
way, do you know about this?

00:21:44.486 --> 00:21:45.841
No.

00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:46.340
No.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.890
And so we see a tremendous
number of those.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.820
The success of
the social vectors

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.160
for getting people's
credentials is

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.414
incredibly high, in particular,
across our industry--

00:21:56.414 --> 00:21:58.580
Dave will talk about it in
a little bit, how you try

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.170
and mitigate those
things-- is very high.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:02.970
And it's a little bit scary.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.310
Yeah?

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.140
AUDIENCE: Dealing on that, is
there a way or some web site

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.650
to see all the places
you've logged-in

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.470
with Touchstone or something?

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.990
So we're working on-- one of the
things I talked about in answer

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.070
to the log question was
what do you guys collect?

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.570
We collect a variety
of information.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.880
One of the things we don't
have the ability to do today

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.640
is to correlate.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.317
So in our case, there's 30
different technology systems

00:22:30.317 --> 00:22:32.650
involved in some of these
things, and different formats,

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.509
and all sorts of different
ways to generate it.

00:22:35.509 --> 00:22:37.300
We are working to try
and make that easier.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.960
And our hope is to give the
user community something where,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.470
from a GeoIP or
other standpoint,

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.220
they can see where
their activity is maybe

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.357
over the last 30
days, or seven days,

00:22:45.357 --> 00:22:47.045
or whatever their
retention period is,

00:22:47.045 --> 00:22:48.420
to help inform
people about where

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.544
these things are happening.

00:22:49.544 --> 00:22:51.311
Dave wants to go a step further.

00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:53.310
He wants to have you can
pick a circle of radius

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.730
where you're allowed to
log-in from geographically.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:57.569
And if you log-in from
outside that range,

00:22:57.569 --> 00:22:59.360
it either shouldn't
allow it, or it'll just

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.752
send a text to your phone to
let you know that something

00:23:00.752 --> 00:23:03.870
happened, which I think is a
step in the right direction.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.330
But so yes, we're
working on that,

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.266
but we don't have it today.

00:23:09.266 --> 00:23:11.736
AUDIENCE: You said there was
malicious traffic on the MIT

00:23:11.736 --> 00:23:12.724
network?

00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:14.210
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.086
In terms of--

00:23:15.086 --> 00:23:16.586
AUDIENCE: What's
the primary source?

00:23:16.586 --> 00:23:18.195
Is it from outside going in?

00:23:18.195 --> 00:23:22.384
Or is there malicious traffic
from the inside going out?

00:23:22.384 --> 00:23:24.550
PROFESSOR: You know, I'd
love to say it's completely

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.040
from the outside coming in.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.466
I'd say there's a fair bit of
it from the inside going out.

00:23:29.466 --> 00:23:32.090
I think, realistically, we have
a tremendous amount of internet

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.170
bandwidth and connectivity.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.650
We'll talk about some of these
more recent UDP reflection

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.730
attacks, which is
a great example.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.184
But when you have
big pipes, it's

00:23:40.184 --> 00:23:42.047
a good resource to use
to hurt other folks.

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:43.880
And so we see a lot of
that, I'd say more so

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.755
than stuff coming in.

00:23:44.755 --> 00:23:46.255
Stuff coming in,
you see a fair bit,

00:23:46.255 --> 00:23:47.920
like I talked about
with the laptop.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.625
But I'd say, in terms of
actual volume of traffic,

00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:52.250
the bigger stuff you
see is in and out,

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.466
in terms of just
sheer throughput.

00:23:56.466 --> 00:23:59.220
AUDIENCE: How many
people connect to the MIT

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.640
Network on a given day?

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.320
PROFESSOR: On a given day,
I'd say like, I don't know,

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.190
100,000, 120,000 different
kinds of devices.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.320
I'd say, people-wise, if you
figure people average 2-1/2

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.174
devices, probably 35,000 folks,
40,000 folks on a given day.

00:24:14.174 --> 00:24:16.590
I think what's more surprising
is our visitor population's

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.589
fairly large in a month.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.133
AUDIENCE: What's the policy
for running a TOR exit

00:24:22.133 --> 00:24:23.461
node on the MIT network?

00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:24.210
PROFESSOR: Policy?

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:24.672
What?

00:24:24.672 --> 00:24:25.171
No.

00:24:25.171 --> 00:24:26.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.830
AUDIENCE: Is there a
good reason not to?

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.492
PROFESSOR: So you know, MIT's
a very open place, all right?

00:24:31.492 --> 00:24:33.700
And I think that's one of
the great beauties of being

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.700
a student here and one
of the things I've always

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.120
cherished about being here
is we're a place where

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.565
it's OK to experiment.

00:24:39.565 --> 00:24:40.440
It's OK to do things.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.590
It's OK to learn about things.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.510
It's OK to develop new things.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.650
That's one of the great
things about being at MIT

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.430
and it's what's special
about being here too, right?

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.629
That's what's pretty unique.

00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:50.670
You don't need to go to
the policy office to say,

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.625
hey, I want to run a
core exit node today,

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:55.500
or I want to invent a
new anonymous protocol,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.560
or something like that.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.060
That's one of the thing's that's
really unique about working

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.480
here and going to school here.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.800
And I think, for us, is it a
good idea or is it a bad idea,

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.760
depends how you're
trying to do it, right?

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.087
If you're doing it as part
of some thesis research

00:25:09.087 --> 00:25:11.045
into an automatization
technique, some privacy,

00:25:11.045 --> 00:25:12.604
it's probably fine.

00:25:12.604 --> 00:25:14.020
If you're doing
it for the purpose

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.461
of running some kind of black
market ring or something

00:25:17.461 --> 00:25:17.960
like that--

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.210
I mean it's probably
not a good idea.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.010
But from a policy standpoint,
MIT's fairly flexible.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:27.635
We really try to
balance the need for--

00:25:27.635 --> 00:25:29.135
the institution has
a responsibility

00:25:29.135 --> 00:25:30.662
to behave responsibly, right?

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:31.554
Let's just be honest.

00:25:31.554 --> 00:25:33.350
As an institution,
we have to do that.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.480
But we try as much as
possible not to encumber

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.320
the activity of innovation.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.090
And so, for the most part,
that's worked out pretty well.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.780
I'd say MIT's been fairly
successful over the last 125

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.720
years.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.020
But you know, I think it's
one of those areas where

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.850
if one of those
activities was to place

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.595
the institution collectively
in jeopardy, then

00:25:51.595 --> 00:25:53.180
we have to look at that.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.140
But MIT does run a
variety of TOR exit nodes.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.650
SIPI has some.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:57.930
CSAIL has a few.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.770
They show up on Dave's
naughty list like a plague,

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.740
but we do that.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.210
You can't run that
at most schools.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:06.710
Questions?

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.880
My esteemed colleague,
Dave LaPorte.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.867
He from used to work in the
Harvard University network.

00:26:20.867 --> 00:26:22.700
And he'll talk a little
bit about networking

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.682
at a liberal arts school, if you
get him outside of the office.

00:26:25.682 --> 00:26:29.578
And he's also a teacher
himself at Northeastern,

00:26:29.578 --> 00:26:31.526
which is great.

00:26:31.526 --> 00:26:33.660
So Dave will talk
to you a little bit

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.839
about some specific examples
of the kings of things

00:26:35.839 --> 00:26:36.880
that keep us up at night.

00:27:01.207 --> 00:27:02.040
PROFESSOR: Oh, wait.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.290
Wait.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.140
I think I got it.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:03.848
Loose connection.

00:27:10.835 --> 00:27:11.335
OK.

00:27:17.192 --> 00:27:17.692
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.850
All right.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:23.690
Hello, everybody.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:24.690
My name is Dave LaPorte.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.950
As this very verbose
title claims,

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.272
I am Manager of Infrastructure
and Security Operations,

00:27:33.272 --> 00:27:34.730
which basically in
a nutshell means

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:38.970
I'm responsible for maintaining
and operating and securing

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:44.190
mit.net, which is
definitely a full-time job.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.212
Today, I've got a lot
of content to cover.

00:27:47.212 --> 00:27:49.670
I'm going to cruise through
it, to leave room for questions

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.878
at the end, because I think
that's probably where you

00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:53.070
guys get the most out of it.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.990
If anything's not
clear, just stop me.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.220
Raise your hand.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.511
I don't mind being interrupted.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.170
But yeah, with that, we'll
start talking with the Security

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.800
Operations Team, which is
really the one central body that

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.432
does security as a
full-time job here at MIT.

00:28:08.432 --> 00:28:09.890
We'll talk about
some of the events

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.530
that we've had in
the recent past here

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.610
and what we've done
to mitigate them

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.970
and to leave the current
state of security at mit.net.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.910
We'll talk about the
current landscape, what

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.210
we're facing a lot of now,
which-- as Mark alluded to--

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.600
is to a large degree, social.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.150
And we'll talk about
some future trends,

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:35.340
which are nebulous by nature, so
the slides are kind of sparse.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.520
So the team there, as
you can see is Mark.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.090
I report directly to Mark.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.530
Under me, there's a
Security Operations Team

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.440
led by our team
lead, Harry Hoffman.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.325
He has three people under
him, Andrew Munchbach,

00:28:49.325 --> 00:28:51.080
who basically is
the analyst who does

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.880
a lot of the washing
of the systems,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.190
does a lot of the
notifications to users,

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.461
responds to complaints
from the outside world.

00:28:57.461 --> 00:29:00.086
Then Mike Hossle, who does a lot
of the engineering activities,

00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:01.910
a lot of the forensics.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.600
And you have Monique
Buchanan, who

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.840
handles a lot of the
correspondence and community

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.370
outreach.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.765
Harry himself is also
extremely hands-on.

00:29:09.765 --> 00:29:11.515
So I just want to
preface this whole thing

00:29:11.515 --> 00:29:14.045
with we have a team of four
in a very large institution

00:29:14.045 --> 00:29:15.650
with tons of devices.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.530
So the federation
that Mark talked about

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:19.900
is really a necessity,
in order to even try

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.579
to secure a network
of this size.

00:29:22.579 --> 00:29:24.620
So now, the portfolio
services we have and what--

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.730
we're going to blast
through this stuff fast--

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:30.750
consulting, we talk with
people and help them on campus.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.280
Services, we provide some
services to the community.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.620
And the tool set that we use.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.520
The services we provide
are pretty varied.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.230
We do abuse reporting.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.790
So this is response
to complaints

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.391
from the outside
world, typically,

00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:50.000
the vast majority of which
are Tor exit node-related.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.076
They just are.

00:29:52.076 --> 00:29:53.584
PROFESSOR: They just are.

00:29:53.584 --> 00:29:55.250
PROFESSOR: Endpoint
protection, so there

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.250
are some tools and
products out there

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.800
that we install on both the
community at large machines--

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.680
you opt-in if you prefer.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.115
If you're part of the MIT
domain, which is typically

00:30:05.115 --> 00:30:08.602
administrative staff, some
might be auto-installed for you.

00:30:08.602 --> 00:30:10.810
Network protection, these
are tool sets that we have,

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.260
either at the border
or throughout mit.net

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:19.570
that detect anomalies or
capture flow data for analysis.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.071
Data analytics helps us
correlate, put all this stuff

00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:24.404
together and try to get some
actionable intelligence out

00:30:24.404 --> 00:30:26.100
of it.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.300
Forensics are-- well, we'll
talk about those in a second.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.830
Risk identification, basically
probing and assessment tools,

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.750
basically Nessus and
things that look for PII,

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.010
Personally Identifiable
Information.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:44.210
which, being in Massachusetts,
we need to comply with 201 CMR

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.470
17.00, which is a Mass
regulation that requires us

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.650
to be able to identify where all
the PII on our network lives.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.520
Outreach awareness and
training, just what it says.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.590
Compliance needs, this is,
in large part, PCI DSS.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.160
So PCI, being the
Payment Card Industry,

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.302
has DSS, which is the
Data Security Standard.

00:31:04.302 --> 00:31:06.760
Believe it or not, MIT-- well,
you'll probably believe it--

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.570
MIT is a credit card merchant.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.140
We have multiple
vendors on campus,

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.750
and we need to be
able to make sure

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.620
that that infrastructure
is compliant with PCI DSS.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.700
So Security is a part of the
team that basically manages

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.820
and ensures that compliance.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:27.230
PCI 3.0, which is the sixth
major update to the standard,

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.820
goes live on January 1.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.800
So we're kind of in
the process right now

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.460
of ensuring compliance of
all of our infrastructure.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:39.520
And providing reporting alerting
metrics on the work we do.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.440
So here's some of the end point
protection products we use.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.100
This eagle-- I think
it's an eagle there--

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.890
is a tool called CrowdStrike,
which is currently

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:53.595
being tested within
IS&amp;T. Basically, it's

00:31:53.595 --> 00:31:56.990
a tool that watches
for anomalous behavior

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.350
from a system call perspective.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.977
If you're using Word,
and Word suddenly

00:32:00.977 --> 00:32:02.810
starts doing something
that it shouldn't do,

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.320
like maybe trying to read
the account database off

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.430
of the system and a
bunch of passwords,

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:10.220
it alerts and throws a flag.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.430
It's a cloud-based tool, which
we'll talk more about later.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.120
So all this data gets
sent to a central console.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.890
And should machines start
doing things untoward

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.430
from a heuristic or
behavioral perspective,

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.040
they get red flagged.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.410
GPO here, these are just
Group Policy Objects,

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.950
so managed systems
which push down policy.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.790
The S is Sophos.

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:33.320
It's anti-xrays,
anti-malware, anti-spam--

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.130
oh, not anti-spam--
but anti-malware,

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.210
anti-virus, all of
the typical stuff

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:41.750
that we expect when we buy and
end point protection product.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:48.480
PGP does hard drive encryption
for select systems on campus

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.650
that have sensitive data.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.070
Some of these tools are in flux.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.180
The industry seems to be
going more towards a more

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.540
vendor-neutral
solution, if you want

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.420
to call it that, so BitLocker on
Windows, FileVault on the Mac.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.720
So we're exploring
those options as well.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.070
And Casper is a way to manage,
mostly Macs, to enforce policy

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.980
on managed Macs.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.760
On the network protection side--

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.770
I'll just start down here.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.280
Akamai is a company
that came out of MIT,

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.780
has a lot of MIT alums.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.220
They also have
extremely good services,

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.410
so we have partnered with them
on a lot of their services.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.390
And we'll talk about
them fairly extensively.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:35.900
TippingPoint is an IDS vendor,
an intrusion detection system.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.197
As I said, some of
these tools are in flux.

00:33:38.197 --> 00:33:39.280
That might be one of them.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.740
But we basically have an
intrusion prevention system

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.750
at our border.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.970
We don't actually
prevent, we just detect.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.600
So we don't actually block
anything on the MIT border,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.370
except for some very
basic anti-spoofing

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.300
and standard rules
you'd find anywhere.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.610
Stealth Watch is a tool that
generates NetFlow data--

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.870
or I should say
collects NetFlow data.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:05.140
So we use Cisco devices,
but all network devices

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.924
will output details,
meta information

00:34:07.924 --> 00:34:09.679
about the flows that
they're sending,

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.415
source port, dest port,
source IP, dest IP, protocol,

00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:14.380
et cetera.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.520
StealthWatch collects this, does
some basic security analysis

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.650
on it, and also
provides APIs that we

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.310
can interface our
tools with to do

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:25.949
some more intelligent things.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:28.580
And RSA Security Analytics,
this is another tool.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.570
[BANG] Oops.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:34.710
It's, in a lot of ways,
like an IDS on steroids.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.800
It does full packet
capture, so you can actually

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.864
see some content if
things get red flagged.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.090
On the risk
identification front,

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:50.290
Nessus, kind of the de facto
vulnerability assessment tool.

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.350
So we typically
use this on-demand.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.420
We don't unleash this
on 18/8 at large.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:59.240
But if we get an
on campus DLC that

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.360
would like us to come in and
perform some basic assessment

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.750
for them, we can use Nessus.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:08.810
Shodan is a computer-- they call
it a computer search engine.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.430
Basically, they scan
the internet at large

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.334
and have lots of, lots
of good security data.

00:35:13.334 --> 00:35:14.750
We have a subscription,
so that we

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.940
can leverage that intelligence.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.790
And Identity Finder,
that's a tool

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.930
that we use in locations
where there's PII,

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.480
Personally Identifiable
Information,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.652
in order to comply
with mass regs

00:35:26.652 --> 00:35:28.985
and just to make sure we know
where critical data lives.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:42.163
Forensics is a
business that is--

00:35:42.163 --> 00:35:43.430
periodic?

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:44.950
I'm looking for the right word.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.250
This isn't something we
do, until we do a lot of it

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.010
for a long time.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.410
And then we don't
do a lot of it.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.430
Basically, when cases surface,
we have the tool sets.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.510
EnCase is a tool that
allows us to image drives

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.450
and go through them
looking for content.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:59.575
FTK, the Forensic Toolkit and
the Sleuth Kit are other tools.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:06.160
We often get called in for cases
where we have to image drives

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.300
for intellectual property cases
or whatever cases the OGC,

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.900
the Office of the
General Counsel,

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.910
needs to have
computers imaged for.

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.520
So we have all the tools
that's necessary to do that.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.050
But frankly, it's
not our day job.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:22.154
It's something that
comes up occasionally.

00:36:22.154 --> 00:36:23.820
So how do we put all
this data together?

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.690
Mark alluded to correlation.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:30.165
We have operating system
logs for managed systems.

00:36:30.165 --> 00:36:31.540
You can see that
we have NetFlow.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.940
We have some DHCP logs,
IDS logs, Touchstone logs.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:41.440
Splunk is a tool that does
a lot of this correlation

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.842
work and take data that's
not necessarily normalized

00:36:44.842 --> 00:36:46.740
and normalize it and
allow us to correlate

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.690
across different sources
to get more intelligence.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.117
So when you were talking about--

00:36:52.117 --> 00:36:53.700
whomever out there
asked about, maybe,

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.720
a log-in page that could
show where you last logged

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.280
in, et cetera,
Splunk would probably

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.915
be the enabling
technology for that,

00:37:01.915 --> 00:37:03.540
because we can put
everything together,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.340
we can do GeoIP lookups,
and really build something

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.080
on top of the raw data,
pull some actual wisdom

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.605
of that data, so that we could
present it to you in a page.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.040
OK.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.055
So now, we'll talk
about attacks and things

00:37:21.055 --> 00:37:23.274
that you might find
more interesting.

00:37:23.274 --> 00:37:25.440
We'll talk first about
Distributed Denial of Service

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.940
attacks, which we've
really received

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.290
a lot of in the past few years.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.040
We'll also talk
specifically about attacks

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.160
that resulted from the Aaron
Swartz tragedy of a few years

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.730
ago, which ties in to the
Distributed Denial of Service

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.850
attacks.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:41.350
OK.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:44.230
So just a primer on
Distributed Denial of Service.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.110
I apologize if this is remedial.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.980
So Denial of Service
attack really

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.110
attacks the A of the CIA triad.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.110
CIA triad's the foundation
of computer security.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.955
It's Confidentiality,
Integrity, and Availability.

00:37:55.955 --> 00:37:57.830
So we're going after
the availability, right?

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:01.260
We want to take a resource down
so that legitimate users can't

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.092
use it.

00:38:03.092 --> 00:38:04.550
That could be
defacement of a page.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.530
Very simple, right?

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:08.362
Digital graffiti, just ruin the
page so nobody could see it.

00:38:08.362 --> 00:38:09.820
Could be resource
consumption where

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.510
you eat up all the
computation on a system,

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.700
all the bandwidth on a network.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.219
Could be a single attacker.

00:38:16.219 --> 00:38:17.760
But much more likely
nowadays, you're

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.384
going to invite your
friends and you're

00:38:19.384 --> 00:38:20.957
going to have a
party and a DDoS,

00:38:20.957 --> 00:38:22.290
a Distributed Denial of Service.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.340
OK these are recent
trends in the industry.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.580
These are pulled from
the Arbor Networks

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.010
State of the Internet report.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:39.370
Hacktivism is the most
common motivation.

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:43.690
According to them, it's
40% of all claimed--

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.240
actually, those attacks that
are attributed, 40% of them

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.090
are attributed to hacktivism.

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:50.030
The next one is 39% unknown.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:56.380
So it's dominating
the top of the heap.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.750
Last year-- and these numbers,
I believe, are from 2013--

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:03.320
there were multiple
100Gbps attacks.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.850
So the year before
that made news

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.885
because I think there was
an attack on Spamhaus that

00:39:07.885 --> 00:39:09.990
was 300Gbpm.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:12.244
This following year,
that's kind of--

00:39:12.244 --> 00:39:13.660
I wouldn't say the
norm, but we're

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.280
seeing a lot more of that.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.570
Longer-lasting attack,
this operation here,

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.850
Ababil, was a multi-month
attack against the US

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:25.370
financial sector.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:26.720
It went on for months.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.579
It was 65Gps sustained at times.

00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:31.870
I've heard stories about
this-- but you can Google more

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:32.700
online--

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.130
where it was just relentless.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:36.600
They just couldn't stop it.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.170
And we'll talk about the way
that they ended up doing it.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.919
But frankly, at
65Gbps or at 100Gbps,

00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:44.710
you're at the mercy of
the attacker, right?

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.200
There's very few
organizations on the planet

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.390
that can sustain an attack--

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:54.260
can sustain-- can survive
a sustained attack

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.622
of that magnitude.

00:39:55.622 --> 00:39:58.350
You just can't do it.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:01.400
And we're seeing a shift towards
reflection and amplification

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.310
attacks.

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:07.080
So this is where you
take a small input

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.720
and generate a large output.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.640
This is nothing new.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.610
This goes way back to--

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:17.070
let's go ahead a sec, all
right, I left that slide out--

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:22.880
but this goes way back
to the ICMP Smurf attack

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.645
where you would ping a
broadcast address of a network,

00:40:25.645 --> 00:40:27.020
and every machine
on that network

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.326
would respond to the
supposed originator

00:40:30.326 --> 00:40:32.700
of the packet, which, of
course, would be spoofed, right?

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.090
So I would masquerade as Mark.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:37.580
I would sent a packet to this
class's broadcast address.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.960
And you would all respond
with packets to Mark,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.240
thinking that he sent it.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.410
Meanwhile, I sit in
the corner and laugh.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:45.770
So this is nothing new.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:48.050
This goes back-- I mean,
when I was in high school,

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.011
I was reading about this stuff.

00:40:51.011 --> 00:40:53.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.370
So UDP and ICMP, but UDP is
a fire and forget protocol,

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:57.870
right?

00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:58.746
It's not TCP.

00:40:58.746 --> 00:40:59.495
It's not reliable.

00:40:59.495 --> 00:41:01.220
It's not connection-oriented.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.740
So fire and forget,
it's easily spoofable.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.780
And over the past
year, what we've seen

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:12.560
are exploits of amplifiable
features of these three

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.720
protocols, in particular.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.844
So DNS-- this isn't working.

00:41:17.844 --> 00:41:20.150
It works with a clicker.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:24.280
DNS, port 53, UDP, right?

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.770
Basically, if you sent
a 64-byte ANY query

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.000
to a misconfigured
server, it would respond

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.740
with a 512-byte response.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.070
So that's an 8X
amplification factor there.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.400
Not bad.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.860
What we found personally
here on mit.net was,

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.022
when this whole trend
started, like most things--

00:41:44.022 --> 00:41:46.230
EDUs and particularly here--
we were at the forefront

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.210
into this trend.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.640
We were seeing this
before it really took off

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.190
against commercial victims.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:56.890
But we saw a 12-gig DNS
amplification attack here,

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:00.500
which substantially impacted
our outbound bandwidth.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.190
We have sufficient bandwidth.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.550
But at those rates, if you add
that to legitimate traffic,

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:07.810
we started to notice issues.

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.150
And Mark and I had to
come in and resolve that.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:18.710
SNMP, which is UDP port
161, very useful management

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:19.750
protocol.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:24.820
But if you send a GetBulkRequest
of 64 bytes to a device

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:30.330
that's improperly configured, it
will respond with up to 1,000X

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.560
amplification.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.100
So that's even better, right?

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.308
If you're an attacker, you're
going to target things.

00:42:35.308 --> 00:42:38.950
And we saw huge attacks
against printers on campus.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.290
So they would have a printer
with an open SNMP agent.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:44.280
They would send packets to it.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:50.360
And we would send back 1,000 of
them and pollute the internet.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.720
NTP, Network Time Protocol.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.220
In this case, a
misconfigured server

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.514
would respond to MONLIST
command, which would--

00:42:59.514 --> 00:43:01.180
I'm not sure of the
amplification factor

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:01.680
on that one.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.680
But that one's really,
really popular.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.970
So we got hit pretty
hard with the NTP MONLIST

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:08.530
misconfiguration.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.150
And we ended up
doing a few things

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.450
to mitigate all these attacks.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.590
So on the NTP side,
we disabled MONLIST

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:16.950
on the NTP server we
could, which kind of

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:19.080
kills the attack in its tracks.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.960
But this being a federated
institution where we don't have

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.924
power over nearly anything--

00:43:23.924 --> 00:43:24.840
I shouldn't say that--

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.420
nearly everything,
there's just a lot

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.370
of things we just don't have the
reach to touch or the authority

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:30.024
to touch.

00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:31.440
So what we ended
up doing was just

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.530
rate-limiting NTP at the border.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.940
And that's been in place
now for almost a year?

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.180
Almost a year with almost
no negative impact.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:44.140
So we rate-limited down to,
let's say, a few megabits,

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.640
which was certainly better than
the gigs we were sending out

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.890
to the internet previously.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:49.990
So that's kind of
a solved problem.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:56.380
DNS is a bit harder, was a
bit harder to take care of.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.390
What we ended up doing
was started to leverage

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:00.860
an Akamai service called, eDNS.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.720
So Akamai has this
service where you could

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.900
host your zones with them.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.150
They're one of many providers.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:07.852
But we had an
existing relationship

00:44:07.852 --> 00:44:09.810
with Akamai, which I'll
talk about in a minute.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:14.240
So we leveraged their eDNA,
bifurcated our DNS, our domain

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.270
name system space.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.720
We put an external
view on Akamai.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.070
We put an internal on the
servers that always served MIT.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:25.410
And then we ACL'd off
the internal view,

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.220
so only MIT clients could
hit our internal servers.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.290
And the rest of the
world hits Akamai.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.380
The benefit of Akamai eDNS
is it's hosted in a content

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.690
distribution network.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:36.960
It's all over the world.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.170
It's being served out of
Asia, Europe, North America

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.510
East, West.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:45.472
It's all over the place.

00:44:45.472 --> 00:44:46.930
Most people can't
take down Akamai,

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.532
so we don't have to worry about
our DNS going down any more.

00:44:49.532 --> 00:44:51.490
So that's kind of how we
resolved that problem.

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:55.450
OK.

00:44:55.450 --> 00:45:00.350
So these are details of
the attacks themselves.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:03.080
Source obfuscation, this
is probably remedial.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.163
Why you do it, to avoid
detection and prosecution.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:10.070
I'll skip that one.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:10.570
OK.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:12.480
So maybe you don't want
to hide your address

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.460
or spoof your
address, you just want

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.420
to destroy a target with bots.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.632
So botnets are huge right now.

00:45:20.632 --> 00:45:23.820
The "it's OK, no
problem, bro" was

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.510
used in that operation Ababil,
which really targeted the US

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.390
financial sector.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.140
So in this case, rather
than just spoofing

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.330
a bunch of packets
from one host,

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.170
we're using a botnet
of legitimate systems

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:40.340
that don't necessarily
need to just spoof.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.810
Since these are
legitimate systems

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:45.040
and they'll respond
to, say, a TCP synack,

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.920
we can actually do more
higher level attacks,

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.967
like attack an HTTP server
and do GET and POST floods.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:55.180
They might hire stressors.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.880
Stressors are basically
botnets for hire

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.170
where you hire them
to do load testing,

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:06.440
and they go and load test
someone else for you.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.980
There's, no doubt, probably
legitimate ones out there.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.334
But there are others that
aren't and are basically

00:46:13.334 --> 00:46:14.500
denial of services for hire.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.770
OK, so the mitigation
strategies.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:22.800
We talked about
one, which is DNS.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.500
We can use DNS to
mitigate these attacks.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.620
So we have used
Akamai to do that.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.150
In this graphic here-- which
is probably too small for you

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:33.810
to see--

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:41.170
but basically, this slide
is way too far ahead

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:42.030
where it should be.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:44.770
So OK, we had an attack
against our web server,

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.300
so I'll just brief
you real quick.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.730
One of the attacks that
followed the Swartz tragedy

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.050
was an attack against web.mit.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.840
They took down our web server.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.880
The way we solved that was
we used our bifurcated DNS

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.520
to point internal clients
to web.mit internally.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.240
And then we use the Akamai
content distribution network

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.710
to basically mirror web.mit.

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.450
And then we used
the external view

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:11.020
of our DNS to point
external clients to Akamai.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:14.560
So when a user out
on the internet--

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.200
which we'll say is over here--

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.620
wants to go to
web.mit, they actually

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:22.180
go to the Akamai CDN, which
serves up the content.

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.790
If it's content that,
for some reason,

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:25.580
they can't directly
serve out cache,

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:31.050
it's dynamic or whatever, the
origin server, which is still

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:35.910
web.mit, and Akamai will go and
fetch the necessary content,

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.370
send it to the user, and
then potentially cache it

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:40.050
for some interval.

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.350
So short story here
is that the attack--

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:44.840
I'll talk about it in a minute--

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.520
but the way we solved it was
we put the actual web server

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.462
on the content distribution
network of Akamai.

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:56.380
The other attacks
that we'll talk

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:57.950
about-- this how we mitigated.

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:01.982
These two slides
are out of order.

00:48:01.982 --> 00:48:03.190
So I mentioned a few attacks.

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:06.090
I mentioned the NTP attack.

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:08.050
I'm going to mention
a couple of others.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.610
But basically, these
are attacks that

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.130
are just brute force, trying
to overwhelm our bandwidth.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.140
And I mentioned, when
you get up into the tens

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:19.830
of gigabits range, a lot
of internet end users,

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:20.849
such as MIT--

00:48:20.849 --> 00:48:23.140
you can name another service
provider, but a very large

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.170
user-- even we would
have trouble handling

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:28.077
tens of gigabits of traffic.

00:48:28.077 --> 00:48:30.410
So in that case, your options
are really limited, right?

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:31.868
If it's spoofed
traffic, how do you

00:48:31.868 --> 00:48:35.260
put a filter at your border
to block this traffic?

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.702
And even so, once it's
got to your border

00:48:37.702 --> 00:48:39.910
where you filter it, it's
already flooded your pipes.

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:41.047
So how do you do this?

00:48:41.047 --> 00:48:43.630
You have to push it back up into
the cloud, into the internet,

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.200
and block it there.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.305
And the way that many
people are choosing to do it

00:48:47.305 --> 00:48:51.719
and the way we've done it here
is through BGP mitigation.

00:48:51.719 --> 00:48:54.010
So if you're familiar with
BGP, which is Border Gateway

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.250
Protocol, it's the protocol that
runs routing on the internet.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.680
And it's a path
vector protocol that

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:04.630
uses ASN, so autonomous
system numbers.

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.840
So every multi-homed
organization on the internet

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.180
has an ASN, an
autonomous system number.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:16.410
And BGP uses that
number to build paths

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:19.120
through the internet so that you
can have multiple paths to get

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.090
to a particular ASN.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.225
In this case, I'm
using example 123,

00:49:24.225 --> 00:49:27.230
because I created this
for another organization.

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:31.530
We're three, because
we're awesome like that.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:35.020
Harvard was 11, so they're a
little slower to the punch.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.930
But in this case,
we've got a path.

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:41.990
So we've got the beginning
of the path is ASN123.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:44.160
The end of the path is 789.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.990
And there's some sequence
of ASes, autonomous systems,

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.320
that this packet
has to pass through.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.160
So what we're going
to with BGP mitigation

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:57.050
is just inject another
ASN into the mix.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.100
And that ASN has
the capabilities

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:02.000
to handle this traffic on our.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.020
So in this case, we have ASN456.

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.210
And they are going to be
kind of a sanctioned man

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:09.460
in the middle for us.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:13.290
We're going to allow them to
advertise our prefixes so that,

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:20.480
when we come under
attack, if 18.1.2.3.0/24,

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:25.070
a small slice of 255 addresses
at MIT comes under attack,

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:31.980
we allow this AS456 to advertise
that prefix on our behalf.

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.620
Once that change propagates
across the internet,

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.480
all of the traffic starts
going into that AS.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.119
And in this case, for
us, that AS is Akamai.

00:50:40.119 --> 00:50:42.410
And they have lots of scrubbers
and can handle the high

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:44.240
bandwidth that we can't.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.970
So on the back end
of that connection

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:48.940
is a private connection
we have into Akamai

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.640
where they send
the post-scrubbed,

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.110
the clean traffic out to us.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:56.310
And that way, we can
avoid these sorts

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:58.195
of potentially
deadly attacks that

00:50:58.195 --> 00:50:59.550
could just take us offline.

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:01.460
If you're getting hit
with that much traffic,

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:02.793
there's just nothing you can do.

00:51:07.664 --> 00:51:09.080
So actually, before
we keep going,

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:13.400
any questions on what
we've covered so far?

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.692
Yes?

00:51:14.692 --> 00:51:16.900
AUDIENCE: This is just more
of a networking question.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:17.983
You mentioned the borders.

00:51:17.983 --> 00:51:18.900
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.400
AUDIENCE: And [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.730
So I'm trying to understand the
structure of the micro-network

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:32.830
and just what a
border actually is.

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:34.194
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:51:34.194 --> 00:51:36.787
Let me see if I can pull
up a quick diagram for you.

00:51:36.787 --> 00:51:37.745
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:39.944 --> 00:51:41.110
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's right.

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:41.610
Yeah.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:43.780
It's a video camera, it's not--

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:58.680
So MIT really has three
border routers, external 1,

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.820
external 2, and another router.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.380
Let's just call it external 3.

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:05.380
So these are our--

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:18.300
so basically, the actual mit.net
is pretty much a standard hub

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.340
and spoke topology.

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:23.170
We have core switches connected
out to a distribution layer.

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.930
And then they go out
to access layers,

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:27.600
which are basically buildings.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.645
At the border, we have
these three borders here.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:33.470
This is incredibly vague.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:34.170
I apologize.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:37.600
But we have multiple providers.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.550
So for instance, our
commercial providers

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:43.320
will soon be dual home to
both of our border routers.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.990
This external router 3 here--

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.660
which is not its real name--
but this external router here

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.440
is basically for
research peering.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.820
So we kind of have a
delineation between commodity

00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.070
and commercial peering
and research peering.

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:03.170
So all of the BGP
we're talking about

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:06.700
happens between the external
border and our providers

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.900
and back up into
the internet itself.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.680
Oh, and these are just
choke point routers

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.120
that we have between
our border and our core.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:22.190
OK.

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:27.910
So in response to the
Swartz tragedy of--

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:32.260
I believe it was two years
ago, I had just started here--

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.010
certain hactivists
took it upon themselves

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.560
to attack MIT as an institution.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.387
So we experienced three attacks.

00:53:37.387 --> 00:53:38.970
And I'm going to go
through all three,

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:42.466
because there were three
separate and distinct types

00:53:42.466 --> 00:53:42.965
of attacks.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.460
So the first attack was against
our infrastructure itself.

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:55.810
So at the time, MIT did and
does and will support openness.

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:59.240
And we have a very open network,
especially in comparison

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:04.690
to other dot edus, having
come from another one.

00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:07.269
That can be a blessing and
a curse from a security

00:54:07.269 --> 00:54:08.060
perspective, right?

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.070
So we're open to the world.

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:12.970
In this case, our border
routers, these guys here

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:16.470
that we just drew, were running
an older version of software

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:20.770
that was vulnerable to a
particular denial of service

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:22.000
attack.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.100
So the attackers in this case
sent a very low bandwidth

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:25.800
stream.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.470
I mean, it was really low.

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:28.610
It was less than 100k.

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:30.890
It would have been
totally non-noticeable,

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.200
without actually going on
the device and debugging.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.010
They send it to the management
interface of those devices.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:38.860
And those devices promptly
just keeled over, right?

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.470
They didn't die,
but the CPU spiked.

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:41.840
They weren't routing packets.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.920
mit.net, at that
point, was offline.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.680
So in this case, this was the
first attack we experienced.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.532
I think it was during the
Patriots playoff game.

00:54:52.532 --> 00:54:53.990
Sometimes, I think
these things are

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.610
planned to find it when staff
is not paying attention.

00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:01.130
So it was during
that playoff game.

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:02.720
What we ended up
doing was immediately

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.845
upgrading the software to
a patched version, right?

00:55:04.845 --> 00:55:07.550
That was a quick triage fix.

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:10.824
The longer term fix was that--

00:55:10.824 --> 00:55:12.240
outsiders on the
internet probably

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.680
don't need to access our
management interfaces, right?

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.860
A very select few need to
access those interfaces.

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:22.400
So we ended up
implementing, basically,

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.420
the least privileged,
so that only at the IP

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:28.010
addresses of our staff
on VPN could access them.

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:33.190
And we stopped using clear
text management protocols.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:36.330
So that one was fixed.

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:37.836
Then attack two came in.

00:55:37.836 --> 00:55:39.502
PROFESSOR: There's a
question over here.

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:39.886
PROFESSOR: Oh, a question.

00:55:39.886 --> 00:55:40.468
Sorry.

00:55:40.468 --> 00:55:44.010
AUDIENCE: So is it not correct
that this was a zero-day attack

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.300
against the service provider?

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.540
PROFESSOR: I think it
would be fair to say

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:47.770
it was not a zero-day attack.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.700
The second attack was
against web.mit.edu itself.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:59.206
And this was what I alluded
to on the DNS mitigation slide

00:55:59.206 --> 00:56:00.910
that I got ahead of myself on.

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:05.850
So web.mit was in
our data center,

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:07.010
protected by a firewall.

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:08.570
So it was behind a firewall.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.300
What ended up happening
was that the attacker

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.820
sent a flood of HTTP traffic.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.540
It was a GET and POST flood.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:19.800
I'm not sure which one it was.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.795
But basically, they didn't
kill the web server,

00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:23.580
they killed the firewall.

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:27.060
The firewall keeled over
because firewalls too are

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.710
a blessing and a curse, right?

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:33.465
A stateless router access list
is very simple, is very fast,

00:56:33.465 --> 00:56:35.215
but you also lose a
lot of the granularity

00:56:35.215 --> 00:56:36.700
in what you can filter.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.325
Because it's doing
it packet by packet,

00:56:38.325 --> 00:56:41.150
you can only use the criteria
in each packet, ports, and IP

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:43.250
addresses, mostly.

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:47.220
We hid behind a firewall, which
worked well when it worked.

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.310
But when it came
under load, the state

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:50.515
required of the firewall--

00:56:50.515 --> 00:56:52.973
because of firewall tracking
in every state, in addition to

00:56:52.973 --> 00:56:54.115
the packets--

00:56:54.115 --> 00:56:55.920
it died.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.310
So the triage fix
for this attack

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:02.090
was that we moved it
to a routed network.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:04.840
And that's something we would
have preferred not to do,

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.080
but you really had to, due to
the attack that was ongoing.

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.410
The longer term mitigation
that we performed

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:13.420
was that we moved
into the Akamai CDN.

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.860
So you may notice, if
you go outside of MIT,

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:21.110
as you go to web.mit now, it
doesn't resolve to 18.09.22

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:21.610
anymore.

00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:25.060
It resolves to a C name,
which in turn resolves

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.856
to an Akamai IP address.

00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:34.630
And attack number
three, this one actually

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:38.180
wasn't on the side of mit.net.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.180
This was on the side
of our registrar.

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:44.760
So we found the
homepage of MIT--

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:48.350
www.mit and web.mit replaced
with this page here.

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:51.660
And we quickly did some
diagnostics on the web server.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.010
Everything looked fine.

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:54.660
The server was not compromised.

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.130
It was not defaced like this.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:00.180
And what we did
end up finding was

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:05.380
that our who is information
for our name and our actual DNS

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:07.590
delegations weren't working.

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:11.000
So in this case, you can see
the administrative contact,

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.550
"I got owned."

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:17.710
And then our address, "Owned
network operations, Destroyed,

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.060
Massachusetts."

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.466
They were clearly just
trying to poke at us.

00:58:22.466 --> 00:58:24.340
But it was delegated
out to these two servers

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:26.778
at CloudFlare, which is a
cloud-based hosting provider.

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:33.220
So this is what
I call the troll.

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:34.570
This was on Gizmodo.

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:38.700
This was a bit of indirection
on the part of the attackers,

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.792
however many there were.

00:58:40.792 --> 00:58:42.000
The hack went down like this.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.510
So this is what
he told the world

00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:45.210
very soon after this happened.

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:48.080
So once we realize
that it wasn't

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.030
MIT or anything on
mit.net that was hacked,

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:53.270
it was actually our
registrar, we got in contact

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.805
with our registrar.

00:58:53.805 --> 00:58:54.929
We got our records changed.

00:58:54.929 --> 00:58:56.690
We got everything locked down.

00:58:56.690 --> 00:59:00.250
But of course, in DNS, there's
time to live values involved.

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:01.570
Some of them are hours.

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:04.410
So after this
attack was resolved,

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:06.660
there were still
some flux afterwards.

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.790
And during that time, we're
trying to clean everything up,

00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:12.080
he posts on Gizmodo
in the comments

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.630
on an article about this.

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:17.760
"Own the MIT NOC guy
with a browser exploit."

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.220
That guy.

00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.570
"Get their Educause
logins, which were blah."

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:27.560
So he goes through
the whole scenario.

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:32.120
But the vector here
was the MIT NOC guy.

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.037
So Mark is swearing at
the time, up and down--

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:35.536
not actually
swearing-- but swearing

00:59:35.536 --> 00:59:36.890
up and down that it's not him.

00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:39.660
He's not compromised.

00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:44.050
So what we did end up finding
out after the fact was this

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:46.331
was published well
after the incident.

00:59:46.331 --> 00:59:48.580
That link is still live, if
you want to read about it.

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:51.050
This was indirection.

00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:52.260
It wasn't true.

00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:55.640
The actual vector was that our
entire registrar was owned.

00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.160
Our registrar, being .edu, is
run by an organization called

00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.180
Educause.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.520
Turns out that every
DNS registration

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.970
account had been compromised.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.040
The attacker had this for
I don't know how long,

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.590
but they just decided to show
their hand with the MIT hack

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:14.600
here and actually use their
power to expose themselves,

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.630
but to also hack our DNS.

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.220
So this one wasn't
actually anybody

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.780
at MIT's fault, it was on
the part of our registrar,

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.860
which they soon acknowledged.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:28.810
This was in February of 2013.

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:31.275
They mentioned that they
were in fact breached.

01:00:31.275 --> 01:00:32.900
And we all had to
change our passwords.

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.400
And do we have two-factor now?

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400
PROFESSOR: No.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.400
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.740
But we ended up locking
down our domain account so

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:41.580
that it couldn't be changed.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.996
But you know, it turns out,
if the entire system is owned,

01:00:43.996 --> 01:00:45.660
if you check a box
that says, "locked,"

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.300
which prevents people
from updating it,

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:49.530
it doesn't do much good.

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:51.880
In any case, they've
fixed their system.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.910
And this one wasn't
our fault, but it

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:55.910
was kind of an interesting
one because it really

01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:58.090
subverted some of the core
protocols of the internet

01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:00.849
in order to do this.

01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:03.687
OK, so the current
threat landscape.

01:01:03.687 --> 01:01:04.633
No, no, no.

01:01:04.633 --> 01:01:06.052
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:06.052 --> 01:01:07.950
Ah.

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:11.920
So if you can't exploit the
silicon, exploit the carbon.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.990
Exploit the use at the keyboard.

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:18.091
And this is what we're
seeing a lot of now.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.590
I mean, from my
personal experience,

01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:22.530
having been in this
for almost 20 years,

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:25.477
the network-based vector--

01:01:25.477 --> 01:01:27.060
with the exception
of this year, which

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.120
I'll talk about in a minute--
but the network-based vector,

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.661
attacks that originate
on the network

01:01:30.661 --> 01:01:33.180
and remotely exploit
hosts, that isn't

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.620
a lot of what we see anymore.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:38.700
Computer systems actually do
seem to be getting more secure,

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.185
from the outside at least.

01:01:40.185 --> 01:01:43.510
You know, Windows, and Solaris,
and Linux, in the old days,

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:46.190
maybe a decade ago, they used
to ship with all their services

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.782
enable.

01:01:46.782 --> 01:01:48.490
I called it lit up
like a Christmas tree.

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:53.520
Everything would be on, because
on the convenience and security

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.090
continuum--

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:56.965
if we agree that one exists,
some people don't-- but they

01:01:56.965 --> 01:01:58.530
were way on the convenient side.

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.160
They wanted everything
to work out of the box.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.170
Whereas, I think we
found a sensible medium

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:06.050
where, when you install
a fresh operating system,

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:09.350
there is a host-based
firewall running.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:13.170
And there aren't world
accessible services

01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:14.340
running on a system.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.320
We've also got things like
Windows Update and Apple Update

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.070
and package managers in
all the Linux distros,

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.280
so that a box that gets
online, pretty quickly,

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.552
will get itself up to date.

01:02:24.552 --> 01:02:27.010
So you don't have these ancient
boxes with ancient services

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.660
open to the world.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:29.160
OK.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.090
So where I was going
with that is they've

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:34.312
moved up the stack now, right?

01:02:34.312 --> 01:02:36.020
Maybe they're at level
eight or nine now.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.186
They're dealing with people.

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:41.680
And they're trying to exploit
human failings or frailties,

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.950
like fear, or greed, or
trust, or familiarity, to kind

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:49.220
of leverage credentials, so that
they can exploit application

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.720
access or privileged access.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.640
Rather than exploiting
hosts themselves,

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.410
they're exploiting people.

01:02:56.410 --> 01:03:01.190
A few things we've seen on
campus in the very recent past.

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:02.780
This one here--
oh, I should say,

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.800
we have not experienced
this one on campus.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.660
I don't want to scare anybody.

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.550
This has been seen, though,
across the nation in different

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:10.174
.edus.

01:03:10.174 --> 01:03:11.840
And it's a very serious
threat, so we're

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.270
moving quickly to address it.

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:15.490
However, we have not
actually seen it here.

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:18.089
So this threat is
spear phishing.

01:03:18.089 --> 01:03:20.130
And this is probably
remedial, but spear phishing

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.650
targets a particular community
with a plausible message.

01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:26.620
So if you just get spam
messages or phishing messages,

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:30.420
they're just casting a
wide net and catching

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:34.940
people who, for some bizarre
reason, might respond to that.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:37.765
However, in a spear
phishing attack,

01:03:37.765 --> 01:03:40.610
if they're able to narrow it and
find a community of interest,

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:43.690
that they can actually say
something that sounds mildly

01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:45.640
plausible, Bank of
America customers,

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.420
or MIT students,
staff, and faculty.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.140
In this case, they were
able to choose communities

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:55.012
of different institutions.

01:03:55.012 --> 01:03:56.970
I'm not singling anybody
out, but it is public.

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:59.760
And Boston University
was one of them.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.950
They targeted the community with
bogus email messages pointing

01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:06.870
to a bogus authentication site.

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:09.179
Some percentage of the users
actually clicked through

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:11.220
and logged in, which of
course, gave the attacker

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.480
the credentials.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.800
The attacker then went
to the legitimate site

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.645
and redirected those
user's direct deposits

01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:19.790
to an account
under their control

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.660
and emptied that account.

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:26.080
I'm not sure the dollars
affected there are public,

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.140
but it was probably
a large amount.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.970
So in response to this--

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:33.510
I mean, how do you combat that?

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:37.110
To a large extent, it's a
user education issue, so

01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:38.150
community awareness.

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:41.180
Just let people know
you can't trust email.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.720
You just have to verify things,
before you click on them.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.681
But from experience and
just knowing human nature,

01:04:49.681 --> 01:04:51.180
that's only going
to get you so far.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.490
There's always going to be
some percentage of people

01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:53.540
who click on it.

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.530
And I'm amazed.

01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:57.670
As you can imagine-- you
all probably are as well--

01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:59.544
I'm a repository of all
the phishing messages

01:04:59.544 --> 01:05:00.590
my family receives.

01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:03.880
So I'm getting stuff from
my father, my sister, like,

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.730
is this legit?

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:06.695
And it's getting
increasingly hard to tell.

01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:08.570
So you've got to actually
go into the headers

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:09.861
and see where it's coming from.

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:13.940
And a lot of male
clients now, they

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:15.606
don't actually like
to show you the link

01:05:15.606 --> 01:05:18.690
that it points to, which
gets really annoying.

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:19.800
So it's getting harder.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:24.800
So some of it is
just user error,

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.940
for lack of a better word.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:28.690
And some of it is it's just
increasingly difficult to tell.

01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:31.630
So at the root of the
problem, in my opinion,

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:34.526
is that passwords are just
a dead technology, right?

01:05:34.526 --> 01:05:37.025
In terms of the factors, it's
something you know a password,

01:05:37.025 --> 01:05:39.240
it's something you
are, maybe a biometric,

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.840
or something you have, a token.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.120
So what we're doing to try
to mitigate this here--

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.650
because basically, these
man-in-the-middle attacks are

01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:50.330
just stealing
something you know.

01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:51.780
They're stealing your password.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:55.084
Well, if we can also add
something that you have,

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:57.000
that attack is only going
to get them halfway.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.150
They're not going to be able
to compromise your identity.

01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:02.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] number?

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.648
PROFESSOR: You won't
be able to compromise--

01:06:04.648 --> 01:06:06.314
the attacker won't
be able to compromise

01:06:06.314 --> 01:06:07.910
the identity of the user.

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:11.720
So we are rolling out a
second authentication factor

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:18.380
in the near term that will be
tied into our Touchstone IDP.

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.150
We can release that
to these guys, right?

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:22.440
So early release, if
you're interested.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:28.217
If you're go to duo.mit.edu,
we're using a vendor

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:29.050
called Duo Security.

01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:32.640
It's a cloud-based two-factor
authentication system that's

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.330
being used in a lot of edus.

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:37.750
But basically, you'll register
your phone as a second factor

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:39.530
and you run a little
smartphone app.

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:41.960
If you don't have a
smartphone, I'm sorry.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:47.980
But if you don't have one,
you can also do it via SMS.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.090
It will actually call you
and tell you a number.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:58.930
And you can also generate
one-time passwords,

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:01.240
a list of 10 passwords
that you can use.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.150
So this is coming
soon to the community.

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:06.020
It is completely active at this
point, it's just not announced.

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.640
If you want to go to duo.mit,
you can opt your phone in.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.870
You can actually
turn on Touchstone.

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:15.690
I'll give you a quick demo,
to show you how it integrates.

01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:19.870
The beauty of using standards
and federated systems,

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:23.260
like SAML and Shibboleth,
which underlay Touchstone,

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:28.020
is that we can easily lay
on additional factors.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:33.240
So in this case, I'm going to
just go to a tool that I use,

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:37.010
which is transparently going
to authenticate me using

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:38.390
Touchstone with my certificate.

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:39.980
But I should now
get prompted for--

01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:45.250
too fast there.

01:07:52.881 --> 01:07:53.631
Who runs this now?

01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:58.054
PROFESSOR: Don't know that guy.

01:07:58.054 --> 01:07:59.054
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

01:07:59.054 --> 01:07:59.554
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:59.554 --> 01:08:00.554
PROFESSOR: He got owned.

01:08:00.554 --> 01:08:01.519
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:01.519 --> 01:08:02.185
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:02.185 --> 01:08:03.560
PROFESSOR: Give
me a site to hit.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.020
I'm just drawing a
blank, because I'm

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:05.560
in front of a crowd.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.310
PROFESSOR: Splunk?

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:07.290
PROFESSOR: Splunk.

01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:08.760
No, not Splunk.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.060
Because that's not a native
Touchstone integration.

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:12.780
Atlas.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:13.738
PROFESSOR: Atlas, yeah.

01:08:25.956 --> 01:08:27.033
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:27.033 --> 01:08:27.908
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:08:27.908 --> 01:08:28.408
All right.

01:08:28.408 --> 01:08:30.533
PROFESSOR: Well, he's very
secure, at least, right?

01:08:30.533 --> 01:08:31.460
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.585
The only real security is
to stay off the internet.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:37.779
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:43.349
If this doesn't work in 20
seconds, I will move on.

01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:45.890
PROFESSOR: Do you have another
browser, maybe, that's cached?

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:46.598
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.130
There we go.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:54.630
Oh, weird.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:57.065
OK, so here's my typical
Touchstone login.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.055
Now, you're going to
just get one more prompt.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.566
PROFESSOR: You're actually
off the Wi-Fi, it looks like.

01:09:08.566 --> 01:09:09.399
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:09.899
I did.

01:09:17.166 --> 01:09:17.666
All right.

01:09:17.666 --> 01:09:19.499
Well, let's leave that
demo for after class,

01:09:19.499 --> 01:09:21.870
and let's edit that out.

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:23.490
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:24.990
PROFESSOR: In fact,
now I tried it--

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.080
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.204
I did not rehearse that
demo, so that's what I get.

01:09:27.204 --> 01:09:28.790
But trust me, it works.

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:31.850
If you go to Duo, you
can register yourself.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:34.924
And all of your two-factor
interactions-- or I'm sorry,

01:09:34.924 --> 01:09:37.340
your Touchstone interactions
will all be two-factored now.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.270
And you'll be super secure.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:41.450
It really does work well.

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:47.120
Another threat we've experienced
in the past few months is--

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.850
this, again, is something
that's targeting not just edus,

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:52.630
but organizations
across the country.

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:55.040
But we've been getting
police called ID spoofing.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.850
And this kind of transcends
the digital world,

01:09:57.850 --> 01:09:59.474
for the most part.

01:09:59.474 --> 01:10:01.140
Members of the MIT
community are getting

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.720
calls from local
police departments

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.284
nearby their hometown.

01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:05.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:07.110
It appears to be a call.

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:08.280
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:12.205
So these police departments are
telling them bad news, right?

01:10:12.205 --> 01:10:13.830
They're telling them
you're about to be

01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:14.890
charged with a crime.

01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:16.900
I think some of
them are tax fraud.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.160
Your family member's
been in an accident.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.740
Of course, it's not real.

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.600
Their call's coming
from an attacker who's

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.573
using ANI, which is automated--

01:10:26.573 --> 01:10:28.545
PROFESSOR: They're
using SIP, basically,

01:10:28.545 --> 01:10:31.037
to forge their From field
in their voice call, right?

01:10:31.037 --> 01:10:31.620
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:32.746
Which feeds into caller ID.

01:10:32.746 --> 01:10:34.286
PROFESSOR: Which
then gets translated

01:10:34.286 --> 01:10:36.850
by a bridge who trust the From
field that a SIP message to be

01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:38.141
whatever number's placed in it.

01:10:38.141 --> 01:10:38.770
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:41.617
PROFESSOR: And so the attacker's
like, all right, so I sign up

01:10:41.617 --> 01:10:42.700
for a cheapie SIP service.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.170
And I'll set my From field
to be the police department's

01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:46.590
number in Lexington.

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:47.480
And I'll send it.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.560
And once it gets to the
transcoding gateway that

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.780
turns it back into traditional
telephony, it says, all right.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.196
Well, that's the
number it's from.

01:10:53.196 --> 01:10:55.235
We'll just show it to the
user when it shows up.

01:10:55.235 --> 01:10:56.860
PROFESSOR: So you
end up getting a call

01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.235
from what you think is a police
department with extremely

01:10:59.235 --> 01:11:00.300
bad news.

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.390
Again, they're exploiting
human frailty here.

01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:04.210
In this case, it's
probably fear.

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:06.540
Maybe it's a little
anger, but it's the case--

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:07.410
PROFESSOR: Or guilt.

01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:08.060
PROFESSOR: What's that?

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:08.480
PROFESSOR: Or guilt.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.146
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:11:09.146 --> 01:11:10.010
Yeah, I suppose.

01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:12.680
[LAUGHS] If it's legit.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.730
But in any case, these calls all
come to the same point, which

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:21.242
is you need to pay a fee for
something, which, on its face

01:11:21.242 --> 01:11:21.950
is kind of bogus.

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:23.180
But once they've told you this--

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.260
I mean, if they told me that
my wife was in a car accident,

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.010
I would not be in the
right state of mind.

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:28.630
And I might believe
some craziness

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:30.400
that they tell me
after the fact.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.930
So we've had people
on campus who--

01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:38.420
I don't think it's actually
anyone's actually paid,

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.940
but we have had multiple
targets of this attack.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.569
And again, this isn't just here.

01:11:42.569 --> 01:11:44.360
If you Google it, you'll
find reports of it

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.637
in Pittsburgh newspapers
and all over the country.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:49.720
But again, this is a spear
phishing attack, right?

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.510
They figure out where you live.

01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:53.520
And they can do this by
just Googling your name

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.920
or just looking at MIT
and checking the directory

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.080
and finding out some
details about you.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.940
And they just need
enough to be plausible.

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:03.740
And then they proceed to call
you and scare you and try

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.890
to extort you.

01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:07.969
The mitigation
here is difficult,

01:12:07.969 --> 01:12:09.510
because it involves
the phone system.

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:11.992
It involves multiple bridges.

01:12:11.992 --> 01:12:13.450
Frankly, I'm not
a phone guy, so it

01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:16.700
involves lots of stuff I'm just
going to wave my hands about.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.432
But law enforcement needs
to be involved here.

01:12:19.432 --> 01:12:22.015
You have to go to your providers
and work with law enforcement

01:12:22.015 --> 01:12:23.090
to get that traced back.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:26.800
Actually moved forward?

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.067
And one more along the spear
phishing email side of things.

01:12:33.067 --> 01:12:34.650
There's another thing
that some people

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.720
call whaling, which is
the intentional targeting

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.344
of high level staff
at an organization.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.790
We have experienced this--

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:45.373
I've experienced it elsewhere,
but we've also experienced this

01:12:45.373 --> 01:12:48.110
here where they will send
extremely targeted messages

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:51.620
at high level staff,
using org charts,

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:54.420
using directories to
find plausible reporting

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:59.830
relationships, and write some
really believable messages

01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:02.107
that, if you're not careful
when you click reply,

01:13:02.107 --> 01:13:03.690
that wire transfer
number that they're

01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:05.790
asking for isn't going to
the person that you think

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:06.498
sent the message.

01:13:06.498 --> 01:13:09.660
It's going to somewhere on
the other side of the world

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.470
or the other side
of the country.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.544
So we've been
experiencing this as well.

01:13:13.544 --> 01:13:16.210
The short of it is-- in your own
security class, you know this--

01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:18.090
SMTP is not a reliable protocol.

01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:19.960
You can't believe
pretty much anything

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.150
in there, which just
runs completely counter

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:23.900
to human nature.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.302
So take everything
with a grain of salt.

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:28.926
PROFESSOR: You going
to tell the story?

01:13:28.926 --> 01:13:29.884
PROFESSOR: No, you can.

01:13:29.884 --> 01:13:31.782
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:32.740
Yeah.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.320
So you could tell it.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.810
Basically, we had one recently.

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:38.360
And I won't go into the
details or the names.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.577
Keep anonymity.

01:13:39.577 --> 01:13:44.040
But a senior member
of the administration

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:49.180
reaches out and says,
hey, I got this email.

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.800
This is from someone
and says, I need

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.270
help-- a very senior executive--
with a wire transfer.

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:56.640
And so he sent me this email.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.450
And I replied.

01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:00.820
And he said he didn't know
what I was talking about.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:01.990
And so how did that happen?

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:03.180
Is my email account hacked?

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.410
It says I sent this
email, but I didn't.

01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:10.140
And to Dave's point, the whole
possibility that email itself

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.794
could somehow be spoofed,
without your account itself

01:14:12.794 --> 01:14:14.960
being compromised, is very
foreign to people, right?

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.270
It's a trust relationship.

01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:17.970
So it turns out, I
guess, it was someone

01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:22.485
at an internet cafe in Nigeria
or something like that,

01:14:22.485 --> 01:14:23.610
which we were joking about.

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:25.735
But yeah, they basically
went to the MIT org chart,

01:14:25.735 --> 01:14:27.520
found a senior
executive, found someone

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.770
in the Vice President of
Finance office and said, hey,

01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:31.894
I need you to help me with
this wire transfer call.

01:14:31.894 --> 01:14:32.760
Here's the number.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.510
And these are the kinds of
things that happen every day.

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:38.450
They didn't transfer
the money, obviously.

01:14:38.450 --> 01:14:39.520
PROFESSOR: The email
was totally believable?

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:39.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:40.980
PROFESSOR: I've seen it.

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:41.830
PROFESSOR: Even the
tone and everything

01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:42.810
seemed very plausible.

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:42.845
PROFESSOR: Yep.

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.678
PROFESSOR: They actually
used email messages

01:14:44.678 --> 01:14:46.590
this senior
executive had written

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:48.174
that were posted
on public websites,

01:14:48.174 --> 01:14:49.840
because they send
memos to the community

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.760
and things like that that
used the exact same style,

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.200
introduction, the way
they closed the message.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.055
Even the language and terms
they used was identical.

01:14:59.055 --> 01:15:01.214
This is stuff they had
used in other ways.

01:15:01.214 --> 01:15:02.630
So it was actually
kind of creepy,

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:04.046
because even when
I first read it,

01:15:04.046 --> 01:15:07.060
if you didn't know what it
was, it was semi-plausible.

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:09.310
And thankfully, the staff
member that it was requested

01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:11.910
of-- like this was kind of an
out of the ordinary request,

01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:14.180
it got flagged, even though
it looked legitimate.

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:19.530
And he or she responded
directly to the sender,

01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:21.300
removing the Reply To
address and actually

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:25.170
putting in a known good one from
his address book or her address

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:29.377
book, and responded and
asked and kind of unveiled

01:15:29.377 --> 01:15:30.270
the whole scheme.

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:34.620
But it could have gone
south really quickly.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.620
OK, so I mentioned that
the network-based vector

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.310
in my experience isn't as
prevalent as it used to be.

01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:43.900
And I'll kind of belie that
here, or make a lie of it here.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:47.390
This year has been a
year of major exploits.

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:50.320
Every single major
SSL implementation

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.630
has been targeted.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:55.120
There was Schannel on
the Microsoft side.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.190
There was the Apple
implementation, open SSL.

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:00.640
There was Poodle with SSL v3.

01:16:04.179 --> 01:16:04.970
This is SSL, right?

01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:06.220
This is a security service.

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:09.770
So when you put a service
up facing the world,

01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:11.240
you're going to run SSL.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.360
So we had a lot of
world-facing services

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.220
out there that were vulnerable
to some of these things.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:19.990
Shellshock was one that affected
the Bash shell where you could

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:21.680
remotely exploit a system.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.730
So these are all kind
of the gold standard

01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:26.644
of a network-based exploit.

01:16:26.644 --> 01:16:28.560
They were remotely
exploitable, and they could

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:31.330
get administrative privileges.

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:34.400
So it's been a kind of a
nasty year, in terms of that.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.560
So it's, in my opinion,
a bit of an outlier.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.970
But how do we deal with this?

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:40.780
Because these
services are public.

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.840
They need to be public.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.800
We can't just fence them
off, because they're

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.040
vulnerable to something.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.640
The first thing is
automatic patching.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.875
In the old days, the latency
between a zero day coming out

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:54.500
and a patch coming
out was fairly long.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.583
That's shortening, and
shortening, and shortening,

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:58.572
so we're down to
literally hours.

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.030
So when these things
surface, we're

01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:02.029
able to push out updates
to at least the systems

01:17:02.029 --> 01:17:03.370
that we maintain.

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:05.455
The systems we don't
maintain, we're

01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:09.500
able to use our communication
folks, like the communications

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.770
office and Monique
on the security team,

01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:14.410
to craft messages to go out to
the community to at least alert

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:16.460
them to the fact that you
really need the patch,

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:20.030
because this is dangerous
and it's out there.

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:23.800
On the more active front,
we can detect these scans.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.990
So the StealthWatch tool,
I mentioned way back,

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:28.920
is a tool that pulls
NetFlow data off

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.507
of our network devices.

01:17:30.507 --> 01:17:32.340
And we can do some basic
heuristics on that.

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.570
And if we see an
outside IP address

01:17:34.570 --> 01:17:37.370
talking to several
hundred MIT systems,

01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:40.780
that's probably not good.

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:41.620
It could be good.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.814
And if it's good, we will
totally white list it.

01:17:43.814 --> 01:17:46.230
And we've done that many, many
times for research projects

01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:48.500
and just things
that are legitimate.

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.440
But it's probably
not a bad posture

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.980
to say, OK, if we see
that, it's probably bad.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.560
Let's block it.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.230
So we actually have some
automated BGP null-routing

01:17:57.230 --> 01:17:59.640
going on where we're
actually watching the flows.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.470
And if we see an
anomalous behavior,

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:03.410
we null-route on-the-fly.

01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:04.710
That runs every five minutes.

01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:10.330
So as soon as a scan starts,
we cut it off at the knees.

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:15.100
On a more proactive
front even than that is

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:16.630
we will proactively scan.

01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:20.900
So in the case of Shellshock
and some of the earlier SSL

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:23.350
vulnerabilities that
were really deadly,

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:24.980
we actually scanned
the community

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.950
and sent out lists
to those we had

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:28.890
contact info for to
let them know, hey,

01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:30.480
this IP address is
running a service.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.605
This is a known vulnerable.

01:18:31.605 --> 01:18:32.352
Please patch it.

01:18:32.352 --> 01:18:34.435
It's really just about
getting the information out

01:18:34.435 --> 01:18:36.910
to the community as
quickly as we can.

01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:39.950
OK future trends, because
we're running short on time,

01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:43.500
consumerization of IT.

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:47.720
I call them future trends, but
the future is now here at MIT

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.410
and pretty much at any .edu.

01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:51.870
These are old things that
we've been dealing with.

01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:53.050
Bring your own device--

01:18:53.050 --> 01:18:54.740
I mean, I've owned
my own phone here

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:58.880
and at other institutions
in the edu space forever.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.866
It makes policy enforcement
really difficult,

01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:02.740
because how do you
enforce policy on a device

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.725
that you didn't pay for
that you don't manage?

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.417
Consumerization of
services, here at MIT,

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:12.250
we have an enterprise
agreement with Dropbox

01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:14.760
now, so that you can
store data up on Dropbox.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:15.510
Unlimited storage.

01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:17.140
That's open to students, right?

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:21.660
So yes, unlimited storage
on Dropbox, which is great.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.340
The problems that
come along with that

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:24.780
are maybe data custody.

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.320
Where is that data
going to live?

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.910
In our case, we've made sure
that jurisdiction will always

01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:30.050
be in the United States.

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:32.500
But what happens if you're
dealing with a provider that

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.640
crosses national boundaries
into areas where they

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.450
have different regulations?

01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:41.845
What do you do if a person
puts sensitive information up

01:19:41.845 --> 01:19:44.400
on that Dropbox and it gets
synced up to the cloud.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.880
And they think it just
lives in the cloud,

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.330
but we know that Dropbox
syncs to the local system.

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:54.670
There's a lot of issues involved
with the consumerization of IT,

01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:56.520
because the IT
department doesn't

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.710
control the service anymore.

01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:00.251
They're really just brokering
the service between the service

01:20:00.251 --> 01:20:02.570
provider and the consumer.

01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:04.640
Third-party email providers,
kind of same thing.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.180
You might send
sensitive information

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.390
through an email system
that's not totally internal.

01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:10.660
So sensitive data might
leave the institution.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.390
Cloud-based resources kind
of ties into that as well.

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:18.600
MIT never really
had a perimeter.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.400
Neither does the rest
of the world now, right?

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.150
If you're a small startup--

01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:26.530
and I'm sure you all have
many friends at startups,

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:27.530
I do as well--

01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:29.660
none of them have local
resources anymore, right?

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:32.540
They're using stuff that's
entirely in the cloud.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.570
How do you draw a
line or put a moat

01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:37.000
around those resources when
they're living in Amazon Web

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.310
Services, and at Salesforce.com,
and as Google Apps,

01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:42.180
and as Dropbox?

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:44.390
We need to find different
ways to handle that.

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:46.120
We have the same
data custody issues

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.990
as to where that
data might live.

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:51.110
We've also got authentication
and authorization issues.

01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:53.520
How do you make sure
that just your users

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.065
are accessing those services?

01:20:55.065 --> 01:20:56.440
And that's where
things like SAML

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:00.380
come in, which I think MIT
is really well-positioned,

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:03.510
because we have this really
robust SAML architecture.

01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:05.100
When we wanted to
add Dropbox, it

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.141
was easy enough to add
them as a service provider

01:21:07.141 --> 01:21:09.580
to our Touchstone
infrastructure.

01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:11.170
And it just worked.

01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:13.030
I'm sure I'm glazing
over some things,

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:15.060
but you know, in
the grand scheme,

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:16.680
standards-based and
federated systems,

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.810
like SAML and
Shibboleth are really

01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:23.070
life savers in a
cloud-based world.

01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:25.150
The internet of things,
what does that mean?

01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:28.310
It seems to be the
new buzzword du jour.

01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:30.450
But in terms of our
experience so far,

01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:33.030
the internet of
things at mit.net,

01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:36.042
we have building management
systems all over, right?

01:21:36.042 --> 01:21:37.500
These are computer
systems that are

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.010
built by the fine
folks that built

01:21:39.010 --> 01:21:40.590
air conditioners last year.

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:44.706
So they're not all that
secure, for the most part.

01:21:44.706 --> 01:21:46.330
Mark had the story
about they were just

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:47.830
living on public mit.net.

01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:49.864
They could be probed
by anyone in the world.

01:21:49.864 --> 01:21:51.530
What we've started
to do-- and actually,

01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:53.821
we're almost entirely done
with our building management

01:21:53.821 --> 01:21:54.930
systems--

01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:57.120
is move them onto a
different VRF, which

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.100
is a Virtual Routing
and Forwarding instance,

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.980
so that they have a completely
different forwarding path.

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.550
And we front-end
it with a firewall.

01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:04.740
It's all access controlled.

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.260
It lives on separate physical
infrastructure in closets.

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:10.100
The closets are secured.

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:12.570
But when we move into a
internet of things world,

01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:14.260
this problem is just
going to multiply.

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.968
What happens when the
light switches have

01:22:15.968 --> 01:22:19.690
IP addresses and, who knows,
my shoes have IP addresses?

01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:21.544
And it's going to get crazy.

01:22:21.544 --> 01:22:22.710
So how do we deal with that?

01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:25.320
And frankly, I don't
have an answer quite yet.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.520
Many companies say they do.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.040
And they'll make you spend
a lot of money on solutions.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.560
But one of them I can think of
is maybe we map access policy

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.750
down to devices,
based on 802.1X.

01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:36.620
So when I authenticate or
my device authenticates,

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:39.059
it pulls down the
thermostat policy,

01:22:39.059 --> 01:22:40.850
so that it can coexist
on the same network,

01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:44.840
and yet not be wide open to the
world as, say, my laptop is.

01:22:47.207 --> 01:22:49.290
So with that, I realized
we're over, but are there

01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:49.873
any questions?

01:22:52.485 --> 01:22:53.359
Yes.

01:22:53.359 --> 01:22:55.359
AUDIENCE: So there was
one page you skipped over

01:22:55.359 --> 01:22:56.317
a coupld of slides ago.

01:22:56.317 --> 01:22:57.637
PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.

01:22:57.637 --> 01:22:58.720
AUDIENCE: Campus firewall.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.835
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:22:59.835 --> 01:23:00.460
Where was this?

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.190
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about it.

01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:03.520
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.270
PROFESSOR: I swear,
it wasn't intentional.

01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:06.320
Oh, yeah.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.120
Coming soon.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.520
So this is-- do you want to
talk about it, or shall I?

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.186
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:23:10.186 --> 01:23:11.182
So I'll talk about it.

01:23:11.182 --> 01:23:13.390
I mean, one of the things
we realized, as David said,

01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:18.240
is that your default posture for
things, you get it with an Xbox

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.610
you install it today.

01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:22.080
You have IP tables by default.
Install Windows machine,

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.000
you have Windows host firewall.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.410
One of the things
we look at is--

01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:27.159
you know, you have
this internet of things

01:23:27.159 --> 01:23:29.596
and this vast variety
of devices on mit.net

01:23:29.596 --> 01:23:32.170
is having a more secure
posture by default,

01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:34.930
so that devices, by
default, may not necessarily

01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:37.620
be exposed to the
entire public network.

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.377
And there are legitimate
reasons people

01:23:39.377 --> 01:23:41.210
want to have a device
on the public network.

01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:41.876
And that's fine.

01:23:41.876 --> 01:23:44.480
You know, one of the things
that's great about MIT is,

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:47.180
if people want to do that,
you allow them to do that.

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.770
They can do that in
an automated way.

01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:49.910
They can do that by themselves.

01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:51.430
They don't need to
ask a policy person.

01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:53.190
They don't need to do
anything like that.

01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:54.690
So what we're trying
to move towards

01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:58.210
is really a network topology
where, by default, people

01:23:58.210 --> 01:24:00.490
will be behind some
layer of protection.

01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:02.960
If they want to go to a web
page and enroll themselves

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.645
in the public internet
level of access,

01:24:04.645 --> 01:24:06.436
they can do that without
talking to anyone.

01:24:06.436 --> 01:24:07.690
And it's automated.

01:24:07.690 --> 01:24:11.154
And it just happens
within a minute or two.

01:24:11.154 --> 01:24:13.070
And so I think what we're
trying to do is just

01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:14.986
move the default security
posture to something

01:24:14.986 --> 01:24:17.980
a little bit more secure, by
default. But at the same time,

01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:20.262
we recognize that
our goal here is

01:24:20.262 --> 01:24:22.220
to not really disrupt
the innovative activities

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:23.190
that happen here.

01:24:23.190 --> 01:24:25.440
And so if people want to do
that, students or faculty,

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.956
on an opt-in basis and go to
the web page, that's up to them.

01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:33.661
Any other questions?

01:24:33.661 --> 01:24:34.494
AUDIENCE: I had one.

01:24:34.494 --> 01:24:36.374
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:24:36.374 --> 01:24:39.750
AUDIENCE: What's the traffic
like now on the MIT network?

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:42.180
It's like, what kind of
traffic do you see the most of?

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:42.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.990
So I mean, looking
at StealthWatch,

01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:46.930
I'd say like 80% of our traffic,
if you look at it by protocol,

01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:48.930
is like HTTP, you
know, [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:51.210
PROFESSOR: Which would
include HTTP-streamed media.

01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:52.300
PROFESSOR: Movies, media.

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:54.180
Now, I think the interesting
question you could ask

01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:56.300
is how much of it is
legitimate research activity.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.670
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:59.730
I know you guys are
all studying hard.

01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:01.730
I know I was, that's why
I'm still working here.

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:02.230
No.

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.590
But yeah, it's
interesting breakdown.

01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:06.950
I think the one thing
we do philosophically,

01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:08.735
as a provider, is--

01:25:08.735 --> 01:25:10.110
you know, a lot
of schools, there

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:11.485
was a time where
they were trying

01:25:11.485 --> 01:25:14.450
to make judgments about
what kinds of traffic

01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:16.730
and how much were going
across their campus networks.

01:25:16.730 --> 01:25:17.990
MIT does not do that.

01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:21.210
One thing we believe very
strongly in is not me

01:25:21.210 --> 01:25:23.080
nor anybody else in
the administration

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:26.310
is in a position to pass
value judgment over someone's

01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:27.520
internet activity.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.540
PROFESSOR: Because
people live here.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.250
PROFESSOR: You live here, right?

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.430
PROFESSOR: It's
not just your work.

01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:32.800
I mean, people are doing a
lot of research on Netflix,

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.340
because we have a Netflix cache.

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:35.840
And we a lot of
traffic going there.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:39.780
But we also have thousands of
students and staff living here.

01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:42.900
So that's them at night
powering up their Netflix box

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:43.750
and streaming.

01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:44.720
PROFESSOR: Or
whatever it may be.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.510
So we've always been in the
position of like, you know, we

01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:48.718
have some very detailed
information about what it is.

01:25:48.718 --> 01:25:51.200
But I'd say that most
of it is, I'd say,

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.290
even nowadays, is kind of scary.

01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:56.550
I'd say, at night, half of
it's video stream, which is--

01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:58.780
AUDIENCE: Would you
allow torrent traffic?

01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:58.910
PROFESSOR: Porn?

01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:59.620
PROFESSOR: We don't.

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.210
No.

01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:00.595
AUDIENCE: Torrents.

01:26:00.595 --> 01:26:00.980
[INAUDIBLE]

01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:01.563
PROFESSOR: Oh.

01:26:01.563 --> 01:26:02.910
You know what's interesting?

01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:06.370
So porn and torrents are
pretty similar, so yeah.

01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:07.027
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:07.027 --> 01:26:09.360
Not that that's what went
through my head Freudian-wise.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.845
I'm sorry.

01:26:10.845 --> 01:26:11.970
You know, it's interesting.

01:26:11.970 --> 01:26:14.245
Torrent traffic has
actually gone down.

01:26:14.245 --> 01:26:15.870
I think that's what's
been interesting.

01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:18.180
I'd say it's actually
gone down over the years.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:21.966
I think, on the plus side,
most things are getting so easy

01:26:21.966 --> 01:26:24.090
for people to get through
something like a Netflix,

01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:25.800
or an Amazon Prime,
or whatever it

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:28.940
is, where you can
subscribe for $4 a month,

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.550
where people are
generally doing it.

01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:32.200
We have a Comcast
video TV service

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.222
we offer for free
to the students.

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.680
If you want to do IPTV, you
can just do it on your computer

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:37.319
now.

01:26:37.319 --> 01:26:39.610
But for the most part, I've
seen torrents have actually

01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:40.448
gone down.

01:26:40.448 --> 01:26:42.614
I would just be honest,
which is kind of a surprise.

01:26:44.785 --> 01:26:45.660
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:46.820
Well, let's thank Dave and Mark.

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:47.420
PROFESSOR: Thank you, guys.

01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:48.295
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

01:26:48.295 --> 01:26:49.570
[APPLAUSE]
