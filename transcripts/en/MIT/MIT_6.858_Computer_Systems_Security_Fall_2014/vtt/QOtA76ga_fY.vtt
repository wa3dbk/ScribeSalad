00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.150
PROFESSOR: So today, we're going
to talk about Kerberos, which

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.750
is a cryptographically
secure, in some ways,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.210
protocol for
authenticating computers

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.671
and applications to one
another over the network.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.670
So this is now finally
going to use cryptography

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.490
whereas last lecture,
we looked at just

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.242
using these TCP sequence
numbers to provide security.

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:47.700
So before we dive
into the details,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.825
I want to mention there's
two bits of administrivia

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:51.970
that you might want to know.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.020
There's a quiz review today
7 to 9 o'clock in some room,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.570
I think 32 or 23.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.910
It's on schedule page and
the quiz is next Wednesday.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.760
And also, we want
you guys to post

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.900
some idea for your
final project on Piazza

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.800
by tomorrow just so
that your classmates can

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.435
know what you're thinking
and help you form groups.

00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:14.560
All right, so let's talk
about Kerberos, all right?

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.580
So what is the
setting that Kerberos

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.360
is trying to support, here?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.900
So the model for
Kerberos, what these guys

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.680
had in mind when
they were designing

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.600
Athena guess 25 or
30 years ago now,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.360
is that they were
imagining they were

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.680
going to have a network
with many server machines

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.790
and many client machines
interacting with one another.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.290
So you could imagine, well, you
have a file server somewhere

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.150
out there.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.140
You probably have a mail server
connected to the network, maybe

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.130
other services-- printer.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.510
And all these are just connected
to some sort of a network

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.500
rather than being processes
on a single machine.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.497
So the prelude to
Athena and Kerberos

00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:59.580
is that you just have a
time sharing machine where

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.050
everything was a single
process and everyone would just

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.760
log into the same system
and store their files there.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.830
So these guys wanted a
more distributed system.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.360
So this meant that you'd have
these servers on one side

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.730
and you'd also have a
bunch of workstations

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.207
that users would
use themselves which

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:19.790
would run applications
and potentially

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.360
connect to these servers
and store the user's files,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.560
get their mail et cetera.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.800
And the problem that
they wanted to solve

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.520
was how to authenticate
the users that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.590
are using these workstations
to all these different servers

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.270
in the back end without
having to trust the network

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.890
to be correct, which seems
like a sensible design

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.010
requirement in many ways.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.890
And I should
mention that I guess

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.580
the alternative to
Kerberos at the time

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.187
was these R login
commands that we're

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:48.520
looking at in last lecture,
which seems like a bad plan.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.860
They just use IP addresses
to authenticate the users.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.330
And Kerberos was
reasonably successful.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.160
It actually still
is used at MIT.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.280
And actually, it's the basis
of Microsoft's Active Directory

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.780
server.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.450
So pretty much every Microsoft
based sort of Windows Server

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.921
uses Kerberos in
some form or another.

00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:07.420
But of course,
because this protocol

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.720
was designed 25 or 30 years
ago, requirements change.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.352
What people assume change.

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:16.310
People now understand
much more about security.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.050
So their version of
Kerberos that's in use today

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.770
is noticeably
different in many ways

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.860
from the version in the paper.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.520
And we'll look at exactly what
assumptions aren't good enough

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.432
anymore today and what
did they get wrong.

00:03:30.432 --> 00:03:32.390
It's sort of inevitable
for any protocol that

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.650
was the first protocol to
really use cryptography

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.460
to authenticate parties over
the network in this sort

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.810
of full system scale.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.422
Anyway, so that's the sort
of setting for Kerberos.

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:45.130
And it might be
interesting to figure out

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.379
what's the trust model, right?

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.910
So Kerberos is going to
introduce this extra Kerberos

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.450
server sitting on the side.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.040
So our third model
at some level is

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.710
that the network is
untrusted like we were

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.420
thinking about in last lecture.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.745
But who do we have to trust
in this Kerberos setting?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.650
So of course, one thing is
everyone-- all parties have

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.230
to trust the Kerberos server.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:20.199
So that's an assumption
these guys were

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.657
willing to make at the time
that this Kerberos server would

00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:24.915
be in charge of all
network authentication

00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:27.435
in some form or another.

00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:29.930
Do we have anyone else
that has to trust anything

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.670
in the setting?

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.960
For example, yeah.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.304
STUDENT: Well users should
trust their own machines.

00:04:36.304 --> 00:04:38.220
PROFESSOR: Yes, so that's
a good point, right?

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.030
There's the users that
I didn't draw here.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.780
But these guys are
using some workstation.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.150
And it's actually pretty
important in Kerberos

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.199
that the user trusts
their workstation.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.490
So what goes wrong if you
don't trust your workstation?

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.406
Or presumably, it can
just sniff your password

00:04:54.406 --> 00:04:59.405
and do whatever you type-- you
know, LS, it tries-- runs RMX.

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:01.950
That seems kind of unfortunate.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.664
Yeah.

00:05:02.664 --> 00:05:04.330
STUDENT: But it's
more than that though,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.020
because they could even, like,
sniff your Kerberos ticket.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.710
Or when you log in, you
type in your password, which

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.960
is even worse than the ticket.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.240
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.490
So this is actually a bit
of a problem with Kerberos

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.050
in the sense that if you don't
trust the workstation, then

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.050
you're in a bit of trouble.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.200
So if you have your
own laptop, this

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.030
seems like a sensible
assumption to make.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.140
If you're using a
public computer,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.485
this is a bit more questionable.

00:05:28.485 --> 00:05:30.860
And we'll see exactly
what could go wrong.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.683
Yeah.

00:05:31.683 --> 00:05:34.641
STUDENT: You have to trust the
people administrating aren't

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:37.106
doing anything bad with
[INAUDIBLE] servers

00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:39.972
and giving them privilege
access to one another.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:41.180
STUDENT: So what do you mean?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.220
So of course,
like, ISNT is going

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.010
to run these machines down here.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.300
But I think the machines
themselves don't necessarily

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.850
have to trust one another.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.010
So the mail server doesn't trust
the print server or the file

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.908
server necessarily.

00:05:54.908 --> 00:05:56.366
STUDENT: Not to
trust, but he might

00:05:56.366 --> 00:05:58.294
be able to access
a server you're not

00:05:58.294 --> 00:06:01.497
supposed to have access to by
going through another server.

00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:03.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's true, I guess.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.040
Yeah, so if you set up
any trust relationship

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.360
between these guys-- like,
if you give the mail server

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.530
some back end to go access your
files just for convenience,

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.140
then this could be abused, yeah.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.400
So you have to be careful
about not introducing

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.990
additional sort of levels of
trust or trust relations here.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.100
All right, anything
else that matters here?

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.090
Do the servers have
to trust the users

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.210
in any way or the workstations?

00:06:31.776 --> 00:06:32.900
No, I guess presumably not.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.920
So this was the whole
goal that the server

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.160
doesn't have to a priori
even know necessarily

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.320
what all these users or
how to authenticate them

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.220
or what this workstation
is doing until it can

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.100
cryptographically prove that
this is a legitimate user

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.460
and they should have access
to their data or whatnot.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.600
All right, so let's look
at how does Kerberos work

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.340
or what's the overall
architecture, at least.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.200
So the plan that
these guys had in mind

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.500
is that there would be
this Kerberos server.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.470
We have drawn it up
there but let's draw it

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.300
in a slightly bigger scale.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.540
So this is the Kerberos server.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:16.650
And today, it's typically called
KDC-- Key Distribution Center.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.430
And there's all these users
out here somewhere and also

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.840
services that you might
want to connect to.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.860
And the plan is that
the Kerberos server

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.650
is going to be responsible
for storing a shared

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.070
key between the Kerberos server
and every entity in the world,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.080
or in this realm at least.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.885
So if the user has some
sort of a key KC for client,

00:07:45.885 --> 00:07:47.260
than the Kerberos
server is going

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.720
to remember this
key somewhere here.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.680
And similarly for the
server, the key KS

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.080
is going to be known
to the service itself

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.300
and to the Kerberos server
but hopefully no one else.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.020
So you can think of it as like
a generalization of passwords,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.520
right?

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.440
So you know a password
and the Kerberos server

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.940
knows your password
but no one else.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.790
And this is how you guys are
going to prove to each other,

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.130
yeah, I'm the right guy.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.000
I know this password
and no one else does.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.150
Makes sense?

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.982
And the other thing the Kerberos
server is going to have to do

00:08:17.982 --> 00:08:20.070
is, of course, keep
track of who is

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.370
it that owns this key, right?

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.080
So it's going to have this table
mapping some sort of a name.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.080
So this is some sort of a user.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:35.630
This is maybe service maybe
AFS or something like this.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.530
And the KDC is responsible for
storing the gigantic table--

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.659
well, not very large in
terms of the number of bytes,

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.640
necessarily, but
one entry per entity

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.310
at MIT that the Kerberos
server knows about.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.510
Makes sense?

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.634
All right, and then we're
going to have sort of provide

00:08:56.634 --> 00:08:57.550
two interfaces, right?

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.200
The paper is a little
fuzzy above this

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.200
or it pretends like there's
really two services.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.260
But really, what's going on
is that there's two interfaces

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.660
to the same machine.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.560
One of them is called Kerberos
in the paper and one of them

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.460
is called TGS for
Ticket Granting Service.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.980
And really, these
are just two ways

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.130
of talking to the same
thing in the back end.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.340
And the protocol is a little
different for these things.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.570
So initially, when
the user logs in,

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.680
they're going to talk
to this guy over here.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.110
And they're going to
send their client name,

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.160
C. So this might be
your Athena username.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.810
And the server is
going to respond

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:43.804
to back with a ticket,
a TGS or-- well,

00:09:43.804 --> 00:09:44.720
some sort of a ticket.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.540
We'll look at the
details in a bit.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:51.130
And then when you want to
talk to some server down here,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.040
KS, then you're going to
talk to this TGS first

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.530
and say, oh, hey,
I already logged in

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.560
through the Kerberos interface.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.770
Now, I want to talk
to the server S.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.560
So you'd tell the TGS about
the server you want to talk to.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.330
And then it returns you
back some sort of a ticket

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.780
for talking to the server
S. And then you can finally

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.600
start talking to
the server over here

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.230
by initially passing
it this ticket for S.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.902
Does this all make sense?

00:10:23.902 --> 00:10:27.270
This is the sort
of high level plan.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.335
So why do these guys
have two interfaces?

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:34.550
Well, I guess I
wanted to actually ask

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.425
a bunch of questions.

00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:38.080
Like, in the case of a
service, this service

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.770
is probably going to
be stored on disk.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.330
What's going on with
this KC on the user side?

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.240
Where does KC come
from in Kerberos?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.574
Yeah.

00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:50.740
STUDENT: KDMS
[INAUDIBLE] the database.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.736
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well,
the key C sits here.

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:53.860
And that's absolutely true.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.420
It's sits on this
giant database.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.280
But it also has to
be known to the user

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.610
because the user has to
prove that they are the user.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.326
Yeah.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.030
STUDENT: Is that a one way
function and then the password?

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.405
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so they actually

00:11:03.405 --> 00:11:05.930
have this sort of cute plan
where the KC is actually

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.100
going to be derived by
hashing the user's password

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.320
or really some sort of
key duration function.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.444
And there's several different
ones of perverse uses.

00:11:14.444 --> 00:11:16.360
But you're basically
going to take a password,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.676
transform it in some
way, and get this key KC.

00:11:20.676 --> 00:11:25.180
All right, so that seems good.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.010
Why do we need two
protocols, right?

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:32.020
You could imagine that you just
always ask the Kerberos server

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.292
for tickets directly this way.

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:34.750
You say, well, hey,
I want a ticket

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.730
for this particular
principle name.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.070
And it'll send you back a
ticket and you can decrypt it

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.440
with your KC afterwards.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:41.940
Yeah.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.861
STUDENT: Can you
[INAUDIBLE] or ask the user

00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:46.527
to reenter their
password each time they

00:11:46.527 --> 00:11:47.740
want to [INAUDIBLE] service?

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.823
PROFESSOR: Right, so the
reason for the difference

00:11:49.823 --> 00:11:52.440
between these two interfaces
is that on this interface,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.170
all the responses come back
encrypted with your key KC.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.500
And the Kerberos designers
are a little worried

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.070
about keeping this KC
around for a long time.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.260
Because either you have to
ask the user to enter it,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.730
which is just
annoying for the user,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.330
or it sits around in memory.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.400
And this is basically as
good as the user's password.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.730
So if this gets disclosed,
then someone with access to KC

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.675
can keep accessing the user's
files until the user maybe

00:12:20.675 --> 00:12:22.800
changes their password and
potentially even longer.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.300
We'll see about that.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.570
So this KC is a really
dangerous thing to leak.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.580
So the whole point of using
this interface first and using

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.270
this interface later for
all subsequent requests

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.790
is that you can
actually forget KC

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:40.430
as soon as you decrypt this
TGS response from the Kerberos

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.980
interface.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.600
And from that point on,
even if you leak it,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.994
there is a lifetime
associated with this ticket.

00:12:46.994 --> 00:12:48.410
So worst case,
someone gets access

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.160
to your account for
a couple of hours,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.359
not for an unbounded
amount of time.

00:12:53.359 --> 00:12:54.900
So that's the sort
of main difference

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.020
why you guys have this slightly
more complicated picture

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.190
with two ways of
accessing the same thing.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.360
All right, so before we dive
into the mechanics of how

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.900
these protocols actually
look like on the wire,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.060
let's talk a little bit about
this naming aspect in Kerberos,

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.560
right?

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.100
So at some level, you
could think of Kerberos

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.530
as being a name registry, right?

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.680
So it's really
responsible for mapping

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.090
these cryptographic
keys onto string names.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.459
And this is the fundamental
sort of operation

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:28.750
that Kerberos needs to provide.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.467
In fact, you'll see in the
next lecture even on the web,

00:13:31.467 --> 00:13:32.800
we need some function like this.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.550
It's implemented
differently from Kerberos

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.570
but this is a fundamentally
very important thing

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.060
to have in almost any
distributed system

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.510
for security.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.080
So let's look at how Kerberos
actually deals with names.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.440
So in Kerberos,
the sort of system

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.560
calls every entity in
this database a principal

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.920
And a principal in Kerberos is
actually just a string, right?

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.780
So you can actually have some
principal like, I don't know,

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.885
nickolei.

00:14:00.885 --> 00:14:01.720
So that's a string.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.170
And that could be a principal
in some Kerberos realm.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.850
So it would literally
be the thing

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:12.000
that sits in this left
column of the KDC's table.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.007
And there's also
some extra instances

00:14:16.007 --> 00:14:17.090
that the protocl supports.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.200
I could say, you know,
nikolai.extra secure

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.740
or something.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.930
And I might use this
as a different entity

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.960
for machines I
really care about.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.810
So maybe I will have
a different password

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.940
for really secure things
and a different password

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.120
for my regular account.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.110
So this is just sort
of how Kerberos--

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.690
this is what the paper
talks about with instances.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.190
So one might actually
wonder-- where

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.440
do you actually see instances?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.440
Where do influences come from?

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.930
So the Kerberos service
maps names to keys for you,

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.940
but how do you know
which name to ask for

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.600
or which name to expect when
you are talking to some machine?

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.720
So I guess what I'm asking is,
what are names appear outside

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.050
of the Kerberos machine.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.256
So I guess we could ask, OK,
where do user names appear?

00:15:06.256 --> 00:15:07.701
Any ideas?

00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:08.200
Yeah.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.525
STUDENT: You can ask the
MIT server for usernames

00:15:10.525 --> 00:15:11.812
presumably.

00:15:11.812 --> 00:15:12.770
PROFESSOR: Right, yeah.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.900
So you could enumerate
these things.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.350
Also, the users just
type them in when

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.349
they log into a machine.

00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:18.480
So that's where it
initially comes from.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.020
Do usernames appear
anywhere else?

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.652
Should they appear
anywhere else?

00:15:23.652 --> 00:15:24.152
Yeah.

00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:26.084
STUDENT: Possibly
access the [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:26.084 --> 00:15:27.494
lists on the various services.

00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:29.910
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's actually
an important point, right?

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.850
The goal of Kerberos is
just to map keys to names.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.440
But it doesn't tell you what
that name should have access

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.020
to.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.950
In fact, the way the
applications typically

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.900
use Kerberos is that
one of these servers

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.730
uses Kerberos to figure out,
OK, what string name am I

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:46.290
talking to?

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.290
So when the mail server
gets a connection

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.920
from some workstation and it
get the Kerberos ticket that

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.220
prove that maybe this
user is called Nikolai,

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.110
then the mail server
internally now

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.630
has to figure out,
OK, well, what

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.280
should that guy have access to?

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.960
And same for a file server.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.150
So inside of all
these servers, there's

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:07.900
probably things like access
control lists, maybe groups,

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.770
maybe other things that actually
do the authorization step.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.770
So Kerberos provides
authentication

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.690
which tells you who is
this person I'm talking to.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.580
And the service itself is
responsible for implementing

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.870
the authorization part where
they decide what access

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.180
you should have based
on your username here.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.440
Makes sense?

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.500
All right, so that's where
the user names appear.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.100
There's also other
principal names

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.400
the Kerberos supports
for services, right?

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.890
So services, I guess
the paper suggests,

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.380
look something like this.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.270
That's rcmd.hostname.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:53.589
And the reason that you need a
name for one of these services

00:16:53.589 --> 00:16:55.380
is that you want to
know, for example, when

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.980
I connect to a file
server, I actually

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.500
want mutual authentication.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.160
It's not just the final
server learns who I am,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.288
but I, the user or
the workstation,

00:17:06.288 --> 00:17:08.579
want to be convinced that
I'm talking to the right file

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.599
server and not some
fake file server that's

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.880
impersonating my files.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.109
Because maybe I'll
look at the grades

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:15.690
file and submit it
to the registrar.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.964
It would be too bad
if some file server

00:17:17.964 --> 00:17:21.319
can impersonate the response and
give me the wrong grades file

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.020
all of a sudden.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.500
So this is why the
service principles also

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.770
need their own name and the
workstations need to figure out

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.120
what name should I expect to see
when I connect to the service.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.500
And typically, this comes
from the user at some level.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.010
So for example, if I type
SSH some machine foo,

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.150
then this means that
I should be expecting

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.100
a Kerberos principal
called rcmd.foo

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.000
on the other end
of this connection.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.210
And if it turns out
to be someone else,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.240
this SSH client
should abort and not

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.040
let me connect because then
I will be misled into talking

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.936
to some other machine.

00:17:57.936 --> 00:18:00.392
That make sense?

00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:01.850
So here's one
interesting question.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.365
When can we reuse
names in Kerberos?

00:18:04.365 --> 00:18:06.940
It's like, all of you
guys have Athena accounts.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.960
And when you
graduate, could MIT,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.480
like, wipe out
your database entry

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.130
and allow someone else to
register that same username?

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.600
Would that be a good idea?

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.290
Well, aside from the fact
that you guys want accounts.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:19.790
Yeah.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.205
STUDENT: Updated services
as well so that they would,

00:18:23.205 --> 00:18:25.593
like map that username
to [INAUDIBLE] permission

00:18:25.593 --> 00:18:26.176
theoretically?

00:18:26.176 --> 00:18:28.470
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
these guys are actually

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.580
just string entries somewhere
in some ACL on a file

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.950
server on a mail server.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:37.340
And just because you wipe out
this entry in the Kerberos

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.075
database doesn't mean
that this entry is gone.

00:18:40.075 --> 00:18:41.950
And they're not versioning
in any way, right?

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.658
This entry could
literally say, you know,

00:18:43.658 --> 00:18:47.270
Alice has access to
some Athena locker.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.999
And if this Alice graduates
and her entry gets removed,

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:52.790
then some new Alice
comes along, registers,

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.770
in the Kerberos database.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.570
But she gets a
principal that looks

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.895
identical to the old Alice.

00:18:57.895 --> 00:18:58.770
It's the same string.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.370
So all of a sudden,
the file server

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.740
will give access to the new
Alice to old Alice's data.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.620
So there's a bit of
a complicated process

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.650
for reclaiming principal
names in Kerberos

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.160
because there's
no real connection

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.869
or versioning
between these guys.

00:19:12.869 --> 00:19:14.410
So as a result, it's
actually kind of

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.749
hard to reuse principal names.

00:19:16.749 --> 00:19:18.540
Once you register a
principal, you probably

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.160
don't want to reuse
it very often.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.930
And same for, in some
sense, these principal names

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.020
for service as well.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.910
As long as this hostname
remain some well-known service

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.040
that people expect to
function in a certain way,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.920
you probably don't want
to get rid of its key

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.940
even if the service goes on.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.398
Because maybe a year later,
some guy tries to connect to it

00:19:38.398 --> 00:19:39.581
and expects certain things.

00:19:39.581 --> 00:19:41.580
And if it's been reused
for a different service,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.130
that guy can impersonate things.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.620
Probably not as dramatic
or as bad, but still,

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.420
you have to be careful with
reusing principal names

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.910
in this kind of protocol.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:53.940
Makes sense?

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.140
Any questions?

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.590
All right, so let's look at how
the protocol itself now works.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.780
So we'll look first and
this step of the protocol

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.160
where you initially get your
ticket with your password.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.170
And then we'll look at how
this TGS interface works

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.660
and how it differs
then a little bit.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.280
All right, so I guess
there's this main data

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.790
structure that Kerberos
uses called a ticket.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.660
And this ticket looks like this.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.270
So there's a ticket to
between a client and a server.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.510
And this guy is
basically the names

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.550
of the server and
the client that we're

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:36.190
talking about-- the IP
address of the client,

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:43.050
some kind of timestamp, and an
expiration time for how long

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.260
the stick is valid.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.400
And there's also
a key, KCS, that's

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.860
going to be shared between
the client and the server.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.790
So that's what's in a ticket.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.610
And there's also this
other weird data structure

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.380
that Kerberos introduces
called an authenticator.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.590
And an authenticator goes
with a particular client C.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.530
And this thing is just
the client's name,

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:11.640
the IP address of the
client, and the time stamp

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.210
when the client generated
this authenticator.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.270
And typically, both of
these things are encrypted.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.520
And authenticator is
typically scripted

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.760
with the key between the
client on the server.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.670
So the authenticator
sort of has to do

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.110
with a particular connection
between a client and a server.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.550
And the Kerberos
ticket itself here

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:38.140
is typically encrypted with
the key for the service KS.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.010
So the subscript
notation denotes here

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:45.050
encryption with
a particular key.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.470
All right, so what does this--
so using this sort of notation

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.670
here, let's try to figure
out what is the protocol.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.650
By which the user initially
logs into this Kerberos

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.010
and gets their TGS ticket.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.240
So as we saw here
before, right, the plan

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:06.030
is the client is going to
send their username over

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:10.130
to the Kerberos server
or that interface.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.140
And the response is
going to be a ticket.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.760
And what precisely
the client actually

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.710
sends over-- both the username
C of the client that's

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:22.150
issuing the request as well
as the principal name-- well,

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.760
the client is also
a principal name.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.840
But the client also
sends the principal name

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.720
of the service for which it
would like to get a ticket.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.880
And typically, the service name
is actually the service name

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.700
of this TGS guy over here.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.150
So you get a ticket for them.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.191
But you could get a ticket
for almost any service

00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:39.700
you want in this way.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.430
And their response
is going to be

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.380
this sort of interesting tuple.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.030
It's going to be your
ticket between the client

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.930
and the server encrypted
just with that key KS

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.560
as shown above.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.170
I guess we should
write that down with KS

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:01.140
And also, you get to
this shared key-- key CS.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.180
And this whole thing
is encrypted with KC.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.690
So that's the wire protocol.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.190
So I guess let's try to
figure out a couple things.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:17.770
So first of all, how
does the Kerberos server

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.020
authenticate the client here?

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.910
How does it know that this
is the right user making

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:21.451
this request?

00:23:24.395 --> 00:23:24.895
Yeah.

00:23:24.895 --> 00:23:27.128
STUDENT: It can make
sure that the ticket

00:23:27.128 --> 00:23:29.100
that it sent because it has KC.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.020
PROFESSOR: Yes, I think
that's what's going on

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.960
is that the Kerberos server
again on some level actually

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.540
doesn't know whether this
is the right client or not.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.500
But it thinks oh, well,
sure, it doesn't matter

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.930
who is making this request.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.780
I'll just send this blob
out and the only person

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.010
who should be able to
make any use of this blob

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:48.170
is the person that knows
this key KC over here.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.432
So that's actually kind
of cool because the client

00:23:50.432 --> 00:23:51.890
doesn't have to
send their password

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.790
over the network at all.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.650
So in some ways, this is
actually better than the client

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.800
sending a password to
the Kerberos server

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.710
because even if the
Kerberos server here

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.960
was listening for
these passwords

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.710
and trying to record them, it
would never get your password.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.900
Or maybe if someone was
impersonating the Kerberos

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.000
server, they wouldn't get
a copy of your password.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.090
All right, yeah.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.380
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
adversary wants to [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.200
your password offline without--

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this is
actually not a great aspect

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.322
of Kerberos, in fact, right?

00:24:24.322 --> 00:24:26.030
So does everyone see
what the problem is?

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.430
The problem is that the
way the client could

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.180
tell if they got the
right password or not

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.520
or the workstation tells
if the client supplied

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.320
the right password is they
try to decrypt this ticket

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.760
and they see if it works or not.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.080
And decryption is fairly cheap.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.700
This is symmetric
encryption and you

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.060
can do probably
millions of decryptions

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.460
a second if you try
hard on modern machines.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.300
And this means that
you can try millions

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.020
of potential
passwords per second

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.497
to guess what the
person's password is.

00:24:56.497 --> 00:24:58.330
And you could do this
for any person at all.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.372
You could just send
their principal

00:25:00.372 --> 00:25:01.330
to the Kerberos server.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.999
It'll very happily give you
back this response encrypted

00:25:03.999 --> 00:25:05.040
with the user's password.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.590
Then you can just try different
passwords and just see what

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.740
works or what doesn't.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.798
Yeah.

00:25:09.798 --> 00:25:12.786
STUDENT: But won't the
content [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:12.786 --> 00:25:14.778
decrypted [INAUDIBLE] advantage?

00:25:14.778 --> 00:25:16.752
How can we be sure
that you directly--

00:25:16.752 --> 00:25:19.210
PROFESSOR: Yes, this is actually
another interesting aspect

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.360
where the Kerberos 4
developers didn't quite

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.300
realize that the time they were
building this that they really

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.270
should have been very careful
about separating encryption

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.110
from authentication.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.150
So in the paper, there's
this implicit assumption

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:37.442
that-- hopefully, that's not us.

00:25:37.442 --> 00:25:38.150
All right, sorry.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.191
So in the paper, there's
this implicit assumption

00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:43.220
that whenever you
encrypt a piece of data

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.210
and you send it to someone
else, if that person can decrypt

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.350
the data and it
sort of looks OK,

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.210
then no, they must have
gotten the right key

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.520
and the data wasn't
tampered with in flight.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.430
But it seems like a
totally bad plan now

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.590
that we think of
it 30 years later.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.230
But at the time,
it wasn't so clear.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.610
So in order to do
Kerberos right,

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.730
and in fact, what
Kerberos 5 does now,

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.277
is they both encrypt
all the pieces of data

00:26:04.277 --> 00:26:05.860
and they also
authenticate the message

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.350
by basically computing
a hash with a key.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.320
And then the result
actually tells you

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.960
that, oh, that piece of data
just wasn't tampered with.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.389
It was correctly signed
with this key, et cetera.

00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:17.930
And what actually
happens in Kerberos

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.030
version 4 is there
are some extra bits

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.110
in this thing that was
encrypted that should all

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.350
be some pattern like zeros.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.150
And typically, if you
get the key wrong,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.510
that pattern will not look
like all zeros just by chance.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.210
It's not cryptographically
guaranteed to be that.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.690
But most times, it will
not look like zeros

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.030
and you will be able to decide
whether you got the correct key

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.490
or not.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.400
All right, so that's
sort of the plan

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.744
for how the clients
tells, I guess,

00:26:47.744 --> 00:26:48.910
whether the ticket is valid.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.384
They just try to decrypt
it and see how it works.

00:26:52.384 --> 00:26:53.800
So another interesting
question is

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.214
why is this key
KCS included twice

00:26:57.214 --> 00:26:58.630
in the ticket in
some form, right?

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:02.520
So it's included once here
and another time actually sort

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.060
of implicitly in
this ticket T. Why

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.274
do we have two copies
of the same key KCS?

00:27:10.274 --> 00:27:10.774
Yeah.

00:27:10.774 --> 00:27:12.658
STUDENT: The client
can't decrypt that ticket

00:27:12.658 --> 00:27:14.681
because it's encrypted
with a service key.

00:27:14.681 --> 00:27:16.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so it's
actually kind of cute, right?

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.067
Like, there's this key
that the client can get to.

00:27:19.067 --> 00:27:20.900
But then there's another
copy of it in here.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.300
It's encrypted with KS.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.400
And the reason for this is that
the Kerberos server is actually

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.670
trying to set up the
client and this other guy

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.350
to talk to each other securely.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.650
So the Kerberos generates
this hopefully random key KCS

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.180
and wants to give one copy
to the client and one copy

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.640
to the write other server
that you want to talk to.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.840
And one thing you could
imagine doing naively

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.600
is maybe the Kerberos will
just go and say, hey service,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.850
this guy wants to talk to you.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:47.767
Here's the key for it.

00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:49.349
But that would be
kind of unfortunate.

00:27:49.349 --> 00:27:52.380
You'd have to have the Kerberos
server call back to the service

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.380
and so on.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.610
So instead, these guys have
this nice trick where they just

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:58.899
to give the client does
blob that the client

00:27:58.899 --> 00:28:00.440
can't actually do
anything with other

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.290
than give to the right service.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.470
And if the service
has the right key KS,

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.260
they'll decrypt it and say, aha.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:10.420
Well, here's the key I should be
using to speak to this client.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.970
And that's how these two guys,
the client and the service,

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.320
are going to establish a
shared key for protecting

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.200
their communication.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:17.700
Yeah.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.670
STUDENT: So what exactly is TGS?

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:24.160
PROFESSOR: So TGS
is-- OK, so there's

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.820
sort of two sides to it.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.620
From the client's point of
view, it's just another service

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.290
that you can get a ticket for.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.540
And the kinds of
operations it supports

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.690
is getting more tickets.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.010
It's a Ticket Granting Service.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.310
STUDENT: Sorry, I meant what
is the ticket called TGS.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.520
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.760
This TGS is just shorthand
for this whole blob

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.565
except where S is actually
the principal name of this TGS

00:28:45.565 --> 00:28:46.065
service.

00:28:48.527 --> 00:28:50.860
So you can think of it as
like, well, there's a Kerberos

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.770
server, there's this
TGS service out there,

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.230
and then there's the real
thing I want to get to.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.170
So you first ask
this guy to give me

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.950
a ticket for some service.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.530
You could ask it to give you
directly a ticket for the file

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:01.550
server.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.400
And this would work.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.040
But you'd need your
KC to decrypt it

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.044
and then you'd need your
KC around all the time.

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:07.460
So instead, what
you do is you get

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.595
a ticket for this special
service over here.

00:29:10.595 --> 00:29:12.720
It looks just like a service
except that it happens

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.630
to be provided by the same box.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.310
And then this guy will
happily give you more tickets

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:23.210
later without having to
present your initial KC again.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:24.143
Makes sense?

00:29:24.143 --> 00:29:26.830
All right, other questions?

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:27.662
Yeah.

00:29:27.662 --> 00:29:32.482
STUDENT: So [INAUDIBLE] the idea
is once you get the TGS ticket,

00:29:32.482 --> 00:29:33.940
you can just get rid of your KC?

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.840
PROFESSOR: Yes,
so that's actually

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.660
the cool thing about
it is that once

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.250
you get this ticket-- well, this
ticket with the S being TGS,

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.450
then you're going to get
rid of the password and KC.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.836
So you log into Athena
workstation and a couple

00:29:46.836 --> 00:29:48.210
of seconds into
the boot process,

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.584
you already get
your ticket here.

00:29:49.584 --> 00:29:51.280
It scrubs the
password from memory.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.240
So even if someone, like,
grabs you and grab the machine

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.870
and runs off, all they
got was your ticket.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.830
And OK, well, maybe they can
access your stuff for 10 hours

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.410
or whatever the
ticket lifetime was,

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:02.760
but not for longer than that.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.580
The password is gone.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.080
Yeah.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.912
So if the password's
gone, then on that picture

00:30:08.912 --> 00:30:11.000
there when Kerberos
sends a reply

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.220
encrypted with KC,
how does the client--

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.680
Oh yeah, so this is the one
place you need your password.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.650
So you send this message,
you get this reply,

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.603
you decrypt this, and then
you forget the password.

00:30:22.603 --> 00:30:24.186
So you can't forget
about the password

00:30:24.186 --> 00:30:26.220
before you use it for
decryption of course.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.150
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.590
PROFESSOR: Ah, no, so this is
just this interface, right?

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:33.470
So this is the thing
you do initially.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.220
And we'll talk in a second
about how you basically also

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.840
can get any ticket you want
from the second interface

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:43.924
without needing
the initial key KC.

00:30:43.924 --> 00:30:46.760
Right, make sense?

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.530
All right, so I guess
we already talked

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.920
about two particular problems
that the Kerberos protocol had

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.830
sort of baked into it, which
is a little unfortunate.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.520
One is that they assumed
that encryption also

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.440
provides authentication
or integrity of messages.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.270
So don't do that.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.040
And Kerberos
version 5 fixes this

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.770
by explicitly
authenticating messages.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.940
Another thing they sort
of had a problem with

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.820
is the ability for
arbitrary clients

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.220
to guess people's passwords.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.102
So any suggestions of
how we could fix this?

00:31:21.102 --> 00:31:22.560
How do you prevent
guessing attacks

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.826
in a protocol like this?

00:31:24.826 --> 00:31:26.242
What could we try?

00:31:26.242 --> 00:31:26.775
Yeah.

00:31:26.775 --> 00:31:28.024
STUDENT: Some sort of salting?

00:31:28.024 --> 00:31:29.400
I'm not sure.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.540
PROFESSOR: Well, so
salting would just

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.900
means that the client
has to hash the password

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.066
in different ways, maybe.

00:31:35.066 --> 00:31:36.440
But it still
doesn't prevent them

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.659
from trying lots of things.

00:31:37.659 --> 00:31:39.950
So maybe it'll be more
expensive to build a dictionary.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.449
Yeah.

00:31:40.449 --> 00:31:43.109
STUDENT: You could [INAUDIBLE]
derivation function?

00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:44.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
another good idea

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.949
is to make this hashing
process super expensive.

00:31:47.949 --> 00:31:49.490
So that might be
kind of nice, right?

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.650
So if this hash function took
a second to compute like you

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.404
guys did in lab two,
then OK, wow, this

00:31:54.404 --> 00:31:55.820
would be actually
really expensive

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.810
to try different passwords.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.351
So that seems like
a reasonable plan.

00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:00.500
So in combination
with salting, those

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.880
would be make it pretty
expensive to do password

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.987
guessing attacks.

00:32:03.987 --> 00:32:04.570
Anything else?

00:32:07.035 --> 00:32:08.910
So another thing is,
yeah, challenge respond.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.620
So you could actually hear
in the initial protocol,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.790
the Kerberos server
doesn't have any idea

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.720
if this was the
right client or not.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.202
But in fact, what
you could do is maybe

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:20.160
give a little bit of a
proof that, well, you're

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.010
probably the right client.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.980
So maybe you could encrypt
the current time stamp

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.890
with your hash
password or something

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.455
like this-- has them together.

00:32:29.455 --> 00:32:31.080
And then the Kerberos
server could just

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.250
check if that's the right-- if
that matches, and if so, return

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:35.330
you back a ticket.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.580
You probably don't want to
necessarily add more rounds

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.450
but this could work.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.760
So just to precise about
what I'm sort of suggesting.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.460
OK, well, maybe you take
the current time stamp

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:51.550
and maybe you hash the current
time stamp and the KC together.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.570
And maybe you include
the timestamp as well.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.957
And then the server could
see, well, it has your KC.

00:32:55.957 --> 00:32:57.790
It could hash the current
timestamp as well.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.490
If it gets the same
value, then yeah,

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.281
it's probably the right
user requesting it.

00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:02.870
And I can send back the ticket.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.420
If not, then it wasn't
the right password at all.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:06.970
Question?

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:13.041
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] you just do
[INAUDIBLE] if the servers see

00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:14.545
too many requests [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:14.545 --> 00:33:15.545
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:33:15.545 --> 00:33:17.570
So the problem is that
we could write limit.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.070
But there's no
reason for the hacker

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.120
to request this more than once.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.980
That hacker requests a
particular user more than once

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.240
and then it gets
this encrypted blob.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.980
And then it can try decrypting
it offline as many times

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.000
as it wants with
different passwords

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.080
without having to re request it.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.950
So I think the whole
point of including

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.840
some sort of a
challenge response thing

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.057
like this in the particle
is so that the server will--

00:33:41.057 --> 00:33:42.890
you'll have to actually
ask the server again

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.809
and again to try to log in
with different passwords.

00:33:46.809 --> 00:33:48.600
And then you could rate
limit of the server

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.700
and get a much better defense.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.640
Yeah.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.930
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] Kerberos?

00:33:54.930 --> 00:34:00.210
PROFESSOR: So I think you could
certainly replay this message

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.330
so if I sent this message
now, you could probably

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.420
look at that message
and send it as well

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.535
and get a response back
from the Kerberos server.

00:34:07.535 --> 00:34:09.159
I guess if you're
watching the network,

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:12.429
you could observe this
thing on the wire as well.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:16.780
So I think this is sort of a bit
of a stopgap measure-- improves

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.420
security a bit.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:21.002
But certainly if you're
watching someone else's network,

00:34:21.002 --> 00:34:23.460
then you're going to see this
packet coming back regardless

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.546
of what happened in this step.

00:34:25.546 --> 00:34:27.004
So coming back,
you'll see this guy

00:34:27.004 --> 00:34:28.817
and you can then
try to attack it.

00:34:28.817 --> 00:34:30.650
There's probably some
more elaborate schemes

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.500
you could design
but I didn't think

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.469
Kerberos 5 even
implements anything more

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:37.590
elaborate than roughly this
plan, which seems good enough

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.460
to prevent arbitrary
people from trying

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.130
to break anyone's or brute
force anyone's password.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:44.326
Make sense?

00:34:44.326 --> 00:34:44.826
Yeah.

00:34:44.826 --> 00:34:46.513
STUDENT: So presume
that you could

00:34:46.513 --> 00:34:50.528
do authenticated [INAUDIBLE]
or something here

00:34:50.528 --> 00:34:51.694
to establish the shared key.

00:34:51.694 --> 00:34:53.235
And then you could
encrypt this thing

00:34:53.235 --> 00:34:54.474
with KC and the shared key.

00:34:54.474 --> 00:34:55.300
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.841
So if you're really
doing this right,

00:34:56.841 --> 00:34:59.630
there's all these nice
particles out there

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.080
that are basically called
password authenticated key

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.170
exchange particles, which is
exactly what's going on here.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:05.836
So if you're actually
building a system,

00:35:05.836 --> 00:35:08.800
you should basically
Google for SRP or PAKE.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.680
And these protocols
and related particles

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.480
will actually do this in
a much better way where

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.760
you can prove to both
parties that you established

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.850
a new key and both parties
are convinced that it's

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.610
the right other party
and there's no way

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:26.240
to mount these offline
password guessing attacks

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.682
on the set of network packets
that you observe and so on.

00:35:29.682 --> 00:35:31.140
So these are the
sort of protocols.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.220
And they're much more
elaborate in terms

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.310
of crypto they rely on.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.690
So it's hard to explain on a
board exactly why they work.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:37.190
Yeah.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.050
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
part of the reason

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.938
they did it this
way is because they

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:44.714
wanted to maintain the ability
of just sending the password.

00:35:44.714 --> 00:35:48.365
And protocols just allow
you to send a single thing

00:35:48.365 --> 00:35:50.840
as your authentication
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.820
PROFESSOR: Well,
yeah, there's lots

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.950
of sort of weird requirements
that these guys had in mind.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:01.540
I think they-- well,
certainly in practice,

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.340
these servers could accept
both Kerberos and non Kerberos

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:06.866
connections.

00:36:06.866 --> 00:36:08.240
And for non Kerberos
connections,

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.030
you get-- like someone
connects to the mail server

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.520
but they're not using
an Athena workstation.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.180
They just want to
send their password.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.889
And then the mail
client here, let's say,

00:36:14.889 --> 00:36:16.430
is going to take
your password and is

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.770
going to get a ticket on
your behalf just to check it.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:19.990
And then it's going to
allow you to use it.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.531
So you certainly want conversion
from Kerberos from passwords

00:36:22.531 --> 00:36:25.119
into checking against Kerberos.

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:27.160
I don't think this precludes
it because certainly

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.833
Kerberos 5 deploys although
this hashes of timestamps,

00:36:30.833 --> 00:36:31.332
et cetera.

00:36:31.332 --> 00:36:33.165
STUDENT: Yeah but it's
because they wouldn't

00:36:33.165 --> 00:36:35.028
want multiple [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:35.028 --> 00:36:37.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well,
I think that probably

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.967
doesn't matter quite as much.

00:36:38.967 --> 00:36:41.300
You could certainly have
multiple rounds in the back end

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.380
behind your library.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.670
But there's some downsides
to these particles--

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:50.180
probably not significant enough
to stop you from using them.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.040
Other questions?

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.880
All right, I guess
the other thing

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.040
I want to mention that
you should watch out

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.080
for in the paper is that these
guys, in designing Kerberos 4,

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.550
they picked a single
encryption scheme.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.740
And at the time,
they basically picked

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.260
DES, which was a popular
encryption scheme of the time.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.590
It's a symmetric block cypher.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:12.820
It goes pretty fast.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.090
It was reasonably secure,
not necessarily the best,

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.392
but certainly good
enough at the time.

00:37:18.392 --> 00:37:20.100
And they just baked
it into the protocol.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.880
Everything in Kerberos has
to use single DES or at least

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.890
everything in
Kerberos version 4.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:27.935
And this was a bit problematic
because 25 years later,

00:37:27.935 --> 00:37:29.310
30 years later
now, it's actually

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.820
very cheap to brute
force DES encryption

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.690
because the keys are
actually very small.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.570
They're 56 bits.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.140
So you could just search build
some custom hardware that

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.090
iterates over all the possible
2 to the 56 combinations

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:46.379
and tries them all and figures
out what someone's password is.

00:37:46.379 --> 00:37:48.170
So this is something
also you want to avoid

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:49.710
in any protocol you design now.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.550
Kerberos version 5
actually supports

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:54.730
multiple different
encryption schemes including

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.885
AES and other things as well.

00:37:56.885 --> 00:37:59.350
So that seems like a
much better way to do it.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.320
On the other hand, MIT
actually kept supporting DES up

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.540
until two years ago, which
is a little unfortunate.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.560
But now they don't.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.530
So that's good.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:12.860
Your principal is secure at
least from this kind of attack.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.680
All right, so does
that make sense?

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.350
This is the initial
way you'd get

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.210
any ticket at all in Kerberos.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.810
And typically, you'd get this
ticket from this TGS service.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.090
So now let's look at what's
going on in this TGS service.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.700
So here, the interaction
with the TGS service

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.350
is going to be a
little different.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:32.150
On one hand, you're
going to-- as a client,

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.900
you're going to have
to speak to it as

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.910
if you're speaking to any
other Kerberos enabled service.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.660
So we'll see how you
authenticate yourself

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.714
with a ticket to some machine.

00:38:41.714 --> 00:38:43.630
But then the response
you're going to get back

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.071
is just a ticket for
some other principle

00:38:46.071 --> 00:38:48.570
that you're going to want to
communicate with like your file

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:50.230
server.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.210
So the protocol level messages
that show up here kind of

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:54.910
look like this.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.050
So here's your TGS service.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.230
And here's a client.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:02.750
The client already
got a ticket for TGS

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:04.090
using this protocol above.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.580
So what the client is
actually going to send over

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.190
is some combination
of messages that

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.690
prove that this is
the right client

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:16.900
and they're issuing a request
for some particular principle

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.490
through TGS.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.414
So what the client is going
to send to TGS is this tuple.

00:39:20.414 --> 00:39:21.830
So first, it's
going to say, well,

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.000
here's the service that
I want to talk to next.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.130
So this might be your mail
server or your file server.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.440
Then is going to
include the ticket.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.970
It already got 4TGS.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:38.100
So this is going to be TC
of TGS encrypted with KTGS.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.430
So this is just this
thing where S is TGS.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.890
And then you're going to have
to include this authenticator

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:44.890
blob.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:48.155
This is this AC
thing from up there.

00:39:48.155 --> 00:39:49.780
And this thing is
going to be encrypted

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:54.892
with a shared key between the
client and the TGS service.

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:58.360
So this is the message that
you're going to send to TGS.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.399
It's going to look
at this message,

00:40:00.399 --> 00:40:02.690
do something with it that
we'll talk about in a second,

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:07.770
and respond back with a
ticket for this new service S.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.700
So the response here looks
almost exactly like here.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.490
In fact, it is exactly
the same thing.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.610
It's going to be a
ticket between the client

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:18.310
and this new service
S encrypted with KS

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.320
and the shared key between the
client and this new service

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.040
S encrypted-- well, now,
here's a little bit different.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.550
Instead of encrypting with KC,
which the client has probably

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.280
forgotten since
then, now we're going

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.800
to encrypt it with this
shared key between the client

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.510
and the TGS service.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:38.030
Makes sense?

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:44.850
All right, so in this-- how does
the server actually figure out

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:46.590
what the client wants to do?

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:49.120
Or, how does server
authenticate the client?

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.650
Well, in this case, it's
going to-- TGS server actually

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.840
knows its own key, KTGS.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.390
So it's going to first
decrypt this blob

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.090
and look inside the ticket and
figure out what's going on.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:03.190
And there's all those
nice fields in the ticket.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.400
So let's just double check.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.100
Why do we need all those
fields in the ticket?

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:12.687
So is it important to have the
server name S in the ticket?

00:41:12.687 --> 00:41:14.770
What would go wrong if you
didn't have S in there?

00:41:17.722 --> 00:41:19.682
Anything?

00:41:19.682 --> 00:41:20.182
Yeah.

00:41:20.182 --> 00:41:21.640
STUDENT: They could
potentially get

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.610
authorized to use any server.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so it's
in general a good idea

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.300
to be very explicit
in network protocols

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.580
and to say exactly
what a message means.

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.910
So in this case,
if you omit an S,

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.189
you might be relying
on the fact that, well,

00:41:37.189 --> 00:41:39.730
if it's the wrong S that you're
trying to use the ticket for,

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:42.320
then maybe you'll have a
different key over here

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.490
and then it wouldn't decrypt
or something like this.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.823
But it seems like a good idea
to include it to make sure

00:41:46.823 --> 00:41:48.630
that the server that
receives this tickets

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:49.960
decrypts and checks.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.470
Is that a ticket for
me or for someone else?

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.970
Yeah.

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.522
STUDENT: What does the
client get KTGS on?

00:41:55.522 --> 00:41:56.730
PROFESSOR: Ah, good question.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:58.230
The client has no
idea what this is.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.060
Because this is like
a super secret key.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.770
If you knew this,
you'd probably be

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.480
able to break all of Kerberos.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.461
So the client has no
idea what KTGS is.

00:42:06.461 --> 00:42:07.294
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:07.294 --> 00:42:08.110
PROFESSOR: Ah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.335
And then the where
you get it from

00:42:09.335 --> 00:42:11.209
is actually-- it's the
Kerberos server itself

00:42:11.209 --> 00:42:14.830
that generates this whole blob
for you where this is actually

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:18.780
TGS and this is KTGS over here.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.450
So you don't construct
this yourself.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.830
You just copy it over.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:23.660
OK

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:27.154
So what is the client
name there important for?

00:42:27.154 --> 00:42:28.570
That should be
fairly easy, right?

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.020
If you don't put the
client name in the ticket,

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.830
then the server
gets this nice blob

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.382
but it has no idea who
it's trying to talk to.

00:42:34.382 --> 00:42:35.840
So it has no idea
whether it should

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.890
issue a ticket for my
principal or for someone else's

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.250
principle, et cetera.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.470
So what's the deal
with the other fields?

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.625
Why do these guys stick
an address in the ticket?

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.475
This is the client's IP address.

00:42:51.475 --> 00:42:53.741
Does it matter?

00:42:53.741 --> 00:42:54.240
Yeah.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.632
STUDENT: Can they
use that address

00:42:56.632 --> 00:42:59.899
with the ticket to verify
against the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:59.899 --> 00:43:00.690
PROFESSOR: Sort of.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.322
Well, so I think
the general plan

00:43:02.322 --> 00:43:03.780
for why there's
addresses appearing

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.290
everywhere here,
these IP addresses,

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.220
is that these guys at the
time were still slightly

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.402
confused and--
well, in some ways--

00:43:11.402 --> 00:43:12.860
they were still
thinking, OK, well,

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.318
we're going to rely
on IP addresses

00:43:14.318 --> 00:43:15.800
for a little bit of security.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.350
So they wanted to make sure
that if the client logged in

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.830
from some IP address, then
everything else going on

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.300
with that ticket happen
from that same IP address.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.070
So if you logged in
from some IP address

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:31.066
on 18.26.4.9 or something,
then every connection

00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:32.940
you make to a file server
or to a mail server

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.280
has to be from the
same IP address.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.405
Otherwise, the server should
reject your connection

00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:39.570
as being stolen by-- or
someone stole your ticket.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.500
So we're thinking,
OK, well, maybe we'll

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.350
defend against ticket
theft this way.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:45.010
If you still a ticket,
well, but you're

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:46.260
not using the same IP address.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.685
So it won't work.

00:43:47.685 --> 00:43:49.830
It's probably a little bit
misguided at this point

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:52.980
but-- that sort of gets in the
way And Kerberos 5 still has it

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.350
but it's largely optional.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:58.410
Really, you should just rely on
cryptography instead of any IP

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.430
address security.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.890
So what's the point of the
time stamp and lifetime things

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.760
in the ticket up there?

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.445
One are those guys good for?

00:44:06.445 --> 00:44:08.595
Are they useful?

00:44:08.595 --> 00:44:09.095
Yeah.

00:44:09.095 --> 00:44:11.270
STUDENT: Preventing
replay attacks.

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:12.687
PROFESSOR: Well,
so the syndicator

00:44:12.687 --> 00:44:14.520
is the thing that's
going to help us prevent

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.080
replay attacks in a second.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.470
Because that thing gets
generated every time

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.370
you do a new request.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:22.490
On the other hand, the
ticket just stays the same.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.739
So it's certainly not
preventing replay attacks there.

00:44:24.739 --> 00:44:25.304
Yeah.

00:44:25.304 --> 00:44:27.804
STUDENT: It prevents somebody
from stealing your ticket then

00:44:27.804 --> 00:44:28.638
using it [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:28.638 --> 00:44:29.720
PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry, yes.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.050
This just bounds the time
for which a ticket is valid,

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.630
meaning that the damage
from disclosing it

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:37.110
is hopefully reduced.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.900
So the plan is the timestamp
is roughly the time when

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.370
you initially got the ticket.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.070
And a lifetime in
the ticket represents

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.030
how many hours,
let's say, it's valid

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:48.900
from that initial timestamp.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.050
So if you try to use it
too early or too late,

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:54.100
then every server should
reject such a ticket

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.040
in the Kerberos protocol.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.180
So this kind of means
that every server

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:02.859
has to have a loosely
synchronized, clock which

00:45:02.859 --> 00:45:04.900
is a bit of a-- well,
maybe you've run into this.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.483
Like, your laptop clock is off
and you can't log into Kerberos

00:45:07.483 --> 00:45:08.121
anymore.

00:45:08.121 --> 00:45:08.620
Question?

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.190
Yeah.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.980
STUDENT: You said before
that the client discards KC

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.780
but they're still
keeping KCS [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.305
the TGS. [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:16.305 --> 00:45:17.555
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

00:45:17.555 --> 00:45:20.310
So the client discards
KC after logging in.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.600
But it still keeps KCS.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.997
You're exactly right.

00:45:22.997 --> 00:45:24.580
STUDENT: So if someone
steals the KCS,

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.487
then they have access
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:27.487 --> 00:45:28.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.111
So how bad is that?

00:45:29.111 --> 00:45:32.892
Like, why is it better
to disclose this KCS

00:45:32.892 --> 00:45:34.600
fof-- actually, well,
this is TGS, right?

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.235
Why is it better to
disclose KCTGS than KC?

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.918
Yeah.

00:45:40.918 --> 00:45:43.205
STUDENT: Someone [INAUDIBLE]
somewhere [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:43.205 --> 00:45:44.580
PROFESSOR: It's
the kind of thing

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.390
that they're both keys, though.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.181
So neither of them are
really hashed, yeah.

00:45:47.181 --> 00:45:49.533
STUDENT: You would take
KCS and you'd just steal

00:45:49.533 --> 00:45:51.238
that session between those two.

00:45:51.238 --> 00:45:53.740
But if you steal KC, you
can impersonate the client.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:54.740
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:55.240
Yeah.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.730
So I guess one
way to answer this

00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.820
is that KCTGS, this is actually
a new key generated every time

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.820
you log in initially.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.550
And this thing is only good
because you have this ticket

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:08.620
that goes along with it.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.550
If you lose this ticket or if
this ticket is no longer valid,

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.500
then yeah, you have these
56 bits in this key.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.880
But no one is going to assume
anything from those bits.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.760
The only reason these
bits are interesting

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.200
is because this ticket talks
about this KCS being valid

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.160
right now.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.886
And there's a bound on it.

00:46:26.886 --> 00:46:28.790
STUDENT: Yeah, so if
they stole both of those

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.579
[INAUDIBLE] be bounded.

00:46:30.579 --> 00:46:32.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if someone
steals both of these blogs,

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:36.040
than they can impersonate you
or, like, log into your file

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.450
server, mail server for the
lifetime of that ticket, which

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.990
is a couple of
hours or 10 hours.

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:44.760
Stealing this, there's no time
bound on that until you change

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.355
your password and maybe worse.

00:46:47.355 --> 00:46:49.720
Make sense?

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.050
All right, so it
seems like, yeah,

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:54.840
all those fields are
kind of important,

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.810
IP address maybe less so.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:02.220
And now in response, right, we
can get this ticket finally.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:05.950
And because we know KCTGS,
we can decrypt the response

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.120
from this TGS server.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.790
And now we have a
ticket for any server

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:12.350
we want-- a file server,
mail server, whatever

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:15.840
it is that we finally
care about connecting to.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.470
Make sense?

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:23.050
All right, so let's look at
how you might sort of finally

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:26.510
use this in some
application level protocol.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:30.090
So suppose that maybe I'm
talking to a mail server

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.610
to fetch my messages.

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.850
So presumably, what my client
workstation is going to do

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:37.245
is going to send a tickets
requesting for, I don't know,

00:47:37.245 --> 00:47:39.770
mail.po12.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:43.380
And it'll get back a ticket
for the principal mail.po12

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.850
or something like this.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:49.340
And then inside of this ticket
or inside of this response,

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.930
now I have a shared
key between me

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:55.080
and the mail server-- S is
the male server over here--

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.720
and this ticket a blob
that I can to the mail

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.870
server to convince it
that I'm the right guy

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:04.679
or anyone with this key
is the right principle.

00:48:04.679 --> 00:48:06.970
And then we can actually have
an encrypted conversation

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:12.220
with the mail server
using this new key KCS.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:16.990
So what I might do as
a client is-- well,

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:20.200
initially, I send some
message to the mail server

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:25.980
that includes this
ticket TC mail encrypted

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.880
with the key of the mail server.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.510
And then I can actually
send some message along

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:36.180
with this request that maybe
says something like, well,

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:40.640
delete some message-- delete 5.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:46.360
And I can encrypt
this with KC mail.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.049
Does that make sense?

00:48:49.049 --> 00:48:51.340
OK, so what happens in this
protocol on the mail server

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.060
side?

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.540
The mail server is going to
use its secret key K mail

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.474
to decrypt this ticket first.

00:48:57.474 --> 00:48:59.140
And then it looks
inside there and finds

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.800
two important things-- the
principal name C of who

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.014
is it that's talking to it in
the first place and the key KCS

00:49:07.014 --> 00:49:08.430
that it should be
using to decrypt

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:11.155
all the subsequent traffic
and authenticate it ideally

00:49:11.155 --> 00:49:12.609
in Kerberos 5, at least.

00:49:12.609 --> 00:49:15.150
And then you can decrypt this
message and say oh, well, yeah.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.370
User C is trying to
delete message five.

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:19.485
So I'll run this command.

00:49:19.485 --> 00:49:19.985
Make sense?

00:49:19.985 --> 00:49:21.316
You had a question?

00:49:21.316 --> 00:49:24.500
STUDENT: Yeah, so
Kerberos initially

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:30.370
sends the TGS ticket in KCTGS.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.620
Where's [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.500
PROFESSOR: So AC, those
authenticators are actually

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.110
generated by the client.

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:40.280
Note that the client
only needs KCS

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.390
to generate an authenticator.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.340
So the client can make
these up any time it wants.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.250
So the general plan for
indicators or the reason

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.970
to use authenticators is roughly
to prevent replay attack.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:55.470
So the client, or at least in
the way that the Kerberos 4

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.840
developers were
intending it, the client,

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.920
every time it sends
a new request ,

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.980
it would generate a new
authenticator to say OK, well,

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:03.999
this is a new request.

00:50:03.999 --> 00:50:04.790
I'm issuing it now.

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:06.706
It's different from all
the previous requests.

00:50:06.706 --> 00:50:07.740
Go do it.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.110
And the general plan
was that the server

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:15.550
would keep a cache of
these authenticators that

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:18.830
were sent within the
last five minutes or so.

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:20.710
So if it ever sees a
duplicate authenticator,

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.310
it says oh, that's
a replay request.

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:24.130
I'm going to reject it.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.350
And if it sees an
authenticator that's

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:28.380
outside of a five
minute boundary,

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.970
it doesn't have it in the cache.

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:33.220
But it will look at the time
stamp in the authenticator

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.220
and say, well, this is a
very old authenticator.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.700
I'll just reject your
request because it's too old.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.700
Send it again if
you really care.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.170
So that's the general
plan for indicators.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.410
As with many things
in Kerberos, they

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:47.160
were slightly broken--
in Kerberos 4, at least.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.890
Because this
authenticator actually

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.098
says nothing about the
message you're sending, right?

00:50:51.098 --> 00:50:52.022
It's some blob.

00:50:52.022 --> 00:50:53.730
So the way you would
use it, for example,

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:57.610
in this mail server protocol
is-- or at least in Kerberos

00:50:57.610 --> 00:51:00.050
4-- well, you would
generate some authenticator

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:02.380
and you would be to
take the authenticator

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.572
and you would encrypt
it with also KC mail.

00:51:06.572 --> 00:51:09.190
And the mail server would
keep track of, well, yeah,

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:11.106
you've sent this [INAUDIBLE]
indicator before.

00:51:11.106 --> 00:51:12.007
No, you haven't.

00:51:12.007 --> 00:51:14.340
But there's nothing here that
connects the authenticator

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.770
to the message you are sending.

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.912
So for the first
message, this was great.

00:51:17.912 --> 00:51:19.370
But when you send
a second message,

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.440
you're going to generate
a second authenticator.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.980
And someone on the
network can say, oh, yeah,

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.310
I got your new authenticator.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:25.740
I can take your
new authenticator

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.130
and splice in the
old delete message.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:31.180
So I'll force you to delete
the fifth message twice,

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.950
even though the
second command meant

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:35.960
to send some other operation.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.819
So Kerberos 5 gets this
right where you actually

00:51:40.819 --> 00:51:42.860
stick something in the
authenticator that relates

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.100
to the command you're issuing.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.724
You could do this, of course,
but sort of took a while

00:51:47.724 --> 00:51:49.390
for people to realize
that, well, here's

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:52.800
how you should design
a protocol correctly.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.540
Make sense?

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.714
Yeah, other question.

00:51:54.714 --> 00:51:55.547
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:58.158 --> 00:52:01.050
PROFESSOR: Ah, so the
client gets case email

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.340
from this response.

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.180
So the client, when it wants
to talk to the mail server,

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:08.240
it's going to ask the TGS for
a ticket for the mail server.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:12.500
And here, S is basically this
mail server's principal name.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:16.370
So when it comes back,
this says S equals mail

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:19.660
and this server key
S is equal to mail.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.470
And this KCS is
actually KC mail.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.830
So this is how the client
learns of the shared key

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:32.870
that it has between it and the
files and the mail server here.

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:34.850
And there's a copy of
it inside the ticket.

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:35.690
Question back there?

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.059
STUDENT: How does the
mail server get KC mail?

00:52:38.059 --> 00:52:38.850
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:40.980
So how does the mail
server get this shared key?

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:43.010
Like, the mail server
might have never heard

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:44.926
of your connection before,
never heard of you.

00:52:44.926 --> 00:52:47.760
Where does KC mail come from
on the mail server side?

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.889
Yeah.

00:52:48.889 --> 00:52:50.430
STUDENT: Isn't it
part of the ticket?

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah, so
this is the cool thing.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.106
You send this ticket over to the
mail server and the mail server

00:52:54.106 --> 00:52:56.180
knows its own secret key K mail.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.980
And it uses that to decrypt the
ticket TC mail and the shared

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.430
key is in there along
with the name of whoever

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:05.656
it is that you're
sharing this key with.

00:53:05.656 --> 00:53:07.780
That's how it finds out,
oh, I'm talking to the guy

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:11.010
and that's the shared
key we should use.

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.930
Makes sense?

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:15.970
All right, so that's
the sort of basic plan

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:20.950
for how you use this protocol
in some actual application.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:27.490
There's-- well, there's a
bunch of problems with this.

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:30.350
So Kerberos is-- it's
a nice paper to read

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:32.570
but then there's all these
problems these guys didn't

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:33.620
know about 30 years ago.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.810
So it's sort of inevitable
that there's problems

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:38.240
you have to go through.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.180
So one interesting
problem in the way

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:45.820
Kerberos 4 encrypted and
authenticated messages

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:49.140
for applications is that
they use the same key

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.960
for encrypting messages from
the client to the server

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.580
as well as messages from the
server back to the client.

00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:01.300
So suppose that the client
issues, I don't know,

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.110
a request to fetch a
particular message.

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:08.720
So then I say, you know,
fetch the message 7.

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:13.720
And I encrypt this
thing with KC mail.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.170
That seems all great.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:17.590
The mail server has
the shared key that's

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:19.040
going to decrypt this message.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:23.690
And it's going to send me back
the body of this email message

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:26.910
also encrypted with KC mail.

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:29.500
Does anyone see a
problem with this?

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:33.180
Why is this is potentially
a bad thing to do?

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.870
Anyone else?

00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:36.421
Sure.

00:54:36.421 --> 00:54:39.530
STUDENT: So there's
a chapter [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:42.104
they can make [INAUDIBLE] look
like some other things they

00:54:42.104 --> 00:54:42.806
want [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:42.806 --> 00:54:43.750
PROFESSOR: Yes, so
those are actually

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:46.444
worrisome because I could send
you any email message I want.

00:54:46.444 --> 00:54:48.610
So suppose I really want
to delete some message that

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.068
is sitting here in
your inbox and I

00:54:50.068 --> 00:54:51.250
don't want you to read it.

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.640
I know it's maybe
message, I don't know, 23.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.932
So I'm going to send you an
email that says, delete 23.

00:54:55.932 --> 00:54:56.931
You're going to read it.

00:54:56.931 --> 00:54:58.800
You're going to fetch
it and a response

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.675
is going to come from
the mail server saying,

00:55:00.675 --> 00:55:03.086
delete 23 encrypted
with this key.

00:55:03.086 --> 00:55:05.210
And so far, it's not being
sent to the mail server.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:07.126
But if I look at the
network at the right time

00:55:07.126 --> 00:55:09.540
and capture this packet,
I can send the packet back

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.690
to the mail server.

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:13.900
It would look like a message
saying delete 23 encrypted

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:15.067
with the right key.

00:55:15.067 --> 00:55:16.900
And the mail server
will say, oh yeah, sure.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:18.441
You're trying to
delete this message.

00:55:18.441 --> 00:55:19.190
I'll do it.

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:21.970
So this is a bit of
a problem because we

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:25.070
are allowing an adversary
to confuse the mail

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:27.860
server into whether our
message was generated by it

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.592
or was sent to it
in the first place.

00:55:30.592 --> 00:55:32.021
So this is quite troublesome.

00:55:32.021 --> 00:55:33.520
So these are what's
typically called

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.144
in cryptography and
protocol literature

00:55:35.144 --> 00:55:37.677
as reflection attacks.

00:55:37.677 --> 00:55:40.260
So you have any suggestions for
how we can avoid this problem?

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:40.660
Yeah.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.985
STUDENT: Can't you just include
a header saying its origins?

00:55:42.985 --> 00:55:44.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so typically, you

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.950
want to have some very
unambiguous way to state what's

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:47.900
going on.

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:50.364
One way is to have a header
in every message that says,

00:55:50.364 --> 00:55:52.780
this is going from the client
to the server or from server

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:53.720
to the client.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.860
And even better plan
in practice turns out

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:57.520
to be just use
two separate keys.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.170
Because you might want to
have a long stream of data

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.860
where you don't really have
space for this header bit.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.380
So instead, what Kerberos 5
does is every time you establish

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.230
a connection with some service ,
you actually negotiate two keys

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:10.690
instead of just one key.

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:13.530
And the first key is going to
be used for encrypting stuff

00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:16.780
from client to server and other
from server back to the client.

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:21.010
So that seems like a much
better way to do it in practice.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:24.220
Make sense?

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:30.750
All right, so I guess
let's now talk a little bit

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:33.780
about what happens with KDC.

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:38.870
So the Kerberos server is
pretty important to the system.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:42.000
But what happens if
this KDC goes down?

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.360
So how bad is it to our system.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.730
Like, in Athena,
suppose if KDC crashes,

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:49.330
does this affect your life?

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.514
Well, if you use Athena.

00:56:50.514 --> 00:56:52.097
STUDENT: Is that why
you can't log in?

00:56:52.097 --> 00:56:53.822
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
you can't log in.

00:56:53.822 --> 00:56:56.030
I guess the other thing is
you also can't get tickets

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:58.010
to new things as well.

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.780
But kind of the cool thing
is that the KDC is largely

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.820
off the critical path
for existing connection.

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.312
So no data passes
through the KDC.

00:57:04.312 --> 00:57:06.270
And if you already have
a ticket for something,

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:07.853
you can keep using
it and keep logging

00:57:07.853 --> 00:57:10.220
into some service
over the network.

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.056
So in that way, it's actually
quite nicely cacheable.

00:57:13.056 --> 00:57:14.680
I guess the other
nice thing these guys

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.430
do is they actually have
a way of replicating

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:18.880
the KDC potentially.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.140
So they have one
master Kerberos server

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:25.800
that stores the sort of primary
copy of this whole database.

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.220
And then they can have
read only replicas that

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.560
hold a copy of this database.

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.080
They don't allow
any updates to this

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.270
like registering users
or updating keys.

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:39.600
But they do allow responding
to login and TJS requests.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:43.030
So this way, these backup
clones of this Kerberos database

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.860
allow you to keep logging in
and keep talking to services

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:49.850
even if the master
crashed and hopefully

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:53.590
make it possible to upgrade
to master without breaking

00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:56.060
everything at the same time.

00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:56.640
Makes sense?

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:56.900
Any questions?

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:57.200
Yeah.

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.741
STUDENT: How hard
is it to compromise

00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:01.292
the KDC server and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:01.292 --> 00:58:03.560
PROFESSOR: Well, yes,
this is a huge sort

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.852
of target for any system
that runs Kerberos.

00:58:05.852 --> 00:58:07.310
Because if you
compromise this guy,

00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:09.350
you're in complete
control of the system.

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:12.620
You can mint tickets for
any service you want,

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.100
pretending to be
client you want.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.600
So this is pretty bad.

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.654
So you really want to
keep this guy secure.

00:58:18.654 --> 00:58:20.070
Now, how hard is
it to compromise?

00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:21.600
Well, ideally, it's hard.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.450
And I don't know
of any instances

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:29.890
where the MIT KDC has actually
been compromised in, I guess,

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:31.700
20 years or so.

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.910
So it's , I think, possible to
run this reasonably security.

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:37.070
But presumably, the things
you would worry about

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:40.440
are just software
implementation security

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.010
of the things that's listening
on these two services, right?

00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:44.990
So if there's buffer
overflows on this guys

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:48.850
or some other vulnerability
like that, that's really bad.

00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:52.270
Or if there's an SSH server
running on the Kerberos KDC

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:55.430
and someone guesses the root
password on that SSH server,

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:57.860
they'll just log in and
copy the database over.

00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.110
So I think you really want
to be careful in minimizing

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:01.151
the attack surface there.

00:59:01.151 --> 00:59:04.040
Maybe be very careful
writing the KDC code.

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.300
Don't allow you to
log into it directly.

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:11.060
Maybe you even worry about
physical security, et cetera.

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:11.690
Absolutely.

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:14.180
Luckily, this is actually
one of the few places

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:16.210
where you have to be
super paranoid, though.

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:19.020
Right, so the servers,
unlike in some other systems

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.940
that do trust all the
machines, the servers

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.770
are actually not that important.

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:24.410
They of course store some data.

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:28.540
But if someone compromises a
mail server or a print server,

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.337
you can probably
recover reasonably well.

00:59:30.337 --> 00:59:32.170
So actually, here's an
interesting question.

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:34.253
Like, suppose someone
compromised the mail server.

00:59:34.253 --> 00:59:37.156
What should you do to
recover from this attack?

00:59:37.156 --> 00:59:38.530
Like, if someone
stole your mail,

00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:39.988
I guess that's kind
of unfortunate.

00:59:39.988 --> 00:59:42.710
But what do you do so that the
attacker doesn't keep accessing

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:44.150
your mail in the future?

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.660
Yeah.

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:45.844
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:45.844 --> 00:59:47.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
in Kerberos, there's

00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:49.830
no sort of revoke operation.

00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:51.350
But what you could
do is you could

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:53.690
change generate a new
key for the mail server

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.000
and stick it in this
database over here.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.490
And then you install a new mail
server, give it the new key,

00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:02.880
and then some attacker that
has the mail server's old key

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.200
has no way of-- like, no
influence at all on this mail

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.167
server now, right?

01:00:08.167 --> 01:00:10.750
On the other hand, suppose you
didn't change the mail server's

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.220
key, K mail.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.726
How that is that?

01:00:14.726 --> 01:00:17.292
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] fine.

01:00:17.292 --> 01:00:19.500
PROFESSOR: OK, so suppose
you didn't change the mail.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.125
You, like, install
the new mail server.

01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:23.200
You patch whatever bug
that hacker exploited.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.130
But it still has
the same key K mail.

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:28.172
And maybe it's taken a day so
all the tickets are expired.

01:00:28.172 --> 01:00:30.380
Can that hacker do anything
interesting in the system

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:30.610
anymore?

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:31.110
Yeah.

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:33.662
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:33.662 --> 01:00:36.245
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, so you give
the new mail server the old K

01:00:36.245 --> 01:00:37.960
mail.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.711
Is that bad?

01:00:39.711 --> 01:00:40.210
Yeah.

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:41.536
STUDENT: This is--

01:00:43.594 --> 01:00:44.260
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.571
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
mail server.

01:00:48.571 --> 01:00:51.566
And [INAUDIBLE] mail
server because you can

01:00:51.566 --> 01:00:52.840
encrypt that initial ticket.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.130
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:54.780
So K mail is actually
super important.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:57.240
And, OK, so you're saying you
can decrypt all the things

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.462
going on to the mail server.

01:00:58.462 --> 01:01:00.670
So suppose the client now
connects to the mail server

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:02.060
after it's been fixed up.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.890
But the attacker
still knows K mail

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:05.850
from the last time they
compromised the system.

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:08.070
They can now decrypt
this ticket k mail

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:11.382
and they can now look inside the
ticket to get the session key

01:01:11.382 --> 01:01:13.590
and they can use that to
decrypt all the messages you

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:15.930
send, all the responses
you get back, and so on.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:18.950
So it's pretty important
to change this key K mail.

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:21.170
And in many ways, it's
actually even worse

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:22.700
than just looking
at the traffic.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.440
Because if the attacker
know this key K mail,

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.180
they can synthesize new
tickets for the mail server

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.100
without talking to the key DC.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.710
So suppose that I
know K mail and I

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:35.100
want to read your mail
from the mail server.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.430
I'll just make up this ticket.

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:39.030
I'll plop down all those five
fields in the right order.

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.950
I'll generate a new key.

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:42.280
I'll encrypt it with K mail.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.072
It'll look like the real
thing generated by the KDC.

01:01:45.072 --> 01:01:46.780
And I'll just connect
to the mail server.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.450
And it'll decrypt it.

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:49.890
It'll decrypt correctly and
then it'll think, oh, yeah,

01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:52.980
this is some particular user.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:55.480
And you can read all their mail
and you know the shared key

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.590
and so on.

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:59.870
So it's critically important
too that no one knows

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:01.770
the secret key of a service.

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:04.120
Because otherwise, not
only is the traffic

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.330
to the service decryptable
and observable,

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:10.410
but also you could impersonate
anyone to that service.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:13.730
So this is actually all
pretty important in Kerberos.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.320
Makes sense?

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.146
Any questions?

01:02:17.146 --> 01:02:18.118
Yeah.

01:02:18.118 --> 01:02:20.548
STUDENT: So if the attacker
has to [INAUDIBLE],

01:02:20.548 --> 01:02:24.436
what's stopping him from
changing the [INAUDIBLE] key

01:02:24.436 --> 01:02:25.785
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:28.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so presumably,
how you'd recover-- like,

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.380
ISNT would, like, call up
the guy that runs this KDC

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.570
and say, oh man, our mail
server got compromised.

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:34.820
Why don't you go and, like,
delete this key from there

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.289
and put in this new key instead?

01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:38.330
So you'd probably want to
have some out of bounds

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:41.570
mechanism for proving that
you're really the mail server.

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.434
Because we'll look
at a second on how do

01:02:43.434 --> 01:02:45.600
you change keys-- like a
password changing protocol,

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.410
for example.

01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:49.410
And you can in general
change passwords in Kerberos.

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:51.020
So if you know the
old password, you

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.920
can change the user's password
to a new password here.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.702
So in order to recover, you
probably-- like the attacker,

01:02:56.702 --> 01:02:58.910
might get your key mail,
change it to something else.

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.750
Someone with ISNT basically has
to go to the Accounts office

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:04.129
and say, hey,
we're hear at ISNT.

01:03:04.129 --> 01:03:06.420
Could you please change the
password of the mail server

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:06.920
for us?

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.878
And they're going to
generate some new password

01:03:08.878 --> 01:03:10.320
the attacker doesn't know.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.230
So yeah, otherwise, if the
attacker knows this key K mail,

01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:16.480
there's nothing differentiating
the attacker from you,

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.240
from the real mail
server operator.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.976
In fact, the attacker probably
changed the key so now they

01:03:20.976 --> 01:03:22.350
know the new thing
and you don't.

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.440
It's like you're not on
the mail server anymore.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.210
So absolutely, you need
some out of band protocol

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:31.460
for initially registering
principles in the database

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.360
and for changing keys if you
forget your password or someone

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.400
changes for you and
you lose it as well.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.020
So there's someone
at MIT or there's

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.950
a group of people at
MIT that help users

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:45.000
register for accounts and
change their passwords

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.440
by, you know, you present your
MIT ID and say, oh, well, OK.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.840
Well, whatever
happened, we'll be

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.740
able to change your
key for you then.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.890
Make sense?

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:55.390
So it's pretty
important, of course,

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.990
to do that right so
if the person that

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:01.310
is allowing password resets does
the wrong thing when checking

01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:04.140
your MIT ID, you'll be able to
compromise the system as well,

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:04.280
right?

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.321
So they are sort of part
of the trusted computing

01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:07.405
base in Kerberos, right?

01:04:07.405 --> 01:04:09.530
Like, anyone that can go
and muck with the database

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:13.990
is pretty important
for security here.

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:17.149
All right, so let's look at
another sort of interesting use

01:04:17.149 --> 01:04:17.940
of Kerberos, right?

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.750
So you could use Kerberos to try
to log into some remote machine

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.329
over SSH.

01:04:24.329 --> 01:04:26.620
And the way this would work
is, of course, very similar

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:27.340
to a mail server.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.881
You'd get a ticket
for the SSH server

01:04:28.881 --> 01:04:32.080
and you'd send the ticket
along with your SSH connection.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.860
But what if you're SSHing
into Athena dot dial-up

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:37.210
and you don't have a Kerberos
client on your machine?

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:39.270
You just want to log
into Athena dot dial-up

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:42.360
with your regular password.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.840
So how would Athena dial-up
authenticate you, then,

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.060
if you're just plugging into
this machine with a password?

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.120
But you have no password
for Athena dot dial-up.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.772
It's on a Kerberos server.

01:04:51.772 --> 01:04:53.230
So which should
the dial-up machine

01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:54.880
do when you log into
it with a password?

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.250
Yeah.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:56.990
STUDENT: You can
access the [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:58.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the dial-up is then

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:01.200
going to basically play the
same protocol logging you in.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.850
So it's going to send a request.

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:04.600
This thing, right?

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.960
It's going to send a request
to the Kerberos service asking,

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.550
give me a ticket for, I
don't know, this user Alice.

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:15.050
And in response, it's going to
get back this reply encrypted

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:16.280
with Alice's password.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.250
And then it's going to try
the password you just applied

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:21.050
and see if it
decrypts correctly.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.650
And if it decrypts
correctly, it's

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:25.270
going to let you log in, right?

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.770
Yeah.

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:27.228
STUDENT: You don't
even really have

01:05:27.228 --> 01:05:30.370
to send your key
to the SSH server.

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:32.840
Because it could
relay this back--

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.230
the dot encrypted thing with KC.

01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:38.948
It could relay that back to the
user over the SSH connection.

01:05:38.948 --> 01:05:40.380
PROFESSOR: Potentially, yeah.

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.560
Right, so this requires
some fancy SSH client

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.810
that you might not have.

01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:45.400
But-- so yeah, absolutely right.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.790
If you want to do
this right, you

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:49.081
probably want to have a
Kerberos client on your machine

01:05:49.081 --> 01:05:51.370
and get a ticket
yourself or maybe

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:53.460
proxy it somehow
through the SSH server

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:56.104
but not allow the SSH
server to have your key.

01:05:56.104 --> 01:05:57.270
That's probably a good plan.

01:05:57.270 --> 01:06:01.518
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
just, the server could get

01:06:01.518 --> 01:06:02.940
through this wall [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.108
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:06:03.108 --> 01:06:05.165
Then you might decrypt
it and send back.

01:06:05.165 --> 01:06:07.290
OK, but in either case,
right, all we're doing here

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:11.279
is someone is going to try
to decrypt this blob with KC.

01:06:11.279 --> 01:06:13.320
And then the server is
going to get this resolved

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.403
and see if it looks right.

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:16.476
It's going to allow you in.

01:06:16.476 --> 01:06:19.219
Seem like a good plan?

01:06:19.219 --> 01:06:21.760
So, turns out this is actually
a fairly dangerous thing to do

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.315
and allows you to potentially
log into the SSH server

01:06:24.315 --> 01:06:26.020
as anyone.

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:28.650
And the reason is
that previously,

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:31.930
when we were talking about
a client trying to log in,

01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:33.549
the client basically
knew that it

01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:35.340
was trying to supply
a legitimate password,

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.780
it was getting a reply from
the right Kerberos server,

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.870
and if it can decrypt it, then
probably the password works out

01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:42.010
correctly.

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:44.650
However, there's nothing
here in this protocol that

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:47.500
authenticates the fact
that this reply is coming

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.670
from the right Kerberos server.

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:57.470
So if I try to log into a
machine by typing in a password

01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:00.080
and the machine sends
out this request

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.700
and some response
comes back that seems

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.170
to be encrypted with
the password I typed in,

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:09.750
this response might not be
from the Kerberos server.

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:12.090
So suppose I have some
machine I want to log into.

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:14.510
I type a password X into it.

01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:16.960
And then the machine
sends out this response.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.280
And before the Kerberos
server can respond back

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.210
with the real reply, I'll
send my own reply that

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:27.640
looks like this real response
encrypted with my password X.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.540
And the workstation to which I
try to log in or the SSH server

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.780
is going to decrypt it
with my fake password.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.180
It's going to look OK
because this response was

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:39.880
generated by me rather than
the real Kerberos server.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:45.395
And you'll be able to
log in This make sense?

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.270
Why does this happen?

01:07:51.704 --> 01:07:52.692
Yeah.

01:07:52.692 --> 01:07:54.668
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
there's no authentication

01:07:54.668 --> 01:07:56.660
from the Kerberos
server [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:57.550
PROFESSOR: Right,
yeah, so there's

01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:59.940
nothing really here that's
tying this to the real Kerberos

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.440
server.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:04.850
So the way that
Kerberos fixes this

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:08.300
for remotely accessible
machines like Athena

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.100
dot dial-up is that
the dial-ups themselves

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.700
have some sort of a secret key
that they share with the KDC.

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.720
So in order to log
you in into a dial-up

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.210
or to any workstation that
really cares about checking

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:21.159
whether you are
really the right user,

01:08:21.159 --> 01:08:22.700
it's actually going
to do two things.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:26.229
It's going to first log you
into Kerberos like this.

01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:28.880
But then just because this
reply decrypts correctly,

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.439
it's not going to trust that.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.090
It's going to try
to get a service

01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:35.910
ticket for itself using TGS.

01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:39.899
So the dial-up machine here
has its own secret key.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:42.229
And it logs you in
with this round one.

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:45.569
Then it talks to TGS
saying, oh, please give me

01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:48.740
a service ticket for
my own principle,

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:51.359
from the dial-up
principle, for this client.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:52.880
Then it gets the response back.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.479
And then it checks if it can
decrypt the response correctly.

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:59.220
Because it knows the
dial-up key for this KS.

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.390
And if this decrpyts,
that it knows, oh yeah,

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:03.390
I must have talked to the
right Kerberos server.

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:04.973
Because only the
right Kerberos server

01:09:04.973 --> 01:09:07.200
would have sent me this
second round ticket encrypted

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.665
with my secret key K dial-up.

01:09:10.665 --> 01:09:12.779
So this is actually
pretty important.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.744
And typically,
Athena workstations

01:09:14.744 --> 01:09:17.160
don't do this extra step because
Athena workstations don't

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.100
have any secret
key stored on them

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.494
that's shared with the KDC.

01:09:21.494 --> 01:09:23.535
Why is this OK for Athena
workstations to let you

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:26.535
log in in this one round
trip and not for dial-ups?

01:09:26.535 --> 01:09:27.035
Yeah.

01:09:27.035 --> 01:09:29.076
STUDENT: If you don't have
access to any services

01:09:29.076 --> 01:09:31.035
because the attacker
couldn't forge the ticket.

01:09:31.035 --> 01:09:32.284
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

01:09:32.284 --> 01:09:35.060
So there's nothing interesting
on the dial-up machine itself--

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.510
sorry, on the
workstation itself.

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:39.660
So workstation, whenever-- you
have root access on it anyway.

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:42.930
So if you log into it with
a fake password, who cares?

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:45.010
It's not like you'll be
able to do anything else

01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:46.519
outside of your workstation.

01:09:46.519 --> 01:09:48.810
Whereas on a dial-up, things
are much more interesting.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:50.851
It might be that you have
other processes running

01:09:50.851 --> 01:09:52.920
on the dial-up from
other login sessions.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.440
And there, the fact that you log
in with a particular Unix UID

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.070
is actually pretty important.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.230
And there, they really
want to authenticate

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:02.360
that you are the right entity.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.780
So that's why they do this sort
of 2-step process for logging

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:09.140
into some shared
time-sharing machine.

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.020
Make sense?

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.230
All right, so the last
thing I want to talk about

01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.840
is how do we change keys.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.230
So we sort of talked about
it briefly here with the idea

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:22.029
that the mail server's
key might get compromised.

01:10:22.029 --> 01:10:23.570
But as a user, you
probably also want

01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:26.080
to change passwords as well.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.861
Like, maybe you're thinking, oh,
that password is not so great

01:10:28.861 --> 01:10:29.360
anymore.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.390
Maybe I accidentally wrote it
on a piece of paper and someone

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:32.280
looked at it.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.100
So you probably
want to change it.

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.120
So the way this
works is actually

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.150
at some level fairly
straightforward.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.440
So there's an extra interface
to this Kerberos server.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.570
In addition to Kerberos
and TGS, there's

01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:45.280
this extra service
called kpassword.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.690
And the service lets you
change your password.

01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:55.744
And the way it works is you
get a ticket for this service

01:10:55.744 --> 01:10:57.660
very much like you'd get
a ticket for the mail

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.750
server or any other service.

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:01.592
And then you send
your new password

01:11:01.592 --> 01:11:03.800
to this kpassword service
encrypted with your session

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.910
key.

01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:08.900
And then if everything checks
out, your key in the database

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:12.330
is going to be updated
to the new key.

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:13.070
Question.

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:14.736
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
if there was, like,

01:11:14.736 --> 01:11:17.339
no [INAUDIBLE] they wanted to
have them use a [INAUDIBLE] had

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:18.130
to go through this.

01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:18.590
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:19.170
OK, yeah, OK.

01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.169
So this is a good point.

01:11:20.169 --> 01:11:22.595
So for changing your
password, remember

01:11:22.595 --> 01:11:24.720
that we have this whole
goal that if someone steals

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.270
your ticket, it shouldn't be
good enough to completely take

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:29.750
over your account.

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:32.849
So for this reason, the key
password service actually

01:11:32.849 --> 01:11:34.140
doesn't accept just any ticket.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.900
It accepts a ticket that you
initially get from the Kerberos

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.740
service with your KC.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.430
So the way this actually works
is that inside of every ticket,

01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:44.763
in addition to all the stuff
I showed you there, there's

01:11:44.763 --> 01:11:47.550
an extra bit that tells you
which of these two things

01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:48.836
gave you the ticket.

01:11:48.836 --> 01:11:50.960
So if you get the ticket
from this Kerberos server,

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.082
the bit has one.

01:11:52.082 --> 01:11:54.540
If you get the ticket from the
TGS server, the bit is zero,

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.500
let's say.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.160
And then the kpassword service,
in addition to everything

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.037
that any mail server or
file server would do,

01:12:00.037 --> 01:12:01.620
it also looks at the
bit on the ticket

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.210
and says, well, if you got it
from Kerberos, that's good.

01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:05.700
If you got it from
TGS, that means

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.020
that maybe you stole
someone's ticket

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.000
and you didn't know their
password right away.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.880
So I'm not going to accept this.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.540
So this is how a key password
ensures that you can only

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.637
change the password if you just
knew the password immediately

01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:18.220
prior to this.

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.980
So you never actually supply
the old password to kpassword.

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.172
You supply that to-- well,
you supply that in order

01:12:24.172 --> 01:12:25.880
to decrypt the response
from the Kerberos

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.940
server for the kpassword
password principal.

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.390
Makes sense?

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:36.670
All right, so let's
just actually spell out

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:40.350
the interactions with
the key password service

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:43.320
because there'll be something
a little bit interesting there.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:48.480
So when you're going to
change your password, what

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.400
the client is going
to do is, of course,

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.990
obtain this initial
ticket from Kerberos.

01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:58.890
So it sends a message to the
Kerberos service saying here

01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:03.760
is my client ID and I want to
talk to the kpassword service.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.220
And the Kerberos server is
going to send a response back

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.690
including the ticket
between the client

01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:16.370
and the kpassword service
encrypted with a key of kpass

01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:21.801
and the shared key
between KC and kpass.

01:13:21.801 --> 01:13:22.300
Makes sense?

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:25.995
This is exactly this thing
up here encrypted with KC.

01:13:25.995 --> 01:13:26.560
Makes sense?

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.050
Everyone's runs on board?

01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:30.962
And then very much like you talk
to a mail server, you take this

01:13:30.962 --> 01:13:32.170
and you send it to kpassword.

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:37.420
You say, well, here's my
ticket-- tckpass encrypted

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:39.500
with kpass.

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:45.370
And in addition, you
send your new password

01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:50.240
and you encrypt this
with the key kcpass

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.340
with shared key for
your interaction.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.561
I just separated these
two things out here.

01:13:55.561 --> 01:13:56.060
Make sense?

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.650
So this is the thing you
send to the kpassword service

01:13:57.650 --> 01:14:00.140
with a new password encrypted
with the session key.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:00.640
Yeah.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.116
STUDENT: But in the [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:06.367 --> 01:14:08.450
PROFESSOR: So if the
attacker knows your password,

01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:11.420
they can change your
password-- absolutely.

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.670
So it seems reasonable, right?

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:15.110
Like, there's no other way to
tell whether it's you or not.

01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:17.060
If someone walks up to an
Athena workstation, types

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:19.047
in your username and
password, runs password,

01:14:19.047 --> 01:14:21.630
change my password to this new
thing, they know your password?

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:23.340
They're going to be
able to change it.

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.010
So that's totally the
same in almost any system

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.760
you could imagine.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.150
This is true for Gmail probably.

01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:31.240
This is true for any system
that uses passwords in general.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.840
The reason that we had to talk
to the Kerberos server instead

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:39.610
of the TGS server here is that
if someone steals your ticket,

01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:42.700
then we don't want them to be
able to change your password.

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.170
So if someone corrupts an Athena
workstation after you log in,

01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:49.420
your password is gone from
memory, the ticket remains.

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.370
You could, in principle,
use the ticket

01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:54.916
to obtain more tickets for
the password changing service.

01:14:54.916 --> 01:14:56.290
But the password
changing service

01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:57.270
says that's not going
to be good enough.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:58.645
It's going to look
at this ticket

01:14:58.645 --> 01:15:01.950
here-- ticket between the
client and the password service.

01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:04.764
And if that was
updated through TGS,

01:15:04.764 --> 01:15:06.180
it's going to
reject your request.

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.513
It's only going to accept it
if it was obtained directly

01:15:08.513 --> 01:15:11.260
from the Kerberos
service using KC.

01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:11.761
Makes sense?

01:15:11.761 --> 01:15:12.260
Question.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:14.794
STUDENT: So if you [INAUDIBLE]
password with the [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:14.794 --> 01:15:15.454
Athena, right?

01:15:15.454 --> 01:15:16.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.375
STUDENT: So if I would
steal your private key--

01:15:18.375 --> 01:15:20.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so actually, KC is

01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:22.896
basically equivalent
to your password here.

01:15:22.896 --> 01:15:24.770
As far as the Kerberos
protocol is concerned,

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.728
that don't even think
that you have a password.

01:15:26.728 --> 01:15:28.510
It thinks you have
a private key KC.

01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:31.000
If someone knows KC, that's
basically your password.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.678
So you can change
your key from KC

01:15:32.678 --> 01:15:34.886
to something else so you
don't lose this thing, yeah.

01:15:34.886 --> 01:15:36.690
Uh, yeah, question?

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:41.926
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
initial message [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:41.926 --> 01:15:44.410
from changing the [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:45.910
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
can certainly get

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:48.725
a ticket for some other
service or an attacker

01:15:48.725 --> 01:15:50.600
could drop this message
altogether or corrupt

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.480
this exchange.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.790
And then you're not going
to successfully change

01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:53.255
your password.

01:15:53.255 --> 01:15:54.088
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:56.456 --> 01:15:58.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the client actually

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.350
knows exactly what service
it wants to talk to.

01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:07.120
So if it-- it's going
to make sure, well,

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.620
there are some messages, some
parts of this protocol I'm not

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.810
showing that allow the
client to make sure

01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:14.330
they actually got the
ticket for the right thing.

01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:17.200
But yeah, so the-- sorry.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:17.700
Question?

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.941
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] very easy
to denial of service attack

01:16:20.941 --> 01:16:25.207
when an attacker [INAUDIBLE]
modifying the encrypted version

01:16:25.207 --> 01:16:26.926
of the new password.

01:16:26.926 --> 01:16:29.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so there's
actually lot of things.

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:34.392
Because, for example, Kerberos
doesn't do authentication

01:16:34.392 --> 01:16:35.850
properly of messages--
it just does

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:38.270
encryption-- you could
totally corrupt this blob.

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.770
And--

01:16:38.770 --> 01:16:39.870
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:40.924
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you
could flip it around

01:16:40.924 --> 01:16:42.770
and it'll decrypt
to something else.

01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:44.260
The service was like, oh
yeah, that's the new password,

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:44.882
and set it.

01:16:44.882 --> 01:16:46.340
And then you're
sort of locked out.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.631
So it seems really unfortunate.

01:16:47.631 --> 01:16:49.130
And this is yet
another reason why

01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:52.325
you want separate encryption and
authentication in the protocol.

01:16:52.325 --> 01:16:54.200
There's actually an even
bigger problem here.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.080
But actually, yeah, question?

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.947
STUDENT: What's the
point of having a one way

01:16:56.947 --> 01:16:59.196
function to [INAUDIBLE] your
password in KC if they're

01:16:59.196 --> 01:17:01.350
essentially [INAUDIBLE]?

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:05.060
PROFESSOR: Basically because
KC is a 56-bit ds key

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.060
and your password might
be of different lengths.

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.430
And even if it's longer
than 56 bits, which

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:11.360
is seven bites or
seven characters,

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.630
you want to use all
those extra bytes too.

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:17.900
So it's mostly just to condense
it down to a fixed width blob,

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:18.996
yeah.

01:17:18.996 --> 01:17:21.412
But there's actually a much
more interesting problem here,

01:17:21.412 --> 01:17:23.990
which is that suppose
that I change my password

01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:27.820
and then I decide, OK,
well, I change my password.

01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:29.930
A day goes by and I'm
thinking, oh yeah, sure.

01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:32.370
I'll tell everyone what my
stupid old password was.

01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:35.200
Is this a good idea in Kerberos?

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:35.700
Yeah.

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.346
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
immediately expire until the--

01:17:38.346 --> 01:17:39.230
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:40.470
But someone's got to wait
for all my tickets to expire.

01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.380
I wait for, like, a week.

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.020
And then no tickets
are good anymore.

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.611
Can I give out my
old password now?

01:17:45.611 --> 01:17:46.110
Yeah.

01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:48.389
STUDENT: It might take
a while to replicate.

01:17:48.389 --> 01:17:49.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
suppose the replicas

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:51.661
are all updated,
yeah, all the stuff.

01:17:51.661 --> 01:17:52.160
Yeah.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.701
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] if someone
saves the initial transaction

01:17:54.701 --> 01:17:56.579
[INAUDIBLE] to get,
like, your old password

01:17:56.579 --> 01:17:57.570
now that they have
your new password.

01:17:57.570 --> 01:17:58.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so this is actually

01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:59.850
super worrisome
in Kerberos, which

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:01.560
is that-- suppose
some attacker was

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.240
watching all of my
previous password changes.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.690
They didn't know what my
password was or is or anything.

01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:10.460
But they're just saving these
packets very diligently.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:13.360
And then a month later, I
go and say, oh, my password

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.820
was poodle or something
silly like this.

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:17.520
And then they go say ah, ha, ha.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.630
I can now decrypt
this initial thing

01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:21.550
because it was encrypted
with your old KC.

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:25.230
And I can get this KC
with pass that you shared.

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:27.270
Then I can use this to
decrypt the new password

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:28.160
you sent to the KDC.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.910
And even if you change
the password again,

01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:31.500
I can decrypt the
next round as well.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.833
And you can just keep going
and get the newest password.

01:18:33.833 --> 01:18:38.000
So in this particular password,
changing protocol, if you ever

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.040
disclose an old
password, then someone

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.330
could sort of unzip this whole
chain of encrypted messages

01:18:43.330 --> 01:18:45.860
and get your newest
password as well.

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.860
This is actually very
troublesome in the design.

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:48.360
Yeah.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.115
STUDENT: Doesn't the later
version of Kerberos [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:51.115 --> 01:18:52.240
PROFESSOR: Absolutely, yes.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.380
So there's actually
a solution to this

01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.490
that's not sort of fundamental.

01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:55.865
And this is
something they didn't

01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:57.160
realize in Kerberos version 4.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.610
There's actually this nice
mechanism called Diffie-Hellman

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:03.800
that I'll just sketch
out in like one minute

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.420
just so that you guys know
when to use it or et cetera.

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.920
But it's basically a solution
for this kind of a problem

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.630
where you want to stop this
unzipping from happening.

01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:13.730
So what happens in
the Kerberos version

01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:16.910
5 password changing protocol
is that actually you

01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:20.370
want to establish a new secret
that will not be apparent

01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:23.360
if you happen to decrypt all
the messages on the wire.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.620
And the way this works
is-- this is like some math

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.286
that you don't have
to fully understand.

01:19:27.286 --> 01:19:33.590
But the client some random value
X. And the kpassword server is

01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:35.630
going to pick some
other random value Y.

01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:37.820
And what they send to each
other are exponentiations

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.050
of these values.

01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:41.500
So the client sends
G to the power X

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:45.810
to the server and the server
sends G to the power Y

01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:47.260
back to the client.

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.890
And it turns out
that mathematically,

01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:52.110
what we can do now is the
client can take G to the Y,

01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:55.270
raise it to X, and get
this value G to the XY.

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:58.680
The server can take G to the
X, raise it to the power Y,

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.650
and get G to the XY as well.

01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:03.670
They can now use this
secret value G to the XY

01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:05.440
to encrypt their
subsequent messages,

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.710
including the new password.

01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:11.263
So you send the new password
encrypted with this value G

01:20:11.263 --> 01:20:13.400
to the XY, roughly speaking.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:14.830
But for some
mathematical reasons

01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:16.600
that we're not going
to cover right now,

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.350
it turns out to be super
difficult for someone that just

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:23.350
gets G to the X and G to the Y
by examining your packets later

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:26.200
from figuring out
what was G to the XY.

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.560
So this is something called
the discrete log problem.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.350
Yeah, question?

01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:31.140
STUDENT: But they have to
[INAUDIBLE] G at some point.

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:31.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.535
So G is some parameter
you could sort of send

01:20:33.535 --> 01:20:35.910
at the beginning of a protocol
or it could be just cooked

01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:36.640
into Kerberos.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:42.030
It turns out to be
relatively less important.

01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:44.410
All right, so anyway, use
Diffie-Hellman because this

01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:46.660
is called-- well, what you
should Google for if you're

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:50.920
building a protocol like this
is this Diffie-Hellman key

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:51.950
exchange protocol.

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:54.302
And Kerberos 5 actually
does this correctly.

01:20:54.302 --> 01:20:56.010
But this is something
to really watch out

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.169
for if you're designing any
kind of new protocol yourself.

01:20:59.169 --> 01:21:00.710
All right, so that's
it for Kerberos.

01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:03.160
Let's talk about SSL on Monday.
