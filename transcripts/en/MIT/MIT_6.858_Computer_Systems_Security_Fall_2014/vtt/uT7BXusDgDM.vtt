00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.940
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.760
Let's get started.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.670
So today we're going to talk
about Android security, which

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.180
is-- you can sort of think
of it as an interesting case

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.170
study of a system
that was designed

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.150
with quite a bit
of attention paid

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.720
to security in the first place.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.750
So this is perhaps in contrast
to many of the systems

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.930
we've looked at
so far, like Unix,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.570
or the web, browsers,
where security

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.260
was in many ways bolted
on after the fact

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.290
and wasn't really designed
in quite the same way

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.127
as you see in this paper,
where these guys who

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:01.710
designed the Android
were very worried

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.660
about particular
classes of attacks,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.500
and constructive mechanisms.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.765
Then figured out a better way
of structuring applications

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:12.210
that is going to allow us
to enforce security policies

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.790
in a better way in Android.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.355
And the cool thing about
it is that it's actually

00:01:18.355 --> 00:01:20.620
a pretty widely used system.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.115
So unlike some
research papers that

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.520
might propose a
new architecture,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.020
this actually gets
used in practice.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.311
And there's lots and lots of
Android devices out there.

00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:31.050
And we can talk about how well
some things have worked out,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.690
how well some things
didn't pan out.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.990
But we will, I
guess, look at what

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.000
parts of the design they
thought were important,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.140
what did they miss, what,
in practice, turns out

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.192
to matter or not.

00:01:46.192 --> 00:01:47.400
But it's kind of interesting.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.661
In some ways, it also
uses existing systems

00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:50.660
that we've talked about.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.660
So Android is built
on top of Unix.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.010
It's just a Linux kernel running
underneath the entire phone.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.240
So in many ways, they use some
of the familiar mechanisms

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.330
you guys have seen
in Lab 2 already,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.040
where you use Unix user IDs
and groups and all these things

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.579
to separate applications
from one another.

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.210
But in Android's case, they
have a very different way

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.960
of setting up user IDs
and file permissions,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.540
et cetera, than in a
typical Linux system.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.420
So I guess let's
start out by talking

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.093
about what is the threat level?

00:02:25.093 --> 00:02:28.820
What are these guys
worried about on a phone?

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.780
What's going on?

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.480
What are they trying
to protect against?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.344
What's the threat model?

00:02:34.344 --> 00:02:34.844
Yeah.

00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:37.326
AUDIENCE: Applications that
want to do malicious things?

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:37.992
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:39.090
So they worry
about-- I guess there

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.506
was these applications that
are going to run on the phone.

00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:44.910
And they might be malicious.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.810
And I guess there's-- well,
that there's outright malicious

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.680
applications that are
just out to get you,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.540
maybe steal your private data.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.440
So things you might worry
about-- there's data,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.290
there's things that
might cost money,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.030
like sending an SMS message
maybe, or making a phone call.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.461
There's maybe using the
internet, et cetera.

00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:07.960
So these are the,
presumably, things

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.820
you want to guard against
or protect on your phone.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.544
And then there's
things that go wrong.

00:03:12.544 --> 00:03:14.460
So presumably, there's
malicious applications,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.200
because these guys want to
allow users to install apps

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.620
written by developers
that Google has never

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.210
heard of themselves.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.035
Or it might be that apps just
have bugs themselves, that you

00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:28.570
have a well-meaning
developer, but they

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.550
forget to do something.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.270
And it would be nice
to help these guys

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.650
as well to build applications
that remain secure

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.150
despite the fact that
the app developer isn't

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.680
an expert in exactly every
kind of vulnerability

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.580
that might be exploited
in their application.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.350
So one thing we could
do is, actually, we

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.250
can-- because Android
is what we use,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.520
we can look at various
vulnerability reports.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.840
So there's this
database called CVE

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.330
that catalogs lots of
common vulnerabilities

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.900
in software systems.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.590
And it's actually
kind of interesting.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.598
There is a number of reports,
of course, of bugs in Android.

00:04:07.598 --> 00:04:09.960
And many of them are of the
flavor you guys have already

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.900
seen in the class.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.274
So there's still
buffer overflows

00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:13.610
in some parts of Android.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.960
There's bad default
choices for crypto systems.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.600
People forget to initialize
the random number

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.089
generator sometimes and
generate predictable keys.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.240
So all these things
do still happen.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.960
It's software.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.370
It's not immune from any
of the other problems

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.613
we've seen so far.

00:04:27.613 --> 00:04:30.020
But one cool thing
is that there doesn't

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.790
seem to be a huge
number of these issues.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.550
So they crop up
from time to time.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.780
But by large, can
fix these issues.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.360
And the system remains
reasonably secure

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.290
after you fix these bugs.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.280
So in many ways,
this, I think, design

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.620
is working reasonably well.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.590
So we'll look at it, I guess,
in more details later on as

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.790
to which parts of the design
are working to various degrees.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.570
But it seems to be a reasonably
well thought out design.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.160
Or at least much more so than
desktop Unix applications

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.750
that you've seen so far.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.480
All right.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.110
So maybe one way to approach
this is to figure out

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.880
how we're going to protect
data and various services

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.530
that might cost you
money, et cetera,

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.740
from malicious applications
is first to understand

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.940
what does an application look
like in an Android system.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.990
And then we'll talk about
how various permissions

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.940
or privileges are configured in
that application and enforced.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.860
So Android applications are
quite different from what

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.050
you've seen so far in terms
of desktop apps or web

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.100
applications.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.375
So instead of being
a monolithic piece

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:43.980
of code with a main function
that you start running,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.160
and you just keep
going forever, they're

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.640
actually much more modular.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.275
And the application, in the
case of Android, is-- actually,

00:05:52.275 --> 00:05:55.340
you can think of it as a
collection of components.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.090
And the paper talks about
four kinds of components

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.440
that the Android
framework provides to you

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.870
or gets the developer
to think in terms of.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.550
And the components
are roughly-- there's

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.969
something called an activity.

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.510
You might have an
activity component.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.350
And this is just a thing
that has a user interface.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.790
So these are things that
actually display things

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.450
to the user, or take
user input, touches,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.920
key presses, et cetera.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.660
In terms of security,
the Activity thing

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.910
has an interesting security
property that you probably

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.920
want to make sure your
user input is going

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.260
to one activity at a time.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.190
So the framework-- I believe
[? an ?] Android actually

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.137
ensures that there is only
one activity that's getting

00:06:39.137 --> 00:06:40.220
your user input at a time.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.550
So if you are running
your bank application,

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.610
you can be reasonably
confident that there's not

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.530
other applications in the
background grabbing the screen

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.390
presses corresponding to your
PIN number in your bank app.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.410
So having the framework be aware
of these different activities

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.690
helps enforce some security
properties with respect

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.970
to user input.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.650
All right.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.780
So these guys are the
user interface components

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.790
of an application.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.280
And then there's
three other types

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.870
of components that mostly
help an application

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.240
structure its own sort
of logic and interaction

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.180
with other components.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.650
So there is something
called a service component.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.220
And this guy just runs
in the background.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.990
So you might have
a service component

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.250
that monitors your location,
like in the application

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.089
these guys describe
in the paper.

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:37.880
Or you might have
services that pull things

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.020
from the network in the
background, et cetera.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.415
These guys have a content
provider component.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.580
And you can think of
these guys as just SQL

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.000
database you can define.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.880
Or you can define
a couple of tables

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.980
with a schema, et cetera.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.456
And you can run SQL
queries all over the data

00:07:59.456 --> 00:08:00.580
stored in that application.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.020
And having it be a
component is going

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.800
to allow the framework
to control access

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.070
to this database to say
who's allowed to run queries

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.700
against it.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.160
And then there's
something kind of unusual

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.580
that hasn't shown up in other
systems-- something called

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.189
a broadcast receiver.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.660
And this guy is going to be
used for receiving messages

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.010
from other parts of the system.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.520
So we'll talk about how
applications interact with one

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.040
other in terms of messages.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.539
All right.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.200
So this is some very
high-level logical view

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.549
of how you can think of
an Android application.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:46.550
But in reality, all these are
just Java classes or Java code

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.920
that the developer writes.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.340
And there's just some standard
interface for an activity,

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.006
for a service, for a
broadcast receiver,

00:08:53.006 --> 00:08:55.700
for a content provider
that you implement.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.490
But clearly, this is
all just Java code.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:02.870
And this application box is
really just a Java runtime

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.790
that runs on top of your phone.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:10.270
And it's just a single
process on the Linux

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.130
kernel running on your phone.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.820
And all these
components are just

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.310
different classes or pieces
of code running inside

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.375
of this Java runtime process.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:20.865
That make sense?

00:09:20.865 --> 00:09:24.590
That's how it sort of translates
to traditional processes

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.380
that you might
understand otherwise.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.360
And the other thing that sort
of shifts with an application

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.730
is what's called a manifest.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.010
So this is code that the
application developer

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.450
writes or compiles.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.940
But there's also
this manifest that

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.240
sits on the side, which
is a text or an XML file,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.540
really, that describes
all these components

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.980
and how other
parts of the system

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.630
should interact with
this application.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.550
So in particular,
this manifest is

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.280
going to talk about
things called labels

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.650
that we'll talk about
in a second that

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.820
define both the privileges
of this application in terms

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.580
of what it should
be allowed to do

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.200
as well as the
restrictions on who else

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.590
should be able to interact
with the different components

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.210
of this application.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.456
That make sense?

00:10:15.456 --> 00:10:18.100
Questions about how that works?

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.480
AUDIENCE: Is the
label something like,

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.194
this app cannot do the phone
call, or this app can send--

00:10:24.194 --> 00:10:24.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.670
So these labels are
going to be things

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.560
like, well, this application
can dial a phone,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.190
or can send an SMS message,
or can use the internet.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.205
So there's really
two kinds of labels.

00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:36.960
So we can draw them out here.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.690
So each application
has a list of labels

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.560
that describe the privileges
that the application has.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.690
So these are something
like maybe DIAL PERMISSION

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:54.700
for dialing a phone,
maybe INTERNET, et cetera.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.710
So we'll talk about how they're
described in a little bit.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.980
So these are privileges
that the application has.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.790
But then you can
also stick labels

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.670
on top of individual components.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.320
And there, they have
a different meaning.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.294
So these are privileges
that the application has.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.030
If you have a label
[? on a ?] component,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.410
it's a requirement
on anyone that

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.420
talks with the component to
have the corresponding label.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.220
So in their example,
maybe you have some sort

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:25.090
of a FRIEND VIEW privilege.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.805
So you are able to view the
locations of your friends.

00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:33.290
So that's like a privilege you
might have in an application.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.630
So you're allowed to do this.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.110
But then in order to
enforce this privilege,

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.130
you might actually put
this FRIEND VIEW label

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.920
onto a particular component.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.130
So you might say, well, my
content provider, the database

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.280
storing the location
of all my friends,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.330
might have the FRIEND
VIEW label attached to it.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.630
And what this means
is that anyone that

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.410
wants to access
this database better

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.400
have this label in
their privilege set.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.470
So that's how you
specify permissions.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.440
You can think these are as like
generalized user IDs or group

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.160
IDs from Unix, except
they're arbitrary

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.160
strings, which make them
slightly more flexible.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.493
You don't run out of these guys.

00:12:09.493 --> 00:12:11.000
You don't worry
so much about who

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.510
gets the number 25 or
silly things like that.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:19.594 --> 00:12:20.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.190
So turns out these guys
aren't-- at least in the design,

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.400
weren't super careful in
scoping these guys out.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.650
So you could totally have
two applications that decide

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.170
to introduce the same label.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.370
So these labels are
application-defined, partly.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.400
And you could have
two applications,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.050
like Facebook and Google+.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.785
They say, oh, we
want to both create

00:12:41.785 --> 00:12:46.262
a new permission string that's
View Your Friends In A Social

00:12:46.262 --> 00:12:47.070
Network.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:47.570
All right.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.110
Well, they're the same string.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.217
So by convention,
what happens is

00:12:51.217 --> 00:12:52.800
that these strings
are actually longer

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.924
than what I am drawing out.

00:12:53.924 --> 00:12:56.940
And they have the domain
of the Java-style domain

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.640
of the application
defining it in the string.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.944
So DIAL PERM, I
think, is actually

00:13:01.944 --> 00:13:03.735
something like
com.google.android.dialperm.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.600
I might have slightly
screwed this up.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.460
But roughly, these are
the kinds of strings

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.626
that show up in permissions.

00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:19.550
So if you have
well-meaning applications,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.577
then they won't collide in terms
of these permission strings.

00:13:23.577 --> 00:13:25.160
But it turns out
that nothing actually

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.300
enforces this,
unfortunately, in Android.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.035
So you do have some
potential problem

00:13:29.035 --> 00:13:32.940
that arise as a result
of this, that-- I don't

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.590
know why they weren't fixed.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.370
It's a little bit
tricky to fix them.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.420
Maybe these guys
thought, well, let's

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.140
do them now, [? for ?]
maybe they weren't

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:40.950
thinking of these issues.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:41.450
Anyway.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.270
So we'll see what
arises if you have

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.889
two applications that conflict
on the label names that we get.

00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:48.735
All right.

00:13:48.735 --> 00:13:50.930
Make sense?

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:51.770
All right.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.900
So this is what a single
application looks like.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.480
It's a bunch of Java code,
a manifest describing

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.930
the permissions for
the application,

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.500
and the required restrictions
on all the components.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.590
And then in order to communicate
between applications,

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.730
for the most part, it's
done through what's

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.950
called an intent,
which is an Android

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.240
thing that the developers of
this framework introduced.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:21.000
And an intent-- you can think
of it as a structured message

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.366
that-- we'll see how these
components of an intent

00:14:24.366 --> 00:14:25.740
are going to be
used in a second.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.650
But roughly, the intent
has three important things.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.320
There's other fields, of course.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.910
But the main thing is the name
of a component to which you

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.020
want to send a message.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.590
There's the action that you
want the component to take

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.601
and the data, along
with a MIME type,

00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:49.310
that you want to send
to this other component.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.770
So just as an example--
this is a little abstract--

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.140
but what you can imagine is
that this component is maybe--

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:04.670
you could imagine
com.android.dialer/Dial

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.660
or something.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.070
So this is how you name
a component in Android.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.120
You specify the name
of the application,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.030
which is kind of like this
Java inverted domain name.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.343
Like, com.android.dialer
is the name

00:15:17.343 --> 00:15:18.926
of an overall
application to which you

00:15:18.926 --> 00:15:20.260
want to send an intent.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.570
And then you write
something like /Dial.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.459
And Dial is the
name of a component.

00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:26.500
Would [? lend ?] that
target application to which

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.600
you are sending this message.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.210
OK.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.729
So that's how you name
the particular component

00:15:33.729 --> 00:15:35.020
where you want to send the guy.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.815
The action, there's a
predefined set of actions.

00:15:38.815 --> 00:15:41.090
You could stick in your
own things as well.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.717
But you might have
something like, I think,

00:15:44.717 --> 00:15:45.550
android.intent.DIAL.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.460
So this is a pre-defined string
or, by convention, a string

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.530
that applications put
on the Action field

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.370
if they want the phone dialer
to dial a phone number for them.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.194
So this is how you
stick something in here.

00:16:03.194 --> 00:16:04.110
There's other actions.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.320
Like, if you want
to view a document,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.240
you will stick something.view
in the Action field.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.970
This'll tell the
receiving component

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.950
that you just want to
view this object instead

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.670
of dialing the phone number
that's in the object, perhaps.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.500
And finally, the
data is basically

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.540
an arbitrary URI
or URL for the data

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:28.630
that you want to send
along with this message.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:32.600
So it could be something like
a telephone, colon, some digits

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.215
to dial the phone number.

00:16:34.215 --> 00:16:40.245
It could be an actual HTTP URL
that you want to view or open.

00:16:40.245 --> 00:16:42.070
It might be any
other applications

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.725
you find URI as well.

00:16:44.725 --> 00:16:47.080
So this is how you
send these messages.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.150
And the way these
messages are actually

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:55.120
routed through the system is
with the help of the Android

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.650
runtime itself that
sits underneath all

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.320
these applications.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.070
So you can think of
the Android runtime

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.500
as being somewhere between the
applications and the kernel.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.069
It's not quite
correct, but maybe

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.220
let's try to draw some
picture to clarify

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.750
what the architecture of
this thing looks like.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:20.400
So you have one application
that's running on Android.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.079
Perhaps you have
another application.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.920
These are all boxes
that are basically

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.800
these guys-- a
separate application

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.880
with a bunch of
components internally.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.720
Of course, these guys
are all processes running

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.352
on top of the Linux kernel.

00:17:36.352 --> 00:17:38.185
So that's providing
some degree of isolation

00:17:38.185 --> 00:17:39.840
between the applications.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.100
And then there's what the paper
calls the reference monitor.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.440
And this guy is
going to mediate all

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.650
the intent-level interactions
between the different apps

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.150
here.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.920
So if App 1 wants to
send a message to App 2,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.600
they actually are going to
send a message to the reference

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.842
monitor first.

00:17:59.842 --> 00:18:01.800
So this is how you send
all intents in Android,

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.440
is that you create one
of these intent messages.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.400
And you basically send it over
some pipe to this reference

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.335
monitor.

00:18:09.335 --> 00:18:11.590
So Android basically has
its own implementation

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:16.010
of pipes for sending these
kinds of intents, called binder.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.020
And every Android
application, by convention,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.460
is going to open a
binder connection over

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.580
to the reference monitor,
so the reference monitor

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.040
can get intents from
this application

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.050
as well as send messages
over to this application.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:35.110
So in our case, if App 1
writes an intent for App 2

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.120
to the reference monitor,
the reference monitor

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.790
is going to figure out where
this intent should go and relay

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.540
it over here to App 2.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.320
So Application 2 can
maybe start an activity,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.365
or receive a message, or
do a SQL query, et cetera,

00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:53.727
for App 1.

00:18:53.727 --> 00:18:56.185
Does that make sense, roughly,
in terms of what's going on?

00:18:56.185 --> 00:18:57.155
Yeah, question.

00:18:57.155 --> 00:18:59.095
AUDIENCE: Does
the label checking

00:18:59.095 --> 00:19:00.550
happen once it gets to that,
or does the reference monitor?

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.030
PROFESSOR: Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.330
So the reference monitor,
hugely, importantly,

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.650
is in charge of checking
all the permissions that are

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.650
represented by these labels.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.310
So you could imagine
different things

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.150
going on in terms of
checking the permissions

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.890
in the apps themselves.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.830
So why do these guys
actually do the checking

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.002
in the reference monitor
instead of in the applications?

00:19:26.002 --> 00:19:28.085
Would it make sense to do
the checking in the app?

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.479
Suppose we stuck the
label checks into App 1.

00:19:35.479 --> 00:19:36.520
Would that be reasonable?

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:36.900
Yeah?

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.699
AUDIENCE: Well, that
seems like a bad idea,

00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:41.537
because if someone
compromises the [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:41.537 --> 00:19:45.684
and is able to its behavior
and get past the checking.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:46.350
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.620
Right.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.770
So you probably don't want
to stick it in the sender,

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.350
because you don't really
want to trust the sender.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.558
So if you install a particular
malicious application,

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:54.320
if you want to be
able to handle,

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.860
that application
isn't going to be

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.925
guaranteed to do the
correct checks for us.

00:19:58.925 --> 00:20:00.600
So that seems a
little unfortunate.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.740
So we're not allowed to do
the checks on the sender site.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.350
What about doing the checks
on the receive side in App 2?

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.220
What about that?

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.110
Yeah?

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.359
AUDIENCE: You could, but
it would need crypto,

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:15.400
and you would need a PKI.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.007
So it would be much
more [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:17.590
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.970
So you're thinking this would
have to be crypto and have

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.510
to have a PKI involved.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.740
So I'm not sure you
have to have crypto,

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.880
because the kernel can tell
you exactly where things

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.736
are coming from.

00:20:27.736 --> 00:20:30.670
So you could still have the
reference monitor telling you,

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.260
oh, this is coming from App 1.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.914
So you don't really need
the PKI in that sense.

00:20:34.914 --> 00:20:36.455
It doesn't have to
be crypto-related.

00:20:36.455 --> 00:20:37.825
I think you need
crypto generally

00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:40.241
when you're talking over the
network, when there's nothing

00:20:40.241 --> 00:20:41.690
common that you can trust.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.736
Here, I think it's not
so much about crypto.

00:20:44.736 --> 00:20:47.299
Any other reasons why you
would actually maybe want it

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:47.998
in that reference monitor?

00:20:47.998 --> 00:20:48.464
Yeah?

00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:49.706
AUDIENCE: You might want
to shift the burden away

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:51.289
from the developer,
who ends up making

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:52.772
a lot of mistakes [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:53.480
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.650
I think a huge part
of it is app bugs.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.910
If you don't really
want silly bugs

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.630
that the application
developer makes

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.070
to compromise the security.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.610
So to the extent
possible, I think

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.930
you want to factor out common
functionality into code

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.260
that the developer doesn't
have to worry about so much,

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.960
or doesn't even have a
chance of screwing up.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.280
So this seems like partially
a good reason for sticking

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.100
to the reference monitor.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:15.520
Yeah?

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.103
AUDIENCE: It could
also be because you

00:21:17.103 --> 00:21:20.400
want to minimize the trusted
surface of the entire system.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.490
So you want to make the
reference monitor so small

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.531
that it can actually be
[? orbited ?] on its own,

00:21:24.531 --> 00:21:27.340
or have some component that
deals with the actual label

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.072
checking that can be
checked on its own.

00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:29.780
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:29.796
Yeah.

00:21:29.796 --> 00:21:31.680
So that seems like a
financially reasonable plan

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.480
as well, because the
security of the role system

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.100
depends on the reference
monitor being correct.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.850
Well, you could see
this going either way.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.058
Actually putting the logic
into the reference monitor

00:21:39.058 --> 00:21:40.670
makes the reference
monitor bigger.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.890
So you could make the
RM smaller by delegating

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.460
some work to the apps.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.751
Although, then there is some
library you have to audit.

00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:48.990
So it's not exactly clear.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.489
I think the one other
example I came up

00:21:51.489 --> 00:21:54.030
with for why to do this-- well,
I guess there was two things.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:54.790
One is just simplicity.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.290
I think it's easier
to do the checks

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.420
all in one place in many ways.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.005
So you can sort of-- as you were
saying, that you could really

00:22:02.005 --> 00:22:04.380
look at this and say, oh, yup,
the checks are being done.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.510
They're always being
done on every message.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.090
So that's convincing or good
from a software engineering

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:11.480
perspective, perhaps.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.620
Another thing is
that these intents

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.010
have two addressing modes.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.440
In particular, in
the paper, they

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.225
describe what are called
implicit and explicit intents.

00:22:22.225 --> 00:22:24.980
So explicit intents
are ones where

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.210
you specify some component.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.730
And you actually
say it has to go

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.920
to this particular component.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.994
So for these explicit intents,
it's actually totally fine

00:22:32.994 --> 00:22:34.660
to do the checking
on the receiver side,

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.780
because well, you know where
you're going to send it.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.696
You can send it there.

00:22:37.696 --> 00:22:40.450
And if it doesn't want to
allow you to send the message,

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.350
it'll drop it on the floor
or reject it somehow.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.770
But then there's also
implicit intents in Android,

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.590
where you don't
know, as a sender,

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.420
exactly which application you
want to receive your message.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.140
So this might happen if you
just want to view a picture

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.985
or you want to dial
a phone number,

00:22:56.985 --> 00:22:58.610
but you don't actually
know which phone

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.430
dialer the user has installed.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.735
Maybe it has a Google Voice,
Voice-over IP dialer, or Skype,

00:23:03.735 --> 00:23:05.630
or who knows what.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.990
So in those case, these
implicit intents actually

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.910
skip the component
name and just say,

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.860
I want this action to be
handled with this data

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.170
by some application out there.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.870
And in this case, it's the
job of the reference monitor

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.450
to find an application
that's suitable for handling

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.040
that kind of message--
dialing a phone number,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.556
viewing a PDF, or a JPEG
image, or what have you.

00:23:26.556 --> 00:23:28.180
And in that case,
the reference monitor

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.480
can actually take
permissions into account

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.160
when choosing a
suitable application.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.844
So it might be that there are
some very sensitive PDF viewer

00:23:36.844 --> 00:23:38.510
application you have
installed, and it's

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.550
capable of viewing
PDFs, but you don't want

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.180
it accessible to most apps.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.970
So maybe the permissions on it
don't allow that application

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:49.000
to receive PDF View messages
from the rest of the system.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.580
So in this case, the reference
monitor will look at this

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.390
and say, well,
you're not allowed

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.640
to send your request there,
but maybe another application

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.080
is willing to
handle your request.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.010
So this sort of simplifies
the user interface or user

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.680
interaction here by matching
an available system,

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.420
including and considering
the permissions that

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.495
are available to the sender.

00:24:08.495 --> 00:24:09.850
That make sense?

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.730
Does that make sense?

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.047
Any questions?

00:24:14.047 --> 00:24:15.045
Yeah.

00:24:15.045 --> 00:24:18.039
AUDIENCE: Would the reference
monitor ever be a bottleneck?

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:19.260
PROFESSOR: It could be, yeah.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.990
So a lot of these messages
are sent through the reference

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.520
monitor.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.870
And I don't know whether it's
actually currently multi-thread

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.450
or not.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.116
You probably could
make it multi-thread.

00:24:28.116 --> 00:24:29.830
I think the logic
it's implementing

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.880
doesn't involve maintaining
a lot of shared state.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.260
So you could probably process
many of intent messages

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.360
in parallel if need be.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.750
I suspect that
you could probably

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.050
avoid it being a bottleneck.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:43.745
For bulk things, Android
has an RPC mechanism

00:24:43.745 --> 00:24:45.120
that the paper
talks about, where

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.990
if you want to send
a lot of operations

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.650
to another application,
you actually

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.190
send what's called a bind
intent to the reference monitor,

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.870
saying, I want a direct
connection to this application.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.150
And if you send a bind intent
to the reference monitor

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.900
and it [? forwards the app ?]
to this app,

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.291
then you're going to establish
this sort of bound channel

00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:03.790
between these two
apps and then send

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.950
lots of messages
directly [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.410
So if some
application is worried

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.470
about an interface which
is performance-critical,

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.580
they'll probably do this.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.862
Yeah, question?

00:25:13.862 --> 00:25:15.826
AUDIENCE: Why does
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:15.826 --> 00:25:20.250
Because every single label
needs to match [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:21.950
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.890
So here, it's not
the case that you get

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.760
direct access inside of App 2.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.240
It's not that you can directly
manipulate all the stuff

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.650
in the address space or
the objects of App 2.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.320
You just get a channel
that the other application

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.670
is willing to look
at messages of

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.540
and do something sensible
with these messages.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.560
So it's up to the Application 2
here to look at these messages

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.080
and do something
sensible with them,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.850
not to allow arbitrary code
execution or arbitrary access.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.210
But in this application, I think
they have two operations where

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.560
you can add a new friend or
enable or disable tracking

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.140
through this interface.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.480
So there's well-defined
messages that you define.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.660
And you're going to
implement probably

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.180
one of these [? surface ?]
components that's

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.554
responsible for
taking a message,

00:26:07.554 --> 00:26:11.411
and checking that it's sensible,
and executing that operation.

00:26:11.411 --> 00:26:11.910
Question?

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.860
AUDIENCE: Well, so
I guess intents are

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.826
usually human-initiated, right?

00:26:16.826 --> 00:26:18.326
PROFESSOR: Oftentimes yeah.

00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:18.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.330
And humans are pretty slow.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.960
So it's unlikely that the
reference monitor is going

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.169
to be any kind of bottleneck.

00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:25.709
PROFESSOR: Yes,
that's probably true.

00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:26.520
Yeah.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.141
It depends on exactly, yeah, I
guess how you're using intents.

00:26:29.141 --> 00:26:30.390
It's a little bit of a bummer.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.130
In the paper, they say
that the permissions

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.711
add [? buying ?] time are
checked by the reference

00:26:35.711 --> 00:26:36.210
monitor.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.001
But the permissions on
individual RPC calls

00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:39.456
between these
applications are not

00:26:39.456 --> 00:26:40.830
checked by the
reference monitor,

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.829
because you have this
direct channel between two

00:26:42.829 --> 00:26:44.110
applications.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.150
So presumably, actually,
I don't know exactly why

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.530
they chose to do it this way.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:52.300
Perhaps it's to get away from
having a reference monitor be

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.690
any kind of bottleneck for
[? handy ?] communication.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:00.050
But it means that the
permissions for individual RPC

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.270
operations between
the applications

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.920
have to be done in software
inside of the application

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.805
logic, which is a little bit
unfortunate if we want to avoid

00:27:08.805 --> 00:27:11.370
the application developer
making these kinds of mistakes

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.596
and maybe forgetting to check
the permissions on some RPC

00:27:14.596 --> 00:27:16.370
calls.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.835
So in some ways, if you are
purely worried about security,

00:27:18.835 --> 00:27:21.430
it might have been nicer
to forward all the RPCs

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.690
through the reference
monitor as well,

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.310
because then the reference
monitor is going to make sure

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.040
that it checks permissions
on every RPC call

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.560
instead of just at
the time you establish

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.717
a channel for future RPC
calls between two apps.

00:27:34.717 --> 00:27:38.629
That make sense?

00:27:38.629 --> 00:27:39.840
All right.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.340
OK.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.025
So let's try to figure out-- one
interesting thing [? to do ?]

00:27:44.025 --> 00:27:48.670
to try to contrast is, why
did these guys-- before we

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.170
dive into a little
bit more details,

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.700
why did these guys
design a whole new app

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.180
model for Android applications
as opposed to-- we've

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.850
seen already.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.497
There's desktop applications,
there's web applications.

00:28:00.497 --> 00:28:02.205
Why did these guys
invent a whole new way

00:28:02.205 --> 00:28:03.300
of writing software?

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.760
Because in some ways, this is
confusing for the developer,

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.140
because I am used to
writing my nice little C

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.727
program with a main function.

00:28:09.727 --> 00:28:11.560
I look at this and say,
well, what the hell?

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.175
I mean, what am I
going to do with-- I

00:28:13.175 --> 00:28:14.790
have to define four
kinds of components,

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.206
and I have to send
intents instead

00:28:16.206 --> 00:28:18.280
of just having a C
struct and writing

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.520
[? straight line ?] code.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.390
So what are the pros or
cons of existing app models?

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:33.140
So we have, I guess,
desktop apps and web apps.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.647
Why do we need a third
column, so to say?

00:28:36.647 --> 00:28:38.730
Because what are the nice
things about these guys?

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.229
Yeah?

00:28:39.229 --> 00:28:41.940
AUDIENCE: Well, the model has
completely changed now, right?

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.677
Because I think on
desktop apps, you

00:28:43.677 --> 00:28:45.510
don't put as much
trust in the developers

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.460
as you put in mobile apps.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.810
And you have a bunch of
more users that are less

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.902
[? inexperienced ?] than the
desktop users who end up having

00:28:54.902 --> 00:28:57.360
a bunch of apps that really
want to [? isolate ?] from each

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.000
other.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.960
PROFESSOR: It could be.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.335
So you think in
the desktop case,

00:29:00.335 --> 00:29:02.251
we don't have to trust
the developers as much?

00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:03.430
AUDIENCE: Of course you do.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.256
But it seems that there's always
like your son or your cousin

00:29:07.256 --> 00:29:10.567
that you take care of their
desktop if it goes bad.

00:29:10.567 --> 00:29:11.513
PROFESSOR: [LAUGHS]

00:29:11.513 --> 00:29:12.657
AUDIENCE: But with
your phone, there's

00:29:12.657 --> 00:29:13.440
a different problem altogether.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.280
PROFESSOR: I guess it's cool
that the phones don't need

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.560
a cousin to take care of them.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.954
So that's great, right?

00:29:18.954 --> 00:29:21.910
But in terms of security,
one thing on the desktop apps

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.300
is that you can't
install-- or it's

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:32.390
really hard to install
new apps or maybe-- well,

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.360
probably not quite exactly
true, because you can always

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.830
click an executable and install
an app on a desktop case.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.200
But I guess people don't install
apps regularly sort of tend to

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.840
maybe-- because it
depends on the usage

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.798
model of a desktop app.

00:29:44.798 --> 00:29:47.400
But typically, you have
a fixed set of software

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.780
you are running as
opposed to on a web app,

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.910
one cool thing is that it's
very easy to run new apps.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.405
You just visit a website,
and there's nothing really

00:29:59.405 --> 00:30:01.155
you have to do other
than click on a link.

00:30:01.155 --> 00:30:05.760
And off you are on some new site
running some new Application.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.705
So that's a pretty nice
property of web apps.

00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:11.120
One bummer about desktop
apps is that there's actually

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:16.170
no isolation at all
between applications.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.266
That's perhaps somewhat
related to the fact

00:30:18.266 --> 00:30:19.640
that it's hard to
install an app,

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.990
because you really
are trusting it

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.820
fully with all the
data on your machine

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.903
when you're installing it.

00:30:24.903 --> 00:30:27.150
There is no isolation
between one app

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.096
that you install in your laptop
and probably any other thing

00:30:30.096 --> 00:30:31.470
running there, or
any of the data

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.450
that you are storing
on that computer.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.410
Whereas in the web
app case, there's

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.020
some reasonable isolation.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.489
As long as you believe the
same origin policy is correctly

00:30:41.489 --> 00:30:44.030
[INAUDIBLE] by the browser, then
you're in pretty good shape.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.100
It's reasonably safe to probably
go to some arbitrary website

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.282
and start using
their application.

00:30:49.282 --> 00:30:51.240
It's not going to
tamper with other sites

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.274
that you have open
in your browser,

00:30:53.274 --> 00:30:55.190
assuming they don't
exploit some browser bugs.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.980
So far, it looks like the web
apps are the winning plan.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.410
They're easy to use,
they have isolation.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.651
Why don't these guys use
web apps for Android?

00:31:07.651 --> 00:31:08.150
Yeah?

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.820
AUDIENCE: So web
apps are starting

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.280
to become like an operating
system in themselves, right?

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:18.480
So you have Firefox OX, which is
basically just a web mobile OS.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.450
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:19.950
OK.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.324
So you're arguing that actually
these guys were mistaken.

00:31:22.324 --> 00:31:24.840
They shouldn't have built
a new Android stack.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.100
They should have just
done a giant web browser

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.750
as your phone.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.843
AUDIENCE: Well, at least Mozilla
has shown that it's possible.

00:31:32.843 --> 00:31:33.551
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:35.443
OK, fair enough.

00:31:35.443 --> 00:31:38.030
So it's at least more reasonable
to go with the web apps

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.190
route rather than the desktop
route, at least for phone.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.690
Yeah?

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:45.458
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
phone call from a web apps,

00:31:45.458 --> 00:31:48.519
you need [? an entire new ?]
API for the web app interface

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:49.342
with the phone.

00:31:49.342 --> 00:31:50.050
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:53.746
So the one limitation that
might be fixable, of course,

00:31:53.746 --> 00:31:58.922
but is still there
is maybe there's

00:31:58.922 --> 00:32:03.200
no APIs for some of the devices.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.970
This is increasingly
becoming less so.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.270
Like, for a camera or for
a GPS, these are slowly

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.090
being added to the web case.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.170
But there is probably
not quite an API

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.360
for accessing your phone
yet, or sending an SMS

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.450
message, and things like that.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.000
Another bummer in web apps
is there is actually limited

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.490
sharing that you can do.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.029
So we were just talking
about implicit intents

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:28.820
in Android, where you
could just say, well,

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.197
I want to view
this JPEG picture,

00:32:30.197 --> 00:32:32.280
but who knows what
application's going to open it?

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.020
Or I want to view this PDF file.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.235
Or I want to share
this picture I just

00:32:36.235 --> 00:32:38.530
took with my camera with
a friend through email,

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.860
but I don't know what email
application you're using.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.390
Let's just ask the
reference monitor

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:45.722
to find me some
email program that's

00:32:45.722 --> 00:32:47.460
going to send this picture out.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.501
So it's something you can
actually do in Android.

00:32:49.501 --> 00:32:51.697
But it's kind of hard
to do in a web app case,

00:32:51.697 --> 00:32:53.155
because every
interaction, you have

00:32:53.155 --> 00:32:55.110
to refer to a particular URL.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.730
So if you don't know what
PDF viewer someone is using,

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.110
you might not know
what URL to open

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:05.583
to ask it to view the PDF
[? potentially. ?] Question?

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:08.068
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:08.068 --> 00:33:11.384
But JavaScript is very
hard to read [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:11.384 --> 00:33:12.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:16.160
So one bummer is that yeah,
this is all JavaScript. [LAUGHS]

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.775
So it's potentially unfortunate.

00:33:17.775 --> 00:33:20.640
But it's maybe not as good
in terms of performance.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.440
Maybe it's hard to
understand what it's doing.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:29.894
It might be hard to compile
efficiently, et cetera.

00:33:29.894 --> 00:33:31.286
Yeah.

00:33:31.286 --> 00:33:33.610
Because one nice thing about
the desktop [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.250
is that sharing is easy.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:39.990
So one side effect of having
all your files be accessible

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.810
in every app is that,
well, you just share.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.330
It's very easy to access
any data you have.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.525
And in some ways, if you
really want a lot of sharing,

00:33:48.525 --> 00:33:49.390
this is great.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.532
Like, I probably could-- it
might be a little bit tricky

00:33:52.532 --> 00:33:54.365
to implement some things
on Android that are

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:55.830
easy to do in the desktop case.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:56.810
So in the desktop
case, if I want

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.310
to compile a piece of software,
I'm going to run [? Make. ?]

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:04.030
That's going to run GCC
and maybe other programs.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.520
And they're all collaborating
on the same C source

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.090
code in the single directory.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.746
They're all building it.

00:34:09.746 --> 00:34:11.120
It might be a
little bit trickier

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.969
to do in the Android case,
where data is kind of associated

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.077
with a primary
application, but storing it

00:34:17.077 --> 00:34:18.884
in a [? quantum ?] provider.

00:34:18.884 --> 00:34:20.300
So it might be a
little bit tricky

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.650
to have an Android world where
I have my source code stored

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.600
somewhere, and then I
install a C compiler,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.865
and [? a Make ?] program, and
an assembler, and other things.

00:34:28.865 --> 00:34:30.380
And they all sort
of work together.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.111
It's a little bit harder to do.

00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:34.035
You probably could
do it somehow.

00:34:34.035 --> 00:34:37.114
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:37.114 --> 00:34:37.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.159
So you could probably work
around it in some ways.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.580
So I think Android is certainly
general purpose enough

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.989
to let you somehow do it.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:49.150
But it's probably not quite as
natural to do this in Android

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.480
as it would be in
a desktop case.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.090
Not that I'm arguing
the desktop case.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.840
But it's not quite as secure.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.169
But yeah.

00:34:56.169 --> 00:34:56.960
Any other comments?

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.846
Yeah?

00:34:57.846 --> 00:35:00.693
AUDIENCE: Another
thing might be the case

00:35:00.693 --> 00:35:02.680
that we're optimizing
for different web

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.772
apps [INAUDIBLE] constrained.

00:35:05.772 --> 00:35:08.718
I'm not sure what [INAUDIBLE]
tend to be constrained by.

00:35:08.718 --> 00:35:10.682
But [? web apps ?]
tend to be constrained

00:35:10.682 --> 00:35:13.137
by both RAM and processing.

00:35:13.137 --> 00:35:16.279
And much more so than either
desktop or web apps, certainly.

00:35:16.279 --> 00:35:16.945
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:16.945 --> 00:35:19.230
So it might be that solid
engineering decisions

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.067
around how to
optimize these things

00:35:21.067 --> 00:35:22.150
are going to be different.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.905
I guess one unfortunate
thing about web apps,

00:35:23.905 --> 00:35:26.196
at least at the time these
guys were designing Android,

00:35:26.196 --> 00:35:28.600
is that it was difficult
to run a web app offline.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.560
If your phone doesn't have
strong enough cellphone

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.535
reception, then it might be hard
for you to run the application

00:35:35.535 --> 00:35:37.780
if some parts of it
fell out of the cache.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.935
I think slowly, as
you were pointing out,

00:35:39.935 --> 00:35:42.400
the web app world is
catching up to Android.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.780
But many of these
limitations are getting

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.620
fixed or sort of improved.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.857
So it might be that
these days, web

00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:53.950
apps are a reasonable model for
starting a new phone platform.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.310
But five years ago,
this Android world

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.800
was necessary, because the
web apps weren't quite there.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.230
Probably not quite there
still yet, but nowadays,

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.310
it might be easier
to push the web apps

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:10.300
all the way to where Android is
rather than start from scratch.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.240
All right.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:17.190
So I guess we can still
talk about what Android

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.716
did even though maybe
today you wouldn't

00:36:19.716 --> 00:36:21.720
have done it the same way.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.275
But I guess in
terms of isolation,

00:36:24.275 --> 00:36:28.600
we can start talking maybe about
security a little bit more.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.125
Android relies on
the Linux kernel,

00:36:30.125 --> 00:36:33.540
as I mentioned, to isolate
these apps from one another.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:38.330
So what happens is that the
Android framework actually

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:45.230
sets user IDs so that this
application has perhaps

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.270
UID 1,001.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.930
This application
runs as UID 1,002.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.990
And the reference monitor
is basically [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:55.860
So I think it
might run as UID 0,

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.840
although I forget the detail.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.860
But I think it does run
as UID 0 on Android.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.330
So the Linux kernel is largely
responsible for keeping

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:08.030
the apps separate
from one another.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.740
And mostly, interactions
between user IDs

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.172
happens through these intents.

00:37:13.172 --> 00:37:15.630
And then there's a little bit
of details in terms of things

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.420
that the Linux kernel
actually enforces

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:22.220
in terms of which UID is allowed
to do which operation as well.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.592
So we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:37:24.592 --> 00:37:28.820
One interesting question is
why did these guys choose Java?

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.640
Like, what's the role
of Java in Android?

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.199
Why is Java there at all?

00:37:36.199 --> 00:37:37.240
Is it enforcing anything?

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:37.720
Yeah.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.803
AUDIENCE: I think it
enforces [? text messaging ?]

00:37:39.803 --> 00:37:40.942
and [? downstreaming. ?]

00:37:40.942 --> 00:37:41.650
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:42.150
OK.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.460
So what do we get out of it?

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.533
Is it like for security,
for probability?

00:37:50.394 --> 00:37:52.560
One other way to think of
it is suppose we took away

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.446
Java and made all the
apps written in C,

00:37:55.446 --> 00:37:57.320
or, like, Assembly, or
don't require anything

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.430
at all for that matter.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:59.753
Would anything break?

00:37:59.753 --> 00:38:00.253
Yeah.

00:38:00.253 --> 00:38:02.185
AUDIENCE: You have
vulnerabilities [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:02.185 --> 00:38:03.851
override these important values.

00:38:03.851 --> 00:38:04.600
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.790
Yeah, it could be.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.880
So like an app could have
some buffer overflow in it.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.219
So how bad would that be?

00:38:11.219 --> 00:38:13.690
AUDIENCE: It could
override with permissions.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:15.700
PROFESSOR: Which permissions?

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.694
AUDIENCE: Like the latency.

00:38:17.694 --> 00:38:18.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.520
Well, actually, let's see.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.220
So as we were talking
about, the reference monitor

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.100
is the thing that does all
the label checking for us.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.650
And the reference
monitor actually,

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:31.220
in Android, stores a list of
all the installed applications

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.730
along with the labels
that correspond

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:35.810
to all those applications.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.310
So it's probably
true that you don't

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:40.270
want any kinds of bugs
in the reference monitor

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:42.549
regardless of what
language it's written in.

00:38:42.549 --> 00:38:44.090
So having the
reference monitor being

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:45.881
written in a type-safe
language is probably

00:38:45.881 --> 00:38:46.930
a good thing in general.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.400
And I like Java.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.850
I can sense that it's
a type-safe language

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.000
and has all these
nice properties.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.320
But if an application
were to be written in C

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.170
and had a buffer
overflow, it wouldn't

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:00.050
be able to corrupt directly the
labels stored in the reference

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:01.150
monitor here.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:03.860
So that wouldn't be
as big of a deal.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.360
Yeah.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.296
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.800
PROFESSOR: It could be.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.190
So why would that be helpful?

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.950
AUDIENCE: There's some
system [INAUDIBLE] that it

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:18.574
can actually override C?

00:39:18.574 --> 00:39:19.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.276
So in principle, it
might be nice to avoid

00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:23.130
the applications talking
directly to the Linux kernel.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.004
[INAUDIBLE] in Android,
this is not the case.

00:39:25.004 --> 00:39:26.690
So actually,
Android applications

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.890
can make arbitrary system
calls if they want to.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.520
And in fact,
applications I should say

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.480
can shift with
arbitrary components

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.870
written in C or Assembly
for performance reasons.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.200
So some games [? shift ?] with
the computationally intensive

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.050
parts written in
C. And they sort of

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:44.254
talk to it from Java as well.

00:39:44.254 --> 00:39:45.844
AUDIENCE: So I
guess part of it is

00:39:45.844 --> 00:39:47.902
being able to use all
of the stuff that's

00:39:47.902 --> 00:39:49.710
been written for Java.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.895
They wanted to make
it easy to build

00:39:51.895 --> 00:39:53.350
applications for developers.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:55.290
And one of the easy
ways of doing that

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.876
is being able to take advantage
of the massive Java libraries

00:39:57.876 --> 00:39:58.462
out there.

00:39:58.462 --> 00:39:59.170
PROFESSOR: Mm-hm.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:39:59.670
Yeah.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.730
So I think one big reason for
using Java is the usability.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:05.820
They wanted to-- I think Java
has little to do with security

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.960
and mostly with programmability,
ease of development.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.875
One other thing that
I think is going on

00:40:11.875 --> 00:40:15.190
is that-- well, to contrast
with iPhones, for example.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.510
iPhones also really want
ease of development.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:21.450
But they use Objective C, which
has buffer overflows if you

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:22.350
try hard enough.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.340
And it is specific to
a particular hardware.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.540
It doesn't maybe have
all the same libraries.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:29.835
I think the main reason
why the Android guys

00:40:29.835 --> 00:40:31.320
went with Java is
probably the fact

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.290
that they weren't manufacturing
devices at the same time.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.735
So the iPhones
knew exactly it was

00:40:35.735 --> 00:40:37.860
going to be this ARM
processor running their phone.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.780
So they could compile to
ARM and be done with it.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.460
And it's more efficient,
because battery

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.770
matters a lot on a phone.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:48.270
And the Android guys use Java,
which probably is slightly

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:51.120
less power-efficient or
CPU-efficient, because it

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.056
involves this JRE, et cetera.

00:40:53.056 --> 00:40:54.430
But the cool thing
about it, it's

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:56.200
actually portable
between architectures.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.750
So if you have a phone that
has a MIPS processor, or an ARM

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.280
processor, or an x86
processor, the Java application

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.280
can be run on all three
of these kinds of devices.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.420
And the Android guys
wanted their platform

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:11.550
to be usable on any kind
of hardware or phone.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:13.305
So that's probably
one big reason

00:41:13.305 --> 00:41:15.695
for why they use Java
in all these cases,

00:41:15.695 --> 00:41:18.120
and probably less so in
terms of [? staying ?]

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.360
security consideration for Java.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.450
So in fact, it turns out that
the Java runtime doesn't really

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:28.190
provide any security purpose
for the application and is just

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.430
sort of a nice
convenience thing,

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.532
as well as providing all the
abstractions that the developer

00:41:33.532 --> 00:41:34.573
should think in terms of.

00:41:34.573 --> 00:41:36.156
But in terms of
isolation, it's mostly

00:41:36.156 --> 00:41:38.090
up to the kernel and
the reference monitor

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:41.300
to keep these guys in line.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.030
That make sense?

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.938
Any questions?

00:41:45.938 --> 00:41:47.854
AUDIENCE: Doesn't the
ease of development also

00:41:47.854 --> 00:41:49.895
kind of translate into
some security [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:49.895 --> 00:41:52.634
Because if you write that
reference monitor in C,

00:41:52.634 --> 00:41:54.800
I can see much more
ways to make a mistake.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.466
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:41:55.466 --> 00:41:57.966
So you're absolutely right.

00:41:57.966 --> 00:42:00.320
Actually, I shouldn't have
said that ease of development

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.520
has nothing to do with security.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.061
This is completely
silly, because you

00:42:03.061 --> 00:42:07.290
want to make it as easy as
possible to write correct code.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.870
And it's all about
covering mistakes.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:12.560
So in some ways,
having a system where

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.400
it's easy to write correct code
is the most important security

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.680
consideration to have.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.240
So in some sense, you're
right, that it avoids the bugs.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.840
But you don't want your
application written in C.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.200
Or I don't know why Apple has
Objective C. It's actually

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.780
a little bit of a
problem in this regard,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.670
because you could
easily have buffer

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:28.930
overflows in your application.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.230
And if that application
matters a lot,

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.540
then it's vulnerable
potentially.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.935
Not with respect to compromising
other applications, but you're

00:42:36.935 --> 00:42:38.518
[? all like, ?] bank
app, I don't want

00:42:38.518 --> 00:42:39.662
that bank app written in C.

00:42:39.662 --> 00:42:40.328
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:42:40.328 --> 00:42:40.990
Yeah.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:44.000
AUDIENCE: Is the reference
monitor written in Java or C?

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.560
PROFESSOR: So in Android, the
reference monitor is largely

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.610
written in Java, yes.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:50.510
There are some native hooks
that it needs in order

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.546
to be able to talk to these
intent interface-- pipes,

00:42:53.546 --> 00:42:54.920
basically, to talk
to the binder,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.380
they need some native code.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.295
They need some native code
to spawn these applications

00:42:58.295 --> 00:42:59.544
in the first place, et cetera.

00:42:59.544 --> 00:43:02.955
But by and large, most of
the logic is written in Java.

00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:06.674
So it's actually a reasonably
safe plan, I think.

00:43:06.674 --> 00:43:10.090
Any other questions about this?

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:11.974
All right.

00:43:11.974 --> 00:43:16.020
So I guess let's try to figure
out what are these application

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.170
UIDs used for other than
to keep applications

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:22.700
separate from another in
terms of their processes?

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.890
So I guess the main
thing that applications

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:29.240
need to use the UID for or
that we need to somehow support

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.430
is the ability to share access
to shared resources and shared

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:35.570
data in the system.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.560
And we already saw one
mechanism for doing it,

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.910
which is to send intents
to the reference monitor.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.230
But there's a bunch of things
that, in Android, are not

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:48.250
done through intents to
the reference monitor.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.780
And they have to do
probably with performance,

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.564
or why-- basically, why isn't
everything sent through intents

00:43:54.564 --> 00:43:56.480
is probably because there
are some performance

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.860
considerations.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.540
You don't want to
invoke the reference

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.490
monitor in every single
thing you do in the system.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:05.200
And there's a couple of things
that an Android are like this.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.200
The simplest one is
probably network access.

00:44:10.151 --> 00:44:11.775
So if you want to
talk to the internet,

00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:14.730
you just open a
socket, very much

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.340
like you would on a standard
Linux application today.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.715
The application can just ask
the kernel, I want a socket,

00:44:19.715 --> 00:44:21.310
I want to connect
to this machine.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:22.806
Go for it.

00:44:22.806 --> 00:44:26.350
So network access
happens to work this way.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.420
Access to removable storage.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.940
So if you have an SD
card in your phone,

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.420
that also directly goes
through the kernel.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.810
Or more generally, any
kind of file system access

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:40.116
or direct access to the
file system, at least,

00:44:40.116 --> 00:44:41.490
goes directly
through the kernel,

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.020
because there is already
a file system there.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.430
And you want to avoid probably
[INAUDIBLE] performance

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:48.920
overheads on that.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:54.610
And also, for most
devices that are hardware,

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:58.610
Android allows the application
to directly talk to the device

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:02.100
instead of mediating the access
through the reference monitor.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:07.280
So this is things like probably
your camera, your GPS device,

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.160
compass, et cetera.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.490
And these guys just show up in
Android in Linux as something

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:15.526
like /dev/camera.

00:45:15.526 --> 00:45:18.750
And this is just
a Linux device you

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.478
could open, and get the
camera data out, and control

00:45:21.478 --> 00:45:23.970
the camera in whatever
ways you want, et cetera.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.870
And the cool thing is that if
you want to do some specialized

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:29.045
things to this device,
you're not restricted

00:45:29.045 --> 00:45:31.220
to what Java allows you to do.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.750
You can always
write C code or even

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.780
Assembly that directly
talks to the kernel

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.810
and performs the necessary
operations on this Linux

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.380
device, making
arbitrary system calls.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.060
And you could wrap this up
in a Java native interface

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:49.018
to expose it to the rest of your
Java-based application here.

00:45:49.018 --> 00:45:49.518
Yeah.

00:45:49.518 --> 00:45:52.101
AUDIENCE: But you still have the
checks in these calls, right?

00:45:52.101 --> 00:45:54.409
So when you open
a socket, someone

00:45:54.409 --> 00:45:56.950
has to check if they're allowed
to open a socket [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:57.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.500
So this is an interesting thing.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.010
Now these things are outside
our intent-based model.

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:03.740
So how are we going
to protect these guys?

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.485
So this sort of boils
down to doing something

00:46:06.485 --> 00:46:07.860
very similar to
what you guys did

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.900
in Lab 2, which is
you [INAUDIBLE] you

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.940
want to enforce it using UIDs.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.850
Basically, the
Android framework is

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:19.440
responsible for carefully
orchestrating the UIDs and GIDs

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.200
of the applications
and of these things

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:28.340
to enforce whatever policy was
specified in terms of labels.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:31.970
So the way this works
out is that for every one

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:35.950
of these resources, there
is a pre-defined label

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:39.100
string that defines
the privilege

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.515
to access this resource.

00:46:40.515 --> 00:46:41.890
So for this network
access thing,

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:45.430
for example, I think
there's a string, something

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.570
like
android.permissions.INTERNET.

00:46:55.590 --> 00:47:00.410
So this is a label that an
application can ask for.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:06.405
And if an application has this
label in its set of privileges,

00:47:06.405 --> 00:47:08.600
then it should be able
to access the network.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.930
And the way this is
enforced-- so the label

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:12.714
is the policy side of this.

00:47:12.714 --> 00:47:14.450
How do you specify
what should happen?

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:17.850
And the enforcement
mechanism is a small change

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:20.420
to the Linux kernel in
Android, where in order

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.260
to make any network-related
system calls,

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.520
you have to be a member
of some magic group.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.540
This is not at all how things
work in Linux traditionally.

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.804
But in Android, there is
some magic group [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:31.804 --> 00:47:35.610
I think it's GID 3003.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.530
And the kernel has this
number hard-coded in it.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:45.315
And if the process has this
group ID in its group list,

00:47:45.315 --> 00:47:48.059
then it's allowed to use a
network-related system call.

00:47:48.059 --> 00:47:50.350
And if it doesn't have this
group ID in its group list,

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.030
then it's not allowed to make
any network-related system

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.980
calls at all.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.250
So this is how Android is able
to translate these label--

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:02.480
sort of maintain a single,
coherent policy system that's

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.482
in terms of these label
screens, but enforce it

00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:06.240
in different ways.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.310
So sometimes it gets enforced
by the reference monitor.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:11.150
And other times,
it gets enforced

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:15.000
by setting GIDs or
UIDs appropriately.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.990
The same thing actually
happens with SD cards.

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:20.150
There's another GID that
corresponds to having access

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:21.120
with the SD card.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.220
And there's a string that
gets translated into this GID,

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.320
effectively.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.884
And same for the file system.

00:48:27.884 --> 00:48:29.300
I guess in the
file system, things

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.460
are a little bit trickier.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.263
I guess the SD card
is in the file system

00:48:32.263 --> 00:48:36.720
and has a specific GID for
accessing the entire SD card.

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:42.250
Another sort of other files
in the phone's file system--

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.450
there, the policy isn't
so much controlled

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:49.340
by labels, but rather
by Android's design,

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.380
which is that each application
has a private directory

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.060
that it can use to store
whatever files it wants.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.770
And in particular,
the content provider,

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:00.580
the SQL database that you're
going to use as an application,

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.140
is stored in your
private directory.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.660
And the policy is only the
application's UID can access

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.650
that private directory,
and no one else

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:10.216
can access it directly.

00:49:10.216 --> 00:49:12.620
And then for
devices, there's also

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.220
a plan very similar to
network access, where

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:19.540
there's a permission string
for accessing GPS, the camera,

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.570
et cetera.

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.345
And for each one
of these, there's

00:49:22.345 --> 00:49:27.850
a GID that is used in the
permissions on that device.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:31.970
So for example, dev/camera
is owned by some magic GID.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.064
And any application that should
have access to that camera

00:49:35.064 --> 00:49:37.450
has that GID in its [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:38.395
All make sense?

00:49:38.395 --> 00:49:44.350
It was hopefully fairly similar
to what you guys did in Lab 2.

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:47.992
Well, not the label part,
but the using UIDs and GIDs

00:49:47.992 --> 00:49:50.357
to get somewhere [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:50.357 --> 00:49:52.249
Make sense?

00:49:52.249 --> 00:49:54.630
All right.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:56.850
So one interesting question
is why do these guys

00:49:56.850 --> 00:50:01.070
have such a course-grained
plan for handling the SD card?

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:04.455
Why don't they
have different apps

00:50:04.455 --> 00:50:06.520
act [? with ?] different
parts of the SD card?

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.815
I probably have lots
of stuff in my SD card

00:50:08.815 --> 00:50:11.520
that I don't want
applications to-- you know,

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.012
to have access to all of it.

00:50:14.012 --> 00:50:14.900
Make sense?

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.530
Yeah.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.821
AUDIENCE: Maybe it has
something to do with [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:17.821 --> 00:50:19.814
that a user has to
approve those permissions.

00:50:19.814 --> 00:50:22.034
And the less of them you
have, the more likely

00:50:22.034 --> 00:50:25.540
it is to actually [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.830
AUDIENCE: Could be.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:30.310
Well, that's definitely a
problem in general in Android,

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:31.930
and we'll get to it in a minute.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:35.380
But I think for the
SD card, it's actually

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.650
a slightly different concern.

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:38.920
It has to do with
the fact that you

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.421
want these SD cards
to inter-operate

00:50:40.421 --> 00:50:41.545
with the rest of the world.

00:50:41.545 --> 00:50:42.950
So this is like
one of the places

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.880
where Android isn't free to
make arbitrary decisions,

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.530
because you want these SD
cards to have a standard file

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:51.470
system, namely
FAT, because that's

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:54.300
the de facto standard for
storing data on an SD card

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.320
these days.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.720
And as a result, you can't have
a sophisticated file system

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.589
there that stores
permissions for each file.

00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:03.380
And as a result, it's
going to be difficult

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.500
for you to somehow
segregate these files

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.310
and give different
apps different access.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:08.809
Yeah?

00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:11.664
AUDIENCE: Do you still
think of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:11.664 --> 00:51:12.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:14.455
So it might be that you
could give each application

00:51:14.455 --> 00:51:17.870
a different subdirectory on
the SD card to have access to.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.035
But then it would
mostly be a way

00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:22.930
to give each application
additional storage and not

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.910
the ability for an
application to read existing

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.880
content from your SD card.

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.336
Because the existing
content might

00:51:30.336 --> 00:51:31.460
be in some other directory.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:31.935
So you're right.

00:51:31.935 --> 00:51:34.310
It might be that you could
have more fine-grained things,

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:36.730
like well, you want access to
the entire SD card addressed

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:39.715
to a per app directory there.

00:51:39.715 --> 00:51:42.770
And that probably has to
do with not overwhelming

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:47.420
the user with too many choices
in terms of these permissions.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.152
But yeah, you're right,
you could probably

00:51:50.152 --> 00:51:53.400
do some combination
of these two.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.640
All right.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:59.890
So I guess one
interesting [? thing to ?]

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:10.390
talk about is how do we decide
whether an application should

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:14.790
have a particular set of labels
that it should have access

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:15.901
to in this label set?

00:52:15.901 --> 00:52:17.650
So where do these guys
actually come from?

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:20.375
Like, who decides that
this application should

00:52:20.375 --> 00:52:23.470
have DIAL PERM and
INTERNET and FRIEND VIEW

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:26.310
permissions in Android?

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:27.103
Yeah.

00:52:27.103 --> 00:52:28.603
AUDIENCE: The
developer [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:31.294 --> 00:52:32.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
a little bit of a,

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.570
you know, well, I guess
an upfront system, where

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.111
the developer has
to, first of all,

00:52:38.111 --> 00:52:40.360
enumerate all the things
it'll ever need in the future

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.910
or as their applications
going to run.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:47.030
And then the user is responsible
for looking over this list

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:48.870
and deciding whether
it's OK, whether they

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:52.295
should allow these application
to be installed or not.

00:52:52.295 --> 00:52:55.110
And this way, the user is
still an important part

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:58.090
of the system in
terms of security,

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:01.480
because the user
could almost always

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.105
approve any set of
permissions you want

00:53:03.105 --> 00:53:06.020
or that the developer wants.

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.050
So in many ways, it's
actually quite flexible,

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:13.144
because unlike something like
iOS-- where it's actually

00:53:13.144 --> 00:53:15.060
difficult to share between
apps, or it's hard,

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.455
for example, for a third-party
iPhone application,

00:53:17.455 --> 00:53:21.090
I think, to access arbitrary
other components of the phone,

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:23.870
and dial a phone, or
send an SMS message,

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.720
or find a JPEG viewer,
et cetera-- here,

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.880
it's quite flexible.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.960
But sort of the cost
to it is that you

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.510
have to get the
developer or the user

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:36.930
to check that the
developer is asking

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:39.160
for a sensible set of
permissions or the user

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.686
trusts this developer
with these privileges.

00:53:41.686 --> 00:53:43.060
So it's a little
bit unfortunate.

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.851
It's probably one of
the biggest, actually,

00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:46.900
security problems in
practice with Android,

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.550
which is that users are
quite willing to give away

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:52.786
these permissions if they
really want an application.

00:53:52.786 --> 00:53:56.010
I search for some application,
and I click Install.

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:58.177
And if it doesn't look like
a particularly long list

00:53:58.177 --> 00:54:00.051
and there's nothing that
pops out right away,

00:54:00.051 --> 00:54:01.500
I'll probably click OK.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.720
And I might not spend the
time to really understand

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:08.062
whether these permissions
are necessary.

00:54:08.062 --> 00:54:11.855
The other slight bummer is that
[INAUDIBLE] the time this paper

00:54:11.855 --> 00:54:15.300
was written, Android
decided that the user

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:17.310
had only two choices--
either install the app

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:19.300
or not install the app,
which is a little bit

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.136
of a binary choice.

00:54:20.136 --> 00:54:22.510
And the user is presumably
going to just say, well, yeah,

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:23.230
I want the app.

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:25.110
What else am I going to do?

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:27.950
I need to do this thing.

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:32.480
And I think more recently, I
think some version of Android,

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.710
I think 4.3, introduced
a more fine-grain scheme,

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:40.120
where the user is actually
allowed to pick and choose

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.360
from these permissions where--
well, you are still presented

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:46.340
with a list of permissions
that the developer wants

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.620
for their application to have.

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.980
But the user can now, in a
more fine-grained manner,

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.870
remove some of these permissions
from the application.

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:58.440
And it's unclear how an average
user is supposed to use this,

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.263
because it's probably quite
hard to go through this list

00:55:01.263 --> 00:55:02.980
and make decisions about this.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.450
But at least the API is
starting to show up there.

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:10.940
I haven't seen any
significant uses of it so far.

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:14.780
But it might be nice.

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.220
All right.

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.160
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:17.660
Yeah?

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.702
it just lets you take away.

00:55:21.702 --> 00:55:22.410
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:27.178
AUDIENCE: The [INAUDIBLE] just
lets you take away [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:27.178 --> 00:55:27.844
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:27.844 --> 00:55:30.900
So I think that's basically
what this new version of Android

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:33.730
lets you do, which is you can--
instead of taking away-- well,

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:34.990
it's not labelled strings.

00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:36.615
It's descriptions of
these permissions.

00:55:36.615 --> 00:55:38.600
But you can actually
now-- something, I think,

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.100
called Android Permission
Manager lets you,

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.416
for every app, list
all the labeled strings

00:55:44.416 --> 00:55:46.430
that the app has permission for.

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:50.740
And you could, I think,
remove these things

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.740
on an individual basis if
you feel strongly about them.

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:57.035
I don't know how many
users [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:57.035 --> 00:55:57.660
Yeah, question?

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.118
AUDIENCE: Whenever the labels
[? don't match up, ?] does it

00:56:00.118 --> 00:56:03.540
hard-fail, or is it just that
doesn't work [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.290
PROFESSOR: Well,
I think it depends

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:08.930
on exactly what
the application is

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:11.590
trying to do that is going
to require that label.

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:14.920
So if the application is
going to send an intent

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.000
and sending that intent requires
a particular label like DIAL

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.459
PERM, well, it
might be that you're

00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:21.541
going to send the intent
to the reference monitor.

00:56:21.541 --> 00:56:23.110
And the reference
monitor is going

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:25.260
to say, well, there's
no application that is

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.044
willing to accept your message.

00:56:27.044 --> 00:56:28.710
So maybe then it's
up to the application

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.270
to do something
sensible in response.

00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:34.130
Another possibility is that
maybe it's a network access,

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:35.990
and you don't have
access to that,

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:38.550
and you're going to make
a socket system call,

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:40.720
or you're going to say,
connect to this IP address.

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.180
And the kernel says, E
PERM, you can't do that.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.040
And who knows what
the application

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.206
is going to do in that case?

00:56:45.206 --> 00:56:48.660
Maybe it'll throw a null
pointer exception somehow.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.690
So one argument
against doing this

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:56.830
is that Android applications,
at least originally,

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.660
weren't written to expect
some of their accesses

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.450
to fail, because they were told,
the manifest is all or nothing.

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:04.640
Either the user approves
your app, or they don't.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:09.190
So application developers,
perhaps rightly so,

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:12.680
wrote code that
perhaps crashes or does

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:18.580
something not unexpected if
some access provision fails.

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:20.980
So it might be that by
taking away permissions,

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.700
you're going to cause the app to
crash if it needs that access.

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:27.075
So it's not like, well, you
know, you have this nice app,

00:57:27.075 --> 00:57:28.900
and it needs access
to the camera.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.480
But if you turn it off, it'll
just put on some dummy picture

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:31.880
instead.

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.171
Maybe it'll just crash instead.

00:57:33.171 --> 00:57:34.670
So it's not great.

00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:36.750
You might imagine much
more sophisticated systems

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:39.185
which, if you take away some
of the access to a camera,

00:57:39.185 --> 00:57:41.185
are going to provide a
fake camera that just has

00:57:41.185 --> 00:57:42.480
a black screen all the time.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.323
So this is not
what Android does.

00:57:44.323 --> 00:57:46.540
But you could imagine
[? alternate ?] situations

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.830
where this might happen.

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:50.330
All right.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:53.360
Any other questions here?

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.160
All right.

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.740
So we've looked a
little bit at sort

00:57:55.740 --> 00:58:00.280
of where these strings come from
in the label of an Android app.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.520
But who defines these strings?

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:07.060
Like, where does the meaning
of a string come from?

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.420
You can list all kinds of
strings in your manifest file.

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:15.180
But how do you decide
which strings matter?

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.670
Where does this string
INTERNET or FRIEND VIEW

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:19.110
come from in the first place?

00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:21.145
Who gives it meaning
in the system?

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.677
Any ideas?

00:58:32.677 --> 00:58:34.135
Well, I think it's
mostly-- the way

00:58:34.135 --> 00:58:38.800
to think of it is that
almost none of these strings

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:43.190
should be magic or
pre-defined ahead of time.

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:45.270
Almost all these
strings are basically

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:47.430
contracts between
two applications

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:51.720
so one application is
willing to export something

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.447
under the protection
of some label string.

00:58:55.447 --> 00:58:57.780
And another application wants
to ask for that permission

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:01.020
to talk to the application
that defines this component.

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:03.632
So these labels
are typically-- you

00:59:03.632 --> 00:59:06.010
can think of them
as being defined

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:09.900
by the application that
provides some protected service.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:13.940
So if you have this
DIAL PERM permission,

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:16.040
it's presumably
something that has

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:19.900
to be defined by an application
that defines what it

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.340
means to dial a phone number.

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.930
So probably the dialer
application in your phone,

00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:27.130
that's the thing that defines
the string and says that, yeah,

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:30.090
this thing, DIAL PERM,
exists, and my components

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:31.760
are going to be protected by it.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.301
And then other
applications that want

00:59:33.301 --> 00:59:35.970
to interact with this
guy, with the dialer,

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:42.210
can now request this DIAL PERM
permission for themselves.

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:44.094
And of course, there
are some built-in things

00:59:44.094 --> 00:59:46.760
that we looked at here, like the
internet permission, the camera

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.890
permission, et cetera.

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:49.295
But you can sort
of think of them

00:59:49.295 --> 00:59:53.520
as the Android framework being
the initial application that

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.900
is in charge of providing
access to this resource

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.930
and defining the string
that's going to protect

00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.940
the resource as well.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.690
What does it mean?

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:08.840
What's sort of associated with
a label string in Android other

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:13.304
than the fact that the string
goes into the application's

01:00:13.304 --> 01:00:15.470
label here when they want
to ask for this permission

01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:18.160
and in the component
label as well?

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.030
So there's a couple of
things that is associated

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:24.260
with the label in Android.

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:27.720
So a label, in
addition to a string,

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.870
also has a couple of
interesting properties.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:35.420
So there's a type of a label.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:39.600
And there's, at least in
sort of a modern Android,

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.290
there's three types
you might care about.

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:46.460
There's a normal type of a
label, or permission label.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.320
There's dangerous and signature.

01:00:55.410 --> 01:01:00.290
And the application that
defines this permission

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:03.270
in the first place gets
to choose the type or all

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:05.280
these other fields for
a label that we're going

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.360
to talk about in a second.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:11.360
So what's the point
of a type of a label?

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.860
Why do labels have
types in Android?

01:01:17.068 --> 01:01:17.568
Yeah.

01:01:17.568 --> 01:01:20.794
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:20.794 --> 01:01:21.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I guess so.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.140
Yeah.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.950
So why not make everything
dangerous, I guess,

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:24.590
at that level?

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.330
Well, I guess, yeah.

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:29.360
So maybe the interesting
thing is like,

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.850
what are the semantics
of these types?

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:32.510
So if something is dangerous,
then you are right.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:34.134
It actually warns
the users when you're

01:01:34.134 --> 01:01:36.390
installing an application,
and the application

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:39.910
asks for access to a particular
label that's of type Dangerous.

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:42.787
Then the user has to
look at this message

01:01:42.787 --> 01:01:45.245
and say, yes, I'm willing to
give this dangerous permission

01:01:45.245 --> 01:01:47.440
to this new application.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.530
For normal-type labels,
applications can ask for them,

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:53.660
and the user
doesn't get prompted

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:59.930
if the application requests
this normal type of permission.

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:01.880
Is this silly?

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.812
What's the point of a permission
if everyone just gets it?

01:02:04.812 --> 01:02:07.090
Is there a reason why
we should have this?

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.590
Like, one example of a
normal permission in Android

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:10.674
is setting your wallpaper.

01:02:10.674 --> 01:02:12.173
So if you have an
application that's

01:02:12.173 --> 01:02:14.890
going to set your wallpaper,
I can, as an application

01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:16.956
developer, say in
my manifest that I

01:02:16.956 --> 01:02:18.080
want to set your wallpaper.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.810
And if you click
Install, it's going

01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:22.143
to say, well, there's nothing
interesting going on here.

01:02:22.143 --> 01:02:24.198
You don't need to give
it any permissions.

01:02:24.198 --> 01:02:24.698
Yeah.

01:02:24.698 --> 01:02:26.912
AUDIENCE: Well, these
permissions usually require you

01:02:26.912 --> 01:02:28.634
to [INAUDIBLE], right?

01:02:28.634 --> 01:02:31.963
So if an application wants to
change your desktop wallpaper,

01:02:31.963 --> 01:02:33.442
it will ask you.

01:02:33.442 --> 01:02:36.227
The system will ask you, do you
want to change your wallpaper?

01:02:36.227 --> 01:02:36.893
PROFESSOR: Nope.

01:02:36.893 --> 01:02:37.386
AUDIENCE: No?

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.352
PROFESSOR: No, it'll just
change the wallpaper.

01:02:39.352 --> 01:02:41.560
It's access to this API call
to change the wallpaper.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.980
If I have this permission,
I can make this API call.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.480
Yeah?

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.034
AUDIENCE: Maybe the application
developer wants to make sure

01:02:49.034 --> 01:02:50.862
they don't do this accidentally?

01:02:50.862 --> 01:02:53.506
PROFESSOR: Yes, I think that's
one reason why you might want

01:02:53.506 --> 01:02:55.960
to have these permissions,
is to help the application

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.610
developer do the right thing.

01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:01.150
So if you worry that your
application might accidentally

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:02.960
do something or it
might have bugs in it

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.230
that others will
exploit, knowing

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:08.630
that there's some
set of permissions

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:11.640
that you do or don't have
prevents your application

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.427
from being abused in these ways.

01:03:13.427 --> 01:03:15.540
So if you have a
benign application that

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.960
never needs to
set the wallpaper,

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.084
you probably don't want to
ask for this permission,

01:03:19.084 --> 01:03:21.094
because if a VLAN
gets compromised,

01:03:21.094 --> 01:03:23.210
then it will be
better for the user,

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:26.440
on whose phone your
application's installed.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.470
It's sort of a least
privilege property.

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:31.710
I guess another thing
is that it maybe

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:34.080
allows some sort of auditing,
both from a developer

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.756
standpoint, where
they can look and see,

01:03:35.756 --> 01:03:38.214
well, what are the things I
should be concerned about here?

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:40.100
And as well as from
a user's perspective.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.130
If your phone is flickering
with a wallpaper change

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:46.920
every second, you can go and
see who has this permission.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.143
Even though I didn't
have to approve it,

01:03:49.143 --> 01:03:51.310
I can at least go and
check who is potentially

01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:54.340
doing this right now.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.800
So these normal
permissions are kind of

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.220
like a good security
measure-- or probably more

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.870
of a good auditing measure.

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:06.800
And [? aren't ?] generally used
for really interesting things

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:11.880
like [INAUDIBLE] data or
accessing things like cameras

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.970
or things that cost money.

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:17.810
So there's also this third
thing, this signature

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:18.430
permission.

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:20.775
So one interesting
thing in Android

01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:22.920
is that you can define
a permission that

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.110
is only accessible to
applications that are signed

01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:30.830
with the same developer
key as the application that

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:33.570
defined the permission
in the first place.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:36.850
So if I have, I guess in
the FRIEND VIEW example

01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:42.060
in the paper, if the friend
tracker defined some permission

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:46.080
with this signature type,
then only other applications

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.200
signed by the same
developer key are

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.190
going to be able to get
this signature permission.

01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:52.580
What's the point of this thing?

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:56.817
Why not just make them
dangerous or, I don't know,

01:04:56.817 --> 01:04:57.471
something else?

01:04:57.471 --> 01:05:01.030
Why do we need a third type?

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:01.893
Any reason?

01:05:01.893 --> 01:05:02.392
Yeah?

01:05:02.392 --> 01:05:05.224
AUDIENCE: Operations
[INAUDIBLE] same developer?

01:05:05.224 --> 01:05:05.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:08.560
So it might be that
this developer has

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.070
some internal APIs that
they don't actually mean

01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:13.080
to expose to the outside world.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.380
But they just want to couple
their own applications

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.130
to each other.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:20.040
So maybe Facebook,
hypothetically,

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.125
could write multiple
applications.

01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:24.930
They might have one
application that's

01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:27.160
pre-fetching content
from Facebook servers,

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.956
another application that
fuses, another application that

01:05:29.956 --> 01:05:30.830
tracks your location.

01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:32.246
And they want all
these components

01:05:32.246 --> 01:05:33.820
to interact with one another.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.920
And they can define the
signature permission

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.220
to do this.

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:40.655
And presumably, one reason why
you might not want to do this--

01:05:40.655 --> 01:05:43.110
might not want to
tag this permission

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:46.910
as a dangerous permission is
for mostly the same reasons

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:49.230
as the [INAUDIBLE]
was talking about,

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:52.936
which is that if you really know
who should be allowed to get

01:05:52.936 --> 01:05:55.110
this permission, you don't
want to allow the user

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:56.290
to screw this up.

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:59.510
So the user could always
be tricked by someone--

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:02.346
or could be tricked by
someone into accepting

01:06:02.346 --> 01:06:07.000
a malicious application that
asks for some permission that's

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:07.770
really dangerous.

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:08.970
But [? it doesn't ?]
need to be dangerous,

01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:10.511
you could just define
this signature.

01:06:10.511 --> 01:06:12.200
And the user doesn't
even have a choice

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.210
of giving away
some application's

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:15.895
internal privileges.

01:06:15.895 --> 01:06:20.255
That's one nice thing
about this permission type.

01:06:20.255 --> 01:06:20.755
Make sense?

01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:24.747
So there's other
stuff associated

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:29.020
with the label that mostly
has to do with describing

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.700
the permission to the user.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:34.530
So there's some sort
of a description here

01:06:34.530 --> 01:06:38.220
that is the sort of
English-level explanation

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.280
of what this permission entails.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.310
And it's this
description that pops up

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:45.940
when you're asked to
install a new application.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.190
So the Android framework will
look through all the label

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:51.470
strings in the manifest
of the application you're

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:55.060
about to install, and display
to the user the descriptions

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.180
for all those labeled
strings, saying, OK,

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.060
you're about to give away the
privileges to dial your phone,

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.500
or you're about to give this
application the permission

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.122
to send SMS messages on
your behalf, et cetera.

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:09.600
That make sense?

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.350
All right.

01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:15.120
So one interesting
question is, what

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.590
happens if a malicious
application defines

01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:22.200
a label for some other app?

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.498
These labels are just
free-form strings.

01:07:26.498 --> 01:07:28.830
So what happens if you're
a malicious application

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:31.560
and you say, oh, I have
this new, great permission.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.680
It's called DIAL PERM.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.915
And [INAUDIBLE] dangerous.

01:07:33.915 --> 01:07:37.406
And the description
does nothing.

01:07:37.406 --> 01:07:39.676
Is it good or [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:39.676 --> 01:07:40.560
Yeah?

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.090
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
domains [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:48.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.760
So you hope so.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.960
Unfortunately, it's
not actually enforced.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.200
So by convention, all
these permission strings

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.410
should have Java-style
reversed domain names.

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:02.550
But there's no
strict association

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:06.470
between the labels that
an application defines

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:09.353
and the application's
own Java-style name.

01:08:09.353 --> 01:08:10.852
And for that matter,
there's nothing

01:08:10.852 --> 01:08:13.380
that enforces that an
application's Java-style name

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.899
be tied to anything, because
we have no way of knowing

01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:19.700
whether the public
[INAUDIBLE] developer signing

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.200
a particular
application corresponds

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.720
to com.google.something
or edu.mit.something.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.830
So in fact, one slight
weakness in Android

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:32.529
that was there at least when
I checked a while ago-- it

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:36.194
probably is still there-- is
that the label definitions are

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:37.569
sort of first
come, first served.

01:08:37.569 --> 01:08:39.684
So when you first
install an application,

01:08:39.684 --> 01:08:41.720
it defines a
particular label, you

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.330
get to decide what type
that label string is

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:47.100
and what is the description
of this label string.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:51.510
So for system permissions, this
is probably not a big problem,

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:54.109
because the system
permissions, or the ones

01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:56.140
for built-in applications
like [? compiler, ?]

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.225
get defined first.

01:08:58.225 --> 01:09:01.600
But applications that come later
are unable to redefine them.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.410
So at least the
framework enforces that.

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:07.229
But certainly, one bummer
is that if you install

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:08.870
a malicious application
first and then

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:11.922
some important
application later,

01:09:11.922 --> 01:09:13.630
the malicious application
can potentially

01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:17.724
subvert the labels used by
the later well-meaning app.

01:09:17.724 --> 01:09:20.340
So in the paper's
FRIEND VIEWER example,

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.370
you could actually-- if you're
a malicious developer, you could

01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:26.015
first trick the
user into installing

01:09:26.015 --> 01:09:28.069
these applications defines
this FRIEND [? VIEW ?]

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:31.729
permission to be a normal
permission with a description

01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:34.580
stream saying, oh, this does
nothing interesting at all.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:37.849
And then the FRIEND VIEWER
applet gets installed later.

01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:39.500
It can't redefine this label.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:40.899
It's already been defined.

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:46.320
And consequently might
be unable to prevent

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.170
the user from giving
away this FRIEND VIEW

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:50.403
permission to other apps.

01:09:50.403 --> 01:09:52.819
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:55.800
PROFESSOR: Well, in principle,
the framework could do this.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.910
When I tried this, you
don't get warned at all.

01:09:57.910 --> 01:10:00.980
So if you install
an application that

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:04.770
defines a label that's already
been defined, it does nothing.

01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:07.360
It simply ignores the
VIEW label definition

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.401
and uses the old one.

01:10:09.401 --> 01:10:11.650
Perhaps that's the problem
where it really goes wrong.

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:13.275
You should at least
say, well, I refuse

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.358
to install this application,
because it's defining

01:10:15.358 --> 01:10:16.640
a label that already exists.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.554
AUDIENCE: Owned by
this other application.

01:10:18.554 --> 01:10:19.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.100
And it's owned by a
different key even.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:21.600
Yeah.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.570
So at least there's a chance
to fix this potentially.

01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:27.780
I haven't seen this
fixed yet, but maybe I've

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.006
not been keeping track of it.

01:10:30.006 --> 01:10:30.950
Anyway.

01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:32.759
So that's kind of an
interesting problem

01:10:32.759 --> 01:10:34.800
that you really have to
keep track of these names

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.320
and figure out who owns a
name and getting that right

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.880
is actually quite important.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.090
So one interesting problem
that shows up in Android

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:48.470
has to do with these broadcast
receivers or sort of sending

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:51.382
messages between applications.

01:10:51.382 --> 01:10:54.529
So one interesting problem is
when you're sending-- well,

01:10:54.529 --> 01:10:56.820
I guess I should first describe
how these messages work

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.350
with broadcast receivers.

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:02.860
So broadcast receivers are
used for one application

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.970
being able to
announce some event

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.370
to every other
application in the system.

01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:09.550
So as we saw before,
intents typically

01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:12.960
go to a particular component,
like view a JPEG image.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:16.785
But for some events,
like, the system boots up.

01:11:16.785 --> 01:11:18.990
Or my friends are nearby.

01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:21.440
You might want to announce
this to every application that

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.475
cares.

01:11:22.475 --> 01:11:25.200
And this is what these
broadcast receivers are for.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.470
But you actually
start worrying when

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:31.820
you have these messages being
sent between two applications,

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.470
both in the broadcast receiver
case and in other cases,

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:36.230
you probably care
about two things.

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:38.120
You might want to
authenticate where

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.510
the message is coming from.

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:41.260
So you want to know
who sent this message.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.300
Can I trust them?

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.250
And also, you want to
potentially control

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.710
where this message
goes to-- who is

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:48.000
able to receive this message.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.980
And initially, it seems like
an Android device didn't quite

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:56.750
get these things quite
correctly in several ways.

01:11:56.750 --> 01:12:03.020
In particular, the
broadcast receivers--

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:07.010
well, if you are sending
a broadcast message

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:11.210
to all the other
components in your system,

01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:13.320
I think in the initial
version of Android,

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.580
you just sent this message.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.060
And other applications could
either subscribe or not

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.450
subscribe to these messages.

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:22.100
So if you have a FRIEND
VIEWER application that it'll

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:25.450
subscribe to these messages
by setting the right action

01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:30.290
or date or data time or MIME
type in their Intent filter,

01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:32.910
but most applications
could always

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:34.970
subscribe to all broadcast
events in the system.

01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:36.470
And you are able
to watch everything

01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:38.632
that's going on on the
phone, or everything

01:12:38.632 --> 01:12:40.340
that's being broadcast.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:44.630
So the Android framework added
an extra sort of argument

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:46.790
for applications to
be able to specify

01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:49.200
who should be able to
see a broadcast message.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:55.070
So when you're sending
a broadcast message,

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:58.630
there's the obvious
argument, which

01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:01.570
is the message you want to send,
which is basically an intent.

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:04.540
But then you can also
specify an optional label

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:09.130
that describes who should be
able to receive this message.

01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:11.540
So instead of broadcasting
to everyone in the system,

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.800
you can say, well, only
other applications that

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.770
have a certain permission
should be able to receive

01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:20.290
this broadcast message from me.

01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:23.660
So this way, you could send
out sensitive information,

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.570
like the locations
of your friends,

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:28.530
in the paper's
example, and make sure

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:31.230
that only those
applications that

01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:33.380
are allowed to see the
list of your friends

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:35.777
will actually get your
broadcast message.

01:13:35.777 --> 01:13:37.610
So this is how, on
Android, you can actually

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:42.060
control who receives the
message that you're sending out,

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.620
at least in the broadcast case.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.470
Question?

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:47.755
No. [? Sorry. ?]

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:49.880
How do you authenticate
where a message is actually

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.470
coming from?

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:55.150
So suppose that in
Android, you register

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:58.796
for-- in the paper's example,
you have your FRIEND VIEWER

01:13:58.796 --> 01:14:00.170
and you receive
a message saying,

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:02.800
yep, this friend is nearby.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:07.830
How do you know this actually
came from the right component?

01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:09.760
Can you actually convince
yourself of this?

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.260
Yeah?

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:13.092
AUDIENCE: Using
the kernel codes?

01:14:13.092 --> 01:14:14.892
Wouldn't you trust the
kernel [INAUDIBLE]?

01:14:14.892 --> 01:14:16.100
PROFESSOR: Potentially, yeah.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.725
Well, this binder thing is going
to tell the reference monitor,

01:14:21.725 --> 01:14:23.110
here's where the
intent came from.

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:24.485
And then the
reference monitor is

01:14:24.485 --> 01:14:27.070
going to forward this intent
to your receiver application.

01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:28.540
And somewhere in
there is the name

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.910
of the applet that
sent this guy.

01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:32.587
How should you
check whether this

01:14:32.587 --> 01:14:38.220
is a reasonable app that should
be sending these intents?

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:41.565
Is there a way to
do this in Android?

01:14:41.565 --> 01:14:42.440
I guess you're right.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.940
Strictly speaking, yeah, the
source is always authenticated.

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.230
You know exactly which
app sent the message.

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:49.050
But what do you do
with a source name?

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:51.190
How do you check whether
it should be sending

01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:53.520
these Friend is Near messages?

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.430
[INAUDIBLE]

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.930
Yeah?

01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:58.024
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
label [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:58.024 --> 01:14:58.690
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:14:58.690 --> 01:15:02.240
So one way to do it
is to actually stick

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.310
a label on the
broadcast receiver.

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:07.420
So one thing you could is say,
well, the only people that

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.295
are allowed to send a message
to the broadcast receiver

01:15:10.295 --> 01:15:20.320
are people with the Friend
Tracker maybe label.

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.430
So if you stick such a label
on your broadcast receiver,

01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:27.583
then you know that only
messages sent from applications

01:15:27.583 --> 01:15:30.880
with this label are going to get
to you through your broadcast

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.460
receiver.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:35.700
That's one way to filter who's
able to send messages to you is

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:38.210
by restricting them by label.

01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:41.080
So this works in many cases.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:46.020
Android also provides a
more specific function

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.914
that you can use.

01:15:47.914 --> 01:15:49.080
It's called Check Privilege.

01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:58.700
And you could sort of say--
or Check Sender Privilege,

01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.560
I think.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.070
And you could ask the
framework whether the sender

01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:07.450
of the intent you're looking
at has a certain label

01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:08.990
in its provisions.

01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:12.960
So this way, you can also
reason about what privileges

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.252
does the sender of
a particular message

01:16:15.252 --> 01:16:18.220
have in situations where maybe
the framework doesn't provide

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:23.130
quite the right mechanisms
in the manifest to do this.

01:16:23.130 --> 01:16:27.070
One place where this Check
Sender Privilege function

01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:28.880
turns out to be
particularly useful

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.480
is in the case of this RPC
interaction between two

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.630
applications, where the
reference monitor isn't

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:37.640
actually involved in mediating
the RPC-looking applications.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.310
But you still want to
ask, is the application

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:43.910
of [INAUDIBLE] privileged
for this kind of operation?

01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:48.120
So this way, you can
manually invoke-- or check

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:51.382
what's in the manifest
of an application.

01:16:51.382 --> 01:16:51.882
Yeah.

01:16:51.882 --> 01:16:52.864
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:00.009
PROFESSOR: Well, so I
guess-- [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:00.009 --> 01:17:02.050
AUDIENCE: You can use the
signature to enable it.

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.716
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
one thing that stops

01:17:03.716 --> 01:17:05.376
is presumably the [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:05.376 --> 01:17:07.000
If the label is a
signature type label,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.272
then that's going to stop
it if it's not [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:09.272 --> 01:17:11.230
AUDIENCE: That requires
the same signature as--

01:17:11.230 --> 01:17:12.170
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:12.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.690
So that requires it be
the same, exact developer.

01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:18.040
Another thing that stops it is
that maybe the permission is

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.231
labelled as Dangerous.

01:17:19.231 --> 01:17:21.480
So then the user is going
to see this on their screen.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.900
When you install an
app, it says, this app

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.380
requires the permission
of viewing your friends,

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.600
or your friends' locations.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.016
AUDIENCE: But that's taken
from the description.

01:17:29.016 --> 01:17:29.960
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.959
AUDIENCE: So what's
[INAUDIBLE] from just giving

01:17:31.959 --> 01:17:33.270
a different description?

01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:38.410
PROFESSOR: So I should
say, this description

01:17:38.410 --> 01:17:41.760
comes from the application that
initially defines this label.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.517
So the label is initially--
so there's two things going on

01:17:46.517 --> 01:17:47.312
in the manifest.

01:17:47.312 --> 01:17:51.429
You can ask for access
to existing labels.

01:17:51.429 --> 01:17:53.220
So I can say, well,
this is an application.

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.164
I want access to the
FRIEND VIEW permission.

01:17:56.164 --> 01:17:58.550
And a separate thing you can
do in the manifest is say,

01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:01.450
I am defining a
new kind of label.

01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:04.054
So then the first Friend
Viewer application--

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:06.295
or the Friend Tracker
application, presumably,

01:18:06.295 --> 01:18:08.170
is going to say, well,
I have an application,

01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:09.170
it has these permission.

01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:11.770
But also, I'm defining
a new kind of label.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:13.520
It's called this.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.750
It's type Dangerous, and
it has this description.

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:19.774
So that's a place where
you have to really get

01:18:19.774 --> 01:18:22.630
the-- this is that first
come, first served problem.

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:25.714
But as long as the application
that should define the label

01:18:25.714 --> 01:18:27.630
is installed first, then
you're in good shape.

01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:30.810
Any subsequent application
is going to ask for the label

01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:32.806
just by its string name.

01:18:32.806 --> 01:18:34.750
And then the Android
framework will fish out

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:37.260
the description and the
type from the application

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.081
that first defined it.

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:43.605
All right.

01:18:43.605 --> 01:18:47.370
Any other questions here?

01:18:47.370 --> 01:18:48.430
All right.

01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:52.790
So I guess this gives you some
sense of how Android works.

01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:56.700
So one cool thing about it
is that you can actually

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.960
get this manifest that,
to a larger extent,

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.800
describes the security
properties of an application.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.230
So this is one thing that
the developers of the Android

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:06.021
framework were going
for-- something called

01:19:06.021 --> 01:19:09.260
mandatory access control,
where you can actually specify

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:12.520
the security policy of
an application separate

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.690
from the application
itself, and in fact,

01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:17.160
have that security policy be
enforced by this reference

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:21.190
monitor regardless of what that
application itself is doing.

01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:23.000
So it seems like kind
of a nice property

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.140
to be able to audit an
application by looking

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.590
at this manifest file.

01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:31.216
You can mostly think of it as a
development nicety rather than

01:19:31.216 --> 01:19:33.590
a strict enforcement mechanism,
because if an application

01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:35.740
really wants to get
around its own manifest,

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.740
it can probably do so.

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:39.476
But it seems like
a nice way of being

01:19:39.476 --> 01:19:42.100
able to understand what's going
on with an application in terms

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:45.505
of security without having to
dive down into the Java code.

01:19:45.505 --> 01:19:47.790
Of course, it matters,
but you can still

01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:50.660
get a high-level sense of what's
going on in an application

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.920
from the manifest.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.320
One bummer, I guess, as we
were talking about here,

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:58.515
there are some situations where
the Android framework turns out

01:19:58.515 --> 01:20:01.450
to be not quite expressive
enough in the manifest.

01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:03.540
And you have to
still write code that

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.260
talks about security checks.

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.802
It would be, in some ways,
nice if there were no security

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:10.010
checks at all in the code
and all the security checks

01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:11.245
went to the manifest.

01:20:11.245 --> 01:20:14.410
But that would mean exposing
things like all the RPCs

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:16.706
to the framework and so on.

01:20:16.706 --> 01:20:18.330
That's potentially
a bit of a trade-off

01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:19.787
that these guys are making.

01:20:19.787 --> 01:20:21.620
And I guess one other
thing is it's actually

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:23.750
kind of hard to change
the manifest file

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:25.890
after you design the system.

01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:28.020
So one perhaps
surprising thing is

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:29.950
that the Android
framework hasn't changed

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:32.220
in terms of security very
much since it was released

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:34.470
or since this paper was
written five years ago, or six

01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:36.090
years ago now.

01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:38.500
Because once the application
starts using this framework,

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.816
it's hard to say some existing
application's going to break.

01:20:41.816 --> 01:20:43.190
So you basically
have to maintain

01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:44.940
backwards compatibility
to a large extent.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:49.349
So you don't get a chance
to sort of do it over again.

01:20:49.349 --> 01:20:50.765
I guess one
interesting thing that

01:20:50.765 --> 01:20:53.710
did happen to Android
since this paper came out

01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:59.220
is that the Android guys
borrowed an idea from Apple

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.410
and are doing now much
more server-side analysis

01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:02.840
of applications.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:06.310
So Apple, on the iPhone side,
is pretty aggressive in terms

01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:11.600
of having the Apple server
checking all the applications

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.590
from developers for
various guidelines,

01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:15.260
including security properties.

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:19.460
And the Android servers, or
this Android market or whatever,

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:21.920
now also does quite a bit
of analysis of applications

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.540
submitted by developers
to make sure they are not

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:27.010
malicious in some loose sense.

01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:28.430
So that's kind of a cool thing.

01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:30.590
And it is largely
[? orthogonal ?]

01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:32.020
to this security architecture.

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.560
So this security architecture
works on your phone.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.410
But then for any other
security problems,

01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:39.990
the server can evolve
defenses over time as need be.

01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:42.560
And those tend to be more
on the phishing side, where

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.518
the human is being tricked
into doing something

01:21:44.518 --> 01:21:46.910
rather than on exploiting
some specific vulnerability

01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:49.290
in the kernel,
perhaps, and so on.

01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:51.320
Make sense?

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.890
Any other questions?

01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:53.390
All right.

01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:55.306
So we'll see you guys
on Wednesday, hopefully.

01:21:55.306 --> 01:21:59.510
We'll talk about an extension
of Android for data privacy.
