ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: All right.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.970
So good morning, everyone.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.250
I'm Armando Solar-Lezama.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.190
I'm giving the lecture
today on symbolic execution.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.740
How many of you here are
familiar with what the term is

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.220
or have heard about it before?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.230
We want to get a
sense of audience.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.180
OK.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.080
So let's see.

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:00.690
I dropped this machine
a little too many times

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.480
and it takes a while to boot up.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.040
So symbolic execution
is really the workhorse

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.420
of modern program analysis.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.580
It's one of those techniques
that has really broken out

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.630
of the research bubble
and actually made it

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.210
into a very large number of
high impact applications.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.400
For example, today
at Microsoft there's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.000
a system called SAGE that runs
on a lot of important Microsoft

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.560
code ranging from
PowerPoint to Windows

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.520
to actually find security
problems and security

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.610
vulnerabilities.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.700
There's a lot of that
academic projects that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.160
have made a lot of
real world impact

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.720
by discovering important
bugs in open source software,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.870
for example, by relying
on symbolic execution.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.390
And the beauty of symbolic
execution as a technique

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.410
is that compared to
testing, for example,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.980
it gives you the
ability to reason

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.420
about how your program
is going to behave

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.260
on a potentially infinite
set of possible inputs.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.390
It allows you to
explore spaces of inputs

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.730
that would be completely
unfeasible and impractical

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.860
to explore by, say,
random testing,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.080
or even by having a very
large number of testers

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.040
banging and the code.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.690
On the other hand, compared
to more traditional

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.580
static analysis techniques
it has the advantage

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.180
that when it discovers a
problem it can actually

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.860
produce for you an
input and a trace

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.280
that you can run on
your real program

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.990
and execute that
program on that input.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.100
And you can actually tell
that it is a real bug.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.980
And you can actually
go and debug it

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.700
using traditional
debugging mechanisms.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.970
And this is
particularly valuable

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.100
when you're in an industrial
development environment

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.830
where you probably
don't have time

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.880
to go looking after every
little problem in your code.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.920
You really want
to be able to tell

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.880
the difference
between real problems

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.010
versus false
positives, for example.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.150
So how does it work?

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.510
So in order to
really understand how

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.260
it works it's useful to
start by looking at just

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.450
normal execution, right?

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.140
If we think of
symbolic execution

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.500
as a generalization of
traditional, plain execution,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.310
it makes sense to know
what this looks like.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.420
So I'm going to be using this
very, very simple program

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.090
as an illustration for
a lot of what I'm going

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.800
to be talking about today.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.510
So what do we have here?

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.460
Again, it's a very simple
piece of code, just

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.510
a couple of branches and
here we have an assertion,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.280
assert false.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.570
And we want to know could that
assertion ever be triggered.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.270
Is it possible?

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.260
Is there some input where that
will make that assertion fail?

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.510
And in this case because the
assertion is just saying,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.780
assert false, what
I'm really asking is,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.960
is there an input that can
reach that point in the program?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.070
So one of the things I can
do is I can try just testing.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.550
I can go in and run this
code with a concrete input.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.050
Right?

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.850
So let's say that I start
with an input where x is 4

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.820
and y is 4.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.110
And initially t is going
to have the value 0

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.310
right after I declare it.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.990
So before we go with
normal execution,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.800
what are some of the
important point here?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.884
The fact that we need some
representation of the state

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:45.800
of the program, right?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.680
Whether we're doing
normal execution

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.020
or whether we're doing
symbolic execution,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.700
we need to have some
way to characterize

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.710
the state of the program.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.700
And in this case, this
is such a simple program

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.850
that it doesn't use the heap.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.050
It doesn't use the stack.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.210
There are no function calls.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.550
So the state can be fully
characterized by these three

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.130
variables together
with knowledge of where

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.200
in the program I'm at, right?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.920
So if I start
executing with 4, 4,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.330
and 0, so when I get to this
branch, is 4 greater than 4?

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.460
Clearly not.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.560
So then I'm going to be
executing t equals y.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.850
So now after I do
that t is no longer 0.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.230
It now has the value 4.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.730
Right?

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.080
So that is now the
state of my program.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.980
And then I can
evaluate this branch.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.260
Is it the case that
t is less than x?

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.350
No.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.849
Right?

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.440
So we dodged the bullet.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.490
We did not get an
assertion failure.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.331
There was no problem in
this particular execution.

00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:52.830
Right?

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.580
But that doesn't
really tell us anything

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.010
about any other execution.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.540
All we know is that
under the input

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.580
x equals 4 and y equals 4, the
program is not going to fail.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.790
But it tells us nothing
about what's going to happen

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.390
on the input
[? 2, 1, ?] for example.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.890
Right?

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.700
And in this input you see
that this input is actually

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.350
going to follow a different
path in the execution.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.020
This time we're actually
going to see that t equals x.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.750
We're actually going
to set t equals 2x.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.710
So after executing these
t will be equal to 2,

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.765
but is there any problem
in this execution?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.500
Will there be an assertion
failure on this input?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.050
Well, so let's see.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.850
So if t is 2.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.970
And x is 2.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.420
Is t less than x?

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.160
No.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.330
So it looks like we
dodged a bullet again.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.830
Right?

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.930
So here we have two
concrete inputs.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.440
And they told us that on
these two concrete inputs

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.770
the program didn't fail.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.900
But that really doesn't tell us
anything about any other input.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.080
And so the idea with
symbolic execution

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.950
is we want to go beyond these
single input executions.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.480
And we want to be able
to actually reason

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.440
about the behavior of
the program on very

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.550
large sets of inputs.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.680
In some cases, infinite
sets of possible inputs.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.830
And the basic idea
is as follows.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.940
So for a program
like this, just like

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.940
before the state
of the program is

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.630
characterized by the
value of these three

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.500
different variables.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.140
Right? x, y, and t together with
knowing where in the program

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.380
I'm at.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:48.230
But now instead of
concrete values for x and y

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.920
what I'm going to have
is a symbolic value, just

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.530
a variable.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.760
A variable that allows me
to give a name to this value

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.450
that the user is going
to provide at the input.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.540
So what that means is that
the state of my program

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.170
is no longer a mapping
from variable names

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.630
to concrete values.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:13.542
It's now a mapping from variable
names to these symbolic values.

00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:15.250
And a symbolic value,
you can essentially

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.480
think of it as a formula.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.610
So in this case the
formula for x is just x.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.440
And the formula for y is just y.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.590
And for t, it's
actually the value 0.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.190
We know that for every input,
doesn't matter what you do.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.400
The value of t after the first
statement is going to be 0.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.510
But now here's where
it gets interesting.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.179
So we get to this
branch right here

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.912
that says, if x
is greater than y,

00:08:44.912 --> 00:08:46.370
we're going to go
in one direction.

00:08:48.977 --> 00:08:50.560
If it's less than
or equal to y, we're

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.018
going to go in the
other direction.

00:08:52.018 --> 00:08:55.600
Now do we know
anything about x and y?

00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:00.600
What do we know about them?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.110
We know their type, at least.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.020
So that's a start.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.870
So we know that they're going
to be ranging from min int

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:16.287
to max int, but that's about
all we know about them.

00:09:16.287 --> 00:09:17.870
And it turns out
that this information

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.070
that we know about them is not
sufficient to tell us which

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.630
direction this branch might go.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.630
This branch could go either way.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:32.360
And so now there are many
things and we can do,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.870
but what's one possible thing
that we could do at this point?

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.018
Make a wild guess.

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:46.935
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:46.935 --> 00:09:48.059
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: Yeah.

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:49.680
We could follow both branches.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.420
We could flip a coin and pick
one branch and take that.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.730
So if we want to
follow both branches

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.990
we have to follow one and
then the other one, right?

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:04.381
So let's say we start
with this branch.

00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:04.880
Right?

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.250
So now we are at this branch.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.240
So what we know is that if
we make it to this branch,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.740
in this branch t is now going
to have the same value as x.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.277
And we don't know what
that value is going to be,

00:10:20.277 --> 00:10:21.360
but we have a name for it.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.080
It's this script letter x.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.580
Right?

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.370
So that's the value
of t on that branch.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.330
If we were to take the opposite
branch then what would happen?

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.730
The value of t would be
something different, right?

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:45.790
In that branch, the value of t
would be the symbolic value y.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.050
So that means that when we get
to this point in the program,

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.020
what is the value of t?

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.040
Well, maybe it's x.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.440
And maybe it's y.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.460
We don't know exactly which
one it is, but why don't we

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.150
give it a name?

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.450
Let's call it t0.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.970
And what do we know about t0?

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.855
What are the cases where t0
is going to be equal to x?

00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:15.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.108
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA:
That's right.

00:11:17.108 --> 00:11:21.380
So essentially what we know is
that if x is greater than y,

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:27.280
then this implies that it's x.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:37.460
And if x is less than or equal
to y that implies that it's y,

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.350
right?

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.960
And so we have this
value that we've defined.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.750
We'll call it t0.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.470
And it has these
logical properties.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:53.150
So at this point in
the program we actually

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.800
have a name for the value of t.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.700
It's t0.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.960
Right?

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.200
And so what did we do here?

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.835
We took both branches
of this if statement.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.090
And then we computed
the symbolic value

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.220
by looking at under
what conditions

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.170
am I going to take one branch,
under what conditions am I

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.360
going to take another branch?

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.330
And then looking
at what values am

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.420
I going to be assigning to
t on both of those branches?

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:31.760
So now it comes to the
point where we have to ask,

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.130
can t be less than x?

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.630
Right?

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.510
So what is the value of t?

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.580
The value of t is now t0.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.040
So what we want
to know is, is it

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:47.090
possible for t0
to be less than x?

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.590
Right?

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.760
Now remember the
first branch we hit

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.930
we were asking a
question about x and y.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.990
And we knew nothing
about x and y.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.520
The only thing we
knew about x and y

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.100
was that they were of type int.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.620
But now with t0 we actually
know a lot about t0.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.930
We know that t0 is going to
be equal to x in some cases.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.640
And it's going to be
equal to y in some cases.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.300
And so this now gives
us a set of equations

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.090
that we can solve for.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:26.060
So what we can say is,
is it possible to satisfy

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:31.110
t0 less than x knowing
that t0 satisfies

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.761
all of these properties?

00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:34.260
Right?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.270
So, in fact, we can
actually express this

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:44.550
as a constraint where we say,
so is it possible to have t0

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.990
less than x?

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:55.720
And to have x greater than
y implies t0 equals x.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:07.146
And x less than or equal
to y imply t0 equal y.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:10.510
Right?

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:15.890
So what we have here is an
equation that if that equation

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:20.200
has a solution, if it's
possible to find a value of t0,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.660
and a value of x, and a value of
y that satisfies that equation,

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.930
then we know that those
values, when we plug them

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.170
into our program, when
the program executes,

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.930
it will take this branch.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:40.090
And it will blow up when
it hits a assert false.

00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:43.220
Right?

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.080
So what did we do here?

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.370
So we're executing this
program, but instead

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:57.560
of keeping our state as a
mapping from variable names

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.970
to values, what
we're doing is we're

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.970
keeping our program as a
mapping from variable names

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.310
to these symbolic values.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.230
Essentially, other
variable names.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.830
And in this case our
other variable names

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:17.320
are the script x, script
y, t0, and on top of that,

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.110
we have a set of
equations that tell us

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.460
how those values are related.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.510
So we have an
equation that tells us

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:29.180
how t0 is related to
x and y in this case.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.620
And solving for
that equation allows

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.380
us to answer the question
of whether this branch can

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.310
be taken or not.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.510
Now just looking
at the equation,

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.900
can this branch be taken or not?

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.070
Right?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.450
So it looks like the
branch cannot be taken.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.170
Why not?

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:56.390
Because we're looking for
cases where t0 is less than x,

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.500
which means that if you're
in this case, then clearly

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.350
that's not going to be true.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.850
Right?

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.480
So that means that when
x is greater than y,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.280
then it cannot happen because
t0 will be equal to x.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.720
And it cannot be equal to x and
less than x at the same time.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.950
And what about in this case?

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.180
Can it happen in this case?

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.200
Can t0 be less than
x in this case?

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.590
No, it clearly cannot, right?

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:29.180
Because in this case we
know that x is less than y.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.790
And so if t0 is going
to be less than x,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.070
then it would also
be less than y.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.730
But we know that in that case
t0 is exactly equal to y.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:42.730
And therefore, again, that
case cannot be satisfied.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:47.080
So what we have here is an
equation that has no solution.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.980
It doesn't matter what values
you plug into this equation.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.990
You cannot solve it and that
tells us that no matter what

00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:01.620
inputs we pass to this code, it
will not go down this branch.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:07.460
Now notice that when
making that argument here

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.859
I was basically alluding to
your intuition about integers,

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.619
about mathematical integers.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.589
In practice we know that
machine ints don't quite

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:22.109
behave exactly the same
way as mathematical ints.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.130
And there are some
cases where laws

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.430
that apply to mathematical
ints don't actually

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.822
apply to ints in programs.

00:17:29.822 --> 00:17:31.280
And so when reasoning
about this we

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.761
have to be very
careful that when

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:35.260
we're solving these
equations, we're

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:40.930
keeping in mind
that these are not

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.830
the integers as they were taught
to us in elementary school.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.550
These are 32-bit integers
that the machine uses.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.090
And there are many
cases and many instances

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.000
of bugs that arose because
programmers were thinking

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.770
about their code in terms
of mathematical integers,

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.450
and not realizing that there
are things like overflows that

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.330
can cause the program
to behave differently

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.470
for mathematical inputs.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.140
But the other thing is
what I've described here

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:16.230
is a purely intuitive argument.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.110
I walk you through the process
of how to do this by hand,

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.970
but that's by no
means an algorithm.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.250
Right?

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.070
The beauty of this idea
of symbolic execution,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.920
however, is that it can be
coded into an algorithm.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.960
And it can be solved in
a mechanical way, which

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.190
allows you to do this not
just for ten line programs,

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.930
but actually for
million line programs.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.281
And it allows you
to actually take

00:18:41.281 --> 00:18:43.280
this reasoning, and the
same intuitive reasoning

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.090
that we used in
this case to talk

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.820
about what happens
when we execute

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.860
this program on
different inputs.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:59.429
And scale that reasoning
to very large programs.

00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:00.720
Are there any questions so far?

00:19:05.621 --> 00:19:06.120
Yes?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.745
AUDIENCE: What if a
[INAUDIBLE] are not

00:19:07.745 --> 00:19:09.620
supposed to take an input?

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.120
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:15.639 --> 00:19:16.680
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: Oh.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.920
That's a very good question.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:26.190
Right, so, for
example, let's say

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:36.100
we have the program that
we have here, but instead

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:46.130
of these being t equals x, here
we will say t equals x minus 1.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.006
Right?

00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:48.630
So now all of a
sudden, intuitively you

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.580
can see that now this
program could blow up, right?

00:19:52.580 --> 00:20:00.150
Because when the program
takes this path then

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.680
t will indeed be less than x.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.220
And you will indeed fail here.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:06.720
Right?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.040
So what will happen to
a program like this?

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.370
How will our symbolic
state look like?

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:15.870
Right?

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:22.710
So in this case, so t0,
when x is greater than y,

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.697
what is t0 now going
to be equal to?

00:20:24.697 --> 00:20:26.030
It's not going to be equal to x.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:35.060
It's going to be equal
to x minus 1, right?

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:47.290
And so that means that,
so, this condition now

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.060
has a satisfying assignment.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:50.560
Right?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.600
Now this can fail, but what
if you go to the developer

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:03.320
and say, hey, this
function can blow up

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.710
whenever x is greater than y.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:11.150
And the developer
looks at this and says,

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.340
oh, I forgot to tell you.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.410
Actually, this
function can never

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:23.090
be called with parameters
where x is greater than y.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.830
Right?

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.110
That the client that calls
this function is just

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.140
a quick function that
I wrote for something.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.060
And it has this branch for
some historical purpose.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.140
But actually this
function will never

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.240
get called with
x greater than y.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.150
You're like, well,
now you tell me.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:39.870
Right?

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.060
But the way we can
think about this

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:55.830
is that there is an assumption
that x is going to be less than

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.360
or equal to y, right?

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.020
This is sometimes referred to
as a precondition or a contract

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.890
for this function.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.639
The function is promising
to do something,

00:22:04.639 --> 00:22:06.622
but only if you satisfy
this assumption.

00:22:06.622 --> 00:22:09.080
And if you don't satisfy the
assumption, the function says,

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.026
I don't care what happens.

00:22:11.026 --> 00:22:12.400
I only promise
that I'm not going

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.390
to fail when this
assumption is satisfied.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.370
And it's the
responsibility of the color

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.790
to make sure that this condition
is never violated, right?

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:26.340
So how would we
encode that constraint

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.040
when we're solving
for equations?

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.280
Well, essentially
what we have is

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.780
we have this set
of constraints that

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.040
tell us whether this
branch is feasible.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.100
And on top of the constraints
that we already have

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:45.530
we need to also make sure
that the precondition,

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.260
or the assumptions
are satisfied.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:48.820
Right?

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.210
And now we want to
ask, OK, so can I

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.780
find an x and a y that satisfy
all of these constraints

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.630
together with these constraint
that I have on the input,

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.540
with these properties
that I know

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.500
that the input must satisfy?

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.810
And once again you can
see that this constraint

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.050
of x less than or equal
to y is the difference

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:13.940
between this constraint
being satisfiable,

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.780
and this constraint once
again becoming unsatisfiable.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.450
That's a very important issue
when dealing with analysis,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.910
especially when you want
to do this marginally

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.990
at the level of individual
functions at a time.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:32.220
It makes sense to know
what the assumptions are

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.412
that the programmer
had in mind when

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:36.620
writing this function,
because if you don't know what

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.760
those assumptions were
you could say, yeah, here

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.780
are some inputs where it's going
to fail only for the programmer

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.530
to dismiss myth that by saying,
oh, but those inputs are not

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.489
possible, or those
inputs can never happen.

00:23:49.489 --> 00:23:50.155
Other questions?

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:58.070
All right.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.210
So how do we do this in
a more mechanical way?

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:07.965
So there are two
aspects to this problem.

00:24:07.965 --> 00:24:11.390
Aspect number one is
how do you actually

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.890
come up with these formulas?

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.770
So in this case it
was kind of intuitive

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.174
how we came up
with the formulas.

00:24:17.174 --> 00:24:19.090
where we were just working
through it by hand,

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.490
but how do you come
up with these formulas

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.390
in a mechanical way?

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.660
And aspect number two is
once you have the formulas,

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.520
how do you actually solve them?

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.140
How can you actually
solve these formulas

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.700
that describe whether
your program fails or not?

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.970
And I'm actually going to start
with that second question.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.350
Given that we're able to reduce
our problem to these formulas

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:54.280
that involve integer
reasoning that involved

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.910
in the case of
programs generally

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:57.721
you care about bit
vector reasoning.

00:24:57.721 --> 00:25:00.220
[INAUDIBLE] programs, a lot of
times, you care about arrays.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.920
You care about functions.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.180
And you end up with
these giant formulas.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.540
How in the world do you actually
solve them in a mechanical way?

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.020
And a lot of the technology
that we're talking about today,

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.870
and the reason why we're
actually talking about it

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:20.280
as a practical tool, have to
do with tremendous advances

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.170
in solvers for
logical questions.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.390
And in particular, there
is a very important class

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:31.300
of solvers called satisfiability
modulo theory solvers,

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.730
often abbreviated as SMT.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.230
But a lot of people
in the community

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.260
would argue that the name is
not a particularly good name,

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.820
but it's the one that everybody
uses and it has stuck.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.220
What you need to know
about these SMT solvers

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:50.840
is that an SMT solver is
an algorithm essentially

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.670
that given a logical
formula will give you

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.080
one of two things.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.430
it will give you either
a satisfying assignment

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:01.830
to the formula, or
it will tell you

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.990
that the formula
is unsatisfiable.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.490
And that there is no
possible assignment

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.590
to the variables in
that formula that

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.790
will satisfy these
constraints that you defined.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.820
Now in practice, if this
sounds a little bit scary

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.730
and a little bit like magic,
it is a little bit scary.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:25.350
A lot of the problems that
these SMT solvers have to solve

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.310
are NP-complete
in the best case.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.570
All right? the nice
ones are NP-complete.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.310
The hard ones can get
much harrier than that.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:41.040
So how can we have a system that
relies as its primary building

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.950
block on solving NP complete
PSPACE-complete problems?

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.020
And still have something
that works in practice?

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.570
And part of the answer is that
for a lot of these solvers

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.590
there is a third thing
that they can tell you,

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.440
which is, I don't know.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:14.530
And so part of the
beauty of these solvers

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.890
is that for practical
problems, even

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.900
for very, very large and
complicated practical problems,

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.660
they are still able to do
better than simply telling you,

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.410
I don't know.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.430
They are still able
to give you either

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.420
a guarantee that this
set of constraints

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.090
is unsatisfiable or an actual
satisfying assignment that

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:37.300
tells you exactly
what the answer is.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:41.750
Yes?

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:48.451
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
For example, [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:50.325
specification I don't
think you said anything

00:27:50.325 --> 00:27:54.000
about how many bits are used to
store an integer. [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:00.907 --> 00:28:02.990
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA:
That's a very good question.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.430
And that really has
to do with how you

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.810
define your constraints, right?

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:18.940
So If you look at our simple
example from the beginning,

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:25.140
in this case, we assume that
these were the integers as

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.640
learned in elementary school.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:34.420
And that we completely decided
to ignore overflow errors.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.920
If you care about
overflow errors,

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.510
if overflow errors are actually
essential to the kind of bugs

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.864
you're trying to find, this
would not be a good way

00:28:42.864 --> 00:28:43.780
to set up the problem.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:49.780
What you need is to represent
these not so fast integers,

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.910
but as bit-vectors.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.940
And the moment you represent
them as bit vectors

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.470
you have to have a
bit width in mind.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:01.530
And this goes back to
what this modular theory

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.670
aspect in the solver means.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.430
What this modular
theory aspect means

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.700
is that the solver is
actually extensible

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.140
with different theories.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:15.960
The most popular theories are
the theory of bit-vector which

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:21.450
are fixed length bit-vectors.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.150
That means that if you're
interpreting your formulas

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.664
in this theory of fixed
length bit-vectors

00:29:26.664 --> 00:29:28.580
you have to fix the
length of the bit-vectors.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.380
And you have to
explicitly specify

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:36.760
that these are going to be
32-bit bit-vectors, or 8 bit

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.326
bit-vectors, or
64-bit bit-vectors.

00:29:39.326 --> 00:29:42.284
AUDIENCE: So if you wanted
to make the the bit symbolic

00:29:42.284 --> 00:29:46.730
[INAUDIBLE], like this
is an x bit, is that--

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.140
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: So
there's another theory which

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.690
is called the theory of arrays.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.740
And we'll talk a little
bit more about it,

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.150
where unlike the
bit vector theory,

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.410
which is designed to be
for fixed length things

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.360
the theory of arrays is meant
to be for collections where

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.110
you don't actually
know the size a priori.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.040
Now in practice
nobody uses the theory

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.010
of arrays to model
integers, for example,

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.100
because it's too expensive.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.250
It becomes way more
expensive to reason about

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.070
when you don't know
what the bound is.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.840
So generally people
use fixed length theory

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.910
of bit-vectors when reasoning
about integers or characters

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.050
even.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:41.760
Another very common theory is
the theory of actual integer

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.520
arithmetic, and in particularly
linear integer arithmetic.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.200
This is a theory that
people like a lot because it

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.650
can be reasoned about
very, very efficiently,

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.930
but it's not
particularly good when

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.960
you're reasoning about programs,
because in general you really

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.040
do care about overflow issues.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.680
But it's actually very widely
used for many, many things.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.240
The other theory that you're
likely to see people using

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:13.535
is the theory of
uninterpreted functions.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.060
So what does it mean, the theory
of an uninterpreted function?

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:27.200
It means that you have a formula
where somewhere in your formula

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.350
you know that you're
calling a function,

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.270
but you know nothing
about that function

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:39.200
other than the fact that it is
a function, that if you give it

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.870
the same inputs you get
the same outputs in return.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.190
And it turns out this is
very, very useful sometimes

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.310
when trying to
reason about things

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:53.190
like if you floating point
code, modeling, sine, cosines,

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.025
square roots can be very
messy and expensive,

00:31:56.025 --> 00:31:57.650
but you can say,
look, I don't actually

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:01.030
care about what the
sine function does.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.200
I don't care about
what its output is.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.600
All I know is that if I
call the sine function

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.390
in many different
places with the input

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.830
I will get the same output.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:14.100
And that's enough for me
to reason about my code.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.350
And so the most
common ones you will

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:21.140
see when analyzing
real systems are

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.510
bit-vectors to deal
with integers, and logs,

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.110
and pointers.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.990
Actually, pointers are often
represented with integer

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.760
because you're
generally not going

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.500
to be doing complicated
bit whittling on pointers.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.650
Sometimes you will and then
you can't use integers anymore.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.210
So OK.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.470
So that's all well and good.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.650
That's what an SMT
solver can do for you.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.900
How does it actually work?

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.870
What's inside it
that makes it work?

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:01.820
And SMT solvers actually
rely on our ability

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.690
to solve SAT problems,
on our ability

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:10.350
to take problems involving
just purely Boolean constraints

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.650
and Boolean variables,
and telling us

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.680
whether there is an assignment
to these Boolean variables

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.370
that is satisfiable or not.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:24.400
And this is the kind of thing
that for many, many years

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.416
people in undergrad have been
taught that actually this

00:33:27.416 --> 00:33:28.690
is an NP-complete problem.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.680
The moment something
reduces to SAT

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.220
you know you shouldn't
do it, but it turns out

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.960
that we actually have
some very, very good SAT

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.720
solvers out there.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:42.060
Probably most of you even
built one as part of 6005.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.940
Am I right?

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.200
Or some of you did.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.780
So I'll tell you the basic idea
behind how SAT solvers work.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:56.140
And the basic idea is that
you take all your constraints

00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.440
on your Boolean variables and
you put them into a database.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.450
And what is a constraint?

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:06.950
Is this too small or can
people in the back read this?

00:34:09.662 --> 00:34:10.570
AUDIENCE: Too small.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:11.179
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: Too small?

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:11.679
OK.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.469
Let's see if we can
make this bigger.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.331
Is this a little bit better?

00:34:45.331 --> 00:34:46.305
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:46.305 --> 00:34:47.770
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: OK.

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:51.000
Well, here's what I'll do.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.030
I will annotate and I
will narrate it as I go.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.810
And I'll post the slides later.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.660
So people can see what it says.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.650
So what we have
here in SAT problem

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:06.770
is that we have all these
variables that represent

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.460
Boolean unknowns, right?

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.620
We want to know is
it possible for x

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.170
to be true, and y to be true,
and z to be true at the same,

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.820
for example.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.320
Right?

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.330
And these are our unknowns.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:22.750
And all the constraints are
in conjunctive normal form.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.590
What that means is
all our constraints

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:33.920
are of the form either x1
is true, or x2 is true,

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.951
or x3 is true, for example.

00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:38.450
Right?

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:42.200
So what we have is we have all
our constraints in this form

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.130
and some of them might say,
well, either x1 is true,

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:48.970
or x2 is false, or x3 is false.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:49.470
Right?

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:50.880
So we have constraints.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.500
All our constraints
are of this form.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.780
And you probably remember
from discrete math

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.700
that any Boolean formula
can be represented

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.264
in conjunctive normal form.

00:36:01.264 --> 00:36:03.680
And it has the added benefit
that it's actually very, very

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.370
easy to translate from arbitrary
representations of a formula

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.970
to these conjunctive normal form
formula, which means whatever

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.180
representation you're using
to represent Boolean formulas,

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:19.130
you can very easily
convert it to this format.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.730
So what we have is
we have a database

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.230
with lots of constraints
of this form.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.380
And what SAT solver
is going to do

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.540
is going to pick one of
these variables at random.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.950
Let's say it's going to pick x1.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.180
And it's going to say, why
don't we set x1 to true?

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.120
I don't know anything
about this problem.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.130
Might as well try
selling it to true.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.050
And then what will happen is
you'll have some constraints

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:48.390
that mention x1 and let's say
that you have a constraint that

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:53.160
says either x1 is
false or x7 is true.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:53.660
Right?

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.700
So if you know that
x1 is true and you

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.430
know that either x1 is
false or x7 is true,

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:04.105
what do you know about x7?

00:37:04.105 --> 00:37:05.145
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:05.145 --> 00:37:06.270
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: Yeah.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.990
It has to be true.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.489
Right?

00:37:07.489 --> 00:37:09.000
Because otherwise
this constraint

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.660
would not be satisfied.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:16.420
And so now you've propagated
this assignment from x1 to x7.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.370
And let's say now you pick
some other random variable.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.090
You say, well, what about x5?

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:24.140
Why don't we try x5 being true?

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:24.640
Right?

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.600
And now let's say that you
have a constraint that says,

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:41.850
well, either x7 is false, or
x6 is true, or x5 is false.

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:42.350
Right?

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:48.500
So I have x5 being true
and I have x7 being true.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.640
So that means x6
now has to be true.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.140
Right?

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.760
Because otherwise this
constraint would be violated.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.520
And so from that the
system infers, OK.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.500
So x6 has to be true.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.680
And it keeps at this
process essentially

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.820
trying out assignments.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.290
And then looking at all
the available clauses,

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.750
and looking at,
hey, are there are

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:14.080
other things that are
implied by the assignments

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.090
that I have so far?

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:20.190
And following those implications
until one of two things

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.690
happens.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:23.480
Either you keep following
implications and trying

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.490
random things and eventually
you have set a value

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.460
to every single
variable without ever

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.550
running into a contradiction.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.580
And then you're done.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.080
Right?

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.240
You found a satisfying
assignment, or what can happen

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.580
is you run into a contradiction.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:45.690
You run into a place where there
was a clause that forced x4

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:49.900
to be true, except there was
another clause that forced x4

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.950
to be false.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:55.080
And if there's one rule of
Boolean algebra that everybody

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.090
should know, is that you cannot
have a variable be true and be

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.860
false at the same time.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.360
Right?

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.859
And so what that
tells you is you've

00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:03.690
run into a contradiction.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:05.840
You clearly did
something wrong in one

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.200
of these random assignments
that you were trying.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.680
So now let's analyze
this contradiction.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.820
Let's figure out what
were the assignments that

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.790
led to this contradiction.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:20.690
And based on the assignments
that led to that contradiction,

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:25.010
let's come up with a
new conflict clause that

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.560
summarizes that contradiction.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.170
So in this case,
what would happen

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:38.180
is that you have x1 being
false, and x5 being false.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:41.130
And x9 being false, right?

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:44.530
So essentially what this is
saying is that based on what I

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.840
learned from these random
assignments I discovered that

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.560
one of these things
has to be true,

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.440
that it cannot be the case that
x1 is true, and x5 is true,

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.990
and x9 is false.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.000
That cannot happen.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.240
And I know that cannot happen
because when I tried that

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:00.965
things blew up.

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:03.050
I ended up with a contradiction.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.330
And so what SAT solver is doing
is trying random assignments,

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.030
propagating them through.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.630
When it runs into
contradictions it's

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:12.600
analyzing the set
of implications

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.130
that led to that contradiction.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:17.690
And summarising that in
a new constraint that

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.650
will make sure
that it never runs

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.980
into this contradiction
again, that it never

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.574
runs into this
particular problem again.

00:40:25.574 --> 00:40:26.240
Other questions?

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.460
OK.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:36.730
So so far so good.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:40.040
So we can't really
think of the SAT solver

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.830
as just a black box that
given a Boolean constraint

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.380
it can either say, no,
this Boolean constraint is

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.130
unsatisfiable, or it
can say, yeah, here's

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.270
a satisfying assignment to
that Boolean constraint.

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:57.137
So SMT solvers are built
on top of SAT solvers.

00:40:57.137 --> 00:40:58.720
And what they're
able to do is they're

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.670
able to combine the
power of the SAT solver

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:08.130
to solve these NP-complete
SAT problems with domain

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:12.190
specific reasoning to reason
about the different theories

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.000
that are supported.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.460
So to give you an
idea of how it works,

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.226
and this is going to
be a fairly high level,

00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:19.600
but to give you
an idea of how it

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.000
works let's say that you have
a formula like this, right?

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.635
So you say x is greater
than 5 and y is less than 5.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:33.791
And either y is greater than
x or y is greater than 2.

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:34.290
Right?

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.310
So is that satisfiable?

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.490
Can we find a satisfying
assignment for that?

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:46.940
So what an SMT solver can
do is separate out the part

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.950
of this formula that requires
domain reasoning, that

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:52.930
requires reasoning in
the theory, in this case,

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:54.150
of integers.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.730
With the part of
this formula that

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.770
is just the Boolean structure.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:01.616
So if you separate the
Boolean structure here,

00:42:01.616 --> 00:42:02.990
essentially what
you're saying is

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:09.034
that there's some formula,
F1 and some formula F2,

00:42:09.034 --> 00:42:11.800
and either F3 or F4.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.300
Right?

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.740
And now this is a purely
Boolean problem, right?

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.060
It's just a problem of
can I find a satisfying

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.110
assignment for that?

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:24.280
Is there a satisfying
assignment for that?

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.570
And, again, this is
just a Boolean formula.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.385
Goes to a SAT solver and the
SAT solver can say, yeah.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.010
I can find a satisfying
assignment for this.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.220
And I can find a
satisfying assignment

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:43.740
by making this true, and
this true, and this true.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:44.240
Right?

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.010
It's a satisfying assignment
for the Boolean formula.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.670
So now we have a question
that we can go and ask

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.160
the domain specific solver.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:59.700
In this case just a
linear arithmetic solver.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.130
So we can go to
the linear solver

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.050
and say, hey, so the
SAT solver claims

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.990
that this is a reasonable
assignment, that if I

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:08.930
can make that
assignment work, then

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:10.890
my formula will be satisfied.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:17.160
So I can go and say, well F1 was
actually this, and F2 was this,

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.740
and F3 was this.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.290
So I can ask a theory solver, is
it possible to get an x and a y

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.030
such that x is greater
than 5, y is less than 5,

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:28.200
and y is greater than x?

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.410
Right, so now this is a question
purely about linear arithmetic.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:36.484
There's no Boolean
logic involved.

00:43:36.484 --> 00:43:37.400
And what's the answer?

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:40.460
No.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:40.960
Right?

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.210
And there are
traditional methods

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.960
to solve these kinds
of your problems.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.730
You could use the simplex
method, for example,

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.570
to solve systems of
linear inequalities.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.070
There's lots of
methods that you can

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.530
use to solve systems
of linear inequalities.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.770
The point is the theory solver
knows about all of those.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.630
And the theory
solver can say, no.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:04.670
This will not work.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.640
This is an assignment
that will not work.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:13.510
And so the theory solver can
now go back to the SAT solver

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:15.740
and not just tell the SAT
solver, hey, that thing

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.300
that you did, that didn't work.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.920
But it can also give
more of an explanation.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.370
So in this case, what you can
conclude from the fact that

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.880
this didn't work is that
actually in addition

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.360
to satisfying this formula you
also want to satisfy the fact

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:40.500
that I cannot have F1,
and F2, and F3, right?

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.810
My theory solver has
told me that these three

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.460
things are mutually exclusive.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.890
I cannot satisfy all
three of them together.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:49.660
And so now that's a
piece of information

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.230
that I can go back
to the SAT solver

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.320
and ask the SAT
solver, hey, can you

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.000
give me a solution
that satisfies

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.440
not only the constraint that
you had in the beginning,

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.410
but also this new
constraint that the theory

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.091
solver discovered?

00:45:05.091 --> 00:45:05.590
Right?

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:09.587
So now is there some other
assignment that satisfies now

00:45:09.587 --> 00:45:10.670
both of these constraints?

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.070
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: Yeah.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:25.870
So there's an assignment
where this becomes false.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:27.415
And this becomes true.

00:45:27.415 --> 00:45:29.040
And that's an assignment
that satisfies

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.160
the constraint on the top.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.250
It satisfies the
constraint on the bottom.

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:34.480
And so once again
that's an assignment

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.856
that leads to a new constraint.

00:45:37.856 --> 00:45:39.230
So this constraint
now goes away.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:40.900
We don't care about it any more.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:44.790
We have a new constraint that we
can ask our theory solver, hey,

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:46.520
it this possible?

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.870
And in this case the
theory solver says, yeah.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:50.310
That actually is possible.

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:57.630
You can make y equal
3 and x equal 6.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.100
And it works.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:45:59.600
Right?

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.820
And so now you
have an assignment

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.150
that satisfies the
formula in the theory

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:11.127
and that satisfies
the Boolean structure

00:46:11.127 --> 00:46:12.085
behind this assignment.

00:46:12.085 --> 00:46:15.240
And with that the system can
come back and tell you, yeah.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.660
Here's an assignment that
satisfies all your constraints.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.870
And so it's this
interaction back and forth

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.660
between the theory solver
and the SAT solver.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.610
And really the ability
to be able to reason

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:31.440
about very, very large and very
complicated Boolean formulas.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.990
That's what makes symbolic
execution possible.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:41.910
So now that we have that
the next question is,

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:52.620
so how do we go from a
program to a constraint

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.090
that we can give
to an SMT solver?

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:54.630
Yes?

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.000
AUDIENCE: Sorry for going back.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.125
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: Sure.

00:46:57.125 --> 00:46:58.622
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
previously.

00:46:58.622 --> 00:47:05.608
But could you run me again the
whole issue of constructing

00:47:05.608 --> 00:47:07.105
the SMT statements?

00:47:07.105 --> 00:47:10.620
Is it an NP-complete or
is it not? [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.670
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA:
So the problems

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:15.190
that the SMT
solvers are solving,

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:20.180
those are NP-complete
problems in the best of cases.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:24.270
So SAT itself is the
canonical NP-complete problem,

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:28.630
but a lot of solvers these
days even include support

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:34.590
for some theories that
are outright undecidable.

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:35.270
So--

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:39.050
AUDIENCE: So how do you
approach that in your system?

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:42.840
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: Well, at
the end of the day what you get

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:48.590
is you're going to create a
constraint from this program.

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.890
You're going to give
it to the SMT solver.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.120
And the fact that these
are NP-complete problems,

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.630
or the fact that they're
unsatisfiable, what it means

00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:03.570
is that if you're lucky, you
will get an answer in seconds.

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:06.770
And if you're not
lucky, then it might

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:09.670
take longer than the age of
the universe for the thing

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.009
to give you an answer.

00:48:11.009 --> 00:48:11.550
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.841
How often do you run into
cases where your system just

00:48:14.841 --> 00:48:18.746
flat-lines and says, sorry, I
just can't figure this out yet?

00:48:18.746 --> 00:48:20.560
Has that ever happened
or is that just--

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.070
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: Yes.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.140
Yes, it does happen.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.666
And a big part of
the engineering

00:48:24.666 --> 00:48:27.340
of these kind of
tools is making sure

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.420
that this happens as
infrequently as possible.

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:35.890
And part what makes
this work at all

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:40.530
is that we're not solving
random SAT problems.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:44.450
We're not solving completely
random bit-vector problems.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:47.390
We're solving problems that
have a certain structure to them

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:50.760
that a person was
able to look at it

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.750
and least have some confidence
that this worked, right?

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:57.070
Build some argument in their
head for why this worked.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.260
And so what the solvers
are trying to do

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.640
is essentially exploiting
that structure.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.260
And taking advantage, for
example, the description

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.194
that I gave you of what the
SAT solver is doing internally,

00:49:08.194 --> 00:49:10.110
that's taking advantage
of the fact that, yes.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:13.390
Your problem might have a
million Boolean variables,

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.280
but actually most
of those variables

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.430
are very tightly dependent
on the values of each other.

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:20.990
So the number of degrees
of freedom in the problem

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:23.730
is actually much smaller
than what the million

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:24.848
variables would suggest.

00:49:24.848 --> 00:49:27.056
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
is that this isn't an exam

00:49:27.056 --> 00:49:27.540
question.

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:28.024
This is real life.

00:49:28.024 --> 00:49:29.476
And someone built this system.

00:49:29.476 --> 00:49:30.444
It was supposed to
work and make sense.

00:49:30.444 --> 00:49:32.138
So it's probably
not going to be one

00:49:32.138 --> 00:49:34.292
of those wildly bizarre
theoretical [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:34.292 --> 00:49:35.750
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA:
That's right.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.760
And in practice what
happens and when

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.020
you use this tool is the
thing is you always do

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.180
is set timeouts.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.864
So generally, what happens
is because it's exponential,

00:49:49.864 --> 00:49:51.780
exponential doesn't mean
that you can't do it.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.820
Exponential just means
that there's a brick wall,

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.700
that before that brick
wall things will work,

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.620
and in fact, they
will work really fast.

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.120
Right?

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.660
The exponential
works in both ways.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.480
Yes, when you're
going out then things

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.520
are growing very
quickly, but when

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.980
you're going toward smaller
problems, or simpler problems

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.490
things are also getting
faster very, very quickly.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:17.120
So in general what that means
is that lots of problems

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.190
finish very, very quickly.

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:21.350
And then some problems timeout.

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:24.630
And the key is to engineer
things in such a way

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:28.990
that among the problems that
finish quickly are actually

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:30.960
problems of practical use.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.410
Or problems that will
actually point you

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.450
to security vulnerabilities
in your system,

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:39.560
will point you to bugs,
will point you to a path

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.390
that you maybe haven't
explored before,

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:43.560
or inputs that will take
you down paths that you

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.432
hadn't explored before.

00:50:45.432 --> 00:50:46.207
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:50:46.207 --> 00:50:47.790
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA:
Other questions?

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.460
All right.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:57.750
So we know how to
go from a formula,

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:01.690
from a set of constraints, to
an answer that will either say,

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.170
yes, this formula
has a solution.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:08.060
And here's a solution, or no,
this formula is unsatisfiable.

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.950
There is no input
that satisfies this.

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:15.310
So now how do we get a
formula from a program?

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:18.970
So one of the
things that you have

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:20.730
when you're doing
symbolic execution

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:23.035
is that when you get
to a branch and you

00:51:23.035 --> 00:51:26.600
don't know which direction
the branch is going to go.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:30.660
Now there are two possibilities
that you can do in that case.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:35.040
One is to do what we did in the
early example, which is just

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.960
to say, I'm going to take both
branches at the same time.

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.790
I'm going to collect what
happens in mode's branches,

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:42.270
merge at the end.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:46.100
That is a strategy
that is often used

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:50.710
when you're trying to get very
strong guarantees in general.

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:54.080
But it's a strategy that
doesn't work too well

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.060
with modern and SMT solvers.

00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:02.674
So often people prefer to do
one path at a time exploration.

00:52:02.674 --> 00:52:04.090
And what that means
is that you're

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.730
going to pick a path
down your program.

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:10.420
And then you're going to
create a formula for that path.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.800
So you're going to ask, fine
me an input that goes down

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:18.640
this path and that
satisfies my constraint,

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.880
or that violates
my property, that

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:26.370
goes out of bounds in my buffer,
or that causes a null pointer

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:27.840
error.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.860
And then if you
can't find one then

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.020
you try a different path
and a different path.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:38.260
And you do these path
explorations one at a time.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:42.000
So that's the strategy that
we're going to talk about now.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.900
It's a little bit easier
to describe how to do it.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:49.440
So let's say that we
have a problem like this.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.690
So, by the way, I
switched representations.

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:54.170
So I'm not representing the
program as a block of code

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:58.220
and representing it as
a control flow graph.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.610
Is everybody here familiar
with a control flow graph?

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:03.930
Or is anybody here not familiar
with a control flow graph?

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:05.790
It's just a representation
of a program that

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:08.940
makes branches more explicit.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.420
So let's pick a path.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.610
And so let's say that we
care about this path, right,

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.790
a path that starts
at the beginning

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:23.310
and takes us all the way
down to the point where

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:27.090
we are asserting false.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.780
And we want to know,
is this path feasible?

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.990
Could the program
go down this path?

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:35.800
So as we're going
down this program

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.660
we're going to keep two things.

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:43.870
We're going to keep
an environment that

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:46.830
keeps track of the
symbolic values

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:48.580
of the different variables.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:52.700
And in addition to that,
we're going to keep around

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.710
an environment for constraints.

00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:05.650
And these constraints
are essentially

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:08.150
going to keep track of
all the relationships

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:12.000
between these variables as
well as any assumptions,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.480
whether they were
assumptions that

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.830
were made at the
beginning, or assumptions

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:18.320
that come from the branches
that you are taking.

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.350
So in this case, when
we start down this path

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:29.490
we get to t equals 0, so
our state is x, y, and 0.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:31.090
And so far we have
no constraints

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:35.290
because we didn't have any
constraint in the beginning.

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:39.224
So now we're going
to take this branch

00:54:39.224 --> 00:54:41.390
and, again, because we've
made a decision that we're

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:45.950
going to go down the
path to your right,

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:51.358
then we know that this
path will only happen when?

00:54:56.506 --> 00:54:57.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:58.908
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA:
That's right.

00:54:58.908 --> 00:55:04.970
So we get our first constraint
that says, x is greater than y.

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:05.470
Right?

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:13.410
So now down here we're
looking at t equals y.

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:16.510
Now in this case because we're
going only one path at a time

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:19.850
we don't actually need to
introduce a new variable for t

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:20.520
necessarily.

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.340
We can just say, OK.

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.750
t is equal to y.

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:27.640
So that means that
t is no longer 0.

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.130
It's now y.

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.740
Right?

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:32.840
And then keep going.

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.860
We get to this point.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.990
Now we hit another branch.

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:39.490
What's a new
assumption that we have

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:41.740
to make if we're assuming
that we went down this path?

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.410
Just t less than y, right?

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:52.880
And what is t?

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:57.120
Right.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.840
So in fact if we look up
t, so t has the value y.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.916
We look up y.

00:56:01.916 --> 00:56:03.300
y also has the value of y.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:09.290
So this constraint actually
translates to y less than y.

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.320
So what does this tell us?

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:16.750
It tells us that in order
to make it to this point,

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:20.280
in order to make it to a assert
false, all of those things

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.340
have to hold.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.730
Can they hold?

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:23.920
Clearly not.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:24.670
Right?

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:28.350
y less than y alone is
already sufficient for things

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:29.550
not to hold.

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:35.980
And so that tells us immediately
that this is unsatisfiable.

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:39.940
And this is often known
as a path condition.

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:42.030
This is a condition
that has to be

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:47.020
true in order for the
program to go down that path.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:51.630
And so we know that this path
condition cannot be satisfied.

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:54.650
And therefore, that it's
impossible for the program

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:55.970
to take this path.

00:56:55.970 --> 00:57:01.480
So this path is now
completely eliminated.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.680
We know that this
path cannot be taken.

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:08.640
And, in fact, so
this constraint we're

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:13.650
actually going to just keep them
around as the condition itself.

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:14.150
All right?

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:17.860
So what about a different path?

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:21.840
So now we're trying this path.

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:29.140
So what would be the
path condition for this?

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:35.920
So, again, our symbolic
state starts with t equals 0,

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.270
and x and y equals to just
the variables x and y.

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:43.060
And now how does
the path constraint

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.610
look like in this case?

00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:48.115
So by the time we get here how
does the path condition look

00:57:48.115 --> 00:57:48.615
like?

00:57:50.984 --> 00:57:51.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:53.818 --> 00:57:54.984
ARMANDO SOLAR LEZAMA: Right.

00:57:54.984 --> 00:57:59.860
So in this case [INAUDIBLE]
this is true and this is false.

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.590
So in this case it says,
OK. x is greater than y.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:10.900
And we are setting
t to be equal to x.

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:21.290
So then when we get here
we have x is less than y.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:21.790
Right?

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:24.830
And once again it's very
clear that this path condition

00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:26.940
is unsatisfiable.

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:27.440
Right?

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.960
We cannot have x greater than
y and x less than y at the same

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:31.460
time.

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.970
There's no assignment
to x that will satisfy

00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:35.360
both of those constraints.

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.740
So what that tells us is, again,
that this other path is also

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.030
unsatisfiable.

00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:42.030
And now at this
point we've actually

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:46.280
explored every possible path in
our program that could lead us

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.040
to this condition.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.200
So we can actually
establish and certify

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:56.890
that there is no possible path
that will lead to an assertion

00:58:56.890 --> 00:58:57.710
failure.

00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:58.539
Yes?

00:58:58.539 --> 00:59:00.205
AUDIENCE: The way you
just presented it,

00:59:00.205 --> 00:59:03.995
it makes it look as if you would
explore every possible branch.

00:59:03.995 --> 00:59:06.120
I mean, one of the advantages
of symbolic execution

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.953
is that you're trying
to prevent [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:07.953 --> 00:59:11.730
a need of exploring all possible
[INAUDIBLE] exponential.

00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:13.356
So how are you avoiding
that over here?

00:59:13.356 --> 00:59:15.730
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: That's
a very good question, right?

00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:18.080
So in this case essentially
what you have is

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.160
you have a trade off between
high symbolic and how concrete

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.101
you want to be.

00:59:22.101 --> 00:59:22.600
Right?

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:26.990
So in this case we are not
as symbolic as the first time

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.810
around when we were visiting
both branches at the same time,

00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:34.460
but in exchange for that our
constraints became very, very

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:35.221
simple.

00:59:35.221 --> 00:59:35.720
Right?

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:39.370
So the individual path by path
constraints are very simple,

00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:42.050
but you have to do this over,
and over, and over again

00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:44.310
to explore all the
different branches.

00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:46.930
And there are exponentially--
all the different paths.

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:50.580
And there are exponentially
many paths in a program.

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:53.110
Now there are
exponentially many paths,

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:55.540
but for every path
in general, there's

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:58.580
also an exponentially
large set of inputs

00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.234
that could go down that path.

01:00:00.234 --> 01:00:02.525
So this already gives you a
big benefit because instead

01:00:02.525 --> 01:00:05.220
of having to try every
possible input you're only

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:08.220
trying every possible path.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.430
But can you do better?

01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:14.370
And this is one of the
areas where there's

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:19.040
been a lot of experimentation in
the area of symbolic execution.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.700
When you do path
by path reasoning?

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.180
When do you do all
paths at the same time?

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.550
And one of the things
that you saw, for example,

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:31.750
in the [? Clee ?] paper
is a set of heuristics,

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:33.550
and a set of
strategies they used

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:35.360
to make the search tractable.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.530
For example, one of
the things that they do

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:40.890
is that they are
exploring path by path,

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:43.300
but they're not exploring
completely blindly.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:47.960
And they are also checking
the path conditions

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.670
after every step.

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:53.480
So that, for example,
if here instead of just

01:00:53.480 --> 01:01:02.110
assert false, if this were
a very complex program tree,

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:03.440
control flow graph.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.860
You don't wait until
you get to the very end

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.330
to check whether the
path is feasible.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:13.870
The moment you get here you know
that this path is unsatisfiable

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:16.330
and you never go
down this direction.

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:18.950
You always go in
the other direction.

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:24.670
So pruning the paths
early helps cut down a lot

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:26.180
on the experiential blow up.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.590
And exploring the
paths intelligently

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:32.510
helps a lot in
preventing blow up.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:35.270
A lot of the practical
tools that are used today,

01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:36.770
some of the things
that they will do

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:39.710
is they will actually start
with some random testing

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:42.520
to get an initial set of paths.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.660
And then they will start looking
for paths in the neighborhood

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.900
of those paths.

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:50.310
They will start asking questions
like, hey, the random execution

01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:51.430
went down this branch.

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:52.770
What if I flip this branch?

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:54.130
What if I flip this branch?

01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:55.560
What if I flip this branch?

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.780
What happens in those paths?

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.750
Can be particularly
useful, for example,

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:01.210
if we have a good test suite.

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:04.220
And you run your test suite
and you find, OK, there

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:07.200
is this piece of code that
nothing in my test suite

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.720
exercised.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.600
So what you can do is you can
take the path that got closest

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.510
to exercising that,
and then ask, hey,

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:19.630
can I change this path so that
it goes down this direction

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:20.930
instead?

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:25.970
And so in general,
the moment you

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:28.690
try to do all paths
simultaneously

01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:31.420
the constraints start
becoming intractable.

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.910
And it's the kind
of thing that you

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:37.250
can do if you're doing
one function at a time.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.420
For example, if you're
doing one function at a time

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:42.140
then it is generally feasible
to explore all the paths

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.790
in a function together.

01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:47.660
If you're trying to do
larger units, then generally

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:50.105
you have to go with path
by path exploration.

01:02:53.392 --> 01:02:54.475
Are there other questions?

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.380
Yes?

01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:00.302
AUDIENCE: You referenced
how [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:00.302 --> 01:03:02.250
How does it do that again?

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.920
What's the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.140
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: So the
most important one really is

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:13.600
this idea that for every branch,
you check your constraints

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.490
to check whether that branch
can actually go both ways,

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:23.670
because if it cannot go both
ways then you save a lot just

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:26.390
going in this direction
of where it can't go.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.780
Beyond that I don't remember
the specific strategy

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.220
that they use for searching
paths that are more

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.570
likely to give good results.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.580
But pruning is really,
really important.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.930
OK.

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:48.560
So far though we've been
talking mostly about toy code

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.360
in the sense that it's only
integer variables, branches,

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.760
very simple stuff.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:55.430
Right?

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:59.090
What happens when you
have a program that

01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:01.680
is more complicated?

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.790
And in particular, what happens
when you have a program that

01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:08.031
involves the heap?

01:04:08.031 --> 01:04:08.530
Right?

01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:11.580
So the heap has
historically been

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.080
the bane of all program
analysis, analysis

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.180
that were so clean and so
elegant in the days of Fortran,

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.230
completely blow up when you
try to run them on a C program

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:23.410
where you're allocating
memory left and right.

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:25.280
And you have aliasing.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.680
And you have all
the messiness that

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.410
comes with dealing with
program allocated memory.

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:34.660
And with pointers and
pointer arithmetic.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.840
And this is one of the areas
where symbolic execution really

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.840
shines in the ability
to actually reason

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.450
about these kinds of programs.

01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:44.190
So how do we do it?

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:47.640
Right, so let's forget now
for a moment about branches,

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.530
and control flow.

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:53.080
We have a trivially
simple program here.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.630
All it's doing is it's
allocating some memory.

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:58.090
It's zeroing it out.

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:02.500
It's getting a new pointer
y from the pointer x.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.380
It's writing something into y.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:08.140
And then it's checking,
hey, is the value

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.070
stored at pointer y equal to
the value stored at pointer x?

01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:14.390
And just from your
basic knowledge of C

01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:16.920
you could see that, no.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:22.081
Right, that this assertion is
actually violated because x got

01:05:22.081 --> 01:05:26.570
zeroed out and y
has 25 in there,

01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:30.210
but x is pointing to
a different location.

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:33.030
Right?

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.000
So far so good.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.570
The way we're going to
model the heap and the way

01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:41.140
the heap is modeled in
a lot of these systems

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:45.070
is by not thinking of
the heap as a heap,

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:48.150
but to thinking of
the heat the way

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:51.840
C likes for you to think
of the heap, which is just

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:57.500
a giant address base, a giant
array where you can put things

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.640
into.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.800
So what does that mean?

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.340
It means that we can
think of our program

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:07.780
as having this very
big global array.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.980
And we're just going
to call it MEM for now.

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.480
Right?

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.530
And it's an array that
essentially is going

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:17.630
to map addresses to values.

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:18.130
Right?

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:19.330
And what's an address?

01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:25.710
Well, an address is
just a 64-bit value.

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:30.040
And what comes after you read
something from an address?

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.750
It depends on how
you're modeling memory.

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:36.620
If you're modeling it at the
byte level, then what comes out

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.960
is a byte.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.460
If you're modeling it
at the word level then

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.880
what comes out of it is a word.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.490
And depending on the kind of
bugs that you're interested in,

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:47.920
and whether things
like memory alignment

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.650
are an issue for
you are not, you're

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:51.441
going to model it a
little bit differently,

01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:53.810
but generally memory
is just an array

01:06:53.810 --> 01:07:00.030
from an address to a value.

01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:00.530
Right?

01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:07.260
So an address is
just an integer.

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:08.147
Right?

01:07:08.147 --> 01:07:10.230
It's in some sense not
that different from the way

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:11.550
C thinks I'm an address.

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:12.870
It's just an integer.

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:15.430
It's just a value.

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:18.740
It's just a 64-bit integer,
or a 32-bit integer,

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.010
depending on your machine.

01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:22.930
It just a value that
indexes into that memory.

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:24.990
And that you can put
things in memory,

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:27.490
read them from the memory.

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:30.860
So things like
pointer arithmetic

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.304
just becomes integer arithmetic.

01:07:33.304 --> 01:07:35.220
In practice there's a
little bit of desugaring

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:43.020
that has to happen because in C
the pointer arithmetic actually

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.290
knows about the types
of the pointers.

01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:50.030
And things will be incremented
proportional to the size,

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:50.530
right?

01:07:50.530 --> 01:08:00.100
So this would actually be x
plus 10 times the size of int.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.320
Right?

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.440
But what's really
important is what

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.610
happens when you're reading
and writing from memory.

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:11.590
So what used to be just a
pointer reference from y

01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:17.109
to write 25, is now just
I'm taking my memory array,

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:19.910
and I'm indexing it with y.

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:24.590
And I'm writing 25 to
that memory location.

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:25.090
Right?

01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:29.020
And this assertion
now becomes, well, I

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:32.430
am reading from
location y in memory.

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:35.100
And I am reading from
location x in memory.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.550
And I am comparing them.

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:40.010
And I'm checking whether
they are the same or not.

01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:41.510
It's a very, very
simple reduction

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:46.880
to go from program that uses the
heap to a program the just uses

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.790
this giant global array
that represents the memory.

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:53.649
And now what that
means is that in order

01:08:53.649 --> 01:08:55.764
to reason about programs
that manipulate the heap

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.680
you don't really have
to reason about programs

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.721
that manipulate the heap.

01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:01.510
As long as you have the
ability to reason about arrays,

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:02.399
you are good.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:04.700
Now here's a simple
question though.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.430
What about the malloc?

01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:11.479
So one thing you can do is
you can say, well, malloc,

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:16.240
I can just take the C
implementation of malloc

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.130
and actually implement
malloc like that.

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:23.130
And keep track of all the
pages that I have allocated

01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:26.950
and keep track of everything
that has been freed.

01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:29.109
And keep a free
list, and everything.

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:31.380
It turns out for
a lot of purposes

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.310
and for a lot of
classes of bugs,

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:35.185
you don't need malloc
to be that complicated.

01:09:35.185 --> 01:09:39.529
In fact, you can get away with
a malloc that looks like this,

01:09:39.529 --> 01:09:41.819
with a malloc that
just says, I'm

01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:49.330
going to keep a counter for
the next free memory location.

01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:55.560
And whenever somebody
asks for an address,

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.730
that address I'm just
going to give this position

01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:59.720
and then increment the position.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:00.220
Right?

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.769
And then return
rv, in this case.

01:10:11.626 --> 01:10:14.042
So one of the thing that is
malloc is completely ignoring.

01:10:17.754 --> 01:10:18.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:18.770
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: Yeah.

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:19.670
Freeing, right?

01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:21.939
This malloc says, yeah,
forget about freeing.

01:10:21.939 --> 01:10:22.730
There's no freeing.

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:26.650
We're just going to keep walking
through our memory allocating

01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:30.880
further, and further, and
further and that will be it.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.770
And we don't care
about freeing anything.

01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:36.710
It also doesn't really
care about the fact

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:39.759
that well, actually, there
are regions of memory where

01:10:39.759 --> 01:10:40.800
you shouldn't be writing.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.385
There are special
addresses that have

01:10:42.385 --> 01:10:44.960
special meaning that are
reserved for the operating

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.540
system.

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.560
It doesn't model
any of the things

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.580
that actually make writing a
malloc function complicated,

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.380
but at a certain
level of abstraction,

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:58.280
if you're trying to reason
about some complicated code that

01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.520
does pointer manipulation.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.130
And you don't care
about freeing memory,

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:04.600
but you really
care about is, am I

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.030
going to write past the end
of some buffer, for example.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.642
Then this malloc
might be good enough.

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:12.850
And this is actually that
happens very, very commonly

01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:15.380
when you're doing symbolic
execution of real code.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:19.080
A very important
step is the modeling

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.750
of your library functions.

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:22.800
And how you model
your library functions

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.760
is going to have a huge
impact on the one hand

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.110
on the performance and the
scalability of the analysis,

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:32.160
but on the other hand,
on the precision.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.670
So if you have a Mickey Mouse
model of malloc like this,

01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:37.930
it's going to be
very, very fast,

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:41.265
but there are going to be
certain classes of bugs

01:11:41.265 --> 01:11:43.060
that you won't be able to catch.

01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:43.560
Right?

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.630
So and this model, for
example, I'm completely

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:46.840
ignoring the allocations.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.840
So if I have a bug
because somebody

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.940
is accessing unallocated space.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:56.010
Well, I'm not going to find
it with this Mickey Mouse

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:58.860
model of malloc.

01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.660
Right?

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:04.400
So it's always a balance between
the precision of the analysis

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:10.400
versus the efficiency.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.030
And the more complicated your
models of standard functions

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:17.010
like malloc get,
the less scalable

01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:20.230
the analysis is going to be,
but for certain classes of bugs

01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:22.150
you will need those models.

01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:25.510
And one of the big things
in the [? Clee ?] paper

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:27.830
was really having
reasonable models

01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:31.440
for all the different
libraries in C,

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.940
all the different
libraries that are

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.350
needed in order to understand
what a program is actually

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.850
doing.

01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:40.177
So, OK.

01:12:40.177 --> 01:12:42.510
So we've reduced the problem
of reasoning about the heap

01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:47.220
to a problem of reasoning
about a program with arrays,

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:50.910
but I haven't actually
told you how to reason

01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:52.270
about a program with arrays.

01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:55.390
And it turns out
that most SMT solvers

01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:58.060
support a theory of arrays.

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.826
And the idea is
if a is an array,

01:13:01.826 --> 01:13:03.950
there's some notation to
say, well, take that array

01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:07.070
and create a new array
where location i has

01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:10.571
been updated to value e.

01:13:10.571 --> 01:13:11.070
All right?

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:14.820
So if I have array a and I
do this update operation,

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.340
and then I try to
read the value k,

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:20.180
then the meaning
is that the value k

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.370
is going to be
equal to the value k

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:25.330
at a if k is different from i.

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:29.350
And it's going to be equal to
e if k is equal to i, right?

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:31.290
That's what updating
an array means.

01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:33.890
That's what it means
to take an old array

01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:35.583
and update it to be a new array.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.780
And the nice thing about this is
that if you have a formula that

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:47.780
involves the theory of
arrays, so, for example,

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:51.850
I started with the zero array
that is just zeros everywhere.

01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:59.210
And then I wrote 5 into location
i, and 7 into location j.

01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:00.850
And then I'm reading from k.

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:04.680
And then I'm checking whether
that's equal to 5 or not.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:10.110
Then that can be expanded
by using this definition

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:14.450
to something that says,
well, if k is equal to i

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:19.290
then if k is equal to y,
and k is different from j,

01:14:19.290 --> 01:14:21.650
then, yes, this is
going to be equal to 5.

01:14:24.570 --> 01:14:30.640
And otherwise this is not
going to be equal to 5, right?

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.850
And in practice SMT solvers
don't just expand these

01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:36.290
into lots of Boolean formulas.

01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:37.950
They, again, use
this back and forth

01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:41.200
strategy between a SAT
solver and an engine

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.380
that is able to reason about
this theory of arrays in order

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.020
to do it.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.060
But what's important
is that by relying

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.680
on this theory of arrays,
using the same strategy we

01:14:51.680 --> 01:15:00.050
saw to generate formulas for
integers you can actually

01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:03.990
generate formulas
involving array logic,

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:08.720
and involving array updates,
involving array axises,

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:16.730
involving iteration over arrays
as long as you fix your path,

01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:21.000
these formulas are
very easy to generate.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.440
If you don't fix
your paths if you

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.450
want to generate a
formula that corresponds

01:15:24.450 --> 01:15:29.080
to going through all paths,
then it's also relatively easy.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.310
The Only thing is you
have to deal with loops

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:34.910
in more of a special way.

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:35.479
Yes?

01:15:35.479 --> 01:15:36.395
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:46.530
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA:
I don't know.

01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:48.870
So dictionaries and
maps are actually

01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:52.960
very easy to model using
uninterpreted functions.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.190
And, in fact, the
theory of arrays

01:15:55.190 --> 01:16:05.170
itself, it's just a special
case of uninterpreted functions.

01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:09.630
So more complicated
things can be done

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:11.460
with uninterpreted functions.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:16.820
In modern SMT solvers
there is native support

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.657
for reasoning about
sets and set operations,

01:16:20.657 --> 01:16:22.740
which can be very, very
useful if you're reasoning

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:28.390
about a program that involves
lots of set computations,

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:30.410
for example.

01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:33.750
When designing
one of these tools

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:36.320
the modeling step
is really important.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:41.040
And it's not just how you model
complicated program features

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.320
down to your theories.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.850
So, for example, things
like heaps down to arrays.

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:50.837
And also the choice of what
theories and the solver you

01:16:50.837 --> 01:16:51.630
use.

01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:56.470
And there's a large number
of theories and the solver

01:16:56.470 --> 01:17:02.260
with different trade offs
between how efficient they are

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:04.520
versus how expressive they are.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.870
And, in general, most
of the production tools

01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:13.370
stick to the theory
of bit-vectors

01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:16.550
and they might use
the theory of arrays

01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:21.820
to model the heap if
that is necessary.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:24.220
Generally production
tools try to shy away

01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:27.380
from some of the more
sophisticated theories,

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:31.560
like the theory of sets
just because by virtue

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:36.450
being richer they also tend to
be less scalable in some cases,

01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:39.620
unless you're dealing with a
program that really requires

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:44.920
exactly that kind of reasoning
in order to work with.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.841
Are there other questions?

01:17:47.841 --> 01:17:48.340
Yes?

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:50.834
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] research
in symbolic execution,

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:52.762
what are people
focusing on and where

01:17:52.762 --> 01:17:54.208
is there room for improvement?

01:17:54.208 --> 01:17:56.620
[INAUDIBLE] applications.

01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:00.040
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: So one
very active area of research

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.880
is around applications.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.080
And looking at models
that will allow

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.400
you to discover new
classes of bugs.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:15.200
So, for example, Nikolai,
and Franz, and Xi Wang and I

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.330
had a paper, what
was it, last year

01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:23.810
when we were looking at using
symbolic execution to identify

01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:28.770
coding your program that a
compiler might optimize away.

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:32.410
Security checks that might get
optimized away by a compiler.

01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:38.510
So it's very different from the
question of will the program go

01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:42.470
down this path or not, but
there is a modeling step

01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:45.300
to go from this high
level conceptual question

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:47.750
of, is there a
code in my program

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:54.780
that can be compiled away
to an algorithm based

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:56.673
on symbolic execution
that will rely

01:18:56.673 --> 01:18:58.530
on the ability of
symbolic execution

01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:01.290
to easily tell you whether
the program can go down

01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:04.930
a particular path, or whether
a particular path is feasible.

01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:08.380
So applications is a
big area, extending

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.080
to newer classes
of bugs, growing

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.500
to new and different
language features.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:19.740
For example, one of the
things that is still

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:22.840
fairly hard to model from
using symbolic execution

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:28.850
are very high level languages,
like JavaScript or Python where

01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:31.750
you have a lot of very
dynamic language features,

01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:37.910
but at the same time they
are-- if any technique can

01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:40.370
work for the symbolic execution,
it's definitely very good.

01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:44.640
And, in fact, we had some
work a couple of years

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.780
ago using symbolic
execution to reason

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:50.070
about errors in Python
programming assignments,

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:51.890
for example.

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:52.623
Yes?

01:19:52.623 --> 01:19:54.102
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:03.962 --> 01:20:04.948
How does [INAUDIBLE]?

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:09.370
ARMANDO SOLAR-LEZAMA: It is.

01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:13.990
So in the case of symbolic
execution part of the problem

01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:19.130
is that your symbolic state,
it's very hard to simply say,

01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:21.340
OK, I executed this
instruction, and then

01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:23.430
this instruction, and
then this instruction.

01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:24.720
The sequence is not there.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.180
There was some work a few
years ago looking, for example,

01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:31.970
at very small pieces of
code, but very critical,

01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:35.150
like a concurring data
structure in operating

01:20:35.150 --> 01:20:37.240
system, or lock-free
data structure

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:43.190
and modeling the
interactions between threads

01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:47.984
by essentially saying, every
time there is a variable that

01:20:47.984 --> 01:20:49.900
could have been overwritten
by something else,

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:54.000
you replace that value with
just a fresh symbolic value that

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.946
says, I have no
idea what this is.

01:20:55.946 --> 01:20:57.320
And you generate
constraints that

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.060
relate to those symbolic
values to symbolic values

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.520
in other threads.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.320
And this has been
used even to reason

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:08.840
about things like missing
memory fences, for example.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.565
And so it is possible, but the
complexity grows quite a bit.

01:21:13.565 --> 01:21:18.100
And it becomes the kind of thing
that you cannot no longer do

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.240
at the scale of Microsoft Word,
but you can do at the scale

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.087
of, say, a concurring data
structure, for example.

01:21:26.087 --> 01:21:28.670
There had been other work though
in the context of concurrency

01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:31.200
looking at, for example,
can I use symbolic execution

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.830
to reconstruct
interleavings based

01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:38.290
on knowledge of how the program
behaved as it was running,

01:21:38.290 --> 01:21:40.810
for example.

01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:46.020
And so this opens a
lot of possibilities,

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:49.220
having this capability to
ask very concrete questions

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:52.660
about can my program
run down this path.

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.440
Being able to have
symbolic values

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.600
and ask questions, what values
should these things have

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.200
in order for the program to
do something, or in order

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:03.215
something to happen is a
very powerful capability

01:22:03.215 --> 01:22:04.590
and there's a lot
of applications

01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:10.660
that have been tried, but
this is a fairly new piece

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.280
of technology as
far as technology

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.203
for analyzing a program goes.
