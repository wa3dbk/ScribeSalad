00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.142
PROFESSOR: All right,
guys, let's get started.

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:31.350
So today, we're going to
talk about network security.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.933
And in particular,
we're going to talk

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.550
about this paper on TCP/IP
security by this guy

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.027
Steve Bellovin, who used to be
at AT&amp;T and now is at Columbia.

00:00:40.027 --> 00:00:41.610
One interesting thing
about this paper

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.276
is it's actually a
relatively old paper.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:44.584
It's more than 10 years old.

00:00:44.584 --> 00:00:46.209
And in fact, it's
commentary on a paper

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:48.520
that was 10 years before that.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.840
And many of you guys actually
ask, why are we reading this

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.500
if many of these problems have
been solved in today's TCP

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.980
protocol stacks?

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.429
So one interesting
point-- so it's

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.220
true that some of these
problems that Steve

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.061
describes in this paper
have been solved since then.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.019
Some of them are still
actually problems today.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.145
We'll sort of look at that
and see what's going on.

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:09.925
But you might actually
wonder, why didn't people

00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:11.970
solve all these problems
in the first place

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.730
when they were designing TCP?

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.480
What were they thinking?

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.507
And it's actually not clear.

00:01:17.507 --> 00:01:18.590
So what do you guys think?

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.440
Why wasn't TCP designed
to be secure with all

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.916
these considerations up front?

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.596
Yeah, any guesses?

00:01:26.596 --> 00:01:27.760
All right, anyone else?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.260
Yeah.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.052
AUDIENCE: The internet was
a much more trusting place

00:01:30.052 --> 00:01:30.500
back then.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.250
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this
was almost literally

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.515
a quote from this guy's paper.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:36.445
Yeah, at the time-- the whole
internet set of protocols

00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:39.700
was designed I guess
about 40 years ago now.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.366
The requirements were
totally different.

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:44.450
It was to connect a bunch
of relatively trusting sites

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.070
that all knew each
other by name.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.510
And I think this is often
the case in any system that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.420
becomes successful.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.600
The requirements change.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.864
So it used to be that
this was a protocol

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.030
for a small number of sites.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.530
Now it's the entire world.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.990
And you don't know
all the people

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.175
connected to the
internet by name anymore.

00:02:00.175 --> 00:02:01.633
You can't call them
up on the phone

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:03.470
if they do something
bad, et cetera.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.650
So I think this is a story
for many of the protocols

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.170
we look at.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.520
And many of you guys have
questions, like, what the hell

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.561
were these guys thinking?

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:10.312
This is so broken.

00:02:10.312 --> 00:02:12.811
But in fact, they were designing
a totally different system.

00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:13.660
It got adopted.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.243
Same for the web,
like we were looking

00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:17.060
at in the last couple of weeks.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.950
It was designed for a
very different goal.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.944
And it expanded.

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:21.610
And you sort of have
these growing pains

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.760
you have to figure out how
to make the protocol adapt

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.750
to new requirements.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.370
And another thing that
somewhat suddenly happened

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.370
is I think people
also in the process

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.814
gained a much
greater appreciation

00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:34.230
for the kinds of
problems you have

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.970
to worry about in security.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.520
And it used to be the case
that you didn't really

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.960
understand all the
things that you

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.870
should worry about an
attacker doing to your system.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.520
And I think it's
partly for this reason

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.400
that it's sort of
interesting to look

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.960
at what happened to TCP
security, what went wrong,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.639
how could we fix it, et
cetera, to both figure out

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.180
what kinds of problems you might
want to avoid when designing

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.980
your own protocols,
and also what's

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.765
the right mindset for thinking
about these kinds of attacks.

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:02.410
How do you figure out
what an attacker might

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.840
be able to do in
your own protocol

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.290
when you're designing it so
you can avoid similar pitfalls?

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.152
All right, so with
that preamble aside,

00:03:10.152 --> 00:03:12.610
let's actually start talking
about what the paper is about.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.770
So how should we think
about security in a network?

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.620
So I guess we could try to
start from first principles

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.350
and try to figure out,
what is our threat model?

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.220
So what do we think
the attacker is

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.210
going to be able to
do in our network?

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.980
Well, relatively
straightforwardly,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.340
there's presumably being
able to intercept packets,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.110
and probably being
able to modify them.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.960
So if you send a packet
over the network,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.800
it might be prudent to assume
that some bad guy out there is

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.540
going to see your packet and
might be able to change it

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.980
before it reaches
the destination,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.440
might be able to drop
it, and in fact might

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.740
be able to inject
packets of their own

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.170
that you never sent
with arbitrary contents.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.605
And probably-- so
this you can sort of

00:04:02.605 --> 00:04:04.480
come up with fairly
straightforwardly by just

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.010
thinking, well, if you
don't trust the network,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.490
some bad guy is going to
send arbitrary packets,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.470
see yours, modify
them, et cetera.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.240
Somewhat more worryingly,
as this paper talks about,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.720
the bad guy can also
participate in your protocols.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.178
They have their
own machine, right?

00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:22.490
So the attacker has
their own computer

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.990
that they have
full control over.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.450
So even if all the
computers that you trust

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.187
are reasonably maintained,
they all behave correctly,

00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:34.020
the bad guy has his own
computer that he can

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.700
make it do whatever he wants.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.840
And in fact, he can
participate in a protocol

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.743
or distribute a system.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.000
So if you have a
routing protocol, which

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.835
involves many people talking
to each other, at some scale,

00:04:49.835 --> 00:04:51.710
it's probably going to
be impractical to keep

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.484
the bad guys out.

00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:54.900
If you're running a routing
protocol with 10 participants,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.170
then maybe you can just call
all them up and say, well, yeah,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.380
yeah, I know all you guys.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.720
But at the scale of the
internet today, it's

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.300
unfeasible to have sort of
direct knowledge of what

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.236
everyone else or who everyone
else in this protocol is.

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:08.610
So probably some
bad guy is going

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.160
to be participating in your
protocols or distributed

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.660
systems.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.868
And it's important to design
distributed systems that

00:05:13.868 --> 00:05:17.955
can nonetheless do something
reasonable with that.

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:19.580
All right, so what
are the implications

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.280
of all these things?

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.680
I guess we'll go down the list.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.570
So intercepting is-- it's on
the whole easy to understand.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.170
Well, you shouldn't
send any important data

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.380
over the network if you expect
a bad guy to intercept them,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.680
or at least not in clear text.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.480
Maybe you should
encrypt your data.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.785
So that seems relatively
straightforward to sort

00:05:37.785 --> 00:05:38.565
of figure out.

00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:41.106
Although still you should sort
of keep it in mind, of course,

00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:43.070
when designing protocols.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.770
Now, injecting packets
turns out to lead

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.380
to a much wider range
of interesting problems

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.970
that this paper talks about.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.160
And in particular,
attackers can inject

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.860
packets that can pretend to
be from any other sender.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.295
Because the way this works in
IP is that the IP packet itself

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.420
has a header that contains
the source of the packet

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.080
and the destination.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.830
And it's up to whoever
creates the packet

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.750
to fill in the right values
for the source and destination.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.100
And no one checks that
the source is necessarily

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.100
the correct.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.050
There's some filtering
going on these days.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.430
But it's sort of fairly spotty,
and it's hard to rely on.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.115
So to a first
approximation, an attacker

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:25.340
could fill in any IP
address as the source,

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.180
and it will get to the
destination correctly.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.070
And it's interesting
to try to figure out

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.540
what could an attacker do with
such a capability of sending

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.670
arbitrary packets.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.771
Now, in the several
weeks up to this,

00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:43.520
like in buffer overflows
and web security,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.110
we looked at, to a large extent,
implementation bugs, like,

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.440
how could you exploit
a buffer overflow?

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.420
And interestingly, the
author of this paper

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.010
is actually not at all
interested in implementation

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.510
bugs.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.770
He's really interested in
protocol errors or protocol

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.562
mistakes.

00:06:57.562 --> 00:06:58.520
So what's the big deal?

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.580
Why is he down on
implementation bugs,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.705
even though we spent several
weeks looking at them?

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:03.510
Why does it matter?

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.010
Yeah.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.828
AUDIENCE: Because we have to
keep those bugs [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:09.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this is the
really big bummer about a bug

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.550
in your protocol design.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.589
Because it's hard to change.

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:15.130
So if you have an
implementation bug,

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.350
well, you had a
memcpy or a print-out

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.254
out of some sort that
didn't check the range.

00:07:19.254 --> 00:07:21.420
OK, well, you had a range
check, and it still works,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.461
and now it's also secure.

00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:23.510
So that's great.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.995
But if you have some bug in
the protocol specification,

00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:29.140
in how the protocol has
to work, then fixing a bug

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.190
is going to require
fixing a protocol, which

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.820
means potentially affecting
all the systems that

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.460
are out there speaking
this protocol.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.340
So if we find some
problem in TCP,

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.910
it's potentially
quite devastating.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.229
Because every machine that uses
TCP is going to have to change.

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.770
Because it's going
to be hard to make

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.790
it potentially
backwards compatible.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.530
We'll see exactly
what these bugs are.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.640
But this is the real reason
he's so excited about looking

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.460
at protocol bugs.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.555
Because they're fairly
fundamental to the TCP protocol

00:07:56.555 --> 00:07:58.982
that everyone agrees to speak.

00:07:58.982 --> 00:08:00.440
So let's look at
one of these guys.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.950
So the first example
he points out

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.140
has to do with how TCP
sequence numbers work.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.169
So just to re-explain--
yeah, question.

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:14.294
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious.

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:15.502
This is a tiny bit off topic.

00:08:15.502 --> 00:08:17.606
But let's say you do
find a bug in TCP.

00:08:17.606 --> 00:08:19.976
How do you make
the change to it?

00:08:19.976 --> 00:08:21.398
How do you tell
all the computers

00:08:21.398 --> 00:08:23.736
in the world to change that?

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.610
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
it's a huge problem.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.900
What if you find a bug in TCP?

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.280
Well, it's unclear what to do.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.530
And I think the authors here
struggle a lot with that.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.165
And in many ways, if
you could redesign TCP,

00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:37.539
many of these bugs
are relatively

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:41.620
easy to fix if you knew what
to look for ahead of time.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.410
But because TCP is
sort of relatively hard

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.350
to fix or change,
what ends up happening

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.457
is that people or
designers try to look

00:08:54.457 --> 00:08:58.135
for backwards compatible
tweaks that either allow

00:08:58.135 --> 00:09:01.170
old implementations to coexist
with the new implementation

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.970
or to add some optional field
that if it's there, then

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.590
the communication is
more secure in some way.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.370
But it is a big problem.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.030
If it's some security issue
that's deeply ingrained in TCP,

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.750
then it's going to be a pretty
humongous issue for everyone

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:23.930
to just pack up and move onto a
TCP version whatever, n plus 1.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.296
And you can look at IPv6 as one
example of this not happening.

00:09:27.296 --> 00:09:29.170
We've known this problem
was going to come up

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.025
for like 15 years or 20 years.

00:09:31.025 --> 00:09:34.759
IPv6 has been around for
well over 10 years now.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:37.300
And it's just hard to convince
people to move away from IPv4.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.060
It's good enough.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.040
It sort of works.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.465
It's a lot of
overhead to move over.

00:09:41.465 --> 00:09:43.019
And no one else is
speaking IPv6, so

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:45.060
why should I start speaking
this bizarre protocol

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.220
that no one else is
going to speak to me in?

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.520
So it's sort of moving along.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.895
But I think it
takes a long time.

00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:53.290
And there's going to be really
some motivation to migrate.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.940
And backwards
compatibility helps a lot.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.700
Not good enough for,
I guess, IPv6-- IPv6

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.205
has lots of backwards
compatibility plans in it.

00:10:01.205 --> 00:10:04.720
You can talk to an
IPv4 host from IPv6.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.770
So they try to engineer
all this support.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.840
But still, it's hard to
convince people to upgrade.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.194
All right, but yeah, looking
back at the TCP sequence

00:10:15.194 --> 00:10:17.610
numbers, we're going to look
at actually two problems that

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.990
have to do with how the
TCP handshake works.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.260
So let's just spend a little
bit of time working out

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.060
what are the details of how a
TCP connection gets initially

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.510
established.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.650
So there's actually
three packets

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.900
that have to get sent in
order for a new TCP connection

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.690
to be established.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.960
So our client generates a
packet to connect to a server.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.140
And it says, well, here's
my IP address, C, client.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.940
I'm sending this to the server.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.534
And there's various fields.

00:10:44.534 --> 00:10:46.575
But the ones that are
interesting for the purpose

00:10:46.575 --> 00:10:49.590
of this discussion is going
to be a sequence number.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.610
So there's going to
be a syn flag saying,

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:54.350
I want to synchronize state
and establish a new connection.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.480
And you include a
client sequence number

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.680
in the initial syn packet.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.370
Then when the server
receives this,

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.167
the server is going
to look and say,

00:11:04.167 --> 00:11:05.750
well, a client wants
to connect to me,

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.459
so I'll send a packet
back to whatever

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.000
this address is,
whoever said they're

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.060
trying to connect to me.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.740
So it'll send a packet from
the server to the client

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.170
and include its own
synchronization number, SN

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.080
server.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.910
And it'll acknowledge
the client's number.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.040
And finally, the
client replies back,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.260
acknowledging the
server synchronization

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:37.070
number-- acknowledge SNS.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.110
And now the client can
actually start sending data.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.290
So in order to send
data, the client

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:46.770
has to include some
data in the packet,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.780
and also put in the sequence
number of the client

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.275
to indicate that
this is actually

00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:55.858
sort of legitimate client data
at the start of the connection.

00:11:55.858 --> 00:11:57.650
It's not some data
from later on,

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.168
for example, that just
happens to arrive now

00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:02.542
because the server missed some
initial parts of the data.

00:12:02.542 --> 00:12:04.735
So generally, all
these sequence numbers

00:12:04.735 --> 00:12:08.240
were meant for ensuring in
order delivery of packets.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.225
So if the client sends
two packets, the one that

00:12:11.225 --> 00:12:14.370
has the initial sequence number,
that's the first chunk of data.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.078
And the one with the
next sequence number

00:12:16.078 --> 00:12:17.410
is the next chunk of data.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.790
But it turns out to also
be useful for providing

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.424
some security properties.

00:12:22.424 --> 00:12:24.465
Here's an example of these
requirements changing.

00:12:24.465 --> 00:12:25.840
So initially, no
one was thinking

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.465
TCP provides any
security properties.

00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:29.940
But then applications
started using TCP and sort

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.470
of relying on these
TCP connections

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.800
not being able to be broken
by some arbitrary attacker,

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.150
or an attacker not being able to
inject data into your existing

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.360
TCP connection.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.060
And all of a sudden, this
mechanism that was initially

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.240
meant for just
packet ordering now

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.160
gets used to guarantee
some semblance of security

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.110
for these connections.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:59.810
So in this case, I
guess the problem

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.710
stems from what could a
server assume about this TCP

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.520
connection.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.180
So typically, the server
assumes-- implicitly,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.480
you might imagine-- that this
connection is established

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.195
with the right client at
this IP address C. It seems

00:13:17.195 --> 00:13:18.650
like a natural thing to assume.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.990
Is there any basis for
making this assumption?

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.780
If a server gets this
message saying, here's

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.500
some data on this connection
from a client to a server,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.950
and it has sequence number
C, why might the server

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.759
conclude that this was actually
the real client sending this?

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:38.050
AUDIENCE: Because the sequence
number is hard to guess.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.940
PROFESSOR: Right, so that's sort
of the implicit thing going on,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.640
that it has to have the
right sequence number C here.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.430
And in order for this
connection to get established,

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.870
the client must have
acknowledged the server

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.570
sequence number S here.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.520
And the server sequence number
S was only sent by the server

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.386
to the intended
client IP address.

00:13:59.386 --> 00:13:59.886
Yeah.

00:13:59.886 --> 00:14:01.362
AUDIENCE: How many bits are
available for the sequence

00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:01.862
number?

00:14:01.862 --> 00:14:05.831
PROFESSOR: So sequence numbers
in TCP are 32 bits long.

00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:10.359
That's not entirely
easy to guess.

00:14:10.359 --> 00:14:12.025
If it was really a
random 32 bit number,

00:14:12.025 --> 00:14:14.040
it would be hard to just guess.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.699
And you'd probably
waste a lot of bandwidth

00:14:16.699 --> 00:14:17.637
trying to guess this.

00:14:17.637 --> 00:14:19.044
Yeah, question.

00:14:19.044 --> 00:14:20.607
AUDIENCE: The data
frequency number

00:14:20.607 --> 00:14:23.150
is higher than the
initial sequence number?

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so basically,
these things get incremented.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.500
So every time you
send a syn, that

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.660
counts as one byte against
your sequence number.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.010
So this is SNC.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.670
I think actually what happens
is this is SNC plus 1.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.140
And then it goes on from there.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.117
So if you send 5 bytes, then the
next one is SNC initial plus 6.

00:14:40.117 --> 00:14:42.200
So this just counts the
bytes that you're sending.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.920
SYNs count as 1 byte each.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.720
Make sense?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.050
Other questions about this?

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:54.650
All right, so typically,
or at least the way

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.370
the TCP specification
recommended

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.550
that people choose
these sequence numbers,

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.750
was to increment them at
some roughly fixed rate.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.300
So the initial RFCs suggested
that you increment these things

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:12.350
at something like 250,000
units, plus 250,000, per second.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.920
And the reason that it
wasn't entirely random

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.060
is that these sequence
numbers are actually

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.690
used to prevent out of
order packets, or packets

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.534
from previous connections,
from interfering

00:15:22.534 --> 00:15:23.917
with new connections.

00:15:23.917 --> 00:15:26.870
So if every time you
established a new connection

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.740
you chose a completely
random sequence number,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.590
then there's some chance if you
establish lots of connections

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.510
over and over that some packet
from a previous connection

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.290
is going to have a
similar enough sequence

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.790
number to your new
connection and is

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.490
going to be accepted as
a valid piece of data

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.602
on that new connection.

00:15:42.602 --> 00:15:45.000
So this is something that the
TCP designers worried a lot

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.916
about-- these out of order
packets or delayed packets.

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:51.290
So as a result, they really
wanted these sequence numbers

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.210
to progress in a roughly
monotonic matter over time,

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.900
even across connections.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.580
If I opened one
connection, it might

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.060
have the same source and
destination, port numbers,

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.610
IP addresses, et cetera.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.920
But because I established
this connection now instead

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.640
of earlier, packets
from earlier hopefully

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.030
aren't going to match up
with the sequence numbers

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.310
I have for my new connection.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.280
So this was a mechanism
to prevent confusion

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.431
across repeated
connection establishments.

00:16:18.431 --> 00:16:18.930
Yeah.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.983
AUDIENCE: So if you don't know
exactly how much your other

00:16:22.983 --> 00:16:25.566
grid that you're talking to is
going to improve the sequencing

00:16:25.566 --> 00:16:26.845
pack, how do you know that
the packet you're getting is

00:16:26.845 --> 00:16:29.120
the next packet if there wasn't
[INAUDIBLE] immediate packet

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.530
that you--

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.870
PROFESSOR: So typically you'll
remember the last packet

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.260
that you received.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.680
And if the next sequence
number is exactly that,

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.267
then this is the next
packet in sequence.

00:16:38.267 --> 00:16:39.850
So for example, here,
the server knows

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.937
that I've seen exactly
SNC plus 1 worth of data.

00:16:43.937 --> 00:16:46.020
If the next packet has
sequence number SNC plus 1,

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.618
that's the next one.

00:16:47.618 --> 00:16:49.117
AUDIENCE: So you're
saying that when

00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:51.790
you establish a sequence number,
then even after that you're

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.762
committing it--

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.428
PROFESSOR: Well,
absolutely, yeah, yeah.

00:16:54.428 --> 00:16:56.611
So these sequence
numbers, initially when

00:16:56.611 --> 00:16:58.986
you establish it, they get
picked according to some plan.

00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:00.135
We'll talk about that plan.

00:17:00.135 --> 00:17:01.940
You can sort of think
they might be random.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.310
But over time, they have to have
some flow for initial sequence

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.034
numbers for connection.

00:17:07.034 --> 00:17:09.575
But within a connection, once
they're established, that's it.

00:17:09.575 --> 00:17:10.280
They're fixed.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.890
And they just tick
along as the data

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.630
gets sent on the
connection, exactly.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.270
Make sense?

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.619
All right, so there
were some plans

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.020
suggested for how to manage
these sequence numbers.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.650
And it was actually
a reasonable plan

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.970
for avoiding duplicate packets
in the network causing trouble.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.730
But the problem, of
course, showed up

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:37.511
that attackers were able to
sort of guess these sequence

00:17:37.511 --> 00:17:38.010
numbers.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:42.090
Because there wasn't a lot
of randomness being chosen.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.750
So the way that the host machine
would choose these sequence

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.290
numbers is they have just a
running counter in memory.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.080
Every second they
bump it by 250,000.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.790
And every time a
new connection comes

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.530
in, they also bump it by some
constant like 64k or 128k.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.930
I forget the exact number.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.180
So this was relatively easy
to guess, as you can tell.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.030
You send them their
connection request,

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.116
and you see what sequence
number comes back.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.741
And then you know
the next one is going

00:18:05.741 --> 00:18:07.950
to be 64k higher than that.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.352
So there wasn't a huge amount
of randomness in this protocol.

00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:14.310
So we can just sketch
out what this looks like.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.190
So if I'm an attacker that
wants to connect to a server

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.690
but pretend to be from
a particular IP address,

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.920
then what I might do is send
a request to the server,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.490
very much like the
first step there,

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.470
include some initial sequence
number that I choose.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:31.995
At this point, any
sequence number

00:18:31.995 --> 00:18:33.660
is just as good, because
the server shouldn't

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.970
have any assumptions about
what the client's sequence

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.042
number is.

00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:38.250
Now, what does the server do?

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.760
The server gets the
same packet as before.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.550
So it performs the
same way as before.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:47.500
It sends a packet back to
the client with some server

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:53.000
sequence number and
acknowledges SNC.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.800
And now the attacker,
if the attacker

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.620
wants to establish a connection,
needs to somehow synthesize

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.540
a packet that looks exactly like
the third packet over there.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.779
So it needs to send a packet
from the client to the server.

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:05.570
That's easy enough.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.403
You just fill in these
values in the header.

00:19:07.403 --> 00:19:12.820
But you have to acknowledge
this server sequence number SNS.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.090
And this is where sort
of the problems start.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.950
If the SNS value is
relatively easy to guess,

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.050
then the attacker is good to go.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.910
And now the server
thinks they have

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:26.400
an established connection with
a client coming from this IP

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.990
address.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.920
And now an attacker could
inject data into this connection

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.174
just as before.

00:19:33.174 --> 00:19:34.590
They just synthesize
a packet that

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.680
looks like this,
has the data, and it

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.030
has the client sequence number
that in fact the adversary

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:41.540
chose.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.870
Maybe it's plus 1 here.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.170
But it all hinges on being able
to guess this particular server

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.400
supplied sequence number.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.820
All right, does this make sense?

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.320
Yeah.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.280
AUDIENCE: What's the reason
that the server sequence

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.374
number isn't completely random?

00:19:56.374 --> 00:19:57.790
PROFESSOR: So
there's two reasons.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.940
One, as I was
describing earlier,

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.330
the server wants to
make sure that packets

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.720
from different
connections over time

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.315
don't get confused
for one another.

00:20:09.315 --> 00:20:12.280
So if you establish a
connection from one source port

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.864
to another destination port, and
then you close the connection

00:20:14.864 --> 00:20:17.363
and establish another one of
the same source and destination

00:20:17.363 --> 00:20:20.000
port, you want to make sure
the packets from one connection

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.121
don't appear to be valid
in another connection.

00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:26.109
AUDIENCE: So the
server sequence number

00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:28.525
is incremented for every
one of their packets?

00:20:28.525 --> 00:20:33.397
PROFESSOR: Well, so the sequence
numbers within a connection,

00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:35.550
as I was describing, get
bumped with all the data

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.217
in a connection.

00:20:36.217 --> 00:20:37.591
But there's also
the question of,

00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:39.820
how do you choose the
initial sequence number here?

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.530
And that gets bumped every
time a new connection is

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.440
established.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.190
So the hope is that by the time
it wraps around 2 to the 32

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.600
and comes back, there's
been enough time

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.270
so that old packets
in the network

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.283
have actually been
dropped and will not

00:20:54.283 --> 00:20:56.006
appear as duplicates anymore.

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.630
So that's the reason
why you don't just

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.920
choose random points,
or they didn't initially

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.374
choose random points.

00:21:01.374 --> 00:21:01.874
Yeah.

00:21:01.874 --> 00:21:04.309
AUDIENCE: So this is a
problem between connections,

00:21:04.309 --> 00:21:06.910
for a connection between the
same guide, the same client,

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.410
the same server, the same source
port, the same destination.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.012
And we're worried
about old packets--

00:21:11.012 --> 00:21:13.565
PROFESSOR: So this is what the
original, yeah, TCP designers

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:14.810
were worried about,
which is why they

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.696
prescribed this way of picking
these initial sequence numbers.

00:21:16.696 --> 00:21:18.094
AUDIENCE: If you have
different new connections,

00:21:18.094 --> 00:21:19.135
you could differentiate.

00:21:19.135 --> 00:21:19.900
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.375
AUDIENCE: So then I don't see
why the incrementing stuff

00:21:22.375 --> 00:21:24.355
and not just take randomly.

00:21:24.355 --> 00:21:26.850
PROFESSOR: So I think the
reason they don't pick randomly

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.100
is that if you did pick
randomly, and you established,

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.320
I don't know, 1,000 connections
within a short amount

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.040
of time from the same source
to the same destination,

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.780
then, well, every one of them
is some random value of module 2

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.990
to the 32.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.920
And now there's a
nontrivial chance

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.420
that some packet
from one connection

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.600
will be delayed in the network,
and eventually show up again,

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.760
and will get confused for a
packet from another connection.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.840
This is just sort of
nothing to do with security.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.465
This is just their
design consideration

00:21:52.465 --> 00:21:55.290
initially for reliable delivery.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] some other
client to the server, right?

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.595
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:21:59.595 --> 00:22:01.830
AUDIENCE: This is [INAUDIBLE]
some other client?

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.080
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.830
So we haven't actually said
why this is interesting at all

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.190
for the attacker to do.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.880
Why bother?

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.055
You could just go from
his old IP address, right?

00:22:09.055 --> 00:22:12.855
AUDIENCE: So what happens
for the server [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:17.346 --> 00:22:19.720
PROFESSOR: Yes, this is actually
an interesting question.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.440
What happens here?

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.106
So this packet doesn't
just get dropped.

00:22:22.106 --> 00:22:24.430
It actually goes
to this computer.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.426
And what happens?

00:22:26.426 --> 00:22:28.926
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], they
just mentioned you try and do it

00:22:28.926 --> 00:22:31.116
like they would
try and do it when

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:34.019
the other computer was
updating or rebooting or off,

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:34.560
or something.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.682
PROFESSOR: Right,
certainly they felt, oh,

00:22:35.682 --> 00:22:36.192
that computer is offline.

00:22:36.192 --> 00:22:37.670
The packet will
just get dropped,

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.720
and you don't have to
worry about it too much.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.010
If a computer is actually
listening on that IP address,

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.065
then in the TCP
protocol, you're supposed

00:22:45.065 --> 00:22:47.790
to send a reset packet
resetting the connection.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.630
Because this is not a connection
that computer C knows about.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.730
And in TCP, this is presumed
to be because, oh, this

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.640
is some old packet that
I requested long ago,

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.320
but I've since
forgotten about it.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.850
So the machine C here might send
a packet to the server saying,

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.710
I want a reset.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.503
I actually forget exactly which
sequence number goes in there.

00:23:10.503 --> 00:23:13.582
But the client C here knows
all the sequence numbers

00:23:13.582 --> 00:23:15.290
and send any sequence
number as necessary

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.580
and reset this connection.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.229
So if this computer C
is going to do this,

00:23:20.229 --> 00:23:21.812
then it might interfere
with your plan

00:23:21.812 --> 00:23:22.948
to establish a connection.

00:23:22.948 --> 00:23:24.406
Because when S gets
this packet, it

00:23:24.406 --> 00:23:25.993
says, oh, sure, if
you don't want it,

00:23:25.993 --> 00:23:27.840
I'll reset your connection.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.610
There's some
implementation-ish bugs

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.075
that you might exploit, or at
least the author talks about,

00:23:34.075 --> 00:23:38.215
and an potentially
exploiting, that would prevent

00:23:38.215 --> 00:23:39.990
client C from responding.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.758
So for example, if you flood
C with lots of packets,

00:23:42.758 --> 00:23:44.633
it's an easy way to get
him to drop this one.

00:23:44.633 --> 00:23:46.924
It turns out there are other
more interesting bugs that

00:23:46.924 --> 00:23:49.520
don't require flooding C with
lots of packets that still get

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.200
C to drop this
packet, or at least it

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.436
used to on some
implementations on TCP stacks.

00:23:53.436 --> 00:23:53.936
Yeah.

00:23:53.936 --> 00:23:55.436
AUDIENCE: Presumably,
most firewalls

00:23:55.436 --> 00:23:57.888
would also [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:57.888 --> 00:23:59.370
PROFESSOR: This one?

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.852
AUDIENCE: No, the SYN.

00:24:00.852 --> 00:24:01.840
PROFESSOR: This one.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.828
AUDIENCE: That
came into a client,

00:24:02.828 --> 00:24:05.203
and a client didn't originally
send a SYN to that server.

00:24:05.203 --> 00:24:07.188
And the firewall is
going to drop it.

00:24:07.188 --> 00:24:08.980
PROFESSOR: It depends, yeah.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.590
So certainly if you have a very
sophisticated stateful firewall

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.150
that keeps track of all existing
connections, or for example

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.110
if you have a NAT,
then this might happen.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.640
On the other hand, a NAT
might actually send the RST

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.810
on behalf of the client.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:23.720
So it's not clear.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.450
I think this is not as common.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.730
So for example, on
a Comcast network,

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.500
I certainly don't have anyone
intercepting these packets

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.916
and maintaining state for me
and sending RSTs on my behalf

00:24:34.916 --> 00:24:35.750
or anything like that.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.250
Yeah.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.250
AUDIENCE: So why
can't the server

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.206
have independent
sequence numbers

00:24:40.206 --> 00:24:42.380
for each possible source?

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.260
PROFESSOR: Right, so this is in
fact what TCP stacks do today.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.910
This is one example of how you
fix this problem in a backwards

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:50.660
compatible manner.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.285
So we'll get to
exactly the formulation

00:24:52.285 --> 00:24:53.330
of how you arrange this.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.910
But yeah, it turns out that
if you look at this carefully,

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.630
as you're doing, you don't need
to have this initial sequence

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.950
number be global.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.626
You just scope it to every
source/destination pair.

00:25:04.626 --> 00:25:06.500
And then you have all
the duplicate avoidance

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.560
properties we had before, and
you have some security as well.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.590
So just to sort
of write this out

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.550
on the board of how
the attacker is getting

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.425
this initial sequence number,
the attacker would probably

00:25:21.425 --> 00:25:23.770
just send a connection
from its own IP address

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.400
to the server saying, I want
to establish a new connection,

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.506
and the server would
send a response

00:25:30.506 --> 00:25:33.920
back to the attacker containing
its own sequence number S.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.590
And if the SNS for
this connection

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.492
and the SNS for this
connection are related,

00:25:39.492 --> 00:25:40.450
then this is a problem.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.540
But you're saying, let's
make them not related.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.310
Because this is from
a different address.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.960
Then this is not
a problem anymore.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.630
You can't guess what
this SNS is going

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:52.298
to be based on this SNS
for a different connection.

00:25:52.298 --> 00:25:52.798
Yeah.

00:25:52.798 --> 00:25:54.797
AUDIENCE: So you still
have a collision problem,

00:25:54.797 --> 00:25:56.533
because you could
engage the 32 bits

00:25:56.533 --> 00:25:58.774
by the addresses of your peers.

00:25:58.774 --> 00:26:01.264
So you have a lot of ports
for each one of these.

00:26:01.264 --> 00:26:04.252
So you still have
conflicting sequence numbers

00:26:04.252 --> 00:26:06.660
for all of these connections
that you're getting, right?

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.160
PROFESSOR: So these
sequence numbers

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.156
are specific, as it
turns out, to an IP

00:26:11.156 --> 00:26:14.530
address and a port number
source/destination duple.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.360
So if it's different
ports, then they

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.372
don't interfere with
each other at all.

00:26:17.372 --> 00:26:19.130
AUDIENCE: Oh, because
you're using the port--

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.205
PROFESSOR: That's right,
yeah, you also use

00:26:20.205 --> 00:26:21.504
the port in this as well.

00:26:21.504 --> 00:26:22.746
AUDIENCE: Because I
thought those ports--

00:26:22.746 --> 00:26:25.246
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so the ports
are sort of below the sequence

00:26:25.246 --> 00:26:27.987
numbers in some way
of thinking about it.

00:26:27.987 --> 00:26:28.486
Question?

00:26:28.486 --> 00:26:31.060
AUDIENCE: If the sequence
numbers are global,

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.910
then doesn't the
attacker [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:36.774 --> 00:26:37.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah, good point.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.780
So in fact, if the server
increments the sequence number

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.180
by, I don't know,
64k I think it is,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.885
or it was, for every connection,
then, well, you connect.

00:26:46.885 --> 00:26:49.090
And then maybe five
other people connect.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.120
And then you have
to do this attack.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.790
So to some extent, you're right,
this is a little troublesome.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.420
On the other hand,
you could probably

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:01.860
arrange it for your packet
here to be delivered just

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.740
before this packet.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.870
So if you send these
guys back to back,

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.200
then there's a good chance
they'll arrive at the server

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:08.920
back to back.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.710
The server will get
this one, respond

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.180
with this sequence number.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.580
It'll get the next
one, this one,

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.754
respond with the sequence
number right afterwards.

00:27:16.754 --> 00:27:19.170
And then you know exactly what
to put in this third packet

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.450
in your sequence.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.620
So I think this is
not a foolproof method

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.790
of connecting to a server.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.260
There's some guessing involved.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.720
But if you carefully
arrange your packets right,

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.230
then it's quite easy to
make the right guess.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.720
Or maybe you try several
times, and you'll get lucky.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.480
Yeah.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.246
AUDIENCE: So even if
it's totally random,

00:27:38.246 --> 00:27:39.912
and you have to guess
it, there are only

00:27:39.912 --> 00:27:40.998
like 4 billion possibilities.

00:27:40.998 --> 00:27:42.248
It's not a huge number, right?

00:27:42.248 --> 00:27:44.372
I feel like in the
course of a year,

00:27:44.372 --> 00:27:46.300
you should be able to
probably get through.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.660
PROFESSOR: Right, yeah, so
you're absolutely right.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:53.500
You shouldn't really be relying
on TCP to provide security

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.817
very strongly.

00:27:54.817 --> 00:27:56.900
Because you're right, it's
only 4 billion guesses.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.370
And you can probably
send that many packets

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.780
certainly within a day if you
have a fast enough connection.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.562
So it's sort of an
interesting argument

00:28:07.562 --> 00:28:09.645
we're having here in the
sense that at some level,

00:28:09.645 --> 00:28:11.120
TCP is hopefully insecure.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.270
Because it's only 32 bits.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.090
There's no way we
could make it secure.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:15.631
But I think many
applications rely on

00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:18.740
it enough that not providing
any security at all

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.368
is so much of a nuisance that
it really becomes a problem.

00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:24.060
But you're absolutely right.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.790
In practice, you do want to
do some sort of encryption

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.350
on top of this that
will provide stronger

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.610
guarantees that no one
tampered with your data,

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.710
but where the keys are
more than 32 bits long.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.242
It still turns out to be
useful to prevent people

00:28:41.242 --> 00:28:45.812
from tampering with TCP
connections in most cases.

00:28:45.812 --> 00:28:48.140
All right, other questions?

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.435
All right, so let's see
what actually goes wrong.

00:28:50.435 --> 00:28:53.360
Why is it a bad
thing if people are

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.990
able to spoof TCP connections
from arbitrary addresses?

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.335
So one reason why this
is bad is if there

00:29:00.335 --> 00:29:03.460
is any kind of
IP-based authorization.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.600
So if some server decides
whether an operation is going

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.170
to be allowed or not based on
the IP address it comes from,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.000
then this is
potentially going to be

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.950
a problem for an attacker
who spoofed connections

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.440
from an arbitrary
source address.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.040
So one example where
this was a problem--

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.350
and it largely
isn't anymore-- is

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:30.910
this family of r commands,
things like rlogin.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.160
So it used to be the case
that you could run something

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.984
like rlogin into a
machine, let's say

00:29:34.984 --> 00:29:35.900
athena.dialup.mit.edu.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.600
And if your connection was
coming from a host at MIT,

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.000
then this rlogin command would
succeed if you say, oh yeah,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.174
I'm user Alice on this machine.

00:29:51.174 --> 00:29:53.340
Let me log in as user Alice
onto this other machine.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.548
And it'll just trust that
all the machines at mit.edu

00:29:55.548 --> 00:29:58.410
are trustworthy to
make these statements.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.700
I should say I think
dial-up never actually

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.500
had this problem.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.416
It was using Cerberus
from the very beginning.

00:30:03.416 --> 00:30:07.360
But other systems certainly
did have such problems.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.610
And this is an example of
using the IP address where

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:15.170
the connection is coming from
some sort of authentication

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.190
mechanism for whether
the caller or the client

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.470
is trustworthy or not.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.650
So this certainly
used to be a problem,

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:23.730
isn't a problem anymore.

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:27.120
So relying on IP seems like
such a clearly bad plan.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.980
Yet, this actually
is still the case.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.160
So rlogin is gone.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.574
It was recently replaced
by SSH now, which is good.

00:30:33.574 --> 00:30:34.990
On the other hand,
there are still

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:38.470
many other examples
of protocols that rely

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.530
on IP-based authentication.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:41.890
One of them is SMTP.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.555
So when you send email, you
use SMTP to talk to some mail

00:30:45.555 --> 00:30:47.650
server to send a message.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.120
And to prevent spam,
many SMTP servers

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.470
will only accept
incoming messages

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.710
from a particular
source IP address.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.460
So for example,
Comcast's mail server

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.280
will only accept mail
from Comcast IP addresses.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.570
Same for MIT mail servers--
will only accept mail

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:03.500
from MIT IP addresses.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.260
Or there was at least
one server that ISNT

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.910
runs that has this property.

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.090
So this is the case
where it's still

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.026
using IP-based authentication.

00:31:13.026 --> 00:31:14.905
Here it's not so bad.

00:31:14.905 --> 00:31:16.775
Worst case, you'll
send some piece of spam

00:31:16.775 --> 00:31:17.775
through the mail server.

00:31:17.775 --> 00:31:19.890
So that's probably why
they're still using it,

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.710
whereas things that allow you
to log into an arbitrary account

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.280
stopped using IP-based
authentication.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.820
So does this make sense,
why this is a bad plan?

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.500
And just to double check,
suppose that some server

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.554
was using rlogin.

00:31:34.554 --> 00:31:35.845
What would you do to attack it?

00:31:35.845 --> 00:31:39.640
What bad thing would happen?

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.590
Suggestions?

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.090
Yeah.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:44.026
AUDIENCE: Just getting
into your computer,

00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:46.482
and then make a user that
you want to log into,

00:31:46.482 --> 00:31:47.898
and then you get
into the network.

00:31:47.898 --> 00:31:50.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so basically
you get your computer.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.955
You synthesize this data to look
like a legitimate set of rlogin

00:31:53.955 --> 00:31:56.170
commands that say,
log in as this user

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.980
and run this command
in my Unix shell there.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.780
You sort of synthesize this data
and you mount this whole attack

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.295
and send this data as if a
legitimate user was interacting

00:32:04.295 --> 00:32:09.275
with an rlogin client, and
then you're good to go.

00:32:09.275 --> 00:32:11.280
OK, so this is one
reason why you probably

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.560
don't want your TCP sequence
numbers to be so guessable.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.340
Another problem is
these reset attacks.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:23.120
So much like we were able
to send a SYN packet,

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.222
if you know someone's
sequence number,

00:32:25.222 --> 00:32:26.680
you could also send
a reset packet.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.810
We sort of briefly
talked about it

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.750
here as the legitimate
client potentially

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.975
sending a reset to reset
the fake connection

00:32:32.975 --> 00:32:35.200
that the attacker
is establishing.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.960
But in a similar
vain, the adversary

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.180
could try to send reset packets
for an existing connection

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.400
if there's some way
that the adversary knows

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.060
what your sequence number
is on that connection.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.850
So this is actually not clear
if this is such a big problem

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:49.750
or or.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.240
At some level,
maybe you should be

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.490
assuming that all your
TCP connections could

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.450
be broken at any time anyway.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.210
It's not like the
network is reliable.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.920
So maybe you should be expecting
your connections to drop.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.710
But one place where
this turned out

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.000
to be particularly not a
good assumption to make

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.060
is in the case of routers
talking to one another.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.340
So if you have
multiple routers that

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.505
speak some routing
protocol, then they're

00:33:10.505 --> 00:33:13.590
connected, of course,
by some physical links.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:16.480
But over some physical
links, they actually

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.000
speak some network protocol.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.671
And that network
protocol runs over TCP.

00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:21.170
So there's actually
some TCP session

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.878
running over each of
these physical links

00:33:22.878 --> 00:33:26.672
that the routers use to
exchange routing information.

00:33:26.672 --> 00:33:28.630
So this is certainly the
case for this protocol

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:32.250
called BGP we'll talk about
a bit more in a second.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.050
And BGP uses the fact
that the TCP connection

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.580
is alive to also infer
that the link is alive.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.750
So if the TCP connection
breaks, then the routers

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.090
assume the link broke.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.350
And they recompute all
their routing tables.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.875
So if an adversary
wants to mount

00:33:47.875 --> 00:33:49.819
some sort of a denial
of service attack here,

00:33:49.819 --> 00:33:51.319
they could try to
guess the sequence

00:33:51.319 --> 00:33:54.520
numbers of these routers
and reset these sessions.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.876
So if the TCP session between
two routers goes down,

00:33:57.876 --> 00:33:59.750
both routers are like,
oh, this link is dead.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.583
We have to recompute
all the routing tables,

00:34:01.583 --> 00:34:02.510
and the routes change.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.235
And then you might shoot
down another link, and so on.

00:34:05.235 --> 00:34:07.300
So this is a bit of
a worrisome attack,

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.489
not because it violates
someone's secrecy, et cetera,

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:15.510
or at least not directly,
but more because it really

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.310
causes a lot of
availability problems

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.079
for other users in the system.

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:21.734
Yeah.

00:34:21.734 --> 00:34:23.960
AUDIENCE: So if
you're an attacker,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.170
and you wanted to target
one particular user,

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.740
could you just keep
sending connection requests

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.594
to a server on behalf
of his IP and make

00:34:32.594 --> 00:34:33.969
him keep dropping
his connections

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:38.679
to the servers and so
you just [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.540
PROFESSOR: Well, so it
requires you guessing.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.460
So you're saying,
suppose I'm using Gmail,

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.835
and you want to stop me from
learning something in Gmail,

00:34:45.835 --> 00:34:48.292
so just send packets
to my machine

00:34:48.292 --> 00:34:49.530
pretending to be from Gmail.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.980
Well, you have to guess the
right source and destination

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:52.787
port numbers.

00:34:52.787 --> 00:34:54.620
The destination port
number is probably 443,

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.912
because I'm using HTTPS.

00:34:55.912 --> 00:34:57.370
But the source port
number is going

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:59.390
to be some random 16-bit thing.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.040
And it's also going to be the
case that probably the sequence

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.070
numbers are going
to be different.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.903
So unless you guess a
sequence number that's

00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:09.650
within my TCP window, which
is in order of probably

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.400
tens of kilobytes,
you're also going

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.280
to be not successful
in that regard.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.350
So you have to guess a
fair amount of stuff.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.168
There's no sort
of oracle access.

00:35:19.168 --> 00:35:21.293
You can't just query the
server and say, well, what

00:35:21.293 --> 00:35:23.130
is that guy's sequence number?

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:27.890
So that's the reason why that
doesn't work out as well.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.040
So again, many of
these issues were

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.880
fixed, including
this RST-based thing,

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.065
especially for BGP routers.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.460
There was actually two
sort of amusing fixes.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.389
One really shows you
how you can carefully

00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:43.430
exploit existing things
or take advantage of them

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.670
to fix particular problems.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.747
Here, the insight is
that these routers only

00:35:47.747 --> 00:35:49.497
want to talk to each
other, not to someone

00:35:49.497 --> 00:35:50.980
else over the network.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.990
And as a result,
if the packet is

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.817
coming not from the immediate
router next across the link,

00:35:55.817 --> 00:35:58.442
but from someone else, I want to
drop this packet all together.

00:35:58.442 --> 00:36:01.730
And what the designers of these
writing protocols realized

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.370
is that there's this wonderful
field in a packet called time

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.390
to live.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:08.665
It's an 8-bit field that gets
decremented by every router

00:36:08.665 --> 00:36:11.840
to make sure that packets
don't go into an infinite loop.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.180
So the highest this TTL
value could ever be is 255.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.630
And then it'll get
decremented from there.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.165
So what these writing
protocols do--

00:36:19.165 --> 00:36:23.000
it's sort of a
clever hack-- is they

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.220
reject any packet with a
TTL value that's not 255.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.660
Because if a packet
has a value of 255,

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.430
it must have come
from the router

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.530
just on the other
side of this link.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.630
And if the an adversary
tries to inject any packet

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.900
to tamper with this
existing BGP connection,

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.852
it'll have a TTL
value less than 255,

00:36:39.852 --> 00:36:41.935
because it'll be decremented
by some other routers

00:36:41.935 --> 00:36:44.520
along the path,
including this one.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.766
And then it'll just get
rejected by the recipient.

00:36:47.766 --> 00:36:50.762
So this is one example
of a clever combination

00:36:50.762 --> 00:36:52.470
of techniques that's
backwards compatible

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.658
and solves this very
specific problem.

00:36:54.658 --> 00:36:55.158
Yeah.

00:36:55.158 --> 00:36:56.866
AUDIENCE: Doesn't the
bottom right router

00:36:56.866 --> 00:36:58.616
also send something
with a TTL of 255?

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so these
routers are actually--

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:01.830
this is a physical router.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.780
And it knows these
are separate links.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.130
So it looks at the TTL
and which link it came on.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.150
So if a packet came
in on this link,

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.840
it will not accept it
for this TCP connection.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.896
But you're right.

00:37:13.896 --> 00:37:17.630
For the most part,
these routers trust

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.450
their immediate neighbors.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:20.950
It need not necessarily
be the case.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.016
But if you keep
seeing this problem,

00:37:22.016 --> 00:37:23.740
and you know you've
implemented this hack,

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.720
then it must be one
of your neighbors.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.594
You're going to look.

00:37:25.594 --> 00:37:27.162
TCP dumped these interfaces.

00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:29.210
Why are you sending me
these reset packets?

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.120
This problem is not as big.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.736
You can manage it by
some Auto Pan mechanism.

00:37:34.736 --> 00:37:36.005
Make sense?

00:37:36.005 --> 00:37:38.450
All right, there are
other fixes for BGP

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.550
where they implemented some
form of header authentication,

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.480
MD5 header
authentication as well.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.220
But they're really targeting
this particular application

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.340
where this reset attack
is particularly bad.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.975
This is still a problem today.

00:37:49.975 --> 00:37:51.975
If there's some
long-lived connection

00:37:51.975 --> 00:37:53.766
out there that I really
want to shoot down,

00:37:53.766 --> 00:37:58.480
I just have to send some
large number of RST packets,

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.730
probably on the order
of hundreds of thousands

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:04.770
or so, but probably
not exactly 4 billion.

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.930
Because the servers
are actually somewhat

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.520
lax in terms of which sequence
number they accept for a reset.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.360
It can be any packet
within a certain window.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.730
And in that case, I could
probably, or any attacker,

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.500
reset an existing
connection with a modest

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.262
but not a huge amount of effort.

00:38:21.262 --> 00:38:22.738
That's still a problem.

00:38:22.738 --> 00:38:25.460
And people haven't really found
any great solution for that.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.576
All right, and I guess the
sort of last bad thing that

00:38:31.576 --> 00:38:33.700
happens because these
sequence numbers are somewhat

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.331
predictable is
just data injection

00:38:36.331 --> 00:38:39.280
into existing connections.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.550
So suppose there is some
protocol like rlogin,

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:47.650
but maybe rlogin doesn't--
suppose we have some

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.710
hypothetical protocol
that's kind of like rlogin,

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:51.990
but actually it doesn't do
IP-based authentication.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:53.364
You have to type
in your password

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:55.392
to log in, all this great stuff.

00:38:55.392 --> 00:38:57.350
The problem is once you've
typed your password,

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.225
maybe your TCP connection
is just established

00:38:59.225 --> 00:39:01.060
and can accept arbitrary data.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.392
So wait for one of you guys
to log into a machine, type

00:39:03.392 --> 00:39:04.100
in your password.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.235
I don't know what
that password is.

00:39:05.235 --> 00:39:07.026
But once you've
established TCP connection,

00:39:07.026 --> 00:39:09.120
I'll just try to guess
your sequence number

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.332
and inject some data into
your existing connection.

00:39:11.332 --> 00:39:13.415
So if I can guess your
sequence numbers correctly,

00:39:13.415 --> 00:39:16.005
then this allows me
to make it pretend

00:39:16.005 --> 00:39:18.255
like you've typed some command
after you authenticated

00:39:18.255 --> 00:39:19.977
correctly with your password.

00:39:19.977 --> 00:39:21.810
So this all sort of
suggests that you really

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:28.260
don't want to rely on these
32-bit sequence numbers

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.430
for providing security.

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.660
But let's actually see what
modern TCP stacks actually

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.650
do to try to mitigate
this problem.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:37.650
So as we were sort
of discussing,

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:41.170
I guess one approach that
we'll look at in the next two

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.780
lectures is how to
implement some security

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.910
at the application level.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:50.160
So we'll use cryptography
to authenticate and encrypt

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.460
and sign and verify messages
at the application level

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.420
without really
involving TCP so much.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.606
But there are some
existing applications

00:39:59.606 --> 00:40:03.950
that would benefit from
making this slightly better,

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:07.160
at least not make it so easy
to exploit these problems.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.360
And the way that
I guess people do

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.200
this in practice today-- for
example Linux and Windows--

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.360
is they implement the suggestion
that John gave earlier,

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.920
that we maintain
different initial sequence

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.820
numbers for every
source destination pair.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:29.110
So what most TCP SYN
implementations do

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:33.200
is they still compute this
initial sequence number

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.590
as we were computing before.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:39.600
So this is the old
style ISN, let's say.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.000
And in order to
actually generate

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.650
the actual ISN for any
particular connection,

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:48.130
we're going to add a
random 32-bit offset.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.005
So we're going to include
some sort of a function.

00:40:51.005 --> 00:40:54.010
Think of it like as like
a hash function like SHA-1

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:56.295
or something maybe better.

00:40:56.295 --> 00:40:59.190
And this is going to be
a function of the source

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:05.140
IP, the source port
number, the destination IP

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:10.820
address, destination port,
and some sort of a secret key

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.900
that only the server
knows in this case.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.290
So this has the
nice property that

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.350
within any particular
connection,

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:24.147
as identified by a source
and destination IP port pair,

00:41:24.147 --> 00:41:25.980
it still preserves all
these nice properties

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:30.000
of this old style sequence
number algorithm had.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.780
But if you have connections from
different source/destination

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.230
tuples, then there's
nothing you can

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:41.600
learn about the exact value
of another connection tuple's

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.780
sequence number.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.450
And in fact, you'll have
to guess this key in order

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:47.680
to infer that value.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.580
And hopefully the server,
presumably the OS kernel,

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.290
stores this key
somewhere in its memory

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.670
and doesn't give it
out to anyone else.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.420
So this is how pretty
much most TCP stacks

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.365
deal with this
particular problem

00:41:58.365 --> 00:42:02.896
today to the extent allowed
by the total 32-bit sequence

00:42:02.896 --> 00:42:03.395
number.

00:42:03.395 --> 00:42:04.050
It's not great,
but sort of works.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:04.543
Yeah.

00:42:04.543 --> 00:42:06.126
AUDIENCE: Could you
repeat that again?

00:42:06.126 --> 00:42:09.480
Is the key unique to--

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.380
PROFESSOR: So when
my machine boots up,

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.780
or when any machine boots up,
it generates a random key.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.530
Every time you reboot it
it generates a new key.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:20.565
And this means that
every time that

00:42:20.565 --> 00:42:24.680
for a particular
source/destination pair,

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.830
the sequence numbers
advance at the same rate as

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:27.820
controlled by this.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.444
So for a given
source/destination pair,

00:42:29.444 --> 00:42:30.850
this thing is fixed.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.889
So you observe your
sequence numbers

00:42:32.889 --> 00:42:34.680
evolving according to
your initial sequence

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.596
numbers for new connections
evolving according

00:42:36.596 --> 00:42:39.480
to a particular algorithm.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:43.915
So that still provides all these
defences against old packets

00:42:43.915 --> 00:42:47.120
from previous connections being
injected into new connections,

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.430
just like packet
reordering problems.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.630
So that still works.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.490
And that's the only
real thing for which

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.030
we needed this sequence
number choosing algorithms

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.800
to prevent these duplicate
packets from causing problems.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.660
However, the thing that
we were exploiting before,

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.095
which is that if
you get the sequence

00:43:04.095 --> 00:43:08.130
number for one connection
from A to S, then

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.715
from that you can infer
the sequence number

00:43:10.715 --> 00:43:12.360
for a different connection.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.080
That's now gone.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.750
Because every connection
has a different

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:19.790
offset in this 32-bit space as
implemented by its F function.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:25.085
So this completely decouples
the initial sequence numbers

00:43:25.085 --> 00:43:27.611
seen by every connection.

00:43:27.611 --> 00:43:28.110
Yeah.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:31.300
AUDIENCE: What's the point
in including the key?

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.300
PROFESSOR: Well, if you
don't include the key,

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.050
then I can connect to you.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.487
I'll compute the same function
F. I'll subtract it out.

00:43:37.487 --> 00:43:38.070
I'll get this.

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.170
I'll compute this function F
for the connection I actually

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:40.910
want to fake.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:42.615
And I'll guess what the initial
sequence number for that one

00:43:42.615 --> 00:43:43.360
is going to be.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.230
AUDIENCE: So can you--
because machines now restart

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:50.630
infrequently, can you still
[INAUDIBLE] by reversing--

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.569
PROFESSOR: I think
typically this function F

00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:55.610
is something like a
cryptographically secure hash

00:43:55.610 --> 00:44:01.557
function, which has a
semi-proved property that it's

00:44:01.557 --> 00:44:03.140
very difficult. It's
cryptographically

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.480
hard to invert it.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.160
So even if you were given the
literal inputs and outputs

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:14.059
of this hash function
except for this key part,

00:44:14.059 --> 00:44:15.517
it would be very
hard for you guess

00:44:15.517 --> 00:44:17.490
what this key is
cryptographically,

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.324
even in an isolated setting.

00:44:19.324 --> 00:44:21.740
So hopefully this will be at
least as hard in this setting

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.324
as well.

00:44:24.324 --> 00:44:26.615
We'll talk a little bit more
about what these functions

00:44:26.615 --> 00:44:30.460
F are a bit later on and how
you to use them correctly.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:31.650
Make sense?

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:37.140
Other questions of this
problem and solution?

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:41.252
All right, so in
fact, this was mostly

00:44:41.252 --> 00:44:44.255
sort of an example of these
TCP sequence number attacks

00:44:44.255 --> 00:44:46.790
that aren't as relevant anymore.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:49.440
Because every operating system
basically implements this plan

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.080
these days.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.425
So it's hard to infer
what someone's sequence

00:44:52.425 --> 00:44:53.577
number is going to be.

00:44:53.577 --> 00:44:55.910
On the other hand, people
keep making the same mistakes.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:59.755
So even after this was
implemented for TCP,

00:44:59.755 --> 00:45:01.490
there was this other
protocol called

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:05.830
DNS that is hugely vulnerable
to similar attacks.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:10.060
And the reason is that DNS
actually runs over UDP.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:13.100
So UDP is a stateless
protocol where you actually

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.340
don't do any connection
establishment where

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.140
you exchange sequence numbers.

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.040
In UDP, you simply
send a request

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.140
from your source
address to the server.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.950
And the server figures out what
the reply should be and sends

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.780
it back to whatever source
address appeared in the packet.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.850
So it's a single
round trip, so there's

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.350
no time to exchange
sequence numbers

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.349
and to establish that,
oh, yeah, you're actually

00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:38.140
talking to the right guy.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:44.330
So with DNS, as a
result, for a while,

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:48.840
it was quite easy to fake
responses from a DNS server.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.464
So how would a query look
like in DNS, typically?

00:45:51.464 --> 00:45:53.130
Well, you send some
queries-- so suppose

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:57.230
a client sends a packet from
client to some DNS server

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:00.210
that knows the DNS server's
IP address ahead of time,

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:04.260
maybe preconfigured somewhere,
say, well, here's my query.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.336
Maybe I'm looking for mit.edu.

00:46:07.336 --> 00:46:09.860
And that's basically it.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.420
And the server's
destination port number

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.600
is always 53 for DNS.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.380
And the clients used to also
run on the same port number

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:20.720
for ease of use or something.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.003
So you send this packet
from the client on this port

00:46:23.003 --> 00:46:24.320
to the server on this port.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.200
Here's the query.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.460
And the server eventually
sends back a reply saying,

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:38.580
mit.edu has a particular IP
address, 18.9 dot something.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.860
The problem is that some
adversary could easily

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.615
send a similar response
packet pretending

00:46:43.615 --> 00:46:45.408
to be from the server.

00:46:45.408 --> 00:46:47.366
And there's not a whole
lot of randomness here.

00:46:47.366 --> 00:46:50.180
So if I know that you're
trying to connect to mit.edu,

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.126
I'll just send a lot of packets
like this to your machine.

00:46:53.126 --> 00:46:55.334
I know exactly what DNS
server you're going to query.

00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:57.400
I know exactly what
your IP address is.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.703
I know the port numbers.

00:46:58.703 --> 00:47:00.036
I know what you're querying for.

00:47:00.036 --> 00:47:02.530
I can just supply my
own IP address here.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:06.310
And if my packet gets
there after you send this

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:08.630
but before you get
the real response,

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.930
your client machine is
going to use my packet.

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:14.585
So this is another example
where insufficient randomness

00:47:14.585 --> 00:47:17.470
in this protocol makes it
very easy to inject responses

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.027
or inject packets in general.

00:47:20.027 --> 00:47:21.860
And this is actually
in some ways even worse

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.113
than the previous attack.

00:47:23.113 --> 00:47:25.220
Because here you could
convince a client

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.150
to connect to another
IP address all together.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:29.865
And it'll probably
cache this result,

00:47:29.865 --> 00:47:31.246
because DNS involves caching.

00:47:31.246 --> 00:47:32.787
Maybe you can supply
a very long time

00:47:32.787 --> 00:47:36.550
to live in this response
saying, this is valid for years.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.620
And then your client,
again till it reboots,

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.740
is going to keep using this
IP address for mit.edu.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.240
Yeah.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.980
AUDIENCE: Could you fix this
by having the client include

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.130
some random value in the
query, and the server customer

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:48.630
exactly?

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.755
PROFESSOR: That's right,
yeah, so this is typically

00:47:50.755 --> 00:47:52.050
what people have done now.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.167
The problem, as we were sort
of talking about earlier,

00:47:55.167 --> 00:47:56.250
is backward compatibility.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.870
It's very hard to change
the DNS server software

00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:59.760
that everyone runs.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.260
So you basically
have to figure out,

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.700
where can you inject randomness?

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.450
And people have
figured out two places.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:05.860
It's not great.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.340
But basically there's
a source port number,

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:11.050
which is 16 bits of randomness.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:13.700
So if you can choose the
source port number randomly,

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.140
then you get 16 bits.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:19.470
And there's also
a query ID inside

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:22.460
of the packet, which
is also 16 bits.

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.030
And the server does
echo back the query ID.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.040
So combining these
two things together,

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.570
most resolvers these days
get 32 bits of randomness

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:31.940
out of this protocol.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:36.620
And it, again, makes it
noticeably harder, but still

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:40.854
not cryptographically perfect,
to fake this kind of response

00:48:40.854 --> 00:48:44.340
and have it be
accepted by the client.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.450
But these problems keep
coming up, unfortunately.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:51.990
So even though it was
well understood for TCP,

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:55.200
some people I guess suggested
that this might be a problem.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.350
But it wasn't actually fixed
until only a few years ago.

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:04.220
Make sense?

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.080
All right, so I guess
maybe as an aside,

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.910
there are solutions
to this DNS problem

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.890
as well by enforcing
security for DNS

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:13.270
at the application level.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:16.750
So instead of relying on
these randomness properties

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.611
of small numbers of
bits in the packet,

00:49:19.611 --> 00:49:23.680
you could try to use encryption
in the DNS protocols.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.040
So protocols like DNS SEC
that the paper briefly

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.070
talks about try to do this.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:30.770
So instead of relying on
any network level security

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:34.590
properties, they require that
all DNS names have signatures

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:36.290
attached to them.

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:37.820
That seems like a sensible plan.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.695
But it turns out that
working out the details

00:49:39.695 --> 00:49:42.300
is actually quite
difficult. So one example

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:47.100
of a problem that showed
up is name and origin.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:51.130
Because in DNS, you
want to get responses.

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.680
Well, this name has
that IP address.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.721
Or you could get a response
saying, no, so sorry,

00:49:54.721 --> 00:49:56.310
this name doesn't exist.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:50:00.186
So you want to sign the it
doesn't exist response as well.

00:50:00.186 --> 00:50:01.560
Because otherwise,
that adversary

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.760
could send back a doesn't
exist response and pretend

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.420
that a name doesn't exist,
even though it does.

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.930
So how do you sign
responses that certain names

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:11.951
don't exist ahead of time?

00:50:11.951 --> 00:50:13.450
I guess one possibility
is you could

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:17.950
give your DNS server the key
that signs all your records.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.082
That seems like a bad plan.

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:21.248
Because then someone who
compromises your DNS server

00:50:21.248 --> 00:50:22.680
could walk away with this key.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.700
So instead, the model the
DNS SEC operates under

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.440
is that you sign all your names
in your domain ahead of time,

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.315
and you give the signed
blob to your DNS server.

00:50:32.315 --> 00:50:34.866
And the DNS server can then
respond to any queries.

00:50:34.866 --> 00:50:36.990
But even if it's compromised,
there's not much else

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.480
that that attacker can do.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.600
All these things are
signed, and the key

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.340
is not to be found on
the DNS server itself.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:49.150
So the DNS SEC protocol had this
clever mechanism called NSEC

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:52.230
for signing nonexistent records.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.390
And the way you would do
this is by signing gaps

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:56.650
in the namespace.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:51:00.490
So an NSEC record might
say, well, there's

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:06.550
a name called foo.mit.edu, and
the next name alphabetically

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:10.492
is maybe goo.mit.edu.

00:51:10.492 --> 00:51:13.680
And there's nothing alphabetical
in between these two names.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.380
So if you query for a
name between these two

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.921
names alphabetically
sorted, then

00:51:17.921 --> 00:51:20.170
the server could send back
this signed message saying,

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.050
oh, there's nothing
between these two names.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:24.460
You can safely
return, doesn't exist.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.060
But then this
allows some attacker

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.768
to completely enumerate
your domain name.

00:51:27.768 --> 00:51:31.410
You can just ask for some
domain name and find this record

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:32.710
and say, oh, yeah, great.

00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:34.330
So these two things exist.

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:36.520
Let me query for gooa.mit.edu.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.200
That'll give me a
response saying,

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.820
what's the next name in
your domain, et cetera.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:42.290
So it's actually
a little bit hard

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:43.950
to come up with
the right protocol

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:46.790
that both preserves all
the nice properties of DNS

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:50.420
and prevents name enumeration
and other problems.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.020
There's actually
a nice thing now

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.950
called NSEC3 that tries to solve
this problem partially-- sort

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:56.875
of works, sort of not.

00:51:56.875 --> 00:51:59.110
We'll see, I guess, what
gets it [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:59.110 --> 00:51:59.880
Yeah.

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.550
AUDIENCE: Is there
any kind of signing

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.915
of nonexistent
top level domains?

00:52:03.915 --> 00:52:05.540
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
think actually yeah.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.600
The dot domain is
just another domain.

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.250
And they similarly have this
mechanism implemented as well.

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:13.120
So actually dot and dot
com now implement DNS SEC,

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.842
and there's all these
records there that say, well,

00:52:15.842 --> 00:52:18.540
.in is a domain
name that exists,

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.915
and dot something else exists,
and there's nothing in between.

00:52:21.915 --> 00:52:23.186
So there's all these things.

00:52:23.186 --> 00:52:25.118
AUDIENCE: So other
than denial of service,

00:52:25.118 --> 00:52:27.533
why do we care so
much about repeating

00:52:27.533 --> 00:52:29.442
domain names within mit.edu?

00:52:29.442 --> 00:52:30.900
PROFESSOR: Well,
probably we don't.

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.200
Actually, there's
a text file in AFS

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.210
that lists all these
domain names at MIT anyway.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:36.930
But I think in
general, some companies

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:39.530
feel a little uneasy
about revealing this.

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:41.735
They often have
internal names that

00:52:41.735 --> 00:52:46.245
sit in DNS that should never
be exposed to the outside.

00:52:46.245 --> 00:52:49.730
I think it's actually this
fuzzy area where it was never

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.910
really formalized what
guarantees DNS was providing

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:52.774
to you or was not.

00:52:52.774 --> 00:52:54.690
And people started
assuming things like, well,

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.390
if we stick some name, and it's
not really publicized anywhere,

00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:59.760
then it's probably secure here.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.740
I think this is another place
where this system doesn't have

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.740
a clear spec in terms of
what it has and doesn't

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:05.930
have to provide.

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:08.224
And when you make some
changes like this, then people

00:53:08.224 --> 00:53:11.214
say, oh, yeah, I was
sort of relying on that.

00:53:11.214 --> 00:53:12.116
Yeah.

00:53:12.116 --> 00:53:13.574
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
replay attack

00:53:13.574 --> 00:53:16.595
where you could send
in bold gap signature?

00:53:16.595 --> 00:53:17.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
there's actually

00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:19.053
time outs on these things.

00:53:19.053 --> 00:53:22.480
So when you sign this,
you actually sign and say,

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.370
I'm signing that
this set of names

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:27.710
is valid for, I
don't know, a week.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:30.790
And then the clients, if they
have a synchronized clock,

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:33.436
they can reject old
signed messages.

00:53:33.436 --> 00:53:36.770
Make sense?

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:43.290
All right, so this is on the
TCP SYN guessing attacks.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:47.850
Another interesting problem that
also comes up in the TCP case

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:50.490
is a denial of
service attack that

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:54.160
exploits the fact that the
server has to store some state.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.460
So if you look at
this handshake that we

00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:00.450
had on the board
before, we'll see

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:04.230
that when a client establishes
a connection to the server,

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:08.720
the server has to actually
remember the sequence number

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.440
SNC.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.060
So the server has to
maintain some data structure

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.960
on the side that says,
for this connection,

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.850
here's the sequence number.

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:21.140
And it's going to say, well,
my connection from C to S

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.740
has the sequence number SNC.

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:28.510
And the reason the server
has to store this table

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:33.545
is because the server
needs to figure out what

00:54:33.545 --> 00:54:37.340
SNC value to accept here later.

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.660
Does this make sense?

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.562
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] SNS?

00:54:41.562 --> 00:54:43.936
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the server
also needs SNS I guess, yeah.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.770
But it turns out that--
well, yeah, you're right.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:57.445
And the problem is that--
actually, yeah, you're right.

00:54:57.445 --> 00:54:58.945
SNS is actually
much more important.

00:54:58.945 --> 00:55:00.235
Sorry, yeah.

00:55:00.235 --> 00:55:02.746
[INAUDIBLE] SNS is actually
much more important.

00:55:02.746 --> 00:55:04.371
Because SNS is how
you know that you're

00:55:04.371 --> 00:55:05.412
talking to the right guy.

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:12.075
The problem is that
there's no real bound

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:13.710
on the size of this table.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.317
So you might get packets
from some machine.

00:55:16.317 --> 00:55:17.650
You don't even know who sent it.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:19.983
You just get a packet that
looks like this with a source

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.610
address that claims to be C.

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:24.730
And in order to potentially
accept a connection later

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:28.435
from this IP address, you have
to create this table entry.

00:55:28.435 --> 00:55:31.012
And these table entries
are somewhat long lived.

00:55:31.012 --> 00:55:33.345
Because maybe someone is
connecting to you from a really

00:55:33.345 --> 00:55:34.346
far away place.

00:55:34.346 --> 00:55:35.690
There's lots of packet loss.

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:40.090
It might be not for maybe
a minute until someone

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:42.730
finishes this TCP handshake
in the worst case.

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:45.710
So you have to store this
state in your TCP stack

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:47.980
for a relatively long time.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.230
And there's no way
to guess whether this

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:52.640
is a valid connection or not.

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.710
So one denial of service
attack that people discovered

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.690
against most TCP stacks
is to simply send

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.670
lots of packets like this.

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:04.980
So if I'm an attacker, then I'll
just send lots of SYN packets

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:08.930
to a particular server and
get it to fill up its table.

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:12.810
And the problem is
that in the best case,

00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:15.410
maybe the attacker just
always uses the same source IP

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:16.720
address.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.800
In that case, you
can just say, well,

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.710
every client machine is allowed
two entries in my table,

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:23.340
or something like this.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.870
And then the attacker can use
up two table entries but not

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:26.745
much more.

00:56:26.745 --> 00:56:28.667
The problem, of course,
is that the attacker

00:56:28.667 --> 00:56:30.125
can fake these
client IP addresses,

00:56:30.125 --> 00:56:31.832
make them look random.

00:56:31.832 --> 00:56:33.290
And then for the
server, it's going

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:34.885
to be very difficult to
distinguish whether this

00:56:34.885 --> 00:56:37.385
is an attacker trying to
connect to me or some client

00:56:37.385 --> 00:56:38.510
I've never heard of before.

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:41.320
So if you're some website that's
supposed to accept connections

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.275
from anywhere in the world, this
is going to be a big problem.

00:56:44.275 --> 00:56:46.870
Because either you deny
access to everyone,

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:51.080
or you have a store state
for all these mostly fake

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.716
connection attempts.

00:56:52.716 --> 00:56:55.020
Does that make sense?

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.480
So this is a bit of a
problem for TCP, and in fact

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.990
for most protocols that
allow some sort of connection

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.970
initiation, and the
server has to store state.

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:05.890
So there's some fixes.

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:07.490
We'll talk about
in a second what

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:10.285
workaround TCP implements to
try to deal with this problem.

00:57:10.285 --> 00:57:13.788
This is called SYN
flooding in TCP.

00:57:13.788 --> 00:57:15.162
But in general,
this is a problem

00:57:15.162 --> 00:57:17.030
that's worth knowing
about and trying

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:19.975
to avoid in any protocol
you design on top as well.

00:57:19.975 --> 00:57:22.120
So you want to make sure
that the server doesn't

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.830
have to keep state
until it can actually

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:27.204
authenticate and identify,
who is the client?

00:57:27.204 --> 00:57:29.745
Because by that time, if you've
identified who the client is,

00:57:29.745 --> 00:57:31.340
you've authenticated
them somehow,

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.290
then you can actually
make a decision,

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:34.515
well, every client is
allowed to only connect

00:57:34.515 --> 00:57:35.920
once, or something.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.780
And then I'm not going
to keep more state.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.240
Here, the problem is
you're guaranteeing

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.938
that you're storing state
before you have any idea who it

00:57:42.938 --> 00:57:44.146
is that is connecting to you.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:48.330
So let's look at
how you can actually

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:53.070
solve this SYN flooding attack
where the server accumulates

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:54.850
lots of state.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:57.530
So of course, if you
could change TCP again,

00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:00.810
you could fix this pretty
easily by using cryptography

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:04.490
or something or changing exactly
who's responsible for storing

00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:05.130
what state.

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:07.100
The problem is we
have TCP as is.

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:11.310
And could we fix this problem
without changing the TCP wire

00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:12.860
protocol?

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:15.657
So this is, again, an exercise
in trying to figure out, well,

00:58:15.657 --> 00:58:17.930
what exactly tricks
we could play

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:21.470
or exactly what assumptions
we could relax and still

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:24.715
stick to the TCP header
format and other things.

00:58:24.715 --> 00:58:28.900
And the trick is to in fact
figure out a clever way

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.500
to make the server
stateless without having

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.842
to-- so the server isn't
going to have to keep

00:58:33.842 --> 00:58:36.424
this table around in memory.

00:58:36.424 --> 00:58:37.840
And the way we're
going to do this

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:42.140
is by carefully choosing SMS.

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.840
Instead of using this formula
we were looking at before, where

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.650
we were to add this
function, we're

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:51.170
instead going to
choose this sequence

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:52.710
number in a different way.

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:55.094
And I'll give you
exactly the formula.

00:58:55.094 --> 00:58:57.510
And then we'll talk about why
this is actually interesting

00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:59.530
and what nice properties it has.

00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:02.192
So if the server detects that
it's under this kind of attack,

00:59:02.192 --> 00:59:03.650
it's going to switch
into this mode

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:12.510
where it chooses SNS using
this formula of applying

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:14.900
basically the same or
similar kind of function F

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:15.490
we saw before.

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:20.100
And what it's going
to apply it to

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:25.652
is the source IP, destination
IP, the same things as before,

00:59:25.652 --> 00:59:35.920
source port, destination
port, and also timestamp,

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.420
and also a key in here as well.

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:45.374
And we're going to concatenate
it with a timestamp as well.

00:59:45.374 --> 00:59:47.665
So this timestamp is going
to be fairly coarse grained.

00:59:47.665 --> 00:59:49.206
It's going to go in
order of minutes.

00:59:49.206 --> 00:59:52.290
So every minute, the
timestamp ticks off by one.

00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:54.560
It's a very coarse grained time.

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:59.920
And there's probably some split
between this part of the header

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.270
and this part of the header.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:03.270
This timestamp doesn't
need a whole lot of bits.

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:07.000
So I forget exactly what this
protocol does in real machines.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.730
But you could easily
imagine maybe using 8 bits.

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:11.158
For the timestamp,
I'm going to be

01:00:11.158 --> 01:00:15.920
using 24 bits for this chunk
of the sequence number.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.830
All right, so why
is this a good plan?

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:19.850
What's going on here?

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.990
Why this weird formula?

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:24.210
So I think you have to
remember, one was the property

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:26.920
that we were trying to achieve
of the sequence number.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.580
So there's two things going on.

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.844
One is there's this defense
against duplicated packets

01:00:31.844 --> 01:00:35.041
that we were trying to achieve
by-- maybe the formula is still

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:35.541
here.

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:37.030
Nope-- oh, yeah, yeah, here.

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.210
Right, so just to
compare these guys-- so

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:42.100
when we're not under
attack, we were previously

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.148
maintaining this old style
sequence number scheme

01:00:45.148 --> 01:00:47.606
to prevent duplicate packets
from previous connections, all

01:00:47.606 --> 01:00:49.495
this good stuff.

01:00:49.495 --> 01:00:51.120
It turns out people
couldn't figure out

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.800
a way to defend against these
kinds of SYN flooding attacks

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.990
without giving up
on this property,

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:57.370
so basically
saying, well, here's

01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:59.670
one plan that works
well in some situations.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.330
Here's a different plan where
we'll give up on that ISN

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:03.760
old style component.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.890
And instead, we'll
focus on just ensuring

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:12.305
that if someone presents us this
sequence number S in response

01:01:12.305 --> 01:01:15.900
to a packet, like
here, then we know it

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.150
must've been the right client.

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:22.434
So remember that in order to
prevent IP spoofing attacks,

01:01:22.434 --> 01:01:23.850
we sort of rely
on this SNS value.

01:01:23.850 --> 01:01:28.310
So if the server sends this
SNS value to some client, then

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.800
hopefully only that client can
send us back the correct SNS

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.985
value, finish establishing
the connection.

01:01:32.985 --> 01:01:36.220
And this is why you had to store
it in this table over here.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.730
Because otherwise,
how do you know

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:40.610
if this is a real response
or a fake response?

01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:42.660
And the reason for using
this function F here

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.670
is that now we can maybe not
store this table in memory.

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:51.760
And instead, when a connection
attempt arrives here,

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.480
we're going to
compute SNS according

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.440
to this formula
over here and just

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.058
send it back to whatever client
pretends to have connected

01:01:58.058 --> 01:01:59.250
to us.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:01.960
And then we'll forget all
about this connection.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.040
And then if this third packet
eventually comes through,

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.230
and its SNS value here matches
what we would expect to see,

01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:11.040
then we'll say, oh
yeah, this must've

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.310
been someone got our
response from step two

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:15.745
and finally sent it back to us.

01:02:15.745 --> 01:02:17.495
And now we finally
commit after step three

01:02:17.495 --> 01:02:21.846
to storing a real entry for
this TCP connection in memory.

01:02:21.846 --> 01:02:25.350
So this is a way to sort of
defer the storage of this state

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:28.820
at the server by requiring
the server, the client,

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.420
to echo back this exact value.

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.716
And by constructing it
in this careful way,

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:34.590
we can actually check
whether the client just

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:38.598
made up this value, or if it's
the real thing we're expecting.

01:02:38.598 --> 01:02:40.486
Does that make sense?

01:02:40.486 --> 01:02:43.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
SNC [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so SNC now,
we basically don't store it.

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.570
It's maybe not great.

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:52.134
But so it is.

01:02:52.134 --> 01:02:54.470
So in fact, I guess
what really happens

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:59.650
is in-- I didn't show it here.

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:05.435
But there's probably going to be
sort of a null data field here

01:03:05.435 --> 01:03:07.560
that says this
packet has no data.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.680
But it still includes the
sequence number SNC just

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.790
because there's a field for it.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:14.554
So this is how the
server can reconstruct

01:03:14.554 --> 01:03:15.857
what this SNC value is.

01:03:15.857 --> 01:03:18.190
Because the client is going
to include it in this packet

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.727
anyway.

01:03:18.727 --> 01:03:19.810
It wasn't relevant before.

01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:22.050
But it sort of is relevant now.

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:24.820
And we weren't going to
check it against anything.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:28.210
But it turns out to be
pretty much good enough.

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:29.770
It has some unfortunate
consequences.

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:33.785
Like if this is-- well,
there's some complicated things

01:03:33.785 --> 01:03:35.100
you might abuse here.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.330
But it doesn't seem
to be that bad.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.370
It seems certainly
better than the server

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:41.495
filling up its memory and
swapping serving requests

01:03:41.495 --> 01:03:43.370
all together.

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:45.630
And then we don't include
in this computation.

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:48.110
Because the only thing
we care about here

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.099
is offloaded the
storage of this table

01:03:50.099 --> 01:03:52.640
and making sure that the only
connections that eventually you

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.075
do get established are
legitimate clients.

01:03:56.075 --> 01:03:58.110
Because therefore,
we can say, well,

01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:00.990
if this client is establishing
a million connections to me,

01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:02.698
I'll stop accepting
connections from him.

01:04:02.698 --> 01:04:04.150
That's easy enough, finally.

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:06.710
The problem is that all
these source addresses,

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:09.180
if they're spoofed,
are hard to distinguish

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.630
from legitimate clients.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:12.580
Make sense?

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.530
Yeah.

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:15.612
AUDIENCE: Would you need
to store the timestamp?

01:04:15.612 --> 01:04:17.570
PROFESSOR: Ahh, so the
clever thing, the reason

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:20.280
this timestamp is sort
of on the slide here,

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.920
is that when we receive this
SNS value in step three,

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.190
we need to figure
out, how do you

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.690
compute the input
to this function F

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:28.951
to check whether it's correct?

01:04:28.951 --> 01:04:30.367
So actually, we
take the timestamp

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.510
from the end of the packet,
and we use that inside

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.512
of this computation.

01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:36.970
Everything else we
can reconstruct.

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:39.330
We know who just sent us
the third step and packet.

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.230
And we have all these fields.

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:43.542
And we have our key, which
is, again, still secret.

01:04:43.542 --> 01:04:46.000
And this timestamp just comes
from the end of the sequence,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.810
from the last 8 bits.

01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:51.040
And then it might
be that we'll reject

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.780
timestamps that are too old,
just disallow old connections.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:56.280
Yeah.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.492
AUDIENCE: So I'm guessing
the reason you only

01:04:57.492 --> 01:04:58.867
use this when
you're under attack

01:04:58.867 --> 01:05:01.160
is because you lose 8 bits
of security, or whatever?

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.630
PROFESSOR: Yes, it's not great.

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:04.120
It has many bad properties.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.668
One is you sort of lose 8 bits
of security in some sense.

01:05:07.668 --> 01:05:09.880
Because now the
unguessable part is just

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.250
24 bits instead of 32 bits.

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:18.750
Another problem is what happens
if you lose certain packets?

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:26.163
So if this packet is lost--
so it's typically, in TCP,

01:05:26.163 --> 01:05:28.580
there's someone responsible
for retransmitting something

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.540
if a particular packet is lost.

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.870
And in TCP, if the
third packet is lost,

01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:36.490
then the client might not
be waiting for anything.

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:39.040
Or sorry, maybe
the protocol we're

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.850
running on top of
this TCP connection

01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:42.308
is one where the
server is supposed

01:05:42.308 --> 01:05:43.900
to say something initially.

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.290
So I connect.

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:46.470
I just listen.

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:48.869
And in the SMTP, for
example, the server

01:05:48.869 --> 01:05:51.160
is supposed to send me some
sort of an initial greeting

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.370
in the protocol.

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:55.446
So OK, suppose I'm
connecting to an SMTP server.

01:05:55.446 --> 01:05:57.160
I send my third packet.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.120
I think I'm done.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.795
I'm just waiting for
the server to tell me,

01:06:00.795 --> 01:06:02.190
greetings as an SMTP server.

01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:04.316
Please send mail.

01:06:04.316 --> 01:06:05.440
This packet could get lost.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.340
And in real TCP, the
way this gets handled

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:12.540
is that the server from step
two remembers that, hey, I

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.860
sent this response.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.867
I never heard back,
this third thing.

01:06:15.867 --> 01:06:17.283
So it's the server
that's supposed

01:06:17.283 --> 01:06:19.829
to resend this packet
to trigger the client

01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:22.489
to resend this third packet.

01:06:22.489 --> 01:06:24.530
Of course, if the server
isn't storing any state,

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.660
it has no idea what to resend.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.720
So this actually makes
connection establishment

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.669
potentially
programmatic where you

01:06:31.669 --> 01:06:33.710
could enter this weird
state where both sides are

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:34.714
waiting for each other.

01:06:34.714 --> 01:06:36.130
Well, the server
doesn't even know

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:37.421
that it's waiting for anything.

01:06:37.421 --> 01:06:39.180
And the client is
waiting for the server.

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.138
And the server basically
dropped responsibility

01:06:41.138 --> 01:06:42.250
by not storing state.

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:44.512
So this is another
reason why you

01:06:44.512 --> 01:06:46.470
don't run this in production
mode all the time.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:47.216
Yeah.

01:06:47.216 --> 01:06:49.950
AUDIENCE: Presumably also you
could have data commissions

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:53.530
if you establish two very
short-lived connections right

01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:55.600
after each other
from the same host.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.105
PROFESSOR: Absolutely,
yeah, yeah.

01:06:56.105 --> 01:06:58.370
So another thing is, of
course, because we gave up

01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:01.340
on using this ISN
old style part,

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.080
we now give up
protection against

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.400
these multiple connections
in a short time period being

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.400
independent from one another.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.322
So I think there's a
number of trade-offs.

01:07:09.322 --> 01:07:10.770
We just talked about three.

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:12.830
There's several more
things you worry about.

01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:15.790
But it's not great.

01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:18.150
If we could design a protocol
from scratch to be better,

01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:21.390
we could just have a separate
nice 64-bit header for this

01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:23.001
and a 64-bit value for this.

01:07:23.001 --> 01:07:24.750
And then we could
enable this all the time

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.458
without giving up the
other stuff and all

01:07:26.458 --> 01:07:28.148
these nice things.

01:07:28.148 --> 01:07:28.648
Yeah.

01:07:28.648 --> 01:07:31.133
AUDIENCE: I just had one
quick question on the SNS.

01:07:31.133 --> 01:07:36.432
In step two, [INAUDIBLE],
do they have to be the same?

01:07:36.432 --> 01:07:37.821
PROFESSOR: This
SNS and this SNS?

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:38.750
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:41.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
because otherwise,

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.685
the server has no way to
conclude that this client got

01:07:45.685 --> 01:07:47.330
our packet.

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:51.020
If the server didn't check that
this SNS was the same value as

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.197
before, then these actually
would be even worse.

01:07:54.197 --> 01:07:56.405
Because I could fake a
connection from some arbitrary

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.810
IP address, then
get this response.

01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:00.362
Maybe I don't even
get it, because it

01:08:00.362 --> 01:08:01.320
goes to a different IP.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.114
Then I establish a connection
from some other IP address.

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:05.530
And then the server
is maintaining

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:06.812
a whole live connection.

01:08:06.812 --> 01:08:09.020
Probably a server crosses
another side waiting for me

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.800
to send data and so on.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.660
AUDIENCE: But the timestamp is
going to be different, right?

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.288
So how can the
server recalculate

01:08:15.288 --> 01:08:17.708
that with a new timestamp
and null the one before

01:08:17.708 --> 01:08:19.443
if it doesn't store any state?

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:21.859
PROFESSOR: So the way this
works is these timestamps, as I

01:08:21.859 --> 01:08:23.150
was saying, are course grained.

01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:24.899
So they're on a
scale of minutes.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:26.631
So if you connect
within the same minute,

01:08:26.631 --> 01:08:30.540
then you're in good shape.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.820
And if you connect on the
minute boundary, well, too bad.

01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.569
Yet another problem
with the scheme-- it's

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.155
imperfect in many ways.

01:08:37.155 --> 01:08:39.180
But most operating
systems, including Linux,

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:42.440
actually have ways of detecting
if there's too many entries

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.689
building up in this table
that aren't being completed.

01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:46.750
It switches to this
other scheme instead

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:48.590
to make sure it doesn't
overflow this table.

01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:49.071
Yeah.

01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:50.737
AUDIENCE: So if the
attacker has control

01:08:50.737 --> 01:08:53.400
of a lot of IP addresses,
and they do this,

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.324
and even if you
switch it the same--

01:08:55.324 --> 01:08:57.032
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
then actually there's

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.644
not much you can do.

01:08:58.644 --> 01:09:00.060
The reason that
we were so worried

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.560
about this scheme
in the first place

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.485
is because we wanted to
filter out or somehow

01:09:04.485 --> 01:09:06.828
distinguish between the
attacker and the good guys.

01:09:06.828 --> 01:09:09.290
And if the attacker
has more IP addresses

01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:11.420
and just controls more
machines than the good guys,

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:14.003
then he can just connect to our
server and request lots of web

01:09:14.003 --> 01:09:16.210
pages or maintain connections.

01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:18.100
And it's very hard
then for the server

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.060
to distinguish whether these
are legitimate clients or just

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.350
the attacker tying up
resources of the server.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:24.880
So you're absolutely right.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.170
This only addresses the
case where the attacker

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:29.060
has a small number
of IP addresses

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.130
and wants to amplify his effect.

01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:34.109
But it is a worry.

01:09:34.109 --> 01:09:38.819
And in fact, today it might
be that some attackers control

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:40.488
a large number of
compromised machines,

01:09:40.488 --> 01:09:42.529
like just desktop machines
of someone that didn't

01:09:42.529 --> 01:09:44.331
patch their machine correctly.

01:09:44.331 --> 01:09:46.580
And then they can just mount
denial of service attacks

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:48.960
from this distributed set of
machines all over the world.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.680
And that's pretty hard
to defend against.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.030
So another actually interesting
thing I want to mention

01:09:56.030 --> 01:10:02.200
is denial of service attacks,
but in the particular way

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.049
that other protocols
make them worse.

01:10:05.049 --> 01:10:07.340
I guess other protocols allow
denial of service attacks

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.131
in the first place.

01:10:08.131 --> 01:10:08.692
I'm sorry.

01:10:08.692 --> 01:10:11.150
But there are some that are
protocols that are particularly

01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:13.370
susceptible to abuse.

01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:16.510
And probably a good
example of that

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:19.150
is, again, this DNS protocol
that we were looking at before.

01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:21.890
So the DNS protocol--
we still have it

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:24.990
here-- involves the
client sending a request

01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:27.540
to the server and the server
sending a response back

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.300
to the client.

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:34.310
And in many cases, the response
is larger than the request.

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:36.890
The request could be just,
tell me about mit.edu.

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:38.710
And the response might
be all the records

01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:41.290
the server has about
mit.edu-- the email address,

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:44.660
the mail server for mit.edu,
the assigned record if it's

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.030
using DNS SEC, and so on.

01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:47.630
So the query might be 100 bytes.

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:50.946
The response could well
be over 1,000 bytes.

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:53.120
So suppose that
you want to flood

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.510
some guy with lots of
packets or lots of bandwidth.

01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:59.074
Well, you might
only be able to send

01:10:59.074 --> 01:11:00.240
a small amount of bandwidth.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.030
But what you could do is you
could fake queries to DNS

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:04.725
servers on behalf of that guy.

01:11:04.725 --> 01:11:06.170
So you only have
to send 100 bytes

01:11:06.170 --> 01:11:10.360
to some DNS server pretending to
be a query from that poor guy.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.880
And the DNS server is going
to send 1,000 bytes to him

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.260
on your behalf.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:17.920
So this is a problematic
feature of this protocol.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.510
Because it allows you to
amplify bandwidth attacks.

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:23.285
And partly for
the same reason we

01:11:23.285 --> 01:11:26.250
were talking about with
TCP's SYN flooding attacks,

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.740
it's very hard for the
server, for the DNS server,

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:32.110
in this case, to know whether
this request is valid or not.

01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:34.439
Because there's no
authentication or no sort

01:11:34.439 --> 01:11:35.980
of sequence number
exchanges going on

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:38.188
to tell that this is the
right guy connecting to you,

01:11:38.188 --> 01:11:39.520
et cetera.

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.450
So in fact this is still
a problem in DNS today.

01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:45.180
And it gets used
quite frequently

01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.730
to attack people with
bandwidth attacks.

01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:50.184
So if you have a certain
amount of bandwidth,

01:11:50.184 --> 01:11:51.600
you'll be that
much more effective

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.380
if you reflect your attack
off of a DNS server.

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.400
And these DNS servers are
very well provisioned.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.460
And they basically have
to respond to every query

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.127
out there.

01:12:00.127 --> 01:12:01.960
Because if they stop
responding to requests,

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.530
then probably some legitimate
requests are going to get

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:04.030
dropped.

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:05.846
So this is a big
problem in practice.

01:12:05.846 --> 01:12:06.346
Yeah.

01:12:06.346 --> 01:12:08.786
AUDIENCE: So if you can still
see it on the DNS server,

01:12:08.786 --> 01:12:15.140
[INAUDIBLE] requests
and never reply to--

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.820
PROFESSOR: Right, yeah, so
it's possible to maybe modify

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.757
the DNS server to keep some
sort of state like this.

01:12:20.757 --> 01:12:22.965
AUDIENCE: That's the reason
why this still works now,

01:12:22.965 --> 01:12:24.170
because they don't store state?

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:25.878
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well
I think some people

01:12:25.878 --> 01:12:29.015
are starting to modify DNS
server to try to store state.

01:12:29.015 --> 01:12:32.020
A lot of times, there's so
many DNS servers out there

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.520
that it doesn't matter.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.498
Even if you appear to do 10
queries against every DNS

01:12:37.498 --> 01:12:38.900
server, that's
still every packet

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:42.060
gets amplified by some
significant factor.

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:43.450
And they have to respond.

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:46.125
Because maybe that client really
is trying to issue this query.

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:47.000
So this is a problem.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.190
Yeah, so you're right, if
this was one DNS server,

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:51.170
then this would be maybe
not as big of a deal.

01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:53.870
The problem is also that
the root servers for DNS,

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.430
for example, aren't
a single machine.

01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:57.360
It's actually racks
and racks of servers.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.120
Because they're so heavily used.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.085
And trying to maintain a state
across all these machines

01:13:02.085 --> 01:13:03.430
is probably nontrivial.

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:05.850
So as it gets abused
more, probably it

01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:09.582
will be more worthwhile
to maintain this state.

01:13:09.582 --> 01:13:11.082
I guess a general
principle you want

01:13:11.082 --> 01:13:15.120
to follow in any
protocol-- well,

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.340
might be a good
principle-- is to make

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:19.855
the client do at least as much
work as the server is doing.

01:13:19.855 --> 01:13:22.450
So here, the problem is the
client isn't doing as much work

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:23.310
as the server.

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:27.280
That's why the server can help
the client amplify this effect.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.120
If you were redesigning
DNS from scratch,

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.970
and this was really
your big concern,

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:33.510
then it'd probably be fairly
straightforward to fix this.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:36.200
The client has to
send a request that

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.090
has extra padding bytes just
there just wasting bandwidth.

01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:42.610
And then the server is
going to respond back

01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:44.880
with a response that's
at most as big as that.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.400
And if you want a response
that's bigger, maybe

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.858
the server will say, sorry,
your padding wasn't big enough.

01:13:48.858 --> 01:13:49.780
Send me more padding.

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:53.300
And this way, you guarantee that
the DNS server cannot be used

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:58.676
ever to amplify these
kinds of bandwidth attacks.

01:13:58.676 --> 01:14:00.050
Actually, these
kinds of problems

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:02.390
happen also at higher
levels as well.

01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:04.660
So in web
applications, you often

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:07.505
have web services that do
lots and lots of computation

01:14:07.505 --> 01:14:08.825
on behalf of a single request.

01:14:08.825 --> 01:14:11.200
And there's often denial of
service attacks at that level

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.200
where adversaries know that
a certain operation is very

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.290
expensive, and they'll
just ask for that operation

01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:18.940
to be done over and over again.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:22.520
And unless you carefully design
your protocol and application

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.610
to allow the client
to prove that, oh, I'm

01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:28.670
burning at least as much work
as you, or something like this,

01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:32.803
then it's hard to defend
against these things as well.

01:14:32.803 --> 01:14:34.760
Make sense?

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.950
All right, so I
guess the last thing

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:38.990
I want to briefly touch
on about the paper

01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:41.150
we talked about as well
is these routing attacks.

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:43.120
And the reason these
attacks are interesting

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.740
is they're maybe popping up
a level above these protocol

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.200
transport level issues.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.710
And look at what goes
wrong in an application.

01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:52.960
And the routing protocol is
a particularly interesting

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.460
example.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:56.360
Because it's often
the place where

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.670
trust and sort of initial
configuration gets

01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:01.230
bootstrapped in the first place.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.200
And it's easy to sort
of get that wrong.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.800
And even today, there's not
great authentication mechanisms

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.790
for that.

01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:11.560
Perhaps the clearest
example is the DHCP protocol

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.660
that all of you guys use
when you open a computer

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.017
or connect to some
wireless or wired network.

01:15:16.017 --> 01:15:17.850
The computer just sends
out a packet saying,

01:15:17.850 --> 01:15:20.370
I want an IP address
and other stuff.

01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:23.900
And some DHCP server at MIT
typically receives that packet

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:27.957
and sends you back, here's an
IP address that you should use.

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:29.790
And also here's a DNS
server you should use,

01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:33.030
and other interesting
configuration data.

01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:35.980
And the problem is that the
DHCP request packet is just

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.990
broadcasting on the
local network trying

01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:39.040
to reach the DHCP server.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.350
Because you actually
don't know what

01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:41.934
the DHCP is going
to be ahead of time.

01:15:41.934 --> 01:15:44.433
You're just plugging into the
network, the first time you've

01:15:44.433 --> 01:15:45.310
been here, let's say.

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:47.970
And your client doesn't
know what else to do

01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:49.770
or who to trust.

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:52.890
And consequently, any
machine on the local network

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:54.660
could intercept
these DHCP requests

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.734
and respond back
with any IP address

01:15:56.734 --> 01:15:59.150
that the client could use, and
also maybe tell the client,

01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.525
hey you should use my DNS
server instead of the real one.

01:16:01.525 --> 01:16:03.774
And then you could intercept
those future DNS requests

01:16:03.774 --> 01:16:04.890
from the client and so on.

01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:06.900
That make sense?

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.640
So I think these protocols are
fairly tricky to get right.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.300
And on a global scale,
the protocols like BGP

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.940
allow any participant to
announce a particular IP

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:18.505
address prefix for the
world to sort of know about

01:16:18.505 --> 01:16:21.200
and route packets
toward the attacker.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:25.053
There's certainly been attacks
where some router participating

01:16:25.053 --> 01:16:29.546
in BGP says, oh,
I'm a very quick way

01:16:29.546 --> 01:16:31.409
to reach this particular
IP address range.

01:16:31.409 --> 01:16:32.950
And then all the
routers in the world

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:36.090
say, OK, sure, we'll send
those packets to you.

01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:40.330
And probably the most
frequent abuse of this

01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:42.432
is by spammers who
want to send spam,

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:44.720
but their old IP addresses
are blacklisted everywhere,

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.000
because they are sending spam.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.910
So they just pick some
random IP address.

01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:50.332
They announce that, oh yeah,
this IP address is now here.

01:16:50.332 --> 01:16:52.290
And then they sort of
announce this IP address,

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:54.080
send spam from it,
and then disconnect.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.935
And it gets abused a
fair amount this way.

01:16:57.935 --> 01:17:00.382
It's sort of getting less now.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:01.590
But it's kind of hard to fix.

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:04.560
Because in order
to fix it, you have

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.434
to know whether someone really
owns that IP address or not.

01:17:07.434 --> 01:17:09.100
And it's hard to do
without establishing

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:12.100
some global database of,
maybe, cryptographic keys

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.890
for every ISP in the world.

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:16.510
And it takes quite a
bit of effort by someone

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:18.080
to build this database.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.640
The same actually applies
to DNS SEC as well.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.350
In order to know which
signature to look for in DNS,

01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:25.690
you have to have a
cryptographic key associated

01:17:25.690 --> 01:17:27.420
with every entity in the world.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.677
And it's not there now.

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:30.010
Maybe it'll get built up slowly.

01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:34.910
But it's certainly one big
problem for adopting DNS SEC.

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:37.542
All right, so I guess the
thing to take away from this

01:17:37.542 --> 01:17:39.500
is maybe just a bunch of
lessons about what not

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.200
to do in general in protocols.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.074
But also actually one
thing I want to mention

01:17:43.074 --> 01:17:46.307
is that while probably
secrecy and integrity are

01:17:46.307 --> 01:17:48.390
good properties and driving
force of higher levels

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:50.637
of abstraction, like in
cryptographic protocols

01:17:50.637 --> 01:17:53.220
in the application-- and we'll
look at that in next lectures--

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.303
one thing that you really
do want from the network

01:17:55.303 --> 01:17:57.384
is some sort of availability
and DOS resistance.

01:17:57.384 --> 01:17:59.050
Because these properties
are much harder

01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:00.850
to achieve at higher
levels in the stack.

01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:02.266
So you really want
to avoid things

01:18:02.266 --> 01:18:04.710
like maybe these
amplification attacks, maybe

01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:09.250
these SYN flooding attacks,
maybe these RST attacks

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.680
where you can shoot down an
arbitrary person's connection.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.096
These are things that are
really damaging at the low level

01:18:14.096 --> 01:18:16.190
and that are hard
to fix higher up.

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:19.155
But the integrity and
confidentiality you

01:18:19.155 --> 01:18:20.780
can more or less
solve with encryption.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.310
And we'll talk about how we
do that in the next lecture

01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:23.910
on Cerberus.

01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:25.760
See you guys then.
