00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.110
PROFESSOR: All right,
let's get started.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.490
So today we're going to
talk about the system called

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.340
Native Client, which is
actually a real world

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.779
system used by Google.

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:42.070
One example, they actually
use it in the Chrome browser

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.290
to allow web applications to
run arbitrary native code.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.070
It's actually a
pretty cool system,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.560
and it's also an illustration.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.900
Another isolation or sort
of sandboxing or privilege

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.320
separation technique,
that's called software fault

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.850
isolation, doesn't rely
on operating systems

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.130
to sandbox a process
or virtual machines.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.330
But instead, it has a
very different approach

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.830
to looking at the particular
instructions in a binary,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.390
to figure out whether it's
going to be safe to run or not.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.900
So before we I
guess start looking

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.000
at the technical details of
the system, let's figure out,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.960
why do these guys actually
want to run native code?

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.580
So the particular
context they are

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.980
interested in applying
their solution to

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.420
is a web browser,
where you can already

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.750
run JavaScript code and
maybe Flash, and maybe

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.510
a couple of other things.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.070
Why are these guys so excited
about running raw x86?

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.758
It seems like a step backwards.

00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:38.590
AUDIENCE: Really
fast computation.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.006
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's one
huge advantage of native code.

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:43.560
Even though it might be
unsafe from some perspectives,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.210
it's really high performance.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.245
And whatever you can
do in JavaScript,

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:49.870
presumably you could just write
the same thing and assemble it,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.900
and it'll go at least as
fast-- probably much faster.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.650
Any other reasons?

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.395
Yeah?

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:56.562
AUDIENCE: Run existing code?

00:01:56.562 --> 00:01:57.228
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:01:57.228 --> 00:01:58.610
So another big
thing is maybe not

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.110
everything is written
in JavaScript.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.090
So if you have an
existing application--

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.664
I guess 'legacy' in
industry terminology--

00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:08.580
if you have some existing
code that you really

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.774
want to run in
the web, then this

00:02:10.774 --> 00:02:11.940
seems like a great solution.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.530
Because you could just
take an existing library,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.485
like some complicated graphics
processing engine that's

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:20.050
both performance sensitive
and lots of complicated stuff

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.550
you don't want to
re-implement, then

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.677
this seems like a good solution.

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:26.260
Anything else-- if you're just
like programming a new web app,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.460
should you use
Native Client if you

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.910
don't care about legacy
or performance so much?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.240
Any other reasons?

00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:38.550
I guess another-- yeah?

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.990
AUDIENCE: You don't
have to use JavaScript.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.227
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
an awesome reason, right?

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:43.810
If you don't like
JavaScript, then you

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.590
don't have to use it, right?

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.140
You can actually use, well,
C, if you are so inclined.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.680
You could run Python code,
you could write Haskell,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.910
whatever you think is useful.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.400
You could actually support
other languages all of a sudden.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.490
So this is a reasonably
compelling list of-- motivation

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.700
for them to run native
code in the browser,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.389
and it turns out to be
reasonably tricky to get right.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.430
And we'll look at the
technical details, I guess,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.100
of how it works in a second.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.730
But just to show you guys what
this paper is talking about,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.760
I just want to show a
very simple tutorial demo

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.410
almost that I got out of
their Native Client website.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.850
It's fairly simple as it turns
out to just take a C++ or a C

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.130
program and run in the browser.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.970
So just to show you
what this looks like,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.640
here's basically a demo
I mostly sort of took

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.600
from one of their examples.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.110
So you can look at a web page
like this index HTML file.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.360
And inside of it, you have
a bunch of JavaScript code.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.620
And the reason this
JavaScript code exists

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.710
is to sort of interact with
the Native Client piece.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.810
So the way you can sort of think
of this running in the browser

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.904
is that you have the
browser-- well, we'll

00:03:53.904 --> 00:03:55.570
talk much more about
web security later,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.320
but roughly you have some
sort of a page, web page that

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.540
contains some JavaScript code.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.310
And this runs with
the pages privileges.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.160
And this can do various
things to the web page

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.140
itself, maybe talk to the
network in some circumstances.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.080
But what Native Client
allows you to do

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.060
is to have this Native
Client module running

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.471
sort of to the side in
the browser as well.

00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:20.970
And the JavaScript
code can actually

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.600
interact with the Native Client
module and get responses back.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.440
And what you see
here in this web page

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.140
is the little bit
of JavaScript code

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.980
that's necessary
in Native Client

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.060
to interract with the
particular NaCl module

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.920
that we're going to be running.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.300
And you can send
messages to this module.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.540
The way you do it is you
take this module object

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.440
in JavaScript, and you
call it postMessage.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.530
And you could actually
supply a message

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.560
to send to the
Native Client module.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.430
And when the Native
Client module responds,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.751
it'll run this handle message
function in JavaScript.

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.250
And in this particular
case, it just

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.080
pops up and alerts
dialog box in my browser.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.270
So it's a fairly simple
interface from the web page

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.589
side, from the JavaScript side.

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:04.630
And the only thing you
additional you have to do,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.560
is you actually have to
declare this Native Client

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.210
module this way.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.489
So you just say embed
module with a particular ID.

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:14.030
And the sort of most
interesting part

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.290
is this source equals Hello.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.230
some NMF barch attribute.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.710
And this one just says, well
here's the roughly executable

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.220
file that you need to
load and start running

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.230
in the native side of things.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.880
And this native code actually
looks like any other C++ code

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.230
you might write roughly.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.290
So here's the program.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.620
The interesting part is roughly
this handle message function.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.380
So this is a C++ class, and
whenever the JavaScript code

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.510
sends some message
to the native code,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.230
it'll actually
run this function.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.800
And it'll check if the message
that's being sent is hello.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.310
And if so, construct a
reply string of some sort

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.809
and send it back.

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:53.850
It's fairly simple stuff.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.420
But just to be
concrete, let's try

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.300
to run it and see what happens.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.360
So we can actually build
it, and run a little web

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.850
server that is going serve up
this page and Native Client

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.950
module.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.850
So here I can go to
this URL and here we go.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.640
Right, it's actually
loaded in the module.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.681
The module seems to have
gotten our hello message

00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:17.436
from JavaScript.

00:06:17.436 --> 00:06:19.720
It replied back with the
string back to JavaScript.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.600
And the JavaScript code
popped up a dialog box

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.390
containing that response.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.710
So it actually
does kind of work.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.680
We can try to see if we could
crash Native Client-- hopefully

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.690
not, but we can take this
code and we have this buffer.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.890
We could write a
bunch of As to it--

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.020
I don't know, quite a
lot-- and see what happens.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.970
So hopefully this
shouldn't crash my browser,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.760
because Native Client is
trying to provide isolation.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.740
But let's see what happens.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.930
So we can rebuild it,
rerun the web server.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.037
And here if you run
it, nothing happens.

00:06:57.037 --> 00:06:58.620
We don't get the
message back anymore,

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.224
so clearly the
message didn't get

00:07:00.224 --> 00:07:01.890
sent back from the
Native Client module,

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.150
because I don't see any popup.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.980
We can look at the
JavaScript console here,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.920
and we can see that the
Native Client module tells us

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.270
NaCl module crash.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.250
So somehow it caught this
buffer flow scribbling

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.940
over some memory, or maybe
it jumped to some bad address

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.780
containing all As.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.110
But any case, the
Native Client module

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.850
is actually able to contain
this without this arbitrary

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.170
sort of memory corruption
in the module affecting

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.620
the rest of the browser.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.150
So this is roughly just a quick
demo of what the system is,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:38.209
and how you use it as an
end user or web developer.

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:39.500
So let's look now at some more.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.380
So that's all in terms of
demos I have to show you.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.770
So let's look more now at how a
Native Client is going to work,

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.400
or perhaps even why we need this
particular design as opposed

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.050
to some of the alternatives.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.384
So if your goal, I guess
is to sandbox native code,

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.300
there's a number of
alternatives you can make.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.716
People actually
had these problems

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:04.640
before, performance
existing legacy code

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.780
and other languages before
Native Client came around.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.960
And people just solved
them in different ways

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.540
that maybe weren't as satisfying
from a security standpoint

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.570
or usability standpoint
as Native Client.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.649
But it is doable.

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:20.190
So let's see.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.606
So what could you
do if you really

00:08:21.606 --> 00:08:25.020
want to run native
code in a browser?

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.974
So one option that people did
was to trust the developer.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.500
And maybe a variant
of this approach

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.870
is to ask the user whether they
want to run some piece of code

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.420
in their browser or not.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.920
So does everybody
understand roughly

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.920
what the plan is, right?

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.660
Like instead of having that
whole Native Client compilation

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.710
strategy, I could
have just built

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.700
a simple C program, served
it up on the browser,

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.030
and maybe the
browser asked, do you

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.238
want to run this site or not?

00:08:57.238 --> 00:08:59.270
If I click yes,
then it accidentally

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.550
scribbled over the browser's
memory and crashes the browser.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.860
So it's possible, right?

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.360
It certainly solves
all these goals,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.980
but what's wrong with it?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.180
Well, I guess there's the
insecurity part, which

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.560
is unfortunate.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.340
One way to potentially get
around this-- and some systems

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:15.840
did.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.720
Like Microsoft had
the system called

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.190
ActiveX, that basically
implemented this plan.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.410
You could serve binaries to IE,
the browser on your machine.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.400
And as long as it came
with a certificate

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.860
from particular developer
signed by let's say

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.345
Microsoft or someone
else, then it

00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:35.329
would actually run this code.

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:37.620
What do you guys think about
this plan, is this useful?

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.496
Yeah?

00:09:38.496 --> 00:09:39.412
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.000
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.160
So right, you really have
to put quite a bit of trust

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.990
into whoever it is
that's signing this,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.280
that they will only
sign binaries that

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.954
will not to do something bad.

00:09:55.954 --> 00:09:57.870
But it's kind of vague
what this bad thing is.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.619
And presumably they're
just writing C code

00:09:59.619 --> 00:10:04.250
and signing it blindly without
doing a huge amount of work.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.480
In which case, you might well
be susceptible to some problems

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.210
down the line.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.762
What if we ask the user?

00:10:10.762 --> 00:10:11.734
Yeah?

00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:12.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:17.530
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.970
Like the user's goal
is to run this thing.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.180
And even if the user wants to
be cautious, it's actually not

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.700
clear how should
the user decide?

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.410
Suppose I really
want to understand,

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.192
should I allow this
program to run?

00:10:29.192 --> 00:10:30.650
All it tells me is
well, maybe it's

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.358
created from Google.com
or Microsoft.com,

00:10:32.358 --> 00:10:34.590
and its file name as foo.exe.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.587
I don't know, like
what's in there?

00:10:37.587 --> 00:10:39.170
Even if I dissemble
the code, it might

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.794
be very hard to tell
whether it's going

00:10:40.794 --> 00:10:42.310
to do something bad or not.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.270
So it's actually
really hard to decide.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.980
So one way to think
of Native Client

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.722
is it's a mechanism by
which users can actually

00:10:48.722 --> 00:10:50.680
get some confidence
whether they should say yes

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.888
or not to running this thing.

00:10:51.888 --> 00:10:54.045
So in practice, I guess
like Paul Young, who

00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:55.670
was giving his guest
lecture last week,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.400
and he suggested that you
should enable this click

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.566
to play extension in Chrome.

00:10:58.566 --> 00:11:00.550
So every extension,
including Native Client,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.209
you should rush click on this
thing before it starts running.

00:11:03.209 --> 00:11:04.750
So in some ways,
that's ask the user.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.080
But then the user
actually has some sense,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.130
that well, if I click
it, I'm still hopefully

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.630
safe in the sense that Native
Client will protect me.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.210
So the two aren't
necessarily exclusive,

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.640
but you really want
some technical guarantee

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.300
from Native Client that ensures
that even if you say yes,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.290
there are something
meaningful that

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.210
isn't enforcing your security.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.440
So does this make sense?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.410
OK.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.340
So the other I guess approach
that people have taken,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:37.443
is to use an OS or hardware
sandboxing, or isolation.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.470
So this is things we looked at
in the last couple of lectures.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.800
So maybe you would use
Unix, isolation mechanisms.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.790
Maybe if you had something
more sophisticated,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.289
if you're running
a free [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:53.289 --> 00:11:54.790
maybe you would use Capsicum.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.060
It seems very well suited to
sandboxing some piece of code.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.450
Because you can give it very
few capabilities, and then

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.070
it seems great.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.380
And Linux has a similar
mechanism called Seccomp

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.420
that we briefly touched on in
the last lecture, that could

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.844
allow you to do similar things.

00:12:09.844 --> 00:12:11.425
So it seems like
there is already

00:12:11.425 --> 00:12:15.410
a mechanism for writing code
in isolation on your machine.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.810
Why are these guys opposed to
using this existing solution?

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.130
Then they are like reinventing
the wheel for some reason.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.110
So what's going on?

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.110
Yeah?

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.110
Oh yeah?

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.925
AUDIENCE: Maybe they want
to minimize the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:29.925 --> 00:12:31.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so in
some sense, maybe they

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.429
don't want to trust
the operating system.

00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:36.220
So maybe they're here,
and they're actually

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.430
worried about OS bugs.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.410
It might be that the previous
dekernel, the Linux kernel,

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.000
has quite a lot of C code
written that they don't want

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.680
to audit for
correctness, or maybe

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.263
can't even audit for
correctness, even

00:12:49.263 --> 00:12:50.360
if they wanted to.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.549
And in one of these Capsicum or
Seccomp based isolation plan,

00:12:54.549 --> 00:12:56.840
you probably do trust quite
a bit of code in the kernel

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.176
to be correct, for the sandbox
to actually hold and enforce

00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:00.910
isolation.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.370
Yeah?

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.105
AUDIENCE: As you get a lot more
ways to use browsers and stuff,

00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:08.620
like you'd have to deal with
having some sort of thing

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.612
you're doing with it on
like iOS and Android,

00:13:10.612 --> 00:13:12.420
and all these other
things, accessing--

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so it's actually

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.595
another interesting
consideration

00:13:14.595 --> 00:13:17.200
is that normally
my OSes have bugs.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.450
But actually the
OSs are incompatible

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.520
with each other in some
ways, meaning that each OS

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.986
has it's own-- like right here.

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:26.235
Well, there's Unix, there's
Capsicum, there's Seccomp,

00:13:26.235 --> 00:13:27.290
but this is just
a Unix variances.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.920
There's Mac OS seatbelt,
there's Windows something else,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.970
and the list just
keeps going on and on.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.920
So as a result,
every platform you

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.750
will have to use a different
isolation mechanism.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.480
And the thing that
actually bothers them

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.146
is not so much that they'll have
to write different code for Mac

00:13:42.146 --> 00:13:43.390
and Windows and Linux.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.510
But more of that, this impacts
how you write the thing

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.747
inside of the sandbox.

00:13:48.747 --> 00:13:50.330
Because in Native
Client, you actually

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.140
write a piece of code
that runs the same way,

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.580
or it's the same piece of code
the runs on Apple or Windows

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.420
or Linux systems.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.655
And if you use these
isolation mechanisms,

00:14:00.655 --> 00:14:02.790
they actually impose
different restrictions

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.440
on the program being sandboxed.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.840
So you'll have to write
one program that's

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.560
going to run inside
of a Linux sandbox,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.296
another program inside of a
Windows sandbox, and so on.

00:14:11.296 --> 00:14:13.400
So this is actually
not acceptable to them.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.202
They don't want to deal with
these kinds of problems.

00:14:17.202 --> 00:14:20.620
So are there other
considerations?

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.692
Yeah?

00:14:21.692 --> 00:14:23.400
AUDIENCE: Presumably
performance as well.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.890
Because if you say
Capsicum, you need

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.510
to fork up a set of
[INAUDIBLE], or whatever

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.370
is running inside the sandbox.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.135
With here, they can actually
run it in the same [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:34.135 --> 00:14:34.830
PROFESSOR: That's true, yeah.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.440
So potentially the
approach they take,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.880
the software fault
isolation plan

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.840
is actually highly
performant, and could

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.517
outperform these
sandboxes at the OS level.

00:14:43.517 --> 00:14:44.975
It turns out that
in Native Client,

00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:49.390
they actually use both their
sandbox and the OS sandbox,

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.110
just for extra
precaution for safety.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.122
So they don't actually
win on performance

00:14:54.122 --> 00:14:56.080
in their implementation,
but they could, right.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:56.627
Yeah?

00:14:56.627 --> 00:14:58.710
AUDIENCE: There is some
like control aspect to it.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.834
Because it can control what
happens in the browser,

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:04.132
but if they sent one out to the
client's machine into their OS,

00:15:04.132 --> 00:15:05.590
they sort of don't
necessarily know

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.990
what might be happening to it?

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.930
PROFESSOR: So I
guess maybe one way

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.630
to think of that is that
yeah, the OS might have bugs,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.710
or my OS might not do as good
of a job at sandboxing it.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.310
Or maybe the interface
is a little different,

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.743
so you don't know what
the OS is going to expose.

00:15:20.743 --> 00:15:22.617
AUDIENCE: So it doesn't
like prevent the code

00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:24.655
from doing some bad things.

00:15:24.655 --> 00:15:26.447
Like there are a lot
of cases of bad things

00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:27.988
that the code can
just do, like maybe

00:15:27.988 --> 00:15:29.910
you want to statically
analyze the distance,

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.034
but they both sit in a loop
and then not allow that

00:15:32.034 --> 00:15:32.949
as a valid program.

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:34.240
PROFESSOR: So you could, right?

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.280
So their approach is quite
powerful in the sense

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.090
that you could try to look
for various kinds of problems

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.740
in the code like maybe
infinite loops, et cetera.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.480
It's hard to decide, kind
of like the holding problem,

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.740
whether it's going to have
infinite loops or not.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.390
But in principle, you might be
able to catch some problems.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.812
I think one actually interesting
example that I almost

00:15:53.812 --> 00:15:55.270
didn't realize this
sort of existed

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.936
before reading this
paper, is these guys

00:15:56.936 --> 00:16:00.255
are worried about hardware bugs
as well, that not only are they

00:16:00.255 --> 00:16:01.880
worried that the
operating system might

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.870
have vulnerabilities that the
motions code will exploit.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.300
But also that the
processor itself

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.000
has some instructions
that will hang it,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.250
or it'll reboot your machine.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.850
And in principle, your hardware
shouldn't have such bug,

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.440
because the operating system
relies on the hardware

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.290
to trap into the kernel if
there's anything bad executing

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.650
user mode, so that the operating
system can take care of it.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.280
But experimentally, it
turns out that processors

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.129
are so complicated
that they do have bugs,

00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:32.670
and these guys
actually say, well, we

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.705
actually found some
evidence that this happens.

00:16:34.705 --> 00:16:37.760
If you have some complicated
instruction that the CPU wasn't

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.965
expecting, the CPU will
actually halt instead

00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:42.950
of trapping to the kernel.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:43.960
This seems bad.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.290
But I guess it's not a
disastrous, if I'm sort of only

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.560
running reasonable
things on my laptop.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.430
But it is bad if you visit
some web page and your computer

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.300
hangs.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.130
So they want basically
a stronger level

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.810
of protection for these Native
Client modules than what

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.410
you would get out of sort
of an OS level isolation,

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.147
even from a hardware
[INAUDIBLE] bug standpoint.

00:17:04.147 --> 00:17:05.480
So they're actually pretty cool.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.450
They're like really
paranoid about security,

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.612
including hardware problems.

00:17:12.612 --> 00:17:15.140
All right, so any questions
about all these alternatives,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.400
how that works, or
why these guys are not

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.454
excited about that?

00:17:19.454 --> 00:17:21.496
Makes sense?

00:17:21.496 --> 00:17:22.700
All right.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.990
So I guess let's
try to look at now,

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:30.566
how Native Client does actually
decide to sandbox processes.

00:17:30.566 --> 00:17:34.760
Let me pull up these boards.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.340
So Native Client takes
this different approach

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.070
that's in general called
software fault isolation.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.630
And the plan is actually
not rely on the operating

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.500
system or hardware to
check things at runtime,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.000
but instead to somehow look at
the instructions ahead of time,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.950
and decide that there are always
going to be safe to execute.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.350
So actually look at
the binary, and you

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.610
check all the
possible instructions

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.480
to see whether they're going
to be safe instructions

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.660
or unsafe instructions.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.960
And once you've decided that
it's all going to be safe,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.050
you can just jump in
and start executing.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.970
Because you know it's all
composed of safe things,

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.850
so it cannot go wrong.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.800
So we'll talk about
exactly what this means.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.130
But roughly what
they're going to do is,

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.000
they're going to look at
pretty much every instruction

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.050
in the binary code that is
served up to the browser.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.290
And they're going to decide
that particular instructions are

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.872
going to be safe or unsafe.

00:18:41.872 --> 00:18:43.455
What do they do for
safe instructions?

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:46.010
Well, they're just
going to allow them.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.315
What's an example of
a safe instruction?

00:18:48.315 --> 00:18:51.260
What are they thinking of that
don't need any extra checks

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.432
or protections, et cetera?

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.424
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:57.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so like
any kind of ALU operation.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.730
Basically you have
math, presumably

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.840
moves between
registers and so on.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.490
So this doesn't actually affect
the security of the system,

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.410
as far as they're concerned.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.600
Because all they
really care about

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.045
is things like memory safety,
where what code you execute,

00:19:11.045 --> 00:19:12.321
and so on.

00:19:12.321 --> 00:19:14.445
So as long as you are just
computing on some stuff,

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:16.120
and registers, they
don't really care.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.660
It's not going to affect
the rest of the browser.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.350
So what about unsafe operations?

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.960
I guess these are
things that they

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.330
might care much more about.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:29.740
So this anything that maybe
does a memory access, or maybe

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:34.400
some privileged instruction,
maybe invoking a system

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.670
call on this machine.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.450
Maybe trying to jump out of
the sandbox, who knows what?

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.450
So for these kinds
of instructions,

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.180
they are going to do
one of two things.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.090
If the instruction actually is
necessary for the application

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.922
to do it's job, like accessing
memory seems important,

00:19:52.922 --> 00:19:55.430
then they're going
to somehow make sure

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.650
that they can execute this
unsafe instruction safely.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.300
Or if you're jumping around
for example in the program's

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.425
address space, [INAUDIBLE]
what they're going to do

00:20:04.425 --> 00:20:07.048
is somehow instrument
the instruction.

00:20:07.048 --> 00:20:09.050
And what instrumenting
the instruction means

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.006
is that you used to have
one unsafe instruction that

00:20:12.006 --> 00:20:14.630
sometimes does good things, that
the application might actually

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.960
want to do legitimately.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.620
And sometimes the instruction
can do bad things.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.722
So what instrumenting
it means is

00:20:20.722 --> 00:20:22.680
that you add some extra
instructions before it,

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.240
that it'll check or enforce,
but only good things

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.383
are going to happen
with that instruction.

00:20:28.383 --> 00:20:30.850
So for example, if you are
accessing a memory location,

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.267
which you could
do-- it turns out,

00:20:32.267 --> 00:20:34.016
they don't do it for
performance reasons--

00:20:34.016 --> 00:20:36.030
but one way to instrument
a memory access would

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.040
be to put some
checks, like an if

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.050
statement before the
instructions, saying, well,

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.660
is this address you're
accessing in range of what's

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.660
allowed for this module?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.554
And if so, do that--
otherwise, exit.

00:20:46.554 --> 00:20:48.220
So that would instrument
an instruction.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.370
And that would turn
an unsafe instruction

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.110
into one that's always
safe to execute,

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.020
because there's always
that check in front of it.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.020
So does that make sense?

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.940
This is their sort of
big idea for running

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.830
this enforcing safety without
support from that operating

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.050
system at some level.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.880
And I guess for other
unsafe instructions,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.330
they don't instrument
all of them.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:09.990
Some of them they
actually prohibit,

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.425
if they believe that this
is an instruction that's

00:21:12.425 --> 00:21:14.830
not really necessary
during normal operation,

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.875
and if an application
tried to run it,

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:18.780
we should just kill
the application

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.450
or not allow it to run
in the first place.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.150
Makes sense?

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.840
Those are their sort of big plan
for software fault isolation.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.480
And once you've checked
the application's binary,

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.214
and it all passes,
and everything

00:21:32.214 --> 00:21:33.630
seems to be properly
instrumented,

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.690
then you can just run the
program and off it goes.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.115
And by definition
almost, it will not

00:21:39.115 --> 00:21:41.630
do bad things, if we
do all these checks

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.310
and instrumentation [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.010
And I guess there's one more
part to the software fault

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.090
isolation story, which
is that once you've

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.650
make sure that
everything is safe,

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.470
then it can't actually
do anything terribly

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.570
interesting, other than
compute stuff in it's

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:56.502
own little memory.

00:21:56.502 --> 00:21:58.876
So it can't access the network,
it can't access the disk,

00:21:58.876 --> 00:22:01.640
it can't access your browser,
display, keyboard, almost

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.580
anything.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.770
So pretty much every software
fault isolation story,

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.630
there's actually also some
trusted service runtime.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.370
And this trusted
runtime is going

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.869
to not be subject to these
checks on it's instructions.

00:22:18.869 --> 00:22:20.410
So the trusted
runtime could actually

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.034
do all these potentially
unsafe things.

00:22:22.034 --> 00:22:23.980
But this trusted runtime
is written by Google.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.940
So hopefully they
get a [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.990
And it's going to
implement all the functions

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.530
that Google's Native
Client team believes

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.690
are OK throughout
for these modules.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.420
So these are going to be
things like maybe allocated

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:42.020
memory, maybe creating
a thread, maybe

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.910
communicating with
the browser as we

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:49.900
saw-- so some sort of a message
passing system, et cetera.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.310
And the way it's going to be
exposed to this isolated module

00:22:54.310 --> 00:23:00.730
is through certain presumably
special jumps or operations

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.980
that the module is going
to perform to transition

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.180
control into this
trusted runtime,

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.195
but hopefully in a very
predictable way to-- question?

00:23:11.195 --> 00:23:12.736
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious about, you

00:23:12.736 --> 00:23:16.432
have to design this application,
knowing that it's going

00:23:16.432 --> 00:23:18.566
to be sent to the NaCl module?

00:23:18.566 --> 00:23:21.458
Or does it like change
the code to [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:23.386
making the [INAUDIBLE]
sort of stuff bad?

00:23:23.386 --> 00:23:27.540
PROFESSOR: So I think if you
are building an application,

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.550
you do have to be sort
of aware that it's

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.580
going to be running
inside of Native Client.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.610
So some function calls like
malloc or pthread_create,

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.005
I think they just transparently
are placed with calls

00:23:39.005 --> 00:23:40.670
to their trusted runtime.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.760
But if you do anything
like opening a file

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.830
by path name, or anything
else that sort of you

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.790
would expect to do
on a Unix machine,

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.640
that you would probably have
to replace with something else.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.800
And you'd probably want
to structure your thing

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.341
to interact at least a little
bit with your JavaScript or web

00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:56.150
page in some way.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.160
And that you would have to do
by explicitly doing some message

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.420
passing or RPCs into
the JavaScript part.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.890
So that you would have
to probably change.

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.620
So there are some-- it's not
like you can run an arbitrary

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.660
Unix program in there, and
you'll just sort of get a shell

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.599
and you can run commands
all of a sudden.

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:15.140
Probably if you
tried hard, maybe you

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.170
could create such
an environment.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.110
But by default,
you probably have

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.886
to make it operate inside
of this web page, and then

00:24:22.886 --> 00:24:23.386
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:23.386 --> 00:24:25.866
Does that make sense?

00:24:25.866 --> 00:24:28.346
All right.

00:24:28.346 --> 00:24:29.350
OK.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.885
So that's the overall plan
software fault isolation.

00:24:32.885 --> 00:24:34.260
So I guess let's
look at actually

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.440
what safety means in their
case for Native Client.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.710
So we talked loosely
about this notion

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.290
of safe instructions, unsafe
instructions-- what do

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.070
they actually care about here?

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.700
So as far as I can
tell for Native Client,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.440
safety basically
means two things.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:57.040
One is that there's no
disallowed instructions

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.050
that it can execute.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.610
And these disallowed
instructions

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:07.430
are things like maybe
system calls or triggering

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.280
an interop, which is another
mechanism on x86 to jump

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.310
into the kernel and
invoke a system call,

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.520
and probably other
privileged instructions that

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.520
would allow you to escape
out of the sandbox.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.970
We'll look a little
bit more later

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.428
at what instructions
could actually

00:25:20.428 --> 00:25:23.420
let you jump out of a sandbox.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.320
And in addition to this no
disallowed instructions rule,

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:33.900
they also want to make sure that
all code and data accesses are

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.670
in bounds for the module.

00:25:39.602 --> 00:25:41.310
So what this means,
is that they actually

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.230
dedicate a particular part
of the program's address

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.150
space-- specifically
it goes from zero up

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:51.250
to 256 megs in the process.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.570
And everything that this
untrusted module does

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.950
has to refer to locations
within this chunk of memory

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.812
in the program.

00:26:00.812 --> 00:26:02.270
All right, so just
to double check.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.910
So why do they want to
disallow these instructions?

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.785
So what if they fail to
disallow the instructions?

00:26:09.785 --> 00:26:10.285
Yeah?

00:26:10.285 --> 00:26:12.575
AUDIENCE: The module can
manipulate the system.

00:26:12.575 --> 00:26:14.700
PROFESSOR: Right, so that's
fairly straightforward,

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.283
exactly, yeah.

00:26:15.283 --> 00:26:17.040
So it can just directly
reboot the machine

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.625
or open your home directory
and enumerate all the files,

00:26:19.625 --> 00:26:20.740
and do all these things.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.720
So that seems like
a good thing to do.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.190
Why do they care
about this plan,

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.140
like isolating the coded
data to only access

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.174
these low addresses?

00:26:30.174 --> 00:26:31.840
What goes wrong if
they fail to do that?

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:36.960
Yeah?

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.376
AUDIENCE: Then they can sort
of accessing and interrupting

00:26:39.376 --> 00:26:42.004
[INAUDIBLE] module
on the computer.

00:26:42.004 --> 00:26:42.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.275
AUDIENCE: We don't care if
they ruin their own program

00:26:45.275 --> 00:26:46.010
and it crashes.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:48.301
That's fine, as long as it's
not going to crash the key

00:26:48.301 --> 00:26:49.900
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so in
some sense, that's true.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.080
But in their case, they
actually run the thing

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.250
in a separate process.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.080
So in theory, this would only
crash that extra process.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.330
I think that I guess what
they're really worried about

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.290
is that this is a
necessary condition

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.260
to ensure this no disallowed
instructions in some way,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.540
because there's other
stuff, like this trusted

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.470
runtime in your process.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.440
So if what you really
care about is not

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.030
corrupting the rest
of your computer,

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.150
then if the untrusted
module can arbitrarily

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.100
jump into the trusted
service runtime

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.460
and do anything that the
trusted service runtime can do,

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.582
then they could sort of
violate this property.

00:27:24.582 --> 00:27:27.040
So in some ways, this is really
like a supporting mechanism

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.000
for enforcing that.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.670
In principle, this could also
be used for lighter weight

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.200
isolation if you could run
this Native Client module

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.320
inside of the browser
process itself, and not

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.812
start an extra process.

00:27:40.812 --> 00:27:42.520
But it turns out for
performance reasons,

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.150
they really have to
tie down the module

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.360
to this particular
range of memory,

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.310
or it has to start
at zero anyway.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:49.810
So this means that
you can only have

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.812
one really Native Client
untrusted module per process.

00:27:52.812 --> 00:27:55.020
So you probably are going
to start a separate process

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.956
anyway.

00:27:56.956 --> 00:27:58.408
Makes sense?

00:27:58.408 --> 00:27:59.376
Any questions?

00:27:59.376 --> 00:28:00.780
Yeah?

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.280
AUDIENCE: Is there
actually a reason

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.230
why it has to start at zero?

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so it turns
out it's more efficient in terms

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.480
of performance to
enforce jump targets,

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.922
if you know that the legitimate
address is a contiguous set

00:28:14.922 --> 00:28:17.505
of addresses starting at zero,
because you can then do it with

00:28:17.505 --> 00:28:21.080
a single AND mask, where
all the high bits are one,

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:27.140
and only a couple of low
bits are zero-- well,

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.542
if you're willing-- well--

00:28:29.542 --> 00:28:32.000
AUDIENCE: I thought the AND
mask was to ensure [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.166
PROFESSOR: Right, so the
AND mask ensures alignment,

00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:35.240
you're right.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.443
So why do they start at zero?

00:28:38.443 --> 00:28:43.210
I think it probably
helps them to-- well,

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.715
I guess they rely on the
segmentation hardware.

00:28:45.715 --> 00:28:47.090
So in principle,
maybe they could

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.369
use the segmentation hardware
to shift the region up,

00:28:49.369 --> 00:28:50.410
in terms of linear space.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.076
Or maybe it's just
with the application,

00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:53.480
sort of sees this range.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.810
And you can actually place
it at different offsets

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.260
in your virtual address space.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.260
It could be-- yeah, so
maybe you could actually

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.010
play tricks with the
segmentation hardware

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.511
to run multiple models in
a single address space.

00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:06.052
AUDIENCE: But is it because they
want to catch a null pointer

00:29:06.052 --> 00:29:06.552
reception?

00:29:06.552 --> 00:29:09.176
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so they want to
catch all points of reception.

00:29:09.176 --> 00:29:10.570
But you could sort of do that.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:11.610
Because the null
pointer-- I guess

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.359
we'll talk about
segmentation in a second,

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:17.260
but the null pointer actually
is relative to the segment

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.662
in which you are accessing.

00:29:18.662 --> 00:29:20.120
So if you shift
the segment around,

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.574
then you can map
an unused zero page

00:29:22.574 --> 00:29:25.030
at the beginning of
everyone's segment.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:30.090
So yeah, it might be that you
could do multiple modules.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.930
I think for-- well, because
one reason they probably

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.810
want to do this
is that when they

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.110
port their stuff to
64 bits, they have

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.300
a slightly different design.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.966
This paper doesn't
really talk about it.

00:29:40.966 --> 00:29:44.360
And I think about 64-bit
design, the hardware itself

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.230
got rid of some of the
segmentation hardware

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.110
they were relying on
for efficiency reasons,

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.890
and they have to do a much more
software oriented approach,

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.880
in which case having a
little bit doesn't help them.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.580
But in this 32-bit version, I
think, yeah, maybe that's true.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.189
That's not a deep reason
why it has to start at zero.

00:30:02.189 --> 00:30:02.855
Other questions?

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.550
All right.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:10.549
So I guess we sort of roughly
understand what the plan is,

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:12.465
or what we want to enforce
in terms of safety.

00:30:12.465 --> 00:30:14.690
So how do we do this?

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.920
So let's look at some of
at least naive approach,

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.540
and see how could
we screw it up,

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.580
I guess, and then we'll
try to fix it afterwards.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.734
So I guess the
naive plan that sort

00:30:25.734 --> 00:30:29.900
of looks like what they
do, is to just look

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.450
for disallowed instructions by
just scanning the executable

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:34.815
from the start going forward.

00:30:37.612 --> 00:30:39.790
So how do you detect
that instructions?

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.380
Well, you could just
take the program code,

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.320
and you sort of lay it
out in a giant string that

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.780
goes from zero up to maybe
all the way to 56 megabytes,

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.850
depending on how big your code
is, and you start looking.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.259
OK, well, maybe there's
a nop instruction here.

00:30:56.259 --> 00:30:58.425
Maybe there's some sort of
an add instruction there.

00:30:58.425 --> 00:31:02.580
Maybe there's a not-- I don't
know, some sort of a jump,

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.350
et cetera.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.840
And you just keep looking.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.450
And if you find a
bad instruction,

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.580
you say, ah, that's
a bad module.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.610
And then you discard it.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.193
And if you don't see any system
call [INAUDIBLE] instructions,

00:31:13.193 --> 00:31:15.550
then you're going to
allow this module to run,

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:20.200
module or whatever it is we'll
do for the in bounds checks.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.301
So is this going to work?

00:31:23.301 --> 00:31:24.800
So why not?

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.320
What are they worried about?

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.470
Why is so complicated?

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the instructions?

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so the weird thing

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.480
is that x86, which is the sort
of platform they are targeting

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.305
has a variable
length instructions.

00:31:39.448 --> 00:31:42.700
So this means that
the particular size

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.677
of an instruction depends
on the first few bytes

00:31:45.677 --> 00:31:46.510
of that instruction.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.090
So you have to actually
look at the first byte

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.305
and say, OK, well,
the instruction

00:31:49.305 --> 00:31:50.545
is going to be this much more.

00:31:50.545 --> 00:31:52.810
And then maybe you sort of have
to look at a couple more bytes,

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.660
and then decide, OK, well,
that's exactly how long it's

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.440
going to be.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.981
But you don't know
how ahead of time.

00:31:56.981 --> 00:32:01.000
So some architectures like
Spark, ARM, [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.700
have more fixed
length instructions.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.731
Well, ARM, for example--
ARM is like weird,

00:32:05.731 --> 00:32:07.230
but it has two
instructions lengths.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.200
Either everything is two bytes
or everything is four bytes.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.485
But x86, the instructions could
be like one byte or 10 byte

00:32:13.485 --> 00:32:16.097
or five bytes, anything
in between, as well.

00:32:16.097 --> 00:32:17.180
I forget actually how big.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.763
You can get a pretty
long instruction.

00:32:18.763 --> 00:32:21.150
I think you can get like a
15 byte instruction with x86

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.044
if you try hard.

00:32:23.044 --> 00:32:26.260
It's complicated
instructions, though.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.900
But as a result, the
problem that could show up

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.270
is that maybe you're
scanning linearly

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.240
and everything seems to be fine.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.560
But maybe at runtime,
you'll actually

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.420
jump into the middle
of some instruction.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.220
Maybe it was a
multi-byte instruction,

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.340
if you interpret it starting
from the second byte,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.890
it looks like a completely
different thing.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.190
So that's just one example
of sort of playing around

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.290
with an assembler.

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:56.210
And if you have an instruction
like this, 25 CD 80, 00, 00.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.872
And if you interpret it as
this five byte instruction,

00:32:58.872 --> 00:33:00.330
meaning that you
look at this byte.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.210
And oh yeah, this is going to
be a five byte instruction.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.130
So you have to look
five bytes forward.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.680
And then this turns out to be
a fairly benign instruction

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.980
that's an and of
the EAX register,

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:16.380
with some particular constant
that happens to be I think 00,

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.580
00, 80, CD. anyway.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.220
So this is one of
the safe instructions

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.330
that Native Client should just
allow under the first rule

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.020
in checking these
binary instructions.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.780
But if it turns out
at runtime the CPU

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.150
decides this is where it has
to start executing the code,

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:35.920
then this instruction
is actually

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.040
a four byte instruction, and
its actually an int instruction

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.950
that makes the OX80
interrupt, which

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.570
is one way to make
system calls in Linux.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.720
So if you miss this fact,
then eventually you're

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.600
going to allow untrusted
module to jump into the kernel

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.988
and make system calls, which
is what you wanted to prevent.

00:33:56.988 --> 00:33:59.790
Make sense?

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.255
So how can we prevent it?

00:34:01.255 --> 00:34:02.796
Like one possibility
is like maybe we

00:34:02.796 --> 00:34:05.980
should try to look
at every byte offset.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:09.125
Because at least x86 can only
start interpreting instruction

00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:11.643
on a byte boundary
instead of a bit boundary.

00:34:11.643 --> 00:34:14.130
So you like look at every
single possible byte off,

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.420
and you see what
instruction starts there.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.445
Is this a reasonable
plan to report?

00:34:19.445 --> 00:34:19.944
Yeah?

00:34:19.944 --> 00:34:21.500
AUDIENCE: I mean, what
if someone actually

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.107
is doing an and, and they're
never going to jump into that.

00:34:24.107 --> 00:34:25.480
And now you're just
allowing their program.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.000
PROFESSOR: Right,
so basically it's

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.310
prone to eventually
false positives.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.770
Now if you really wanted
to, you could probably

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:36.889
contort yourself and
change the code a little--

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:38.330
and somehow avoid this.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:41.080
If you knew exactly what
the checker was looking for,

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.620
you could potentially
change these instructions.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.969
Maybe like end it with
one thing first, and then

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.010
end it with another mask later.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:51.520
But just avoid these
suspicious byte patterns.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.430
But that just seems
pretty awkward to do.

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:56.949
Now it is actually possible
that the architecture does

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.030
involve changing the compiler.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.400
So in principle, they
do have some component

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.150
that actually has to
compile the code correctly.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.020
You can't just take
of the shelf GCC

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.880
and compile a code
for Native Client.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.100
So in principle it's doable.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.500
But I think they're just
thinking it's too much hassle,

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.065
and it's not going to be
reliable or high performance,

00:35:15.065 --> 00:35:16.506
et cetera.

00:35:16.506 --> 00:35:18.420
Make sense?

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.770
And plus there's a couple
of x86 instructions

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.780
that are prohibited or should
be unsafe and prohibited.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.110
But they're like one
byte long, so that

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:32.820
is going to be pretty damaging
to look for or filter out.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.320
OK.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.110
So if they can't just assemble
and sort of straight up

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.540
and hope for the best, then
they need some other plan

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.830
for doing this disassembly
in a reliable fashion.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.070
So what is that client
or Native Client

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:50.431
to ensure they don't get tripped
up by this variable length

00:35:50.431 --> 00:35:50.930
encoding?

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:58.839
So I guess one way to
think about it is, well,

00:35:58.839 --> 00:36:01.130
so how are we going to solve
this reliable disassembly?

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:10.260
So in some sense, if we
really do scan forward

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.150
from the left to the right, and
we look for all the possible up

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:16.910
codes, if that's the
way the code executes,

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.080
then we're in good shape.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.000
So even if there are
some weird instruction

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.580
and has some
offset, then the CPU

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.290
isn't actually
going to jump there.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.072
It actually executes
the same way

00:36:26.072 --> 00:36:27.530
that we're scanning
the instruction

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.740
screen from left to right.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.020
So the problem with getting
the disassembly to be reliable

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:38.320
really comes from the
fact that there's jumps.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.920
Because if we execute linearly
from left to right, then

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.390
the CPU will follow
the same rules

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:45.000
that our checker is following,
and see the same instruction

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.840
screen.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.230
So the problem really
comes down to what

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:51.490
happens if there's a jump
somewhere in the application.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.500
Could a jump to some
position in the code

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.654
that we didn't observe in
our left to right scan?

00:36:57.654 --> 00:36:59.570
So this is what they are
sort of going another

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.380
in the reliable disassembly.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.780
And the basic plan is to just
check where all the jumps go.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.020
It's actually fairly
straightforward at some level.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.880
They have a bunch of rules
we'll look at in a second,

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.680
but roughly the plan is if
you see a jump instruction,

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.910
then it actually
has to be-- well,

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:24.395
you have to check that the
target was seen before.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.850
So you basically do
the left to right scan

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.970
that we sort of described
in our naive approach here.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.910
But then if you see any
kind of a jump instruction,

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:39.545
then you see what is the address
to which the jump instruction

00:37:39.545 --> 00:37:42.000
is pointing to, and
you make sure that it's

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.750
an address that you saw in
your left to right disassembly.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:47.240
So if there's a jump
instruction for example

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.780
that goes to that
CD byte, then we're

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:53.340
going to flag that jump as
invalid because we never

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.250
saw an instruction
starting in the CD byte.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.030
We saw a different instruction.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.320
But if all the instruction,
if all the jumps

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.540
go to the start of
instructions we saw,

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.622
then we're in good shape.

00:38:03.622 --> 00:38:06.320
Does that make sense?

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.910
So the one problem
is that you can't

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.690
check the targets of
every jump in the program,

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.460
because there might
be indirect jumps.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.520
For example in x86,
you could actually

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.105
have something like jump to
the value of that EAX register.

00:38:20.105 --> 00:38:22.510
This is great for implementing
function pointers.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.670
The function pointer
somewhere in memory,

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.080
then you hold to
function pointer

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.870
into some register at one time.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:29.930
And then you jump
to whatever address

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:34.240
was in the [INAUDIBLE]
relocation register.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.894
So how do these guys deal
with these indirect jumps?

00:38:36.894 --> 00:38:38.560
So I have no idea if
this actually going

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.674
to jump to the CD
byte or the 25 byte.

00:38:42.674 --> 00:38:43.340
What do they do?

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:43.820
Yeah?

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.310
AUDIENCE: The
instrument [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:45.976
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:45.976 --> 00:38:48.690
So this is their basically main
trick here, is instrumentation.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:52.180
So whenever they see
a jump like this,

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.120
well actually what the
compiler is going to generate

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.960
is a proof that this
jump is actually

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.740
going to do the right thing.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.950
And the way they actually
do this is-- they

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.610
don't actually know--
it's actually kind of hard

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.540
to put in a proof here that
it's one of the addresses

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.910
that you saw during the
left right disassembly.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:11.670
So instead what
they do is they want

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:15.770
to make sure that all the jumps
go to multiples of 32 bytes.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.470
And the way they
do this is actually

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:22.240
change all the jump
instructions into something

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.640
that they pseudo instructions.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.458
So they're still that
jump to the EAX register.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:35.220
But they prefix it
with an AND instruction

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:40.690
that is going to
clear the low five

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:50.610
bits, E 0 with an EAX register.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:53.820
So that AND instruction
clears the low five bits,

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.120
which means that it
forces this value

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.690
to be a multiple of
32, two to the five.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:01.570
And then you jump to it.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.960
So if you look at it
during verification time,

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.800
then you can sort
of convince yourself

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.170
that this instruction
pair will only

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:15.180
jump to a multiple 32 bytes.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.420
And then in order to make
sure that this is not

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.777
going to jump to some
weird instruction,

00:40:19.777 --> 00:40:21.610
you're going to enforce
an extra rule, which

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:25.195
is that during your disassembly,
when you're scanning

00:40:25.195 --> 00:40:27.700
your instructions
from left to right,

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.640
you're going to ensure that
every multiple of 32 bytes

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.096
is a start of a
valid instruction.

00:40:34.096 --> 00:40:35.720
So in addition to
this instrumentation,

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:44.867
you're also are going to check
that every multiple of 32

00:40:44.867 --> 00:40:45.825
is a valid instruction.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.635
What I mean by valid instruction
here is an instruction

00:40:54.635 --> 00:40:57.889
that you see when you
disassemble from left to right.

00:40:57.889 --> 00:40:58.388
Yeah?

00:40:58.388 --> 00:40:59.730
AUDIENCE: Why 32?

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:00.850
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah, so
why did they choose 32?

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.225
That seems like
some magic number

00:41:02.225 --> 00:41:03.910
that they pulled out of a hat.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:07.680
Should you choose 1,000 or five?

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.660
Any comment?

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.130
OK, should we choose five?

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.766
So why is five bad?

00:41:12.766 --> 00:41:14.482
AUDIENCE: The power of two.

00:41:14.482 --> 00:41:16.440
PROFESSOR: Yes, OK, so
we're on a power of two.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.310
OK, so good point.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.827
Because otherwise ensuring
something is a multiple of 5

00:41:19.827 --> 00:41:21.910
is going to require a
couple of instructions here,

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.080
which is going to lead overhead.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.420
How about eight?

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.550
Is eight good enough, yeah?

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.090
AUDIENCE: You can have
instructions longer than eight.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:30.089
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, so
it has to be at least as

00:41:30.089 --> 00:41:32.399
long as the longest x86
instruction you want to allow.

00:41:32.399 --> 00:41:33.940
So if there's a ten
byte instruction,

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.350
everything has to be a
multiple of eight, well,

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.474
you're kind of screwed with
a ten byte instruction.

00:41:37.474 --> 00:41:39.025
There's nowhere to put it.

00:41:39.025 --> 00:41:40.400
So it has to be
at least as long.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.570
32 is pretty good, like
the biggest I could find

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:43.990
was 15 bytes.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:45.596
So it's probably good enough.

00:41:45.596 --> 00:41:46.096
Yeah?

00:41:46.096 --> 00:41:50.080
AUDIENCE: Can [INAUDIBLE] be
longer than [INAUDIBLE] code,

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.570
they'd have to have
a alt instruction

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:54.064
at the beginning
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:54.064 --> 00:41:56.105
so you can't just jumpt
directly into [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:56.105 --> 00:41:58.048
and they also need a
jump instruction that

00:41:58.048 --> 00:41:59.330
jumps to another [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:00.580
PROFESSOR: That's right, yeah.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.390
So you have to be able
to fit for the entry

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.970
and exit from the
process service runtime,

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:07.580
you need to be able to fit
some nontrivial amount of code

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.799
in a single 32 byte slot.

00:42:09.799 --> 00:42:11.340
We'll see how this
works in a second.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.590
Or even 31 bytes slot,
as you are pointing out,

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:17.150
for one hold instruction.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:18.250
Should it be much larger?

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:22.788
Should we make it, I don't know,
a thousand byte, well, 10 24?

00:42:22.788 --> 00:42:25.776
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] sparse,
because you have to have

00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:26.780
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so if you
have a lot of function pointers

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:32.530
or lots of sort of indirect
jumps, then every time

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:36.160
you want to create some place
where you're going to jump to,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.580
you have to pad it out
to the next boundary

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.530
of whatever this value is.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:41.830
So with 32, maybe that's OK.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.740
You're like well, worst
case, you waste 31 bytes,

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.530
because you just need to fast
forward to the next boundary.

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:51.280
But if it's a multiple of 1024,
then all of a sudden you're

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.730
wasting a kilobyte of
memory for an indirect jump.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:59.580
And if you have probably short
functions or lots of function

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.280
pointers, then
this might actually

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.240
be a memory overhead all
of a sudden, as well.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.930
Does that make sense roughly?

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:08.330
So yeah, I think the
32 is not set in stone.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:11.485
Like Native Client has
to have 32 byte blocks,

00:43:11.485 --> 00:43:13.310
but something on that
order probably works.

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.330
16 is probably a little short.

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.580
On the other hand,
like 64 could work.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.740
128 maybe is getting
a little longish.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.750
But I don't think
you could derive 32

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.231
from first principles.

00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:28.880
Makes sense?

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.090
All right.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:33.280
So let's set a plan for
reliable disassembly.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.030
And as a result, the compiler
has to be a little bit careful

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:42.220
when it's compiling your C or
C++ code into a Native Client

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:42.720
binary.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.344
It has to basically
follow these rules.

00:43:44.344 --> 00:43:46.660
So whenever it
has a jump, it has

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.640
to add those extra
instruction front.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.049
And whatever it's
creating a function

00:43:53.049 --> 00:43:54.840
that it's going to jump
to, our instruction

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.673
is going to jump to,
as we're talking about,

00:43:56.673 --> 00:43:58.000
it has to pad it out.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.150
And it can't just pad
it out with zeros,

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.590
because all those have
to valid up codes.

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.710
So it actually has to pad
it out with [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:06.535
just to make the
validator happy,

00:44:06.535 --> 00:44:08.720
just to make sure that every
possible instruction is

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.800
a valid one.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.390
And luckily on x86, no
op is a single byte,

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:14.940
or at least there is a no
op-- that's a single byte.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.600
There's many no ops on x86.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.200
So you can always pad
things out to a multiple

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.670
of whatever this constant is.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.040
Make sense?

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.330
All right.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.030
So what does this
guarantee to us?

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.490
I guess let's make
sure that we always

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.370
see what happens in terms
of the instructions that

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:35.220
will be executed.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.630
So this finally
gets us this rule.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:43.280
So we can be sure there's never
a system call being issued.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.850
What about-- So
this is for jumps.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:46.700
What about returns?

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.570
How do they deal
with the returns?

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:52.874
Can you return for a
function in Native Client?

00:44:52.874 --> 00:44:56.770
What would happen if you
ran into a red hot code?

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:57.731
Would that be good?

00:44:57.731 --> 00:44:58.231
Yeah?

00:44:58.231 --> 00:45:01.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you
don't want the-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.947
modifying your
overall [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:03.947 --> 00:45:06.030
PROFESSOR: Well, it's true
that it pops the stack.

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:09.700
But the stack that Native
Client modules use,

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.270
it's actually just some data
inside of their section.

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:16.309
So you don't actually care--
the Native Client contact

00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:18.600
doesn't care whether those
guys screws up their stacks,

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.767
overflow their stack, or--

00:45:19.767 --> 00:45:22.340
AUDIENCE: Wait, but you could
put anything on the stack.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.340
And when you [INAUDIBLE]
you jump through that--

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.090
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:27.048
Yeah, so return is almost
like an indirect jump

00:45:27.048 --> 00:45:29.160
from a particular
weird memory location

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.890
that's at the top of the stack.

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.580
So I guess one thing
they could do for return

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.270
is maybe prefix it with a
similar check, where maybe like

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.800
pop the top thing of the stack.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.080
You check whether it's
valid, and then you write,

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.240
or you somehow do an
AND to a memory operand,

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.360
and that's the top of the stack.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.640
It seems a little
fragile, partly because

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.440
of race conditions.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.045
Because for example, if you
look at the top location

00:45:51.045 --> 00:45:53.020
of the stack, you
check that it's OK,

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.060
and then you do a write
later, another threat

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.090
in the same module
could modify the thing

00:45:58.090 --> 00:45:59.710
at the top of the stack.

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:02.640
And then you'd be
referring to that address.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.100
AUDIENCE: Would this not be
the case for the jumps as well?

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so what
happens with the jump?

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:09.030
Could our race conditions
somehow invalidate this check?

00:46:11.793 --> 00:46:12.292
Yeah?

00:46:12.292 --> 00:46:13.751
AUDIENCE: The code
is not writable.

00:46:13.751 --> 00:46:16.000
PROFESSOR: Well the code is
not writable, that's true.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.475
So you can't modify the AND.

00:46:17.475 --> 00:46:21.250
But could another thread
modify this jump target

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:23.350
in between these
two instructions?

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:23.850
Yeah?

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.350
AUDIENCE: It's in
a register, so--

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:26.975
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's the cool thing.

00:46:26.975 --> 00:46:29.880
There is basically-- if
it modifies it in memory

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.520
or where ever it loaded
into EAX from, sure,

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.360
you do it before you load, in
which case this EX will be bad,

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.990
but then will
clear the bad bits.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:38.909
Or it could modify it
after, at which point

00:46:38.909 --> 00:46:40.450
it's already in the
EX, so it doesn't

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:43.920
matter that it's modifying
the memory location from which

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.130
the EX register was loaded.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:50.530
And threads don't actually
share the register sets.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:52.650
So if another thread
modifies the EX register,

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:55.210
it will not affect this
thread's EX register.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.860
So this instruction
actually is sort of

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.050
race-proof in some sense.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:03.719
Other threads can't invalidate
this instruction sequence.

00:47:03.719 --> 00:47:04.218
Make sense?

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.490
All right.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:11.750
So here's another
interesting question.

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:14.370
Could we bypass this AND?

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:16.760
I can jump around in this
address space all I want.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.796
And when I'm disassembling
this instruction,

00:47:18.796 --> 00:47:21.045
this seems like a perfectly
fine parallel instruction,

00:47:21.045 --> 00:47:24.680
an AND and a jump.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:30.155
And the check for static
jumps is that, well,

00:47:30.155 --> 00:47:32.650
it just has to point to
some target that was seen.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:33.860
So yeah, we saw an AND.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.360
That's one instruction
that's valid.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.980
We saw a jump, that's
another valid instruction.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.950
So when I see a
direct jump up here,

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:42.280
maybe I jump to some address.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:46.530
I don't know, one,
two, three, seven.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.542
That's actually OK, even though
it's not a multiple of 32.

00:47:49.542 --> 00:47:53.180
Native Client doesn't
generally allow direct jumps

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.290
to arbitrary
addresses, as long as

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.420
that address is a instruction
that we saw during disassembly,

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.370
as we were just talking about.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:05.600
So could I put in this very
nicely checked indirect jump,

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.270
and then later on in the code
jump to the second instruction

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.220
in that sequence?

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.210
So then I'll load
something into EX,

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:15.850
jump here, and
then directly jump

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.910
into this unsandboxed address.

00:48:20.607 --> 00:48:22.190
That will violate
the security, right?

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:23.148
Does everyone see that?

00:48:23.148 --> 00:48:24.120
So how is this avoided?

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.024
AUDIENCE: Well, the NaCl
[INAUDIBLE] and the jump

00:48:27.024 --> 00:48:28.274
has to signal instruction.

00:48:28.274 --> 00:48:30.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this
is why they call this thing

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:34.510
a single pseudo instruction.

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:36.660
And even though
at the x86 level,

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.350
they're actually
distinct instruction,

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.760
as far as the NaCl
validator thinks of it,

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.980
it's actually a
single atomic unit.

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.080
So as far as this check for
whether it's an instruction

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.980
that you saw before,
they think, oh, this

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.730
is the only instruction
that I saw before.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:51.400
Jumping in the middle
is like jumping

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.565
in the middle of this guy.

00:48:53.565 --> 00:48:55.020
It's the same thing.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:58.360
So they basically enforce
slightly different semantics

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:02.640
than what x86 enforces in terms
of what an instruction is.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.590
And this might
actually mean that you

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:09.580
can represent certain
instruction sequences in NaCl.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.430
So if you actually had
legitimate code that

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:15.030
looked like this
before, this is going

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.002
to be turned into a
single out code in NaCl.

00:49:18.002 --> 00:49:19.460
But hopefully that's
not a problem.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.127
Yeah?

00:49:20.127 --> 00:49:21.710
AUDIENCE: Presumably
they can out that

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:27.040
in the trusted code base in
the start of the text segment.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.816
Because that way, you will
always replace those two.

00:49:30.816 --> 00:49:33.440
Instead of putting those in the
binary that you produce anyway,

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.290
you just jump straight to
that jump target that's

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:37.795
in the privileged section.

00:49:37.795 --> 00:49:40.170
PROFESSOR: In the trusted
runtime, you mean or something?

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:42.660
AUDIENCE: No, so
in the first 64 K--

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, they had
these trampolines and yeah--

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.420
AUDIENCE: So they can make
that one of the trampolines.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.156
Except that it doesn't jump out.

00:49:48.156 --> 00:49:49.332
It jumps back in.

00:49:49.332 --> 00:49:50.040
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.861
AUDIENCE: So that
way, it wouldn't

00:49:51.861 --> 00:49:53.152
need to be a super instruction.

00:49:53.152 --> 00:49:56.360
It would just be
a single x86 jump

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.194
into there, which would
then jump out again.

00:49:58.194 --> 00:49:59.401
PROFESSOR: That's true, yeah.

00:49:59.401 --> 00:50:01.940
That's another sort of clever
solution that you could do,

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.710
is instead for the
deliverance of [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.704
so suppose that you didn't want
to do this pseudo instruction

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:12.920
trick, and you just wanted
to have a single instruction

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.590
replacing the jump EAX.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:16.090
Well, what you can
basically come up

00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:18.630
with is a library of all
possible indirect jumps

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:19.710
you can ever do.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:26.410
So like well, there is jump EAX,
there's jump EBX, and so on.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.460
And you would construct
a library of these guys

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.209
for each of them, you would
construct the safe check

00:50:31.209 --> 00:50:32.750
that you'd want to
replace them with.

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:36.040
So for this one, you'd put an
AND in front of it, and so on.

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.452
And for this one, you'll also
put an AND in front of it,

00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:39.262
and so on.

00:50:39.262 --> 00:50:43.470
And then in the compiled
binary, every time

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:45.830
you want to jump to EAX,
what you actually do,

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.690
is actually jump
to a fixed address

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:51.870
that corresponds to this
helpful piece of code

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:55.490
stored somewhere in that
low 64 k of the program.

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:59.660
And then this guy will do
the AND and jump again.

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.460
The reason that they
probably don't do this

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.450
is performance for this
sort of interesting reason.

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:07.675
So that Intel processor,
actually most processors

00:51:07.675 --> 00:51:11.720
these days, have
to predict where

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.830
the branch goes to keep the
pipeline of the processor

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:16.025
full at all times.

00:51:16.025 --> 00:51:18.150
It's one of the really
complicated branch predictor

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:20.649
that not only decides whether
you're going to branch or not,

00:51:20.649 --> 00:51:21.740
like if statements.

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.949
But also actually guesses
where you're going to jump.

00:51:23.949 --> 00:51:25.740
So if you see an indirect
jump, it actually

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.880
is going to guess what the
address is going to be.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.338
And this is actually
a guess that's

00:51:29.338 --> 00:51:32.720
stored per cache line stored
in the jump instruction.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.980
So if you have a single
place where all the jump

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:37.037
EAXs come from, then
the CPU is always

00:51:37.037 --> 00:51:38.120
going to be very confused.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.250
Because these jump EAXs seem
to be going all over the place,

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:41.045
everywhere.

00:51:41.045 --> 00:51:43.170
Where as if we are really
tied to a particular jump

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:45.215
instruction, it would
be a better prediction.

00:51:45.215 --> 00:51:48.620
That's just a performance
trick that they play.

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:49.120
Make sense?

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.860
All right.

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:56.127
So I guess we roughly
understand how

00:51:56.127 --> 00:51:57.710
it's going to
disassemble all of these

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.830
instructions how it's going
to prevent these instructions.

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:03.440
So now let's look
at the set of rules

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.667
they are going to enforce
through this table

00:52:05.667 --> 00:52:08.560
in the paper, table one.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:12.880
And it has all these different
rules for the validator

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.396
to follow, or that the
binaries have to follow

00:52:15.396 --> 00:52:17.010
and the validator checks.

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.176
So I'll go through these
rules and just double check

00:52:19.176 --> 00:52:21.350
that we understand why
all these rules are there.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:28.510
So we have these things,
C1, all the way to C7.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:32.700
So C1 basically says that once
you load the binary memory,

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:38.720
then the binary is actually
not writable at the page table

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.100
level.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.630
So they set the permission
bits for the binary

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:43.650
can be non-writable.

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:45.467
So why?

00:52:45.467 --> 00:52:47.050
It should be fairly
obvious hopefully.

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:52.020
The reason is that
their whole security

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.749
plan relies on them checking
that your binary is correct.

00:52:55.749 --> 00:52:57.290
So once they've
checked it, they want

00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:59.300
to make sure you can't
modify the binary

00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:02.680
and have it do something
illegal that they prohibited.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.870
So this is I think
reasonably clear then.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:09.770
So C2 is their plan
that basically has to

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:16.890
linked at zero at start at
64 K. So this requirement,

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:19.694
I think doesn't actually have
to do with security so much.

00:53:19.694 --> 00:53:21.110
I think it's just
for convenience,

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.570
because they just want
to have a standard layout

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:25.190
for the program.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:27.440
In some sense,
it's for simplicity

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.950
so that they don't have to deal
with complicated relocation

00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:32.040
records, which
means that there's

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.630
fewer things that the validator
or a loader might screw up.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:39.140
But basically this is sort of a
standardization plan for them,

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.280
in terms of how to
load their executable.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.280
Make sense?

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:44.780
All right.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:51.530
So the third requirement is that
I guess the indirect jumps use

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.632
the two instruction.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.860
So the two instruction
is this thing above.

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.980
So that, we just talked about,
why it needs to ensure this,

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.100
so that you don't jump to the
middle of some instruction,

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:09.542
or somehow invoked
[INAUDIBLE], et cetera.

00:54:09.542 --> 00:54:11.530
Make sense?

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:12.620
All right.

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:14.430
So what's going on with C4?

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:22.680
Basically you have to pad out
two page boundary with a halt

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.720
instruction.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:28.185
Why do they want to pad
their binary out with halts?

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.332
Any ideas?

00:54:32.332 --> 00:54:33.876
Yeah?

00:54:33.876 --> 00:54:34.792
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:46.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think--
so I have to admit,

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.300
I don't have a crisp
answer for why C4 exists.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:49.674
But I think it's
roughly what you

00:54:49.674 --> 00:54:52.650
are saying, which is that
if you-- the code naturally

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:53.685
stops at some point.

00:54:53.685 --> 00:54:54.946
There's some end to it.

00:54:54.946 --> 00:54:56.320
And the question
is, what happens

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.670
when you just keep executing
it, and you get to the end?

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.570
Then the processor might just
keep executing past the end,

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:04.445
and execute some
extra instructions.

00:55:04.445 --> 00:55:06.450
Or maybe it wraps around
in some weird way.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.450
So they just want to
make sure that there's

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:12.085
no ambiguity about what
happens if you keep running

00:55:12.085 --> 00:55:14.430
and you don't jump, and
you just run off the end

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:15.690
of the instruction screen.

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:18.220
So let's just make sure
that the only answer there

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.835
is if you keep
executing, you'll halt,

00:55:20.835 --> 00:55:22.245
and you'll trap
into the runtime,

00:55:22.245 --> 00:55:24.139
and you'll terminate the module.

00:55:24.139 --> 00:55:26.180
So it's just sort of about
simplicity and safety,

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.545
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:27.545 --> 00:55:30.780
I don't think there's a concrete
attack that I could have

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.313
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:31.313 --> 00:55:32.229
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:35.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:37.120
But here's the thing.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.840
You can't jump past the end.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.990
So the last thing
that you could jump to

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:44.140
is the last instruction.

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.460
And by this rule, that
instruction must be hold.

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:49.350
So you could jump to the hold,
but then would be at the hold.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:52.570
And you want to
run past the end.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.890
So I think it's just
sort of cleanliness,

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:58.380
as far as I can tell, a
guarantee for them to make sure

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.362
that there's no
weirdness in terms

00:56:00.362 --> 00:56:03.870
of wrap around at the engine.

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:04.850
All right?

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:10.000
So C5 is basically
no instructions

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:16.160
that span the 32 byte boundary.

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.880
So this is sort of a
variant of this rule

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.410
that we talked about before,
where every multiple of 32

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:25.080
must be a valid instruction
that we solder in disassembly.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.880
So otherwise, we'll jump to
the middle of an instruction

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.245
and have the problem
with that sys call

00:56:30.245 --> 00:56:32.050
that might be hidden there.

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:32.880
OK.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:38.580
And then we have C6, which
is basically all instructions

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:45.584
reachable by disassembly
from the start.

00:56:45.584 --> 00:56:47.500
So this ensures that we
see every instruction,

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.750
and we can check every
instruction that could possibly

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.930
be run at runtime.

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:55.275
And I guess C7 is this
basically all direct jumps.

00:57:00.031 --> 00:57:00.530
OK.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:03.020
So this is the example of
that jump up there, where you

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.760
code in the target right away.

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.680
So it doesn't have
a multiple of 32,

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.770
but it still has to
be a valid instruction

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:12.003
that we solder in the
left to right disassembly.

00:57:12.003 --> 00:57:12.503
Question?

00:57:12.503 --> 00:57:16.984
AUDIENCE: So what's the
difference between C5 and C3?

00:57:16.984 --> 00:57:17.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:22.830
So I think C5 says that
if I have an instruction

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:29.080
that's multiple bytes, it cannot
stay on that 32 byte boundary.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.780
So suppose that I have
my instruction stream.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.900
And here's an address, 32.

00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.960
Here's address 64.

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.050
And maybe I have some
sort of an AND instruction

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:43.060
that sort of spans
this boundary.

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:45.120
So this is what C5 prohibits.

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.990
No instructions can
span this boundary.

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:49.470
Because otherwise, we
saw this AND instruction.

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:51.665
But because you can always
jump 32 byte multiples,

00:57:51.665 --> 00:57:53.290
you could jump into
the middle of that.

00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:55.380
And who knows what
will happen there?

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.920
So this is what C5
prohibits for that.

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:02.090
And C3 is the counterpart
to it on the jump side.

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:04.560
So C3 says that
whenever you jump,

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.090
you're going to jump to
a multiple of 32 bytes.

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:10.450
And C5 says that everything you
can find in a multiple of 32

00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:13.049
bytes is a safe instruction.

00:58:13.049 --> 00:58:14.882
AUDIENCE: I wonder if
there's any redundancy

00:58:14.882 --> 00:58:15.780
because [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.090
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I don't know.

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:17.550
I'm not sure.

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:19.900
I had a little bit of that
feeling when reading this list.

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.691
It seems like, wow,
they're all good rules.

00:58:21.691 --> 00:58:24.000
But I'm not sure it's the
minimal, non-orthonormal set

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:31.640
of-- or set of orthonormal rules
that you need to enforce this.

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.550
But any other
questions about the set

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:36.650
of restrictions they have?

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:37.680
All right.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.869
So I guess let's think
about this homework question

00:58:40.869 --> 00:58:41.910
that we sort of assigned.

00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:43.618
It turns out-- I think
there was actually

00:58:43.618 --> 00:58:45.243
a bug that Native
Client had and that's

00:58:45.243 --> 00:58:46.701
in our sandbox at
some point, which

00:58:46.701 --> 00:58:48.510
is that for some
complicated instruction,

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:52.320
I believe they didn't have
the length encoding correctly,

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.980
if I remember
properly, in which case

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:58.090
something bad might happen.

00:58:58.090 --> 00:58:59.880
I can't remember exactly
what the bug was.

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.100
But suppose that the
sandbox validator

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:06.792
gets the length of
some instruction wrong.

00:59:06.792 --> 00:59:08.590
What bad things could happen?

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:09.860
How would you exploit this?

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.132
AUDIENCE: You can hide a
sys call or a [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:12.924
potentially.

00:59:12.924 --> 00:59:13.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:17.600
So suppose that there's some
fancy variant of some AND

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.570
instruction that you
could write down.

00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.570
And maybe the validator
gets that wrong

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:23.730
and thinks that, oh,
this guy is actually

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:27.370
six bytes, when in reality,
it's five bites long.

00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:30.200
So you could plop this
down, pull this AND down.

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.660
And then the validator
thinks, oh, it's six bites.

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.380
I'll look six bites further.

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.669
And I'll check whether this
is a valid instruction.

00:59:36.669 --> 00:59:38.460
And we just have to
make sure that whatever

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.920
is six bytes later looks
like a valid instruction.

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:43.450
But the CPU itself,
when it runs this code,

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:45.917
is going to maybe only look
five bytes from the AND

00:59:45.917 --> 00:59:48.000
because that's the real
length of the instruction.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.730
So if we can use this extra
byte to stick a sys call

00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:52.480
instruction, then we
could be in business.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:58.524
So if we stick that-- remember
from that example above on x86,

00:59:58.524 --> 01:00:00.190
OXCD is how you make
an AND instruction.

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:05.050
So if we stick a CD byte
at the end of that AND,

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:06.870
then maybe we can
put something here

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.859
that looks like an
instruction but actually is

01:00:08.859 --> 01:00:11.080
going to be part of the
AND instruction here.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.310
And then we can all of
a sudden make a sys call

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:16.433
and escape the inner sandbox.

01:00:16.433 --> 01:00:17.415
Makes sense?

01:00:17.415 --> 01:00:20.380
Any questions?

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.755
So the validator
in Native Client

01:00:22.755 --> 01:00:24.330
has to be really
in sync with what

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:27.400
the CPU is doing because it's
sort of guessing, well, here's

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.900
exactly how the CPU is going
to interpret every instruction.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.746
It has to be right
at every level here.

01:00:32.746 --> 01:00:35.477
So that's going to be a
little bit tricky to do right.

01:00:35.477 --> 01:00:37.560
But there are actually
some other interesting bugs

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.300
in Native Client that
people have found.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.040
One, I think, has to do
with not properly sanitizing

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.390
the environment of the CPU when
you're jumping into the trusted

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:46.270
service runtime.

01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:48.020
I guess we'll talk
about this in a second.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.213
But the trusted
service runtime is

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:52.212
going to basically run
with the same sort of set

01:00:52.212 --> 01:00:55.400
of CPU registers initially
that the untrusted module was

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.496
running with.

01:00:56.496 --> 01:00:58.120
So if there's something
that it forgets

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:02.230
to clear or reset or whatnot,
then the trusted service

01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:05.070
runtime might be tricked
into doing something

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:07.980
that it wasn't meant to
do, or the developers

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.330
didn't want to do it initially.

01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:12.489
OK.

01:01:12.489 --> 01:01:13.030
So let's see.

01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.910
Where are we now?

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.780
So what we understand
now is roughly

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.820
how we can disassemble
all the instructions

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.860
and how to prevent
disallowed instructions.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:24.860
So now let's look at, how do we
keep the memory and references

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:29.550
for both code and data within
the bounds of the module?

01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:32.855
So for performance reasons,
the Native Client guys actually

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.230
start using some
hardware support

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:36.810
at this point to make
sure this actually

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:38.430
doesn't impose much overhead.

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:40.664
But before we look at the
hardware support they use,

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:43.330
does anyone have any suggestions
for how we could do it actually

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.538
without any hardware support?

01:01:44.538 --> 01:01:48.430
Could we just enforce
all the memory accesses

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:52.085
going in bounds with the
machine we have so far?

01:01:52.085 --> 01:01:53.015
Yeah.

01:01:53.015 --> 01:01:56.070
AUDIENCE: You can
instrument the instructions

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:57.370
to clear all the higher bits.

01:01:57.370 --> 01:01:58.370
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:58.500
Yeah.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.080
So actually we see that we have
this instruction over here,

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.980
which every time
we, for example,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.770
jump somewhere, right now,
we clear the low bits.

01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:08.310
But if we want to keep all
the possible code that you're

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:11.580
executing within
the low 256 Megs,

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.330
then you could just
replace this with a 0.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:16.830
So we end with 0ffffe0.

01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:21.521
So this clears the low bits and
also caps to at most 256 Megs.

01:02:21.521 --> 01:02:23.645
So this does exactly what
you're sort of suggesting

01:02:23.645 --> 01:02:26.720
and would make sure that
whenever you're jumping,

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.940
you're saying within
the low 256 Megs.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:34.420
And the fact that we're
doing disassembly,

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.890
you can also check for
all the direct jumps,

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:39.030
that they're all in bounds.

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:40.414
And that's actually not so bad.

01:02:40.414 --> 01:02:42.330
The reason I think they
don't do this for code

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:46.340
is because in x86 you can very
efficiently encode an AND where

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.820
all the top bits are 1.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.490
So this turns out
to be, I think,

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:53.185
basically a 3 byte
instruction for the AND,

01:02:53.185 --> 01:02:55.410
and a 2 byte instruction
for the jump.

01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:57.270
So the overhead is,
like, 3 more bytes.

01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:00.260
But if you want to
have non-1 high bits,

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.830
then this is actually now a 5
byte instruction all of sudden.

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:04.240
So I think they're worried a
little bit about the overhead

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.500
here.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.287
Question?

01:03:06.287 --> 01:03:07.870
AUDIENCE: Isn't there
also the problem

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:09.661
that you might have
some instructions which

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.840
increment what version
that you're trying to get?

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.020
So you might say--
your instruction

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.187
might have a constant offset
or something like that.

01:03:16.187 --> 01:03:17.478
PROFESSOR: Well, I think, yeah.

01:03:17.478 --> 01:03:19.240
You would probably
prohibit instructions

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.990
that jump to some complicated
formula of an address.

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:24.520
So you will only support an
instruction that jumps directly

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.540
to this value.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:28.262
And this value always
gets ANDed and--

01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:30.470
AUDIENCE: It's more for
memory accesses rather than--

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:31.136
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:31.136 --> 01:03:33.600
So that's a good point
because this is just code.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.060
And for memory access, there's
lots of weird ways on x86

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:40.330
to refer to a particular
memory location.

01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:43.070
In that case, you basically
have to first compute the memory

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:47.560
location, then insert an extra
and, and then do the access.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.210
And I think that's the real
reason why they're actually

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:52.210
very worried about the
performance overheads

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:54.020
of this instrumentation.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.426
So on x86, at least
on the 32-bit, which

01:03:56.426 --> 01:03:59.050
is what this paper talks about,
they actually use some hardware

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:03.060
support instead to
limit the code and data

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:07.330
addresses that the untrusted
module can refer to.

01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:11.810
So this actually leverages
some somewhat esoteric hardware

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:12.980
in x86.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:16.320
So let's see what it looks
like first before we start

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.932
figuring out how
we're going to use

01:04:17.932 --> 01:04:21.240
it to sandbox the next module.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.650
So this hardware is
called segmentation.

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:28.220
It's sort of left over
from the days before x86

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.650
actually even had paging.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:40.080
So the way it works is actually
there's a segmentation on x86.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.170
They way it works is that
whenever a process is running,

01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:49.830
there's actually a table
maintained by the hardware.

01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:52.450
Let's call it the
segment descriptor table.

01:04:59.324 --> 01:05:02.610
And what this table has is
just a bunch of segments,

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:05.670
numbered from 0 up to
whatever the size of the table

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:08.350
is, kind of like file
descriptor in Unix.

01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:11.870
Except every entry
has two values in it,

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:16.050
some sort of a
base and a length.

01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:19.110
And the same for every
entry, base and length.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.220
OK.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.790
So what this table
does is it tells us

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:27.040
that we have a
couple of segments.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.070
And whenever we refer to
a particular segment, what

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:33.140
this in some sense
means is that we're

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:37.380
talking about a chunk of memory
that starts at address base

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:42.140
and goes for this length
from that base upwards.

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.640
And the way that
this actually helps

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.190
us to enforce memory
bounds is that on x86,

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:51.530
every single instruction
in one way or another,

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:53.050
whenever it's
talking about memory,

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:55.150
actually talks about
memory with respect

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:58.820
to a particular
segment in this table.

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.366
So for example, when you
actually do something like move

01:06:02.366 --> 01:06:09.130
a memory value from a pointer
stored in the EAX register

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:12.400
into maybe another
pointer stored in the EBX

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.127
register, what you think it
does is it figures out, well,

01:06:16.127 --> 01:06:16.960
what's this address?

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.050
It knows the memory
at this address.

01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:20.091
And then it figures out,
OK, what's this address?

01:06:20.091 --> 01:06:21.700
And it stores the value there.

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:25.680
But in fact on x86, whenever
you're talking about memory,

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.900
there's an implicit--
what's called a segment

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.822
descriptor, which is kind of
like a file descriptor in Unix.

01:06:30.822 --> 01:06:33.744
It's just an index into
this descriptor table.

01:06:33.744 --> 01:06:36.450
And unless specified
otherwise, every opcode

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.490
has a default segment in it.

01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:40.946
So when you're
doing a move, this

01:06:40.946 --> 01:06:45.470
is actually relative to the DS
or the data segment register.

01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:47.790
So it's like a special
register in your CPU

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:51.250
that's a 16-bit integer,
if I remember correctly.

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:55.020
And that 16-bit integer points
into the descriptor table.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:55.810
And the same here.

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:59.370
This is actually the relative
to that DS segment selector.

01:06:59.370 --> 01:07:02.690
Actually, a bunch of these guys
are 6 segment selectors on x86.

01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:10.740
There's a code selector
CS, DS, ES, FS, GS, and SS.

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.709
And the code selector
is sort of implicitly

01:07:14.709 --> 01:07:16.000
used to fetch the instructions.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.360
So if your instruction
pointer points somewhere,

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.300
it's actually relative to what
the CS segment selector says.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:26.620
And most data references
implicitly use either DS or ES.

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.890
And then FS and GS are
some special things.

01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:30.920
And SS is always used
for the stack operations.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.020
If you push and
pop, they implicitly

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.625
come off of this
segment selector.

01:07:35.625 --> 01:07:38.400
It's a fairly baroque
machinery, but it turns out

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.270
to be hugely useful for
this particular use case

01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:46.630
because what happens is if you
access some address at maybe

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:53.390
some selector DS: some offset
or some address here, what

01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:57.250
the hardware will actually do
is translate it into-- well,

01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:59.680
it'll put this
address, and it'll

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:07.140
add the table of DS,
the base to this guy.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:10.730
And it'll actually
take the address modulo

01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:13.880
the length from the same table.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.390
So whenever you're
doing a memory access,

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:20.002
it's actually going to have the
base of your segment selectors,

01:08:20.002 --> 01:08:23.200
sort of descriptor table
entry, and take your address

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.250
that you're actually
specifying and mod it

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.390
with the length of the
corresponding segment.

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:29.689
Does this make sense?

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:32.750
It's a little baroque, but
that's what [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:34.730
AUDIENCE: So why isn't
this used, for example,

01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:36.334
for buffer protection?

01:08:36.334 --> 01:08:37.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:37.874
It's a good question.

01:08:37.874 --> 01:08:39.709
So could you use
this for protecting

01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:40.750
against buffer overflows?

01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:44.910
What's the plan?

01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:48.760
You could basically set up--
for every buffer that you have,

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.080
you could put the
buffer's base here.

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.892
You can put the size
of the buffer there.

01:08:53.892 --> 01:08:55.892
AUDIENCE: What if you
don't need to put it there

01:08:55.892 --> 01:08:57.183
before you want to write to it?

01:08:57.183 --> 01:08:58.890
You wouldn't need
it there constantly.

01:08:58.890 --> 01:08:59.569
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.250
So I think the reason
that this isn't

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.910
used so much for protecting
against buffer overflows

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:09.140
is that this table has at
most 2 to the 16 entries

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.605
because these descriptors
are actually 16 bits long.

01:09:11.605 --> 01:09:14.380
And in fact, a couple of the
bits are used for other stuff.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:18.010
So in fact, I think you can only
stick 2 to the 13 entries here.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:21.584
So if you have more than 2
to the 13 variable size array

01:09:21.584 --> 01:09:24.450
things in your code,
then it's probably

01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:26.130
going to overflow this table.

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:27.630
That was actually
a little bit weird

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.339
for the compiler to
manipulate this table

01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:30.963
because the way you
actually manipulate

01:09:30.963 --> 01:09:32.140
it is through system calls.

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.899
So you can't actually
directly write to this table.

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:36.060
You have to issue a system
call to the operating system.

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.934
And the operating system
will pull this table

01:09:37.934 --> 01:09:39.800
into the hardware for you.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.040
So I think most
compilers just don't

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.550
bother having this complicated
story for managing buffers.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:47.890
Multex actually did this though.

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:50.673
So on Multex, you
actually kind of have 2

01:09:50.673 --> 01:09:54.902
to the 18 distinct segments and
2 to the 18 possible offsets

01:09:54.902 --> 01:09:55.610
within a segment.

01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:58.270
And every possible
shared library chunk

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:00.020
or chunk of memory was
a distinct segment.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.240
And then they would
all be range checked,

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.134
not maybe at the variable level.

01:10:04.134 --> 01:10:04.634
But still.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:05.286
Yeah.

01:10:05.286 --> 01:10:07.119
AUDIENCE: Presumably,
it's also a bit slower

01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:09.110
if you have to tap into the
kernel all the time to--

01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.455
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:09.955
Yeah.

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:11.330
So there's also the overhead.

01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:13.610
I guess to set this up,
there would be some overhead.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:16.390
Or if you create a new buffer
on the stack, all of a sudden,

01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:20.510
you have to call in to
this guy and add an extra.

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:22.150
So yeah, it is nice machinery.

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:25.287
But it's mostly used
for coarser grain things

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:28.269
because of the overhead
of changing it a bit.

01:10:28.269 --> 01:10:30.750
Makes sense?

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:31.250
All right.

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.680
So how many of these
guys actually use

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.971
now the segmentation machinery?

01:10:33.971 --> 01:10:36.633
Well, you can sort of
guess how it works.

01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:38.910
I guess by default all
these segments in x86

01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:41.267
have a base of 0 and a
length of 2 to the 32.

01:10:41.267 --> 01:10:43.100
So you can access the
entire range of memory

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.730
you could possibly want.

01:10:44.730 --> 01:10:48.120
So for Native Client, what
they do is code in a base of 0

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:52.520
and a length of 256 Megs.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.680
And then they point
all these six segment

01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.070
selector registers to this
entry for a 256 Meg region.

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.700
So then whenever the hardware
does a memory access,

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:04.700
it's going to mod it.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.410
The offset was 256 Megs.

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:10.850
So it'll be restricted to the
256 Meg range of memory that's

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.040
allowed for the module
to [INAUDIBLE] modify.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.360
Makes sense?

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.850
All right.

01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:21.370
So I guess we sort of roughly
understand now this hardware

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:25.745
support and how this works and
how you could eventually do

01:11:25.745 --> 01:11:28.070
the wealth segment selectors.

01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:31.590
So if we just
implement this plan,

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:33.380
is there anything
that could go wrong?

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:37.160
Could we escape out of
the segment selector

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.440
in the untrusted module?

01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:43.640
I guess one thing
you have to watch out

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.534
for is that these registers are
just like regular registers.

01:11:46.534 --> 01:11:48.700
And you can actually move
values in and out of them.

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.630
So you have to make sure that
the untrusted module doesn't

01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:54.220
tamper with these registers,
the segment selectors,

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.535
because somewhere in
your descriptor table

01:11:56.535 --> 01:11:59.830
is also the original
segment descriptor

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:02.295
for your entire process,
which has a base of 0

01:12:02.295 --> 01:12:04.560
and a length of 2 to the 32.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.520
So if the untrusted
module could somehow

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.120
change the CS or DS or
ES or any of these guys

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.890
to point to this original
operating system that

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:16.370
covers your entire
address space,

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:18.578
then you could then do memory
references with respect

01:12:18.578 --> 01:12:22.070
to this segment and get
out of this sandbox.

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:25.137
So as a result,
Native Client has

01:12:25.137 --> 01:12:27.930
to add some more instructions
to this prohibited list.

01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:31.380
So I think they basically
prohibit all instructions that

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:35.590
move into a segment
selector DS, ES, et cetera,

01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:37.810
so that once you're
in the sandbox,

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:41.840
you cannot change the segment
that you are referencing things

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.472
with respect to.

01:12:43.472 --> 01:12:44.430
Makes sense?

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.930
Yeah.

01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:47.135
AUDIENCE: The segmentation such
and such provides [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:47.135 --> 01:12:47.801
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:12:47.801 --> 01:12:50.494
So it turns out that on
x86, the instructions

01:12:50.494 --> 01:12:53.040
to change the segment
descriptor table are privileged.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:56.210
But changing these
indices into the table

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.934
are completely unprivileged.

01:12:58.934 --> 01:13:00.355
Yeah.

01:13:00.355 --> 01:13:01.220
Other questions?

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:01.847
Yeah.

01:13:01.847 --> 01:13:03.430
AUDIENCE: Can you
initialize the table

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:07.380
to put all 0 lengths
in the unused slots?

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.520
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.532
So the unused slots--
you could-- yeah.

01:13:10.532 --> 01:13:11.990
You can set the
length of the table

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:14.390
to something so there
are no unused slots.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:18.460
It turns out that you actually
need this extra slot containing

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:22.260
0 and 2 to the 32 because
the trusted run time is going

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:25.680
to need to run in this segment
and access the entire memory

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:26.230
range.

01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:29.470
So you need this entry in
there for the trusted runtime

01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:30.390
to work.

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:31.150
Question?

01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:32.441
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] set list?

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.920
In order to set the table
output to some length,

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.615
do you need to--

01:13:35.615 --> 01:13:36.615
PROFESSOR: No, actually.

01:13:36.615 --> 01:13:37.420
It's pretty cool.

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:39.470
It was like something that
you don't have any root for.

01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:40.928
On Linux, there's
actually a system

01:13:40.928 --> 01:13:45.560
called-- I think it's called
modify_ldt for local descriptor

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:46.370
table.

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:48.780
And it lets any process
modify its own table.

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.792
These tables are
actually per process.

01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:53.250
Well, as everything in x86,
it's actually more complicated.

01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:55.333
There's a global table,
and there's a local table.

01:13:55.333 --> 01:13:57.148
But the local table
is for a process

01:13:57.148 --> 01:13:59.930
you can modify [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:01.416
Makes sense?

01:14:01.416 --> 01:14:03.601
All right.

01:14:03.601 --> 01:14:04.100
OK.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:06.987
So I guess one thing we
could now try to figure out

01:14:06.987 --> 01:14:11.780
is, how do we jump in and out
of the Native Client runtime

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.774
or out of the sandbox?

01:14:13.774 --> 01:14:15.440
So what does it mean
for us to jump out?

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.510
So we need to run
that trusted code.

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:19.540
And the trusted code
lives somewhere up

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.190
above the 256 Meg limit.

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:24.470
And in order to jump
there, we basically

01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:26.960
have to undo all these
protections that Native Client

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.220
sets in place.

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:32.204
And they basically boil down
to changing these selectors.

01:14:32.204 --> 01:14:33.745
So we already-- I
guess our validator

01:14:33.745 --> 01:14:35.520
isn't going to
enforce the same rules

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.880
for the stuff above 256 Megs.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.800
So that's easy enough.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.280
But then we need to somehow
jump into the trusted runtime

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.710
and reset these segment
selectors to the right values,

01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:50.440
to this giant segment that
covers the entire process

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:51.640
address space.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.490
So the way that works
on Native Client

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.220
is through this
mechanism they call

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.450
trampolines and springboards.

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:06.820
So all these guys
are things that live

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:12.020
in the low 64k of the module.

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:14.494
And the cool thing
about that is that these

01:15:14.494 --> 01:15:16.910
are going to be sort of chunks
of code laying at the lower

01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:18.910
64k of that process space.

01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:21.460
So that means that this
untrusted module can actually

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:24.850
jump there because it's
a valid code address.

01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:27.300
It's going to be on the 32
byte boundary potentially.

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.630
And it's going to be
within the 256 Meg limit.

01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:31.675
So you can jump to
these trampolines.

01:15:31.675 --> 01:15:33.920
But the Native Client
runtime is going

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.370
to actually copy
these trampolines

01:15:36.370 --> 01:15:37.560
from somewhere outside.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.430
So the Native
Client module isn't

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.730
allowed to supply its
own trampoline code.

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:43.905
The trampoline code comes
from the trusted runtime.

01:15:43.905 --> 01:15:45.405
So as a result, it
actually contains

01:15:45.405 --> 01:15:46.800
all these sensitive
instructions,

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.390
like moving DS
and CS, et cetera,

01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:55.240
that the untrusted code
itself is not allowed to have.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.320
So the way you actually
jump out of the sandbox

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.010
and into the trusted runtime
to do something like malop

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:04.790
or create a threat is you
jump to a trampoline, which

01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:06.600
lives at a 32 byte offset.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.150
So maybe it's an address.

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:08.970
Well, who knows?

01:16:08.970 --> 01:16:12.430
Maybe it's 4,096 plus 32.

01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.790
And it's going to have some
instructions to basically undo

01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:16.820
these segment selectors.

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.195
So what it's
probably going to do

01:16:18.195 --> 01:16:22.820
is it's going to move some
value-- I don't know, maybe 7--

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:26.420
into the DS register and maybe
some points to this entry here

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:30.670
that's allowed for the entire
2 to the 32 address space.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.140
And then you're going
to effectively move

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:39.140
CS and then jump somewhere
up into the service runtime.

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:44.382
And this is basically
going to be past 256 Megs.

01:16:44.382 --> 01:16:46.340
So there's going to be
this jump in here that's

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.140
not regularly allowed.

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.390
But we're going to be
OK with it because it's

01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:54.469
going to be into a point in the
trusted service runtime that

01:16:54.469 --> 01:16:55.574
is expecting these jumps.

01:16:55.574 --> 01:16:58.440
And it's going to perform
proper checks afterwards

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.846
on the arguments and
whatever else that is

01:17:01.846 --> 01:17:03.240
being passed around.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.060
And we can actually
do this, move DS here,

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.840
because we know that
it's actually safe.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.466
The code we're going
to jump to isn't

01:17:08.466 --> 01:17:10.090
going to do anything
arbitrary or funny

01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:13.340
with our untrusted module.

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:16.930
Makes sense roughly,
what's going on?

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:19.400
So why do these guys bother
jumping out of the segments?

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.020
Like, why not just put the
whole thing in the trampoline?

01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:27.885
It seems like more
work on some level.

01:17:27.885 --> 01:17:28.835
Yeah.

01:17:28.835 --> 01:17:29.937
AUDIENCE: We only have 64.

01:17:29.937 --> 01:17:32.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you don't
actually have a lot of space.

01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:34.270
Well, I guess you have 64k.

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:36.595
So that's potentially maybe
enough for-- maybe you

01:17:36.595 --> 01:17:38.140
can move a malop in there.

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:40.820
But the problem is not
so much the 64k thing

01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:43.090
but this 32 byte restriction.

01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:45.314
And it's actually
not a restriction

01:17:45.314 --> 01:17:47.355
on the trusted code,
because the trusted code can

01:17:47.355 --> 01:17:48.490
do whatever it wants here.

01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:49.790
It's not going to be checked.

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.520
The problem is that
the untrusted code can

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.890
jump to every 32 byte offset.

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:56.550
So every 32 byte
offset has to be

01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:59.390
prepared to be very
special in its arguments.

01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:03.080
So you probably are going
to have a hard time writing

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.500
this code here
with every 32 bytes

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.970
rechecking the arguments
and values and so on.

01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:10.980
So basically, you have to
jump out of the trampoline

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:17.750
and into the runtime up here
within 32 bytes of code.

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:19.375
So then if you jump
to the next thing,

01:18:19.375 --> 01:18:21.500
then, well, something else
is going to happen here.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:26.410
But it's not part of this
same trusted routine here.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.270
Makes sense?

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:28.850
OK.

01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:32.060
So this is how you sort of
jump out of the sandbox.

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:36.090
To jump back in, you also
need to-- you basically

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:37.850
need to invert these
transformations.

01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:41.280
You need to sort of set the
DS back and CS back and so on.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:44.320
And the tricky thing is that
if you're running outside

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.040
of this 256 Meg limit, if you're
running inside of the trusted

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.060
run time, then you can't really
reset these registers yet,

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.550
because otherwise,
you won't then

01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:58.019
be able to access any of the
memory in your space outside.

01:18:58.019 --> 01:19:00.310
So what they actually do is
they have this thing called

01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:03.211
a springboard, which
is how the trusted

01:19:03.211 --> 01:19:05.769
runtime from outside
the 256 Meg limit

01:19:05.769 --> 01:19:08.310
is actually going to jump back
into the Native Client module.

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:13.707
So here it's going to reload the
DS register with maybe whatever

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:16.060
that limit in the
segment descriptor is.

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:17.180
Maybe let's say it's 1.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:19.180
And then it's going
to reset other things,

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:24.190
and then it'll jump
to whatever address

01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:27.460
the trusted runtime
wants to return to

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.640
in the untrusted module.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.230
Makes sense?

01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:32.650
So this is how you
sort of jump back in.

01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:34.025
And the only sort
of tricky piece

01:19:34.025 --> 01:19:38.120
here is that you don't want
the untrusted code to jump

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.840
into the springboard itself.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.256
Maybe something
weird will happen.

01:19:41.256 --> 01:19:41.920
Who knows?

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.940
So what they do is they
actually put a halt instruction

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:49.330
as the first byte of this
32 byte multiple sequence.

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:52.896
So if you jump to the
beginning of this guy,

01:19:52.896 --> 01:19:55.750
you'll immediately halt.
The trusted runtime

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:59.070
is going to jump to
one past this byte

01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:01.165
and be able to execute
the springboard.

01:20:01.165 --> 01:20:03.800
But this is something that
only the trusted runtime can

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.321
do because regularly
checked, this

01:20:05.321 --> 01:20:05.950
is not going to be allowed.

01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:06.340
Question?

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:06.964
AUDIENCE: Wait.

01:20:06.964 --> 01:20:09.570
Is it a springboard in
the untrusted module?

01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:12.140
PROFESSOR: So the
springboard is within the 0

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.500
to 256 Meg part of
the untrusted module.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:17.210
But it actually lives
in that 64 bit chunk

01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:19.050
at the very beginning
that doesn't actually

01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.300
come from the binary you
download from some website.

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.690
But it's actually
patched into it

01:20:22.690 --> 01:20:25.315
by the Native Client
runtime when it first

01:20:25.315 --> 01:20:27.123
loads this module into memory.

01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.214
AUDIENCE: Why not just
have it in the runtime?

01:20:29.214 --> 01:20:29.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.780
So why not have
it in the runtime?

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.762
So what happens if the
runtime was allowed

01:20:32.762 --> 01:20:33.845
to supply the springboard?

01:20:38.269 --> 01:20:38.995
Is this bad?

01:20:43.094 --> 01:20:44.528
Yeah.

01:20:44.528 --> 01:20:47.635
AUDIENCE: How would
it know-- how would it

01:20:47.635 --> 01:20:49.320
know where to jump back to?

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.930
PROFESSOR: Well, I think what
this actually is is it actually

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.290
jumps to something like EAX.

01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:55.780
So the trusted
runtime says, oh, I

01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.342
want to return to this address.

01:20:57.342 --> 01:20:59.580
It puts it on the EAX
register, jumps here.

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:02.374
The springboard does this, this,
this and then jumps to EAX,

01:21:02.374 --> 01:21:05.130
wherever the trusted
runtime's set up to jump.

01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:08.960
So what if the module came
with its own springboard?

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:13.366
AUDIENCE: Well, you could do it
as a natural jump type thing.

01:21:13.366 --> 01:21:15.782
But it shouldn't know anything
about the descriptor table.

01:21:15.782 --> 01:21:16.710
That's a hardware--

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:17.376
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:21:17.376 --> 01:21:19.734
So actually, this is a
really important instruction

01:21:19.734 --> 01:21:22.025
for sandboxing, the fact that
we reload that descriptor

01:21:22.025 --> 01:21:25.130
to point at one of those
limited descriptors up there.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.220
It's really important.

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:30.360
And if the module was allowed
to supply its own springboard,

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:34.205
maybe it'll just skip this part
and then not restrict itself

01:21:34.205 --> 01:21:35.750
back to 256 Megs.

01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:37.640
So once you jump
through the springboard,

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.050
you'll be able to still access
the entire process address

01:21:40.050 --> 01:21:41.050
space.

01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:44.075
So the springboard is part
of the enforcement mechanism.

01:21:44.075 --> 01:21:46.050
It sort of sets
up the boundaries.

01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:47.642
So this is the
reason why I think

01:21:47.642 --> 01:21:51.914
they don't want the springboard
to come from the developer.

01:21:51.914 --> 01:21:53.440
Now-- yeah, question?

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.750
AUDIENCE: Can you put the
springboard past 256 megabytes?

01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:58.650
PROFESSOR: So I
think they don't want

01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:01.505
to put the springboard
past the 256 Megs

01:22:01.505 --> 01:22:04.450
because then you might
have trouble jumping down.

01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:07.720
So you want to jump to
a particular address,

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.780
but you also want to set
up extra registers here.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:14.660
So if you're-- I think this
basically has to-- sorry.

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.500
This has to do with setting
that CS code descriptor

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.645
segment because you want
to set the code descriptor

01:22:20.645 --> 01:22:23.060
segment to this bounded
segment, and you

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:25.789
want to jump to some particular
address at the same time.

01:22:25.789 --> 01:22:27.330
So I think it's
easier for these guys

01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:30.010
to do it through a springboard
because you first sort of jump

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:30.640
to here.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.436
Then you can set your CS value.

01:22:32.436 --> 01:22:34.060
But you can still
execute the same code

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:40.355
you're still running because
you're within the 256 bound.

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:42.215
Makes sense?

01:22:42.215 --> 01:22:44.500
I think basically it
has to do with what

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:47.510
atomic primitives the
hardware provides to you.

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:50.145
So basically, you want to set a
whole bunch of these DS segment

01:22:50.145 --> 01:22:52.644
selector registers and the CS
register and jump to somewhere

01:22:52.644 --> 01:22:53.870
at the same time.

01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:59.560
So this is one way
for them to do it.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.330
I think that's maybe
not as [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:04.532
Probably, if you tried
hard, you could probably

01:23:04.532 --> 01:23:06.490
come up with some x86
instruction sequence that

01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:10.039
could do it from outside
the bound of the address

01:23:10.039 --> 01:23:12.558
space in the module.

01:23:12.558 --> 01:23:13.433
Makes sense?

01:23:13.433 --> 01:23:13.932
All right.

01:23:13.932 --> 01:23:17.212
So I guess that's it
for Native Client.

01:23:17.212 --> 01:23:18.580
And I'll see you guys next week.

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.630
We'll talk about web
security as far as I know.
