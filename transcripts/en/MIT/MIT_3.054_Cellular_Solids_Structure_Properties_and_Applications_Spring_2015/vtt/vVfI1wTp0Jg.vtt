00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:26.940
LORNA GIBSON: All right.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.460
So last time we were talking
about tissue engineering

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.664
scaffolds.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.330
And what we're going
to talk about today

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.200
still has to do with tissue
engineering scaffolds,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.680
but we're going to look at it
from a different perspective.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.054
So last time we
were looking more

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:39.580
at sort of a
clinical perspective,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.740
and looking at those
osteochondral scaffolds

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.740
for repairing small
defects in cartilage.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.430
And today what we're
going to talk about

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.800
are how cells-- how
biological cells,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.600
interact with the scaffolds.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.660
And there's various
kinds of interactions.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.620
So we're going to go
through a bunch of these.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.310
So the first one I'm
going to talk about

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.830
is degradation of the scaffolds.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.220
Then we'll talk about
the cell attachment.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.750
Cell morphology-- so the shape
of the pores in the scaffold

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.300
can affect the way the
biological cells-- what

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.020
shape they have.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.490
Biological cells could
also contract the scaffold

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.780
and apply mechanical forces.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.030
So we're going to
talk about that.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.360
The stiffness of the
scaffold and the pore size

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.736
can affect the speed
of cell migration.

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:24.110
And the stiffness
of the scaffold

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.790
can affect the differentiation
of cells, so from one cell type

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.565
to another.

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:30.190
So I thought today
I'd talk about that.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.230
This probably won't
take the whole hour.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.980
The next topic is on
energy absorption in foams.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.100
And so we'll probably start that
towards the end of the lecture.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.380
OK.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.000
So the idea here is
that we're looking

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.070
at how scaffolds are
being used, really,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.380
to provide a 3D
environment to characterize

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.530
the behavior of cells.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.320
And in particular,
how the cells interact

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960
with their environment.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.490
So let's write that down.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.460
So how the cell behavior is
affected by the substrate

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.970
it's on.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.040
OK.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.873
So the first thing we're
going to talk about

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.160
is scaffold degradation.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.850
And if you think of the
native extracellular matrix,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.040
the cells secrete enzymes
which resorb that matrix

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.722
and then they also
deposit new matrix.

00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:06.180
So it was kind of
like what we were

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.346
talking about with the bone.

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:09.830
The bone is always being
resorbed and deposited.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.270
And if there's a balance
between that those two,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.110
then the density of the
bone stays the same.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.770
And if one of the rates
gets out of whack,

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.200
then you get osteoporosis
and you lose bone mass.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.670
So the idea is that in just the
native extracellular matrix,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.970
the cells are producing enzymes
that degrade the scaffold.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.610
And those enzymes are also
going to degrade the tissue

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.640
engineering scaffolds as well.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.360
And you want to
be able to control

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.680
the rate of degradation,
versus the rate

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.910
at which the native
extracellular

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.470
matrix gets deposited.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.880
Excuse me, sorry.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.880
So you can kind of imagine
if the tissue engineering

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.570
scaffold did not
resorb quickly enough,

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.020
you'd have scaffold there.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.330
And the cells would
be trying to put down

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.038
their own extracellular
matrix, and there

00:03:55.038 --> 00:03:57.230
wouldn't be a place to put it.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.274
And if it resorbs too
quickly, then the cells

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:01.690
don't have something
to attach to.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.500
So there has to be a balance
between the rate at which

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.470
the enzymes are resorbing the
tissue engineering scaffold,

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.130
versus the rate at which
the cells are depositing

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.947
their own extracellular matrix.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.650
So in the native
extracellular matrix,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.670
the enzymes produced
by the cells

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.180
are resorbing the
extracellular matrix.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:05:00.270
And then the cells are
also synthesizing so they

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.526
synthesize ECM to replace it.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.649
So the cells are also going to
degrade the tissue engineering

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:15.690
scaffold that you put in.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.850
And the length of time that
the scaffold is insoluble,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.940
or so that it remains
in the body as a solid,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.370
is called the residence time.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.180
And so then we require
the scaffold degradation

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.765
to occur over a time that
balances with the new ECM

00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:14.265
synthesis.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.570
And so the scaffold
residence time

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.430
must be about equal
to the time required

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.258
to make new native
extracellular matrix.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.820
So the degradation rate
depends on the composition

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.974
of the scaffold, on how
much cross linking there is,

00:07:44.974 --> 00:07:46.140
and on the relative density.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.130
Obviously, the more
scaffold there is,

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.375
the longer it's going
to take to degrade it.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.550
And with synthetic polymers you
can vary the molecular weight

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:28.670
of the polymer.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.460
And sometimes if
you have copolymers,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.610
one may degrade
faster than the other.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.919
And you can control the balance
of how much of each copolymer

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.419
you have.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.860
And for natural
proteins, like collagen,

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.920
you can control the
amount of cross linking.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.700
So you can do the cross
linking by various techniques.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.220
That's what's called
physical methods.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.130
There's something called
dehydrothermal treatment, where

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:31.500
you heat the collagen up to
105 degrees C in a vacuum,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.170
in a dry environment.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:38.120
And that eliminates water and
causes more cross linking.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.740
There's a UV treatment,
ultraviolet light treatment,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.510
you can use.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.710
And there's also chemical
cross linkers you can use.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.130
So there's different
chemical methods you can also

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:52.665
use to cross link the collagen.

00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:53.164
OK.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.220
So the next thing I wanted to
talk about was cell adhesion.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.850
And let's just wait a minute
for people to catch up.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.870
Are we just about there?

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.500
So this next slide shows
a sort of schematic

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.260
of how a cell would
adhere to a substrate.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.730
So down at the bottom here,
all these little squiggly lines

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.065
are representing the
extracellular matrix

00:12:29.065 --> 00:12:29.940
in the native tissue.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.640
Or you can think of it as
a, say, a collagen scaffold.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.500
But here we have the ECM.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.930
And this little blob
here is our cell.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.470
This is the nucleus of the cell
here, the little green blob

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.550
in the middle.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.210
And the cell is
attached to the ECM

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.920
through something called
focal adhesion points.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.070
And this schematic here is a
blow up of that focal adhesion.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.060
And at the focal
adhesion there's

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.810
proteins called integrins.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.270
And integrins pass
across the cell membrane.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.090
So the idea is the
integrins attach to ligands

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.950
on the extracellular matrix.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.560
And then they also attached
to the sub membrane plaque

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.760
within the cell.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.900
And then that plaque attaches
to the side of skeleton.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.640
Things like actin
filaments within the cell.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.800
So this is what
attaches the cell

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.390
as a whole to the
extracellular matrix,

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.610
is these focal
adhesion sites here.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:28.680
And different kinds of
cell behaviors-- obviously,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.250
things like cell
attachment, but also

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.690
things like cell
migration, are affected

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.458
by those focal adhesions there.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:48.400
So we have that the cells attach
to the ECM at focal adhesions.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.300
And sometimes you see those
referred to just as FA.

00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:06.370
And at the adhesion point
the cell has integrins.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.890
And the integrins are
transmembrane proteins,

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.220
so they go across the membrane.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.790
And they bind to
like ends on the ECM.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.770
And then the other
end of the integrin

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.980
is attached to the submembrane
plaque within the cell.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.160
And then that connects
to the cytoskeleton.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.520
And then different kinds
of cell behaviors-- so

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.040
for example, things
like adhesion,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.744
and proliferation,
and migration.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.330
And that cell contraction,
we're going to talk more

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.460
about that in a minute.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.442
They all depend in part on
this adhesion between the cells

00:16:07.442 --> 00:16:08.650
and the extracellular matrix.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.900
And the biological activity
depends on how many

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.150
binding sites there are.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.000
So if you think of the
extracellular matrix,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.930
it's got these
ligands and it depends

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.151
on the density of binding
sites, how much interaction

00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:20.650
you can get.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.460
So things like how much
cell attachment you can get,

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.920
depends in part on just how
many of these binding sites

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.600
you've got for the
cells to attach to.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.730
And that density of
the binding sites

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.230
or the density of the ligands
depends on the composition

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.210
of the scaffold.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.060
But also on the surface area
per unit volume of the scaffold.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.970
So if you think of first,
just the composition,

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.060
if you have native proteins,
like collagen, they

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.700
have binding sites themselves.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.390
They have native binding sites.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.900
But if you think of
synthetic polymers,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.570
like the resorbable
sutured type of polymers

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.890
that we talked about, they
don't have binding sites

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.530
and you have to coat the
scaffold with some sort

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.040
of adhesive protein.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.960
And then the surface area per
unit volume of the scaffold

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.950
is related to the pore size
and the relative density.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:12.100
Let's call the
specific surface area,

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.645
surface area per unit volume.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.410
And if you think of having
some scaffold that's

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.150
like an open celled
foam, you can roughly

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.430
calculate what the surface
area per unit volume is.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.860
So say each strut
was a cylinder,

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.290
then the surface
area of each cylinder

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.000
is going to be 2 pi rl.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.050
If each one has a
radius r and a length l.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.480
Say we had n of them, that
would be your surface area.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.240
And the volume of the whole
scaffold, or one cell,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.240
would go as l cubed, the
length of each strut cubed.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.200
So if we just forget about
all the constants here.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.430
Forget about n.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:11.790
This just goes as r
over l times 1 over l,

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:17.270
and that goes as the relative
density to the 1/2 power

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.310
times 1 over the pore size.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.610
So the specific surface area
depends on the relative density

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.602
and on the pore size.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.645
And if you have a
tetrakaidecahedron cell,

00:21:33.645 --> 00:21:35.770
you can work out exactly
what that relationship is.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:36.790
It's sort of a model.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.910
And that gives you the
relationship there.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.670
And in this particular
case, I think

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.200
the relative density was 0.5%.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.860
And so it's a constant
over the cell size.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.290
So one of the things
we did in my group

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.090
was look at how cell
attachment varied

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.230
with this specific surface area.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.170
So we seeded cells onto
scaffolds of different pore

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:57.744
sizes.

00:21:57.744 --> 00:21:59.285
We kept the relative
density constant

00:21:59.285 --> 00:22:01.440
and we changed the pore sizes.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.040
Remember I said, when we make
these scaffolds by freeze

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.800
drying we can control
the pore size,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.920
by controlling the
freezing temperature.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.060
And we see that it's just a
linear relationship between how

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.620
many cells attach, or the
percentage of the cells

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.430
that were seeded that attach,
and the specific surface area.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.710
In here we used MC 3T3 cells.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.270
It's sort of a standard
cell one that you can get.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.500
So Fergal O'Brien was
the post-doc in my group

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.080
who did that.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:37.030
So I'll just say we
find cell attachment is

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.300
proportional to the
specific surface area.

00:22:47.841 --> 00:22:48.340
OK.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:54.672
So that's the cell attachment.

00:22:54.672 --> 00:22:56.630
So you can see how the
scaffold design is going

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.310
to affect how the cells attach.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.600
So there's some relationship
between them there.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.770
Another thing people have
looked at is cell morphology.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.630
And so if you change, the sort
of, orientation of the pores,

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.630
how does that change the
orientation of the cells?

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.380
So this was a study
done in another group.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.087
So here we have
randomly oriented fibers

00:23:14.087 --> 00:23:15.170
that make up the scaffold.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.430
And here they're not
perfectly oriented this way,

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.554
but more or less.

00:23:18.554 --> 00:23:19.970
And then these are
cells that have

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.630
been seeded onto them, so
that the green staining is

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:23.650
the cells.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.880
And you can see if the
scaffold is random,

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.040
the cells themselves line
up with that fiber structure

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.600
and become more or less random.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.450
And if the scaffold
has fibers that

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.380
are aligned, then
the cells, they also

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.030
line up and be aligned.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.040
So the morphology
of the cells can

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.040
be affected by the orientation
of the scaffold pores.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.390
Also the cell morphology
can be affected

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.850
by the stiffness of the cells.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.880
Or the stiffness
of the substrate.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.110
So this is a substrate.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:24:00.140
Here this was a
PEG-fibrinogen hydrogel.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.340
And they varied the cross
linking of this hydrogel.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.400
So they got different
modularly for the hydrogel.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.730
So these numbers here, are
all the stiffness of the four

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.630
different hydrogels.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.040
And you can see the
cell morphology changes

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.130
from being a spread out thing
on the least stiff substrate,

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.310
to being just a little
spherical or circular blob

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.640
on the most stiff substrate.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.760
So the cells respond
to the substrate.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.420
And so how the cells
behave, depends

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.695
in part on their environment.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.060
So I wanted to also talk
about womb contraction.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:43.060
And talk about how cells
contract scaffolds as well.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.900
So one of the things
people have found

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.990
when they look at say, skin
and regeneration of skin--

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.260
so say you had
somebody with a burn

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.040
and the surgeons will
clean the burnt out.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.140
And then what will
happen as it heals,

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.250
is scar tissue will form.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.240
And the scar tissue
forms in conjunction

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.660
with the wound contracting.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.170
So cells will actually
migrate into the wound bed

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.780
and they'll pull the
edges of the wound

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.350
together to try to
close the wound.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.070
And they won't
close it completely,

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.680
but they'll partially close it.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.520
And that's called
wound contraction.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.110
And that is thought to be
associated with the formation

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.420
of scar tissue.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.310
So the cells can actually
apply mechanical loads.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.740
And they can contract the wound.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.190
And one of the things that
Professor Yannas found

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.160
was that if you use one of his
collagen and gag scaffolds,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.010
you can inhibit that
wound contraction.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.510
And if you can prevent the wound
contraction from occurring,

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.090
you also prevent the
formation of the scar tissue.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.080
And that allows
normal dermis to form.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.230
So you get normal skin.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.440
So this photograph
here is of somebody

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.470
who had burns over
their entire torso.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.770
And they put this tissue
injury scaffold on this part

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.000
at the bottom, but not
on that part at the top.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.630
And you can see these lines
here are contracture lines

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.090
from the scar formation.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.380
And you can see this skin down
here is relatively normal.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.420
And in fact, when people look
at the histology of the skin

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.430
the forms using
these scaffolds, they

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.349
find that it is pretty much
the same as normal dermis.

00:26:14.349 --> 00:26:17.015
It doesn't have sweat glands and
it doesn't have hair follicles.

00:26:17.015 --> 00:26:19.980
So you can't sweat from that
skin and you don't grow hair.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.020
But apart from that, it's
more or less normal dermis.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.714
So this observation
that if you can inhibit

00:26:26.714 --> 00:26:28.880
the womb contraction, you
can prevent scar formation

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.782
and you can get
normal dermis to form.

00:26:30.782 --> 00:26:32.240
That's led to some
interest in just

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.970
seeing how is it that the cells
do this contract l process.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.417
I think hitting the thing
and my battery is dead.

00:26:40.417 --> 00:26:42.000
So one of the things
people have done,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.530
is they've just taken what's
called, free floating scaffold.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.321
They've just taken
little disks of scaffold

00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:50.160
and put it in a cell culture
medium in a Petri dish.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.690
And they find that if you
put, say fiberblast on it,

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.096
the fiberblast will
contract that scaffold.

00:26:55.096 --> 00:26:56.470
And people have
measured how much

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.490
the diameter of the
scaffold changes.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.490
And so they've kind of
measured this contraction

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.030
just by-- it's almost
like measuring a strain.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.680
And what we wanted
to do is we wanted

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.990
to try to measure the
forces that were involved.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.640
So we first developed something
called a cell force monitor,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.260
and I'll show you that.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.884
And then we tried to calculate
how much an individual cell

00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:17.300
could apply in
terms of the force.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.210
So we used this scaffold here.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:26.290
This is the same collagen GAG
scaffold I showed you before.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.840
And here's the
cell force monitor.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.690
So that's just a
schematic of holding

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.170
a piece of the scaffold
between two clamps.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.017
So here it is in elevation view.

00:27:37.017 --> 00:27:38.850
And then I'll just build
the whole thing up,

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.016
so you can see how it works.

00:27:40.016 --> 00:27:41.560
So it's on a base plate.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.030
It's attached to a horizontal
stage that's adjustable.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.612
Then there's a very
thin beam here.

00:27:47.612 --> 00:27:49.320
So this is another
adjustable stage here,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.190
and this very thin beam here.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.145
And that's attached to
one end of this clamp.

00:27:53.145 --> 00:27:54.320
And here's the matrix.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.480
And this is attached to this
other adjustable stage here.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.610
And then when we have
a proximity sensor-- so

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.210
what's going to happen is,
this is fixed over here.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.830
The scaffold is
going to contract

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:11.410
with the cells applying
these contract l forces.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.870
This beam here is going to
bend and the proximity sensor

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.495
is going to tell us
how much it's bent.

00:28:15.495 --> 00:28:17.400
So we can measure
how much that's bent.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.460
If we know how much that's
bent, and we calibrate the beam,

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.960
we can figure out the
force in the beam.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.460
OK.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.220
So we can figure out how much is
the total force that the cells

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.020
are contracting with.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.070
And then this just is a
little silicone well with

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.903
some culture medium.

00:28:28.903 --> 00:28:30.240
So that's the whole setup there.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.770
Toby Fryman was a student
who did that, who's

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.360
married to Professor Van Vliet.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.110
And I have a very big soft
spot for both of them.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.720
So anyway, that's the set up.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.500
And the thing that Toby
measured was the force,

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.600
by measuring how much
that beam deflected.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.830
And he measured the
force over time.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.900
And he found that if he put say,
a certain number of fiberblasts

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.580
onto the scaffold, the force
would increase and then reach

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.320
an asymptotic point.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.530
And you could describe these
curves by this equation here.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.160
Here's the asymptotic force.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.870
And it's a 1 minus exponential
of minus time over a time

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.600
constant tao.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.260
And then this number here
is the number of fiberblast

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.820
that were attached at 22 hours.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.900
So he ran these
tests for 22 hours.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.020
And when he was
finished, he could

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.690
count the number of cells that
were attached in the scaffolds.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.650
So you would just wash off any
cells that weren't attached

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.180
and you can do accounting
of how many cells are left.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.750
And one of the
things that he found

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.220
was that if you plot that
asymptotic force-- if you plot

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.470
through this force over here,
against the number of cells

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.760
that were attached, you just
get a linear relationship.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.190
And the slope of that is
roughly the force per cell.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.100
And that's about
one nano neutron.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.930
Now this is a little deceptive
because not all the cells

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.044
are contracting.

00:29:49.044 --> 00:29:51.210
And not all the cells are
lined up in one direction.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.085
So there are cells in
different orientations.

00:29:53.085 --> 00:29:54.700
But just as an
order of magnitude

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.100
the cells are applying something
like one minute per cell.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.900
So that's the effect
of the cell number.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.350
Another thing he
did was he looked

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.000
at what happens if you change
the stiffness of that beam if.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.090
You make that beam in the
device different stiffnesses,

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.880
how do the cells react.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.810
And so the stiffness here are
the stiffness of the system.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.230
So there's 0.7 newtons
per meter up to ten,

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.830
so it's a factor of a
little over ten difference.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:23.050
And you can see the
displacement per cell changes.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:29.350
The stiffer the system is the
less the cells can displace it.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.700
But if you then plot
the force per cell,

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.260
you find that the force
per cell is about the same.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.320
So you develop about
the same force.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.970
So that suggests the cells
are capable of applying

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.520
a certain amount of force,
and not any more force.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.000
No larger force.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.874
So he did that.

00:30:45.874 --> 00:30:48.290
Then we were interested in
what was the mechanism of this.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.200
How were the cells
applying this force?

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.550
Because I was kind of
surprised to find out the cells

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.247
even could apply forces.

00:30:54.247 --> 00:30:55.830
So we were interested
in understanding

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.549
the mechanism of this.

00:30:58.549 --> 00:31:01.090
And one of the things we knew
that we didn't quite figure out

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.850
how this all worked
together was,

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.496
we knew that the
cells elongated.

00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:06.995
If you just take a substrate,
like even just a 2d substrate,

00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:10.160
and you put cells on it they'll
be rounded to start out with.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.490
And over time, over a few
hours, they'll spread.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:14.230
And that's pretty standard.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.940
Many types of
cells will do that.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.120
So we knew the cells were
starting off as rounded

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.967
and they were spreading.

00:31:19.967 --> 00:31:22.300
So the cells are getting
longer, but our whole scaffolds

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.060
getting shorter.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.640
And so it wasn't obvious how
was the cells going longer,

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.570
but the scaffold's
getting shorter.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.810
And so the next thing
we thought we would do

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:32.450
is just watch the cells
and see what they did.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:36.410
And so we measured the
aspect ratio of the cells

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.980
at different time points.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.320
And we did this by
just impregnating

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.280
the scaffold in the
cells at different time

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.200
points with a resin,
and then using a stain,

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.202
and then using digital
image analysis.

00:31:49.202 --> 00:31:51.410
So what we found was that
the fiber of the fiberglass

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.050
morphology looked like this.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.430
So the long thready
things of the scaffold,

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.600
and these little blobs here are
the fiberblast of the cells.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.110
So here at time 0 you
can see-- like I said,

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.700
the cells are pretty rounded
they're not very spread out.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.610
Here at eight hours
you can see-- here's

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:07.190
a cell that's gotten longer.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:08.040
Here's another one.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.400
This guy here is still
rounded, it's not doing much.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.300
22 hours, again, some of the
cells are quite elongated.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.290
Some of them are still
not that elongated.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.405
So they don't all become active.

00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:19.780
But one of the
things we noticed,

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.680
if you look at this image
here, you can see these cells

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.666
are attached at one end,
and at the other end.

00:32:24.666 --> 00:32:26.290
But they're not
attached in the middle.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.480
There's sort of a gap between
the cell and the strut.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.020
And this is another
example here.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.740
Here's a cell here, and this
is the collagen GAG strut

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.204
that it's attached to.

00:32:36.204 --> 00:32:38.120
And you can see it's
attached to the two ends,

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.430
but not in the middle.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:42.420
And this starts
to explain how it

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.630
is that the cells are elongating
but the scaffolds getting

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:46.460
shorter.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.090
It's that the cells are
just attached at two ends.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.070
And the cells are
moving along a strut

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.860
and they're attached
to the two ends.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.300
And if you think of
the cells attached

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.320
through those focal
adhesion points,

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.500
they're applying
tension to the cell.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.540
And the actin filaments in
the cell are in tension.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.450
Obviously, filaments
can't be in compression.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.960
They're only going
to be in tension.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.990
And what happens is that puts
the stress into compression.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.050
And if the struts in
compression, at some point

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.200
it's going to buckle.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.680
And you can see this
strut here has basically

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.710
buckled under that cell.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.830
And so if the cells
are getting longer,

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:22.860
and they're buckling
the struts, then that's

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.021
going to shorten the struts
and the whole scaffold

00:33:25.021 --> 00:33:26.020
is going to get shorter.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:32.500
And so then Toby plotted the
aspect ratio of the cell,

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.690
so that is a measure of their
elongation against the time.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.580
And again, he found
one of these curves

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.310
with the same kind
of form as the curve

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.220
for the forced development.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.210
And he found the
time constant here

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.550
for the change in the aspect
ratio was about five hours.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.640
And for the development of the
force it was about 5.7 hours.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.350
So the time constant for
the elongation of the cells,

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.200
more or less matches
up with a time

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.560
constant for
developing the force.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.560
So that's what that says.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.280
And that suggests there's a
link between the elongation

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.170
of the cell population and
the macroscopic contraction

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.760
of the population.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.250
So then we wanted to
take it one step further.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.849
And we wanted to look at what
the cells were doing live.

00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:15.239
Like as they were doing it.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:18.429
So Toby devised this little
schematic thing here.

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.179
So he had just an
optical microscope.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:26.449
He had a microscope slide with
a fairly thick well in it,

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:29.040
so that we could put
culture medium in the well.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.800
We put a cell seeded
matrix in here.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.290
And he had a heated stage here.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:37.067
And then he took little videos
of what the cells were doing.

00:34:37.067 --> 00:34:39.400
And this required some patience
because as you could see

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.510
not all the cells did anything.

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.179
Some of them just sat
there and did nothing.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:43.960
So he would set this up for
a day, and watch a cell,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.050
and it would do nothing.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.883
And then he would have
to find another cell.

00:34:46.883 --> 00:34:48.810
But he did find
some cells that were

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.230
responsible for the contraction.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:52.560
And that was it
was kind of neat.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.769
So here's the scaffold again.

00:34:53.769 --> 00:34:55.601
All these little bits
here are the scaffold.

00:34:55.601 --> 00:34:57.090
This is a strut of the scaffold.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.710
And this is a fiberblast
parked on the scaffold.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.340
And this has a
little video here.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.780
And you can see what's
happening is the strut here

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.300
is starting to buckle.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.877
And you can see
these two sides here,

00:35:10.877 --> 00:35:12.710
those two things are
coming closer together.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.860
So they originally
were this piece here,

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.750
and that piece there.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.357
And now they're at
that point there.

00:35:18.357 --> 00:35:20.190
And then if I let it
go a little bit longer,

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.290
it continues to do that process.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:27.860
And then the final thing--
this kind of smushed up mess

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.740
here is these two things having
me brought completely together.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.470
And this strut here is
some strut down over here.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:39.110
So you can see how the cells
are elongating and causing

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:41.580
contraction of the scaffold.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.240
Here's a series of stills taken
from another video that he did.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.840
So this sort of square
thing is the scaffold.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.100
So b is the scaffold.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.510
And a, this little blob
here, is the fiberblast.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.904
And you can see, even from
this image to this one,

00:35:54.904 --> 00:35:57.070
you can see that the
fiberblast has spread a little.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.730
Do you see how it's kind of
oozed out along the scaffold

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:00.930
there.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.186
And eventually it
attaches over here.

00:36:03.186 --> 00:36:04.560
And you can see
that it's buckled

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.322
this strut underneath it.

00:36:06.322 --> 00:36:08.030
And here it's a little
bit more deformed.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.420
It then grabs on
down here somewhere

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.560
and deforms it even more.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.920
So you can see
that's more deformed.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.920
And then Toby put alcohol
on the whole thing,

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.829
which kills the cells
and the cell let's go.

00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:22.995
And you can see you recover
some of the deformation.

00:36:22.995 --> 00:36:26.920
You don't recover all of it,
but you recover some of it.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.685
This was another example.

00:36:28.685 --> 00:36:30.060
And this was kind
of interesting.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.780
Here there was a
scaffold junction

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.310
where there were three
struts that came together,

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.870
a little bit like a strut.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:38.890
And there was a little
cell right there.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:40.570
And you can see
the cell elongates.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.920
You see how this
elongated and its grabbing

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.670
on up here somewhere.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.680
But the amount of
force the cell was

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.930
kind of pulling with must
have been less than the--

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:54.610
or rather must been
more than the force

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:55.720
of the focal adhesion.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.178
Because what happens
was eventually

00:36:57.178 --> 00:36:58.860
the focal adhesion let go.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.630
And the cell kind of bounces
back and ends up over here.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.130
So the cell was
kind of snapped back

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.430
on to the other focal
adhesion over here.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.080
And here it's rounded again.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.770
And here it elongates again.

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.860
And then this focal
adhesion lets go

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.260
and now it's moved
back over to there.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.900
So these struts
here are so stiff.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.770
They're much stiffer,
I think, partly

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:19.978
because they're triangulated.

00:37:19.978 --> 00:37:22.820
And it looks like they're just
shorter and a lot thicker.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.340
The cell isn't being
able to deform those.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:29.510
But it's elongating and then
focal adhesion was letting go.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.720
So this is a little schematic
of what we thinks going on.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.490
So the cell starts out--
it's some elongation here.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:36.810
It's attached at that point.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.460
It's attached at
that point there.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.930
And the cell is getting longer.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.270
And if you think about it as
the cell's getting longer--

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.260
if you think about the
Euler Buckling formula,

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.200
the buckling load goes
as 1 over l squared.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.780
So the longer the
length of this piece

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:54.940
of the strut of the scaffold
underneath the cell is,

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.367
the smaller the load it takes
to actually cause it to buckle.

00:37:58.367 --> 00:37:59.950
So at some point it
buckles like this.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.060
And this is just a
little force diagram.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.930
So the actin fibers
are in tension

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.870
and the matrix strut
is in compression.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:07.980
Sometimes we saw some bending.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.040
So you could see if a cell was
spanning between two struts,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.390
you could get the cell
bending the struts as well.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:15.860
That was another possibility.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.310
And so we think that
the cell elongation

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.070
was related to the contraction.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.650
The time constants for the two
things were almost the same.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:27.450
And as the cell elongates
there's a gap between the cell

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.060
and the matrix on
the central portion.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.740
And then the cell is adhered at
the periphery of the adhesion

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.700
points.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.860
And then the tensile
forces in these act.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.430
And filaments inside the
cell induce compression

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.690
in the strut, and
that causes buckling.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.240
And then Toby graduated.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.310
And then I got another
student, Brendan.

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.620
And Brendan saw what
Toby did and he wanted

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.540
to do a little more with that.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.041
Brandon was also involved
that osteochondral project

00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.290
that I talked about last time.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.940
And Brendan this other thing
as well for his project.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.390
So he wanted to measure the
force of an individual cell.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.460
So when we had that
cell force monitor,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.540
that was the total force of
all the cells in that one

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.720
direction.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.670
But Brendan wanted to
know if he could measure

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.600
the force of a single cell.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.480
And now that we knew that the
contractal process was related

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.590
to buckling, We thought,
well, we could just

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.570
use Euler's formula.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.830
If we knew what the
modulus of the solid

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:24.690
was, and we knew what the
dimensions of the struts were.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:27.220
So that would allow us to
calculate the contractile force

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.271
of a single fiberblast.

00:39:30.271 --> 00:39:32.020
So I think I've shown
you this thing here.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.061
So Brendan was the one
who did these experiments.

00:39:34.061 --> 00:39:37.840
He cut a single strut
out of the scaffold.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.090
And the single strut is
about 100 microns long.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.750
He used a microscope to do this.

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.510
He then glued it
onto a glass slide

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.640
and he used the atomic
force microscope probe

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.140
to bend the strut like
a cantilever beam.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.010
And he measured this
displacement here.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.940
And from that he could back out
what the modulus of the solid

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.890
was.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.920
He did these tests
in the dry state.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.340
But we could extrapolate
to the wet state

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.760
from looking at the behavior
of the whole scaffold.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:10.190
So he had a modulus for
the wet scaffold solid.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.760
And then this is our formula
for Euler buckling here.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.240
So that's just the
standard formula.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.590
I had a student from
civil engineering, who

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:24.067
looked at hydrostatic loading
of a tetrakaidecahedral cell

00:40:24.067 --> 00:40:25.150
and he looked at buckling.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.310
If you had a
tetrakaidecahedral cell and you

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.397
load it in all three directions.

00:40:29.397 --> 00:40:30.480
He looked at the buckling.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.110
And he had calculated that
the n constraint factor--

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:36.060
the n squared was point 0.34.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.010
So we have some idea of what
that n squared value should be.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:41.750
Although it's somewhat
of an estimate.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.000
I had a UROP student
who took Toby's images

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.420
and measured the
dimensions of the struts.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.422
So he measured the diameter and
the thickness of the struts.

00:40:50.422 --> 00:40:52.130
And from that, we just
plugged everything

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.480
into the Euler formula.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.070
And we found that the
average single cell

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:59.220
force is somewhere between
about 11 and 41 nano neutron.

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.169
It was something like
26 nano neutrons.

00:41:01.169 --> 00:41:03.460
So it would make sense that
it's more than the one nano

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.040
neutron per cell because not
all of those cells were active

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.850
and they weren't all going
in the same direction.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:11.950
So Brendan Harley and Matt Wong
did that part of the project.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:16.570
OK.

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:17.710
So that's the contraction.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.220
Are we good with contraction?

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.386
So it's kind of interesting
that cells will contract

00:41:21.386 --> 00:41:23.490
and we can measure some forces.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:26.015
So the next type of
interaction between the cells

00:41:26.015 --> 00:41:27.890
and the scaffolds that
I wanted to talk about

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:29.890
is cell migration.

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.427
And these are some studies
from the literature.

00:41:32.427 --> 00:41:33.760
These are two different studies.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.870
But the top one here, they've
measured migration rate

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.730
as a function of
the cross linking

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.790
treatment of a scaffold.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.327
And the decreasing
stiffness goes this way.

00:41:44.327 --> 00:41:46.660
And so they're seeing that
the speed of migration-- this

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.810
is in millimeters per day.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.110
Cells don't move too quickly.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:52.330
They go millimeters per day.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:55.370
But you can see that the
migration speed, the speed

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.340
at which the cells
can move, depends

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.050
on the stiffness of the scaffold
that they're attached to.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:03.790
And in this study on the
bottom here, what they did was

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:07.440
they had just a
flat 2d substrate.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.550
Just a flat polymer.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:12.420
And what they did was they cross
linked one part of the polymer

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.660
more than the other
part of polymer.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.600
So over here, this was
the less cross linked.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.040
That was the soft part.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.790
And this was the more
highly cross linked.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.460
This was the stiffer part.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.110
And they found that if they
put a cell on the soft part

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.730
it would migrate
onto the stiff part.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.230
But if they put a cell
on the stiff part,

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.702
it would start going this
way towards the soft part.

00:42:32.702 --> 00:42:34.160
But when it got to
the interface it

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.290
would just spread out
along the interface.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:38.790
And it wouldn't go
into the soft part.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.540
So the cells were
somehow sensing

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.152
the stiffness of the substrate.

00:42:42.152 --> 00:42:44.610
And for some reason, I don't
know what, but for some reason

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.450
these particular
cells seem to prefer

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.559
being on the stiff substrate.

00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:50.350
So this is just really
showing that there's

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:53.440
some interaction between the
substrate stiffness and the way

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.440
the cells are behaving
and migrating.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:01.030
And then Brendan also
wanted to study this.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.172
And he got some of the
collagen GAG scaffold.

00:43:04.172 --> 00:43:05.380
He made some of the scaffold.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.000
And he stained that with a
stain that made it turn red.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.660
So these lines here are all
red struts in the scaffold.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.440
And then he put fiberblasts
on to the scaffold

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.530
and stained them green.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:20.430
So all these little blobs here
that are green are the cells.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:22.290
And then he used
confocal microscopy.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.170
And the confocal
microscopy allowed

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:27.560
him to look at a certain
volume of the scaffold.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.210
And he had some
software that would

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.460
track the centroid
of each cell as it

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.230
moved through the scaffold.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.950
And so he had a thing
he called spot tracking.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:40.310
So each of these little spheres
here corresponds to a cell.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:43.115
And the white box is
the volume of material

00:43:43.115 --> 00:43:45.150
that you could see
in the scaffold.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:48.470
And this color scale here
really corresponds to time.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.180
So I've forgotten which round.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.730
I think blue is the
original time 0,

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.360
and then red is
maybe five seconds,

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.520
and yellow was 10 seconds.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.360
The different colors
correspond to different times.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.910
So he could track
the path of each cell

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:05.090
and also what the position
was at different time points.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.145
So he knew what the position
was at different time points.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:09.520
And obviously from
that, he could

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.200
get the speed of the scaffold.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.730
And he did these
experiments on scaffolds

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:18.170
of different stiffnesses, as
well as, different pore size.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:21.110
And here you can
see the cell speed.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.680
He's measuring it in
microns per hour now.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.760
The cell speed
increases at first

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.780
and then decreases with
the strut stiffness.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.140
So we don't know
exactly why this is.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.950
But there is an effect between
the stiffness of the scaffold

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.727
and the migration speed.

00:44:36.727 --> 00:44:38.310
And another thing
he did was he looked

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.070
at how the cell speed
varies with the pore size.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:46.560
And as the pore size gets
smaller, the speed goes up.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.310
And we're not entirely
sure why that is.

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.560
But I think that might be
related to this binding site

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.095
thing too.

00:44:53.095 --> 00:44:56.730
As the pore size goes down,
the number of binding sites

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:57.860
is going to go up.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.160
And if you think of
the cells migrating

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.940
by having these adhesion sites,
and the adhesion sites are just

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.700
at the ends of the cells, and
the cells kind of putting out

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.330
a little extension, and then
looking for somewhere else

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:10.996
it can bind.

00:45:10.996 --> 00:45:12.370
The more binding
sites there are,

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.100
the faster it's going
to find a binding site.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.070
And the faster, I think,
it's going to move on.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:19.910
So I think that the cell speed
depends on pore size, at least

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:23.290
in part because of the
increase in the binding sites

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:26.470
with smaller pore sizes.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.350
So pore size and the migration.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:31.300
And then the last thing
I wanted to talk about

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.470
was cell differentiation.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.870
And this is a study
study by Engler.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:39.470
And one of the things he found
was he put mesenchymal stem

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.880
cells on 2d substrates.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.370
Just flat 2d substrates
of different stiffnesses.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:48.200
And again, he could control
the stiffness by cross linking.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.000
And what he's showing
up here in the first bit

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.330
is that he's looking at
the stiffness of tissues

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:56.450
of different kinds.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.270
So here's brain type tissue.

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:00.790
Something like one kilo pascal.

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:04.110
Muscle might be something
like 10 kilo pascal.

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:06.030
And collagenous
bone-- this is sort

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.790
of the osteoid that is
the precursor of bone, not

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:09.820
the bone itself.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.540
Is about 100 kilo pascals.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.210
And what he did was he
put these mesenchymal

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:20.150
stem cells-- so here's his
cell onto his substrate.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:22.830
And he varied the
stiffness of the substrate.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.010
And then he looked at
the shape of the cells.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:28.400
So here's the least
stiff substrate,

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.930
so between point 1
and 1 kilo pascals.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:34.090
And here's 4 hours,
24 hours, 96 hours.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:39.280
And these cells
formed long processes

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.510
extending beyond the cell body.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:43.490
And they looked kind
of like neurons.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:45.660
So they he called
those neuron like.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.270
Then there's an intermediate
stiffness of substrate here.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:53.330
And these cells became
even more elongated.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:57.180
And became something like a
muscle cell, myoblast like.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:01.115
And then cells that were
put onto a substrate that

00:47:01.115 --> 00:47:04.270
was between about 25
and 40 kilo pascals,

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.430
they developed a shape that was
something like an osteoblast,

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:09.460
like a bone cell.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.600
So one of the things
he was looking at here,

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.820
was how the stiffness
of the substrate

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.310
affected how a stem
cell might differentiate

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:18.250
into different cell types.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:23.680
And another thing that he did
was he looked at different cell

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.790
markers.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.490
And he found that the
cells were expressing

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:33.670
markers that were corresponding
to the types of tissue.

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:35.840
So I couldn't tell you the
names of all these things

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:36.590
and what they are.

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:39.840
But I think the red
here is expressing

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.220
more of a particular marker.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.470
And I think these wounds
were related to nerve tissue.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.860
These wounds here, were
related more to muscle tissue.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.357
And these wounds here were
related more to bone tissue.

00:47:49.357 --> 00:47:51.190
So the things the cells
were expressing also

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.380
seemed to correspond to the
different types of tissue

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:58.680
that they were corresponding to.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.500
So I'm just going to
end this part by going

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.890
through a little summary here.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.390
So what I've tried
to show you today

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:07.530
is different types
of cell behavior

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.400
that are affected
by the scaffold.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.600
And they're affected by
things like the number

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.670
of binding sites,
by the pore size,

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:15.640
by the stiffness
of the scaffold.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.410
So we started with
a cell attachment.

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.900
We saw that the cell
attachment increases linearly

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.655
with a specific surface area.

00:48:21.655 --> 00:48:24.260
We saw that the cell morphology
depends on the orientation

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:24.880
of the pores.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.296
And that kind of
makes sense, they

00:48:26.296 --> 00:48:27.830
got to line up with the pores.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:29.679
We talked about the
contraction behaviors.

00:48:29.679 --> 00:48:31.970
So the cells bind at the
periphery, the cells elongate,

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:33.490
and that causes this buckling.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:35.390
And you can calculate
the buckling forces.

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:39.870
It's around 10 to
40 nano neutrons.

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.890
We looked at the
cell migration speed.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.170
That increases with the
stiffness of 1D fibers.

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:49.360
And we looked at cell migration
in the collagen gag scaffolds.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.802
So that depends on the
stiffness of the pore size.

00:48:51.802 --> 00:48:53.260
And then there was
this final study

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.350
on the cell differentiation.

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.400
So I wasn't going to
write any notes on this

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.710
because the slides I think
pretty much explain it.

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.251
So I was just going
to put the slides

00:49:01.251 --> 00:49:03.970
on the website at the end
after today's lecture.

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:06.060
So are we good with how
cells and the scaffolds

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.892
of the environments interact?

00:49:08.892 --> 00:49:10.350
Because I think
it's not so obvious

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:14.230
that this actual mechanical
environment makes a difference.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:18.756
People think of the chemical,
the biochemical environment.

00:49:18.756 --> 00:49:20.130
That obviously
affects the cells.

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.690
But people don't think
at first that something

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:27.990
like the sort of structure
of the pores, the pore size,

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:31.062
or the orientation of the pores,
or the mechanical properties

00:49:31.062 --> 00:49:32.770
are going to affect
how the cells behave.

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.530
But in fact, they do.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:35.110
So that's it.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.070
And this is all various
people who worked

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:38.580
with me on these projects.

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.060
So it was a lot of fun.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.060
OK.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:46.310
So hang on a sec here.

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:47.272
What's this all about?

00:49:47.272 --> 00:49:48.480
I'm going to get rid of that.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.560
Go away.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.160
Here we go.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:50.660
OK.

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:54.640
So are we good with
cells and substrates?

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.310
Yeah?

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.460
OK.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.585
So let's just take
a little moment

00:49:59.585 --> 00:50:00.710
and I'll rub the board off.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:02.168
And then we can
start the next bit.

00:50:43.616 --> 00:50:44.116
OK.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:10.540
OK.

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:14.560
So that's the end of the
medical material stuff.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.989
So we talked about the bone.

00:51:16.989 --> 00:51:19.030
We talked about the tissue
engineering scaffolds.

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.840
And then we talked about the
cell scaffold interactions.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.200
So now we're going to go back
to more engineering topics.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.310
And the next thing I
wanted to talk about

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:29.550
was energy absorption in foams.

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:31.980
So foams are very widely
used for energy absorption

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.030
applications, things
like bicycle helmets,

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:35.400
different kinds of helmets.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.300
You buy a new computer, it
comes in foam packaging.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.430
And the reason foams
are used so much

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:43.660
is they're extremely good at
absorbing energy from impact.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.410
And in fact, they're
better than the solid

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.960
that they're made from.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.670
So let's just look at this
curve here for a minute.

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:55.480
So here's a stress strain curve
in compression for the foam.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.500
And the material
that it's made from

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.070
would have the stiffness
something like this.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.450
It would be much, much
stiffer than the foam.

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.950
And if you think about how
much energy you can absorb,

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:08.020
the energy you can
absorb is just the area

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.390
under the stress/strain curve.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:12.280
That's the energy you can absorb
in a given volume of foam.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.490
And so when you're thinking
about these energy absorption

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:18.380
problems, it's not
just that you need

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.640
to absorb a certain energy.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.110
You need to absorb it without
exceeding a certain peak

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:22.906
stress.

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:25.280
So whatever it is you're trying
to protect, at some point

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.839
it's going to break.

00:52:26.839 --> 00:52:28.130
This is what you want to avoid.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:29.570
You want to avoid it breaking.

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:31.659
So you don't want to
have a stress bigger

00:52:31.659 --> 00:52:33.200
than the stress
that's going to break

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.540
whatever it is, your computer,
or your head, or whatever.

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.370
So say you have a
given peak stress

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:41.010
that you can tolerate here.

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:43.450
And we've normalized things
by the solid modules.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:45.730
But just say that's
a peak stress here.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.910
The foam is going to absorb
this amount of energy

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:50.470
up here, this whole
little shaded region.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.280
And the solid is going to absorb
that little, teeny weeny bit

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.160
in there.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.790
So what you want to do
is absorb the energy

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:58.970
without exceeding a
certain peak stress.

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:01.990
And the foam is always going
to be better than the solid

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:03.890
that it's made from.

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.140
There's a couple other things
that make the foams good

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.020
because they're more or less
isotropic, maybe not perfectly.

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.562
But roughly, they have the same
properties in all directions.

00:53:11.562 --> 00:53:13.728
Sometimes you don't know
what direction the impact's

00:53:13.728 --> 00:53:14.530
going to come from.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.196
And so if you've got
the same properties

00:53:16.196 --> 00:53:19.460
in all directions or roughly
the same, that's a good thing.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:23.030
You also want the protective
thing to be light.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.990
If you're paying for shipping
for your computer or whatever,

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:27.730
the fact that the
packaging is light

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.732
makes the shipping easier.

00:53:29.732 --> 00:53:31.190
If you have a helmet
for your head,

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:32.690
you don't want some
big heavy thing.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:34.100
You want something fairly light.

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.070
And foams are cheap.

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:39.040
So the fact that they're roughly
isotropic, they're light,

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.080
they're cheap, this
all helps as well.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.670
But from a mechanical
point of view,

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:47.130
foams are very good
at absorbing energy.

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:49.870
And so what we're going
to do in the next--

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.530
the rest of this lecture
and on Wednesday-- we're

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.700
going to see how we can
convert these stress/strain

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:59.010
curves into what are called
energy absorption diagrams.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.446
We're going to look at some
energy absorption diagrams

00:54:01.446 --> 00:54:03.570
that we just measure from
the stress/strain curves.

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.530
And we're going to look at
how we can predict the energy

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:07.027
absorption diagrams as well.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.560
OK.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.950
So the main idea here is
that the impact protection

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:19.960
has to absorb the
energy from the impact

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.056
but without exceeding
a certain peak stress.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.630
So the direction of loading
may not be predictable.

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:26.570
And foams are good because
they're roughly Isotropic.

00:55:33.234 --> 00:55:35.150
And they would have the
same energy absorption

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:36.502
capacity from any direction.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.689
And foams are also
light and cheap.

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:13.840
We can say for a given peak
stress the foam is always

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.750
going to absorb more energy
than the solid it's made from.

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.920
So other things
that make foams good

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.567
are that they have a capacity
to undergo large deformations.

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:02.300
And they do that at
roughly constant stress.

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:10.540
So that if you look
at the stress strain

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:17.780
curve for the foam,
you're going to be

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.220
able to absorb all
this energy under here.

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.250
And these strains that
the foam might go to

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:28.210
might be 0.08 to 0.09, so
huge strains on an engineering

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:30.930
scale.

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:34.240
And then this is your
energy-- would absorb

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.160
is that area under the
stress/strain curve.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.716
So I wanted to say something
about strain rates too.

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.260
So typically we're
going to be talking

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.580
about problems of impact.

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.080
And in impact, the strain
rates are typically

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:55.090
on the order of 10 to 100 per
second, something like that.

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:57.410
We're not going to talk
about things like blast.

00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:59.229
If you have a blast
loading, then you

00:57:59.229 --> 00:58:01.020
have to take inertial
effects into account.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.910
And blasts involves
strain rates,

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:06.890
which are 1,000 to 10,000 per
second, much, much higher.

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:08.810
So we're going to talk
about strain rates that

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:13.530
are about 10 to 100 per second,
maybe a bit more than that.

00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:16.099
And for instance,
you can roughly

00:58:16.099 --> 00:58:18.140
estimate what one of these
impact rates would be.

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.960
So you had something
that you dropped

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.210
from a height of 1 meter.

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:32.260
Then the velocity on
impact is just if you just

00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:34.430
equate the potential energy
with a kinetic energy.

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:36.730
The velocity and impact is
just the square root of 2gh.

00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:39.920
So g's the gravity acceleration.

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.850
And h is the height.

00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:45.030
So that's the square root
of 2 plus 9.81 meters

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:48.050
per second times 1 meter.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:53.490
And that comes out to
4.4 meters per second.

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.400
And say you had some
foam packaging that

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.422
was 100 millimeters thick.

00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:05.935
Then you could say roughly
that the strain rate would

00:59:05.935 --> 00:59:13.160
be approximately equal to that
velocity over the thickness, so

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:19.500
4.4 per second over 0.1 meters.

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.350
That' would be 44 per second.

00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:23.869
So it's somewhere in that range.

00:59:23.869 --> 00:59:26.160
Obviously, the thickness
could be a little bit smaller,

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.140
it could be bigger.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.050
But it's in that ballpark.

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:31.950
And if you do tests on
servo controlled instrons

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:33.392
or you do a drop
hammer test, you

00:59:33.392 --> 00:59:34.975
can get strain rates
in that ballpark.

00:59:59.220 --> 00:59:59.840
OK.

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.726
So we're talking about
impact and not blast.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.670
OK.

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:45.060
So most of the energy
that's absorbed

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.700
is really absorbed in
that stress plateau.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:52.464
So if you think of the
stress/strain curve,

01:00:52.464 --> 01:00:54.380
most of the area under
the stress/strain curve

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.150
comes from the area from
underneath the stress plateau.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:00.219
So the mechanisms of
absorbing the energy

01:01:00.219 --> 01:01:02.760
are going to be mechanisms that
are associated with a plateau

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.530
stress.

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:06.000
So for elastomeric
foams, we've got

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.500
elastic buckling of the cells.

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:21.530
And one of the advantages
or disadvantages-- depending

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.600
on what you want-- of this
is that the deformation

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.450
is recoverable and you
got to have rebounds.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:29.380
So if you have an object and you
drop it onto elastomeric foam,

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.270
it's going to bounce
around like that.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:41.913
So the elastic deformation
is going to be recovered,

01:01:41.913 --> 01:01:43.246
and you're going to get rebound.

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:05.880
If you have a foam that
has a plastic yield point

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.200
or is brittle, then
the deformation

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.177
is going to be largely from
dissipating plastic work

01:02:11.177 --> 01:02:12.010
or work of fracture.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.100
And in that case,
there's no rebound.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.340
But once you've loaded it,
you've crushed the thing,

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:40.070
and you've permanently deformed
it, and you can't use it again.

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:42.870
So sometimes if you ride
your bicycle like I do,

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:45.880
if you have a helmet, you
should wear your bicycle helmet.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.460
If you have a problem,
if you have an accident,

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.192
and your helmet get
smooshed, that's it.

01:02:50.192 --> 01:02:51.650
You have to throw
your helmet away.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:52.608
You can't use it again.

01:02:52.608 --> 01:02:53.695
And this is why.

01:02:53.695 --> 01:02:55.175
[INAUDIBLE], even
if it doesn't get

01:02:55.175 --> 01:02:57.300
smooshed, if you hit your
head at all, [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.690
Exactly.

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:00.150
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.650
Yeah.

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:01.670
You need a new helmet.

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.280
Yeah.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.070
Go ahead.

01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:07.741
Talk about helmets because I'm
on a helmet conversion thing.

01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:08.240
Yes.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.720
You've got to wear your helmet.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.770
And you should change
it every now and then.

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:15.050
Anything else you'd like to add
about bicycle helmet safety?

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:15.950
No, absolutely.

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:16.680
You've got to wear your helmet.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.929
So I know several people who
would have had their head

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.270
smooshed had they not
been wearing their helmet.

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:24.031
So you have to wear your helmet.

01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:24.530
Let's see.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:27.290
OK.

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:30.230
If you think about natural
cellular materials, things

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:37.150
like wood, they
often have cell walls

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:38.330
that are fiber compensates.

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:41.980
And you can dissipate energy by
mechanisms related to the fiber

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.210
nature, so by things like
fiber pull out fracture.

01:04:17.594 --> 01:04:21.660
And then you can also have
open cell foams with fluids.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:23.506
You can have fluid
within the cells.

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:34.670
And if the cells are open
cells, the fluid effect

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.170
is really only going
to be important

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:39.690
if the cells are extremely small
or the fluid is particularly

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:42.280
viscous, or the strain
rates are very high.

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:11.880
So in most cases,
the fluid effects

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.260
aren't important
in open cell foams.

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:16.520
But, for example, you could
try to make an open cell

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.570
foam that had more energy
absorption by putting

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:20.410
a fluid into it.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:22.600
So you could put
glycerin into the fluid,

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.262
and that would increase how
much energy it would absorb.

01:05:25.262 --> 01:05:26.720
Or, you can put
this honey into it.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.250
That would make it
more energy absorption.

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:38.040
And enclosed cell foams,
you may have an effect

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.847
of the gas within the cells.

01:05:39.847 --> 01:05:41.680
But it's really only
going to be significant

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.220
if you have
elastimeric foams where

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.860
the cell faces don't rupture.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.380
The cell faces
rupture, then the gas

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.310
is just going to
flow out of them,

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:50.200
and that's not going to do much.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.140
So the next step is I
want to go from having

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.240
the stress/strain curve
that we've become very

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.110
familiar with,
and make something

01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:19.930
with that that is a little
easier to see graphically

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:21.842
that shows how much
energy we can absorb.

01:07:21.842 --> 01:07:24.050
Remember, what I said what
we're really interested in

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:25.675
is absorbing a certain
amount of energy

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:28.760
without exceeding a
certain peak stress.

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.550
So what I'm going to
do is plot another plot

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.280
that's based on that.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.940
It's going to be
the energy absorbed.

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:38.840
So w is going to be energy
absorbed per unit volume.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:52.235
And I'm going to plot that
against the peak stress.

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.360
OK.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.290
So we're going to look at
three different regimes here.

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:10.050
We're going to look
at what happens

01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:13.930
in the linear elastic part, what
happens in the stress plateau,

01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:16.779
and then what happens in
the densification part.

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:21.740
So let's think about the
elastic regime first.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.720
And if I moved up-- say
I moved up to some point

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:29.319
right there where the little x
is on the stress/strain curve.

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:31.050
Then the amount of
energy I absorbed

01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:35.580
would just be equal to
this little bit here.

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:38.920
And if I moved up, and then the
peak stress would be this peak

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.840
stress there.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:43.880
We'll call that sigma p1 and w1.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:48.970
And if I moved up over
here, I'd be at w2.

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:51.250
And that would be
sigma p2, right?

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:54.170
And if I know the modulus, I
know what that relationship is.

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:56.057
And I get a relationship.

01:08:56.057 --> 01:08:58.640
And these are going to be-- I'm
going to do this on log scales

01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.140
here.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:03.140
There's going to be log,
and that's going to be log.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:07.510
I'm going to get in that
linear elastic regime.

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:15.260
The energy is going to go as
the peak stress squared over 2

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.720
times the modulus of the foam.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.920
Remember, energy is a
half stress times strain.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.550
And I can say strain
is sigma p over e.

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:30.000
So it's 1/2 sigma
p squared over e.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.790
So on my log1 plot
here, this is just

01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:35.260
going to be a straight
line like that.

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.430
And then I'm going to
get to this value here.

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:42.492
I'm going to get to my
collapse stress here.

01:09:42.492 --> 01:09:44.609
So let's call that single star.

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:49.270
And at that point, the
more I go along here,

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:51.620
every point I go
along, like that,

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.859
I'm going to absorb
more and more energy.

01:09:53.859 --> 01:09:56.590
But the stress isn't
going to go up at all.

01:09:56.590 --> 01:10:01.009
So then this thing here is going
to go like that because I'm

01:10:01.009 --> 01:10:02.300
absorbing more and more energy.

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.740
But the stress just
stays the same.

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.930
So this is good news if
we want to absorb energy.

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:11.690
And then once I get to
the densification point,

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:14.010
then it's going to do
the opposite thing.

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:17.220
As I go along here,
at each increment

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.180
I'm not absorbing
that much more energy.

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.130
But the stress is going up.

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:25.730
So at some point it turns
and starts to look like that.

01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:28.930
So this part here corresponds
to linear elasticity.

01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:37.560
This bit here corresponds
to the stress plateau.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:44.770
And this bit here
corresponds to densification.

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:51.410
And the point where
I would like to be

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:53.120
is right here,
because here I'm going

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.470
to absorb the most
energy possible

01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:57.710
through the peak stress.

01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:01.480
So you can think of that as
sort of an optimal point.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:08.736
And I'm going to refer
to that as a shoulder

01:11:08.736 --> 01:11:10.360
because it's the
shoulder between where

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.955
the curve bends over again.

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:21.460
So I've only got a
couple minutes left.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.800
But let me just
show you one thing

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.960
and then we'll talk about
this more next time.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.250
So I've just done this
for one relative density.

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:32.740
But if you look
at the screen, you

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:35.810
can imagine I would have
stress/strain curves for lots

01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:37.165
of different relative densities.

01:11:37.165 --> 01:11:39.290
And let's say these are
all at the same temperature

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:41.220
and all at the same strain rate.

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:43.860
And I could draw a curve
that looks like that

01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.940
for each stress/strain curve.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.200
And if I did that, I'd
get a family of them.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.770
So this is our
energy absorbed here.

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:53.480
I've normalized it by
dividing by the solid modulus.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.360
This is our peak stress here.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.902
And I've normalized that by
dividing by a solid modulus.

01:11:57.902 --> 01:12:00.110
And I've got a sort of family
of these things, right?

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:01.318
They all have the same shape.

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:03.810
But they shift depending
on the relative density.

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:06.600
And then the thing
that makes life good is

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.370
that these shoulder points
you can connect with a line.

01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:12.360
And you can mark off
the relative density

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.600
for those shoulder
points on each line.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.990
And then the last
step you can do

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:19.045
is you can just
plot these lines.

01:12:19.045 --> 01:12:21.170
And you can repeat this
for different strain rates.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:24.850
So this would be a family
of these guys here.

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:27.272
There's a family of those lines
at different strain rates.

01:12:27.272 --> 01:12:29.480
And then you would join up
the points that correspond

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.610
to each relative density.

01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:32.110
So you can make a
drawing that looks

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:37.040
like this that summarizes the
most energy you can absorb

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.004
for a certain peak
stress for foams

01:12:39.004 --> 01:12:41.420
of different relative densities
tested at different strain

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.011
rates.

01:12:42.011 --> 01:12:44.510
You could do it for different
temperatures if you wanted to.

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:46.180
So next time, we'll
talk about that.

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:48.280
But I'm going to
stop there for today.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:48.780
OK?

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.520
Are we good?
