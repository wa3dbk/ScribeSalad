00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.100
LORNA GIBSON: All
right, so last time we

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.560
started talking about
energy absorption,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920
and I wanted to try to
finish that up today.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.460
And then next week we would
talk about sandwich panels

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.990
and using honeycombs and
foams in sandwich panels.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.140
So I think we got
as far as the idea

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.470
of introducing what these
energy absorption diagrams are.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.180
So let me run through this
little sequence again,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.480
and then I'll put the
notes up on the board.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.350
So the idea is that you have
your compressive stress strain

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.140
curve-- so here's a series of
curves for different densities

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.230
of a foam.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500
And we would do these
all at the same strain

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.170
rate and temperature, so
that those aren't variables.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.370
And then what we would do is
we could turn those into energy

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.720
absorption diagrams.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.200
So notice here,
this is a log plot.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.250
So here's that energy
absorption here.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.650
Here's the peak stress
here-- so that's

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.620
the peak stress up to some level
of energy that you've absorbed.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.470
And we've normalized both of
those by the solid modulus.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.160
So say we look at one density
here, say we look at the lowest

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.540
density-- 0.01.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.410
So here's our curve
here for the test.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.000
If I go up to some
stress level that's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.120
still in the linear
elastic region,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.570
then that's going to translate
into somewhere along here

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.165
on the energy absorption curve.

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:41.540
And one of the
things we're going

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.850
to do today-- I'm going to
show you how you draw these,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.410
and how you can set them up.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.810
And you can either get
them from experiments--

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.290
so this is, say the top curve
were experiments, doing it

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.020
from experiments-- or you can
use the models for the foams

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.930
to do it, as well.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.150
So we'll see how you
can do from both ways.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
So this would be the
linear elastic bit here.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.720
This vertical part-- where
the energy is increasing,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.050
but the peak stress isn't
increasing-- that corresponds

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.940
to the plateau here.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.700
And then this part here,
where the energy is not

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.670
increasing very much,
but the stress increases

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.010
a lot-- that corresponds to the
densification part over there.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.330
So what you would do
is you would do tests

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.340
on foams of different densities,
and from the test data,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.170
you could draw an
energy absorption

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.150
curve for each density.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.590
So you plot-- there's four
different densities here,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.446
so it forms a family
of these curves.

00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:33.820
And then what you
do is you say--

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.810
and I think we talked
with this last time--

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.630
that the place you want to
be is at this shoulder point.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.770
You want to be absorbing
as much energy as possible

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.344
at that plateau stress.

00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:45.760
So you want to be at the point
just before it turns around

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.730
to the densification regime.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.330
So you can mark that
little shoulder point

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.130
for each density.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.390
So here's like 0.01,
here's 0.03, and so on.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.320
And then those points can
be connected by a line--

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.470
so that heavy line then
connects those shoulder points,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.350
or those optimum points.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.010
And then what you can do is
then repeat this whole process

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.670
for different strain rates.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.260
So this family of lines here
is at different strain rates--

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.166
so this set that goes this way,
corresponds to this line here.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:17.040
And if you do them at
different strain rates,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.730
where the shoulder appears at
a slightly different point--

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.900
and so if you mark
those shorter points,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.690
you can draw these lines
here that connect up

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.680
for one relative density.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.820
So this line on the
left hand side here,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.450
these are all relative
densities of 0.01,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.020
these ones are all
relative densities of 0.03.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.800
So this diagram down
here, doesn't really

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.360
look like this at
all-- it doesn't

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.990
look like the basic
energy absorption diagram.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.950
But it actually has
information for what

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.620
the optimum would be
for a range of densities

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.700
and a range of strain rates.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.500
So typically, these
foams are viscoelastic

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.300
and they have some
strain rate sensitivity.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.200
So you'd like to get the strain
rate sensitivity into it.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.870
And it's not shown
here, but you could

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.840
do the same thing at
a constant strain rate

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.240
and varying the
temperature, too.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.198
So if you had things at
different temperatures,

00:04:04.198 --> 00:04:05.910
you could do the
same kind of idea.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.730
OK-- so are we good
with how this works?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.140
Because now I'm going to
write some notes on the board

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.335
so you have it in your notes.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.300
So the idea is that you turn
your stress strain curve

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.860
to look something like that,
into an energy absorption

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.070
diagram.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:56.130
And you can plot on log
log scales, the energy

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.520
versus the peak stress.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.380
And you get something like that.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.666
And this point here, I'm going
to call the shoulder point.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.920
And that would use the material
in the most efficient way--

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.530
you get the most energy
absorption without getting

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.147
higher than that plateau stress.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.390
So we can say at this stress
plateau, the energy increases

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.345
without much increase
in the peak stress.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.680
And then as the foam
densifies, then you

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.010
get an increase in
that peak stress,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.190
with little increase
in the energy absorbed.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.210
And so ideally, you want to
be at that shoulder point.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.160
So to construct these
energy diagrams,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.220
you can test the series of foams
at different relative densities

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.320
and constant strain
rate and temperature.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.950
And then you make that
plot of the energy absorbed

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:06.170
normalized by the solid
modulus, versus the peak stress

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.020
normalized by the solid
modulus for each curve.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.720
And typically what people
do is they would take

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.776
the solid modulus at a constant
strain rate and temperature,

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.651
so you don't have to
introduce that, as well.

00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:36.470
Then you would mark the density
for each of those shoulder

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.010
points, and then you
would connect them.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.000
And then you could
repeat this whole process

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.320
for different strain rates.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.870
And then you would
draw the final diagram

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.390
at the bottom, where you have
this family of lines that

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.486
describes the shoulder points
for different densities

00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:15.610
and different strain rates.

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:48.000
And you could treat different
temperatures in the same way,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.790
if you wanted to.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.456
You would hold the
strain rate constant,

00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:53.240
and vary the temperature.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.990
so it's kind of a nice
way of just putting

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.490
a lot of information
in one diagram.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.900
So one of the
things about this is

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.240
that, because we're
normalizing by Es,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.210
and if you think of elastomeric
foams, elastomeric foams,

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.960
both the Young's
modulus depends on Es,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.500
and the plateau
stress depends Es.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.290
So the Young's modulus depends
on the stiffness of the solid,

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.155
and also because
the plateau stress

00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:20.200
is related to elastic
buckling, it also

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.820
depends on the
modulus of the solid.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.010
So for elastomeric foams--
it's because you normalized it

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.690
with respect to Es--
one of these diagrams

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.487
will represent all
elastomeric foams.

00:09:32.487 --> 00:09:34.070
So that's rather a
nice thing-- so you

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.960
can have different
elastomeric foams,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.550
but one of those diagrams is
going to represent all of them.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.730
So we can say,
elastomeric foams can all

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.030
be plotted on one
plot, or one curve,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.275
since both the modulus
and the plateau stress

00:09:55.275 --> 00:09:56.495
are related to Es.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.962
So if we look at this
next figure here--

00:10:40.962 --> 00:10:43.336
maybe I'll just wait a minute
for people to stop writing.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.601
Some people write
faster than others.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.230
So if we look at
this next plot here,

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.770
here's a compressive
stress and strain.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.450
These tests are done
for one density,

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.283
but at different strain
rates-- so it's kind

00:11:08.283 --> 00:11:10.170
of the other version of this.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.370
But here's the stress
strain curves here,

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.830
and here's the energy
absorption diagram that's

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.260
derived from those.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.580
And then here's
a summary diagram

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.210
that has the different
strain rates, and that would

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.130
have different densities here.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.220
And the idea is
this diagram here

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.870
could represent all
elastomeric foams.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.090
So this has been put
together for polyurethane,

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.210
but it should be able
to represent other sorts

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:40.980
of flexible elastomeric foams.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.994
Sorry?

00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:44.602
AUDIENCE: In those
diagrams, then,

00:11:44.602 --> 00:11:46.320
the intersection
of this strain rate

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.350
line and your
relative density line

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.330
should be the shoulder position?

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.590
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:56.520
And so this line here is for
0.01, and that one's for 0.03.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.370
So 0.02 is going
to be-- you'd have

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.530
to interpolate somewhere
in between there.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.586
So we've just put
on certain values,

00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:05.710
because we're not going to
put on a million values.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.700
We just put on certain
ones, and then you

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.820
can estimate where
other densities would

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.840
appear on there.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.710
OK?

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.430
So here's another
example here-- these are

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.020
curves for two different foams.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.130
So here's a polyurethane
a polyethylene,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.790
so these are both elastomers.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.690
And one is the dashed line,
and one is the solid line.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.530
And you can kind of see
how the lines mesh up.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.970
So here's a density of
0.01 for the polyurethane.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.760
Here's 0.05 for
the polyurethane.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.250
And here's 0.06 for
the polyethylene.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.460
And you can see how
the 0.06 and 0.05--

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.220
they're not quite on
top of each other,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.553
but they're pretty close to
coming on top of each other.

00:12:44.553 --> 00:12:47.910
And then 0.1, 0.12-- and
so you get a family of them

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.480
for the different densities.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.150
And you can also do
this for materials

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.500
that have a yield point, so
polymethacrylimid has a yield

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.940
point, so you do exactly
the same kind of thing.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.840
So here's the energy
absorption diagram

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.480
that's been developed from
the stress strain curves.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.870
But now this curve here,
or this set of curves here,

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.740
is really just valid for
one ratio of sigma [? ys ?]

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.996
to Es-- so the solid yield
strength of the solid modulus.

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:17.370
So it's valid for
whatever it was

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:24.230
for that particular type of
foam-- the polymethacrylimid.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:35.200
So I'll just say,
if we have foams

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.846
that are made from a
material with a yield point--

00:13:37.846 --> 00:13:43.220
and so they have a plastic
collapse stress-- then

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:53.450
the curve will be
valid for foams

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.790
with the same ratio of
[? sigma ys ?] to Es.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.730
So in that case there,
for the polymethacrylimid,

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.230
that ratio is about
equal to 1 over 30.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.660
So that plot would probably
give not a bad description

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:24.860
of other foams, with the same
value of sigma ys over Es.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.490
So the idea here
is we can generate

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.379
these diagrams either
from data-- the way

00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:32.337
those ones have been
done-- or from the models.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.130
So another way to generate these
is to think about the models

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.674
that we have for the foams,
and the foam behavior.

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:44.090
So we have an equation that
describes the Young's modulus,

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.880
we have equations that
describe the plateau stresses,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.570
we have an empirical equation
for the densification strain.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.500
And we can use those to
generate these diagrams.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.180
And they're kind of
useful, because they

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.320
show you what's going on a
sort of mechanistic basis.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.590
So this is a diagram here that's
been generated for open cell

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.140
elastomeric foams.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.050
Here's our energy
absorbed, here's

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.870
our peak stress down here.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.650
This little inset is sort of a
schematic of the idealized foam

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:12.150
behavior.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.790
So here's the Young's
modulus, here's

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.580
the elastic [? collapse ?]
stress, here's

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.770
the densification over here.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.480
So obviously it's kind of
a very idealized set-up.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.274
But we can generate
this diagram--

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.190
and I'm going to go
through the equations that

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.860
will let us do that.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:32.260
So one thing to note is here's
the curves for each density.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.340
Here is this line that
connects the shoulder points.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.050
There's a couple of
other lines on here

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.550
that I just wanted to
mention something about.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.240
If you think about the
densities-- like that's 0.01,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.430
this is 0.03,
that's 0.1-- if you

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.540
had a fully dense solid that
was made of the same elastomer,

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.040
you could plot the
curve for that,

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.890
and that is going to
show up over here.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.580
So this is kind
of an upper bound.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.520
It can't get any more from that.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.030
And we've also got
a dotted line here,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.870
which takes into account
fluid flow within the cells.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.901
So there can be some
fluid flow, and because we

00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:08.359
haven't talked about that,
we're not going to go into that.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.619
So we can just ignore
that dotted line for now.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:18.690
So let me go through how
we can do the modeling.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.030
So we're going to divide
the stress strain curve up

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.530
into bits, and I'm
going to write equations

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.300
for the energy
absorbed for each bit.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.102
So we're going to start with
a linear elastic behavior.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:37.860
And I'm going to--
let's see-- yeah,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.570
so let me just note here that
this is the densification

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.070
strain out here.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.650
And this strain, epsilon
naught, corresponds

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.870
to the strain at which we
first reach the stress plateau.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.600
So here, for the
linear elastic part,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.670
I'm going to say that the
strain is less than that.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.940
So the strain is less
than absolute naught.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.200
And then I can say,
the energy absorbed--

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.700
so if you just
remember from Hooke's

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.830
law on linear elasticity,
energy under the stress strain

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.360
curve for the
linear elastic part

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.810
is 1/2 of sigma
squared over E. So I'm

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.510
going to call sigma-- whatever
the stress is going to be,

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.510
the peak stress that we get to.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.980
And now we're going to
divide by E of the foam--

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.100
because these were
our foams here.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:30.070
And I can use our
model here to say--

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.740
and now I've got to
divide that by Es,

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.220
because I've normalized here.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.830
So because I know
from my modeling

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.850
that the Young's
modulus of the foam

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.500
is just equal to Es times
the relative density squared

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.390
for the open celled
foam, that means

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.230
I've now got an Es squared
in the denominator,

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.310
so I've got a sigma
p over Es squared.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.790
And then I've got a 1 over the
relative density squared term.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:04.610
So that factor there,
that equation there,

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.340
gives you these first
set of lines here.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.370
Gives you that bit, and
this bit, and that bit.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.143
So it gives you those first
parts of the energy absorption

00:19:13.143 --> 00:19:13.643
diagram.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.810
And then if we look at
the stress plateau--

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.300
so here we're going to say
that epsilon naught is less

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.940
than epsilon is less than
the densification strain--

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.420
so we're on the
plateau somewhere.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.560
And now the energy
absorbed is just

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.320
going to be our plateau stress
times the amount of strain

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.360
we've got.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.290
So that's epsilon
minus epsilon naught.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:50.080
And if I normalized with
respect the solid modulus,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:59.300
I can write down that my
plateau stress is 0.05 times

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.510
the relative density
squared, and then

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.125
multiply that times epsilon
minus epsilon naught.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.000
So that equation
then corresponds

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.510
to these vertical parts--
so this part here, that part

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.090
there, this part here.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.070
It corresponds to those
vertical lines on the figure.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.090
Vertical lines on the diagram.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.110
And then the plateau
stress is going

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.490
to end at the
densification strain.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.753
And at that point,
the energy diagram

00:20:47.753 --> 00:20:49.128
is just going to
become vertical.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.114
OK, and then the
last part-- I'll

00:21:39.114 --> 00:21:40.613
try to rub this off
a little better.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.870
And then the last
part is when we're

00:21:48.870 --> 00:22:01.930
at the end of this
stress plateau,

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.180
and the strain is equal to
that densification strain.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.360
And so the amount of
energy we absorb here

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.776
is really going
to be the maximum.

00:22:35.504 --> 00:22:36.920
So this is the
energy that's going

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.740
to correspond to
that shoulder point

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.790
that I've been talking about.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:46.360
So I'm going to call that W max,
and normalize that with respect

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.810
to Es.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:52.800
And that's then going
to be our plateau stress

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.960
times the densification strain.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.246
And the densification strain
was just 1 minus 1.4 times

00:23:02.246 --> 00:23:03.120
the relative density.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:17.780
So here I'm assuming that
the densification strain

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.580
is very much bigger
than the strain at which

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.000
the buckling first
occurs, and I'm neglecting

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.415
that linear elastic part.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.890
So then we could say
that the optimum foam

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.860
is at that shoulder point.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.020
And I can say that the
peak stress at that point

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.933
is just equal to
the plateau stress.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:08.590
And what I want to do is get
an equation for that solid line

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.430
up here that connects all
those shoulder points.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.780
So I want an equation,
in terms of the energy,

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.700
and the peak stress, instead
of in terms of the density.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.130
So what I'm going to do a
solve this for the density,

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.867
and then plug that
back into there.

00:24:34.287 --> 00:24:36.120
So I get that the
relative density is, then,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.067
20 times the peak stress
over the solid modulus,

00:24:40.067 --> 00:24:41.525
and I take the
square root of that.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.612
And now I can substitute this up
here for the relative density.

00:24:54.612 --> 00:24:55.820
I think I need another board.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.680
So then I've got-- this is
my peak stress, or my plateau

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:39.670
stress, over Es, and this is all
just the densification strain.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.454
And that's just 1 minus 1.4
times the relative density.

00:25:42.454 --> 00:25:44.120
But now I'm putting
the relative density

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.085
in terms of the peak stress,
or the plateau stress.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.830
If I just simplify that
slightly with the constant,

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:08.312
it's 1 minus 6.26 times sigma
p over Es to the 1/2 power.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:18.270
So that equation there describes
the-- oops, no more updates.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.390
No updates.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.494
Go away.

00:26:21.494 --> 00:26:25.870
Ah, so that equation there
describes this line here that

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.367
connects those shoulder points.

00:26:28.367 --> 00:26:30.450
And that's the line you're
the most interested in,

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.250
because each of
those shoulder points

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.100
is a point where
the foam is being

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.355
used in the most efficient
way, or the optimum way.

00:26:48.509 --> 00:26:50.300
And then, let's see--
is that going to fit?

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.714
No-- let me try the other board.

00:26:55.505 --> 00:26:56.880
And then the last
thing we can do

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.910
is calculate that line that
corresponds to the dense solid.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.072
Yeah?

00:27:02.072 --> 00:27:04.055
AUDIENCE: On those
ones over there,

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:06.554
it says it corresponds to the
vertical lines on the diagram.

00:27:06.554 --> 00:27:08.554
And then later it says
then it becomes vertical.

00:27:08.554 --> 00:27:11.050
Is that referring to
two different diagrams?

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:14.020
LORNA GIBSON: So this
stress plateau equation

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.320
here corresponds to these
vertical lines here.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.220
So for relative density of 0.01,
it corresponds to that part.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.340
For 0.03 it's this part.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.560
And your 0.01 it's that part.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.522
AUDIENCE: But then
some of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:32.246
it says, then w [? versus ?]
sigma becomes vertical.

00:27:32.246 --> 00:27:33.400
Should that--

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.120
LORNA GIBSON: So, well
the plateau stress

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.920
ends at the
densification strain.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.200
So the plateau stress ends here.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.810
Oh, let's see-- and then it
becomes-- should be horizontal.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:42.310
Sorry.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.140
OK, sorry.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:58.640
Happy?

00:28:01.657 --> 00:28:03.240
And now I'm going
to rub that all off.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.560
OK, did everybody get this?

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.268
I can rub it off?

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:45.350
OK, so then the last
part is what happens

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.540
when the foam is densified.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.540
And if it was fully dense--
and you never really

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.200
can get to this point--
but if it was fully dense,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.658
you would get rid
of all the pores,

00:28:53.658 --> 00:28:55.040
and it would just be a solid.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.750
And then the energy
absorption curve

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.200
would be the curve
for the solid.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:09.142
So I'll just say,
when fully densified,

00:29:09.142 --> 00:29:13.095
I'm going to say a curve
approaches that for the solid.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:24.695
And for the solid, you would
just have that W over Es

00:29:24.695 --> 00:29:29.885
is equal to 1/2 the peak
stress squared over Es.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.650
So this model curve, the
curves have the same shape

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.070
as when you get the diagrams
from the experiments.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.190
And you can see how the
different mechanisms

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.422
of deformation and failure
contribute to the diagram,

00:29:45.422 --> 00:29:46.630
where the diagram comes from.

00:29:48.884 --> 00:29:50.300
And I guess one
other point is you

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.120
can see that the foams are
always going to be a lot better

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.260
than the solid.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.050
And remember this
is a log log curve,

00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:01.010
so that a foam that has a
density of 3% here, there's

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:03.460
a huge difference
in the peak stress.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.740
So say you wanted to absorb
this amount of energy up here,

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.640
for a foam that was 0.03
dense, the peak stress

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.900
would be a little less
than 10 to the minus 4,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.520
normalized by the modulus.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.870
And for the solid, it would
be 10 to the minus 2--

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.630
so it's orders of
magnitude better to have

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.040
the foam rather than the solid.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.030
All right, now let's
see what else we have.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.890
So we could do a similar
thing for closed-cell foams,

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:32.066
and you get diagrams
that look like this.

00:30:32.066 --> 00:30:34.440
One of the differences with
the closed-cell foams, if you

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.950
assume that the faces don't
rupture, the plateau stresses

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:41.160
and horizontals-- remember
we had that gas contribution,

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.270
and you can take
that into account?

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.410
So I'm not going to go
over the details of that.

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:47.960
The next one I
wanted to talk about

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.500
was looking at foams
that have a yield point.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.200
And again, you can generate
a similar kind of diagram,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.480
but now, instead of having
an elastic failure here,

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.810
you've got a plastic failure--
you form plastic hinges.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:02.670
And then again,
this diagram is less

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.000
general than the one
for elastomeric foams,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.150
so this diagram would be valid
for whatever ratio of sigma ys

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:11.810
over Es you've the
calculation for.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.730
So this one here is for 0.01.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.590
So let me just run through
the same kind of calculation

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.930
for the plastic foams.

00:31:25.414 --> 00:31:26.830
Can I rub this
off, and then I can

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.280
use this board to start here?

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.980
OK, so the linear elastic
part is just the same

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.970
as for the elastomeric foams.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:16.956
So you get W over Es is 1/2.

00:32:16.956 --> 00:32:21.970
Sigma p over Es squared times
1 over the relative density

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.700
squared, so it's
just the same thing.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:34.370
And the stress plateau--
you get w over Es

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:43.010
is just the plastic collapse
strength times the strain range

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.960
that you go up to.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.980
So if you remember the
plastic collapse strength

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:55.260
was 0.3 sigma ys times the
relative density to the 3/2

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.590
power, and then times
the strain range.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.290
And then at the end
of the stress plateau,

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:13.310
you've got the maximum
energy absorbed.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:16.420
So normalize that by Es.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.300
And that's going to be
your peak stress over Es

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.395
times the densification
strain again.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:31.674
So this bit here is the
densification strain.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.530
And then you can
do a similar thing

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.363
to figure out the
equation of that line that

00:33:40.363 --> 00:33:41.590
joins the shoulder points.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.155
So the first step is to solve
for the relative density there.

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:27.810
So if this part here-- 0.3 sigma
ys times the relative density

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:31.719
to the 3/2 power is the
plastic collapse stress,

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:35.760
then at the densification
point, the relative density,

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.690
you just rewrite that and it
comes out to the 2/3 power,

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.580
because you turn
the power around.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.870
And then you just
substitute this up in here.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.070
So you get that the
maximum energy absorbed,

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:23.310
normalized by the solid modulus,
is your peak stress, times

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:27.290
1 minus 1.4 times this thing
in brackets to the 2/3 power--

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.350
the 3.3 times the peak
stress over the yield

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.930
strength of the solid.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:40.830
And then if I just rearrange
that, and get the constants,

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:51.890
it's 1 minus 3.1 times our
ratio of the stresses there.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.610
So maybe I'll just
put over here--

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:04.465
the curves are less general
than for elastomeric foams.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.280
So each family of
curves would be

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.400
for a particular ratio of
the solid yield strength

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.453
to the solid modulus.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.490
So you get the idea?

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.880
It's fairly straightforward.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.690
So I wanted to
finish up this topic

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.280
by giving you a few examples of
how you can use these curves.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.560
So the next thing is to look
at the selection of foams

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.080
for impact protection.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.750
And typically, you're given some
information about the objects--

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.850
so typically you want
to protect some object.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.230
It could be a computer,
it could be your head,

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.650
some part of your body.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.650
So typically you know
something about the object

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.680
you want to protect.

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.350
So you might know its mass, you
might know the area of contact,

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.280
you might say, well,
if it's my computer,

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.890
I want to make sure it
doesn't break if I drop it

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:54.890
from a height of a meter.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.550
Or you could say whatever,
[? maybe it's ?] 2 meters.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.010
But you pick something.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.820
And so there's a
certain amount of energy

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.410
you know that you
need to absorb.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:04.310
And you may know that
whatever the component is,

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.280
or the body part, or
whatever-- there's

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.427
some maximum acceleration
you can tolerate.

00:38:09.427 --> 00:38:11.010
So you might say,
well, I want to make

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:14.180
sure my computer doesn't break
under acceleration of so much.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.399
So you're given
the acceleration.

00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:18.440
And so if you know the
mass and the acceleration,

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.814
and you know the
area of contact,

00:38:19.814 --> 00:38:22.300
you can figure out a
force over an area,

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.140
and that gives you
the peak stress.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.940
So typically, you know
those things in the problem.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.700
And typically the problem
involves choosing a material,

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.810
or choosing-- like choosing
what kind of material

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.390
do you want to make the foam
out of, and what density of foam

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:35.800
do you want to use,
what thickness of foam

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.810
do you want to use?

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.830
So I've got a couple
of examples just

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.580
to show you how this works.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.094
So let me just write down
a couple notes, and then

00:38:43.094 --> 00:38:45.677
the rest of it I think I'm just
going to take from the slides.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.410
So typically, you know what
it is you want to protect,

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:13.850
and you know something about it.

00:39:20.714 --> 00:39:22.380
So if you know what
it is, typically you

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.557
know what the mass is.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.090
You might know what the
contact area would be.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:49.279
Say a maximum drop height,
maximum tolerable acceleration.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.750
So say if you're worried
about brain injury--

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.230
and making a helmet-- you might
know what the maximum tolerable

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.482
acceleration would be.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:09.720
So typically, you know what the
peak allowable stress is, just

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.770
from whatever the
object itself is.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.700
And the variables that
you have to play around

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:25.530
with-- variables-- are things
like the foam material,

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.965
the foam density, and
the foam thickness.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.030
So I have a couple
of examples that

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.910
have different setups here.

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:41.610
And we'll just see how
the thing works out here.

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:45.520
So the first example, we're told
the mass of the packaged object

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.210
is 1/2 kilogram.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:49.870
We're told the area of
contact between the foam

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.370
and the object is
going to be point.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.190
0.01 of 1 meter squared.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.700
And we're told
that it's supposed

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.830
to be designed to withstand
a drop of 1 meter--

00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.790
so if the drop
height is 1 meter,

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:03.670
then the velocity is just
the square root of 2gh.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.620
So g is gravity, so you can
work out the velocity on impact

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.184
would be 4.5 meters per second.

00:41:09.184 --> 00:41:11.350
And if you have the velocity
on impact and the mass,

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:13.387
you can figure out the
energy to be absorbed.

00:41:13.387 --> 00:41:14.970
You can say mv squared
screwed over 2,

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.280
or you could say it's
mgh-- either way.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.430
So here it's going to
work out to 5 joules.

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:25.100
And in this case, we're told
that the maximum deceleration

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.300
is 10g-- so then if that's 10g,
the maximum force is the mass

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.900
times the acceleration.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.920
That works out to 50 Newtons.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.800
And then that gives
us a peak stress,

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.240
the maximum
allowable peak stress

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.060
of the force over the area
it's 5 kiloNewtons per meter

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.270
squared.

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.240
And in this case, we're
told that the foam is

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.400
going to be a
flexible polyurethane,

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.550
and it has a solid
modulus of 50 megapascals.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.920
And so we can calculate
this normalized peak stress.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.110
So the normalized peak stress
here is 10 to the minus 4.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.350
So in this problem here,
we need to figure out

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.020
what's the foam
density, and what's

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.450
the thickness of the foam
to protect the object?

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:05.024
And so that last slide
is just summarized here.

00:42:05.024 --> 00:42:07.190
And I realized that when I
was going to put this up,

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.773
the font is going
to be kind of small,

00:42:08.773 --> 00:42:10.680
so I blew it up a little.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.980
So we have figured
out that we're

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.850
at sigma p over Es-- the
peak stress normalized

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.372
by the solid modulus
is 10 to the minus 4.

00:42:18.372 --> 00:42:19.830
And we know that
we're going to use

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:22.840
a flexible elastomeric
polyurethane,

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.330
so we pull out our diagram
for elastomeric foams.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.660
And this sort of
hashed band here

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.940
corresponds to all the
different strain rates, and all

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:31.990
the different densities.

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:33.900
So I haven't plotted
each individual line,

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.970
we've just got this band that
represents the whole thing.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.510
So we know that
our normalized peak

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:43.060
stress is going to be
somewhere along this line here.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.620
That's from everything
that's given,

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.220
and what we can calculate.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.220
And we want to know what
density of foam to use,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.610
and what thickness.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.300
So the way you approach
this is the thickness

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.759
is going to affect
the strain rate.

00:42:53.759 --> 00:42:56.299
So the strain rate's just going
to be the velocity on impact,

00:42:56.299 --> 00:42:58.590
divided by the thickness--
or it's an approximation

00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.960
for the strain rate.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.380
So we don't know if we're
at this point down here,

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.950
or if we're at this
point up there,

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.190
because we don't know where
we are in the strain rate

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.580
end of things.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.506
So the way you solve this is
you just guess a thickness.

00:43:10.506 --> 00:43:11.880
And if you guess
a thickness, you

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.237
can calculate a strain rate.

00:43:13.237 --> 00:43:14.820
Then if you calculate
the strain rate,

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.650
you know where in
this band you are.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:19.370
You can figure out a
value of W over Es.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.970
And you can use an
iterative process.

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:23.690
And the way this
is set up is we've

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:27.090
chosen two very different
initial thicknesses,

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.130
and the point of doing
that is to show you

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.190
that it converges very quickly.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.410
So the first
iteration on this side

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.540
here, we've chosen the
thickness of a meter, which

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:38.590
is probably unlikely that
we need a meter of foam.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.450
And on the side here, we've
chosen a millimeter-- 0.001

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.950
meters.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:43.620
So probably, we
need more than that.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.078
So we probably need
to be somewhere

00:43:45.078 --> 00:43:46.570
between those two bounds.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:49.600
So if the thickness was a
meter, then the strain rate

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.300
turns out to be 4.5 per second.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.940
And then we know where
we are in this diagram,

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.970
and we can read off
a value of W over Es.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.350
So we know we're
on this line here,

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.220
and for a particular
strain rate,

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.580
we can read off the W over Es.

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.660
So here's the value-- 5.25
times 10 to the minus 5.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.840
And if we know Es,
which we do, we

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.579
can then calculate
the actual energy

00:44:13.579 --> 00:44:14.620
absorbed per unit volume.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:19.190
We get W-- so W is [? 2620 ?]
joules per cubic meter.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.550
And we can use that
value-- because that's

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:24.904
an energy per unit volume--
we know the area of contact,

00:44:24.904 --> 00:44:27.320
and we can use that to get
another value of the thickness.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.160
So we use that to calculate
the next iteration

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.580
of the thickness.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.190
So U is the total
energy in joules,

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.600
and W is the energy
per unit volume.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.930
So U, the energy
in joules, is going

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:41.410
to equal the energy unit
volume times the area

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:42.746
times the thickness.

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:44.120
So we know what
the area is, too.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.270
We can then calculate
a new thickness.

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:49.320
So now our new thickness
is 0.19 meters.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.790
We can use that to
get a new strain

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:53.790
rate-- that's 24 per second,
and go through the whole thing

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:54.390
again.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:58.320
And we end up with a revised
energy of 3,300 joules

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.032
per cubic meter.

00:45:00.032 --> 00:45:01.490
Now if we started
at the other end,

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:05.410
if we started with the first
guess was a millimeter, then

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:09.890
the strain rate is 4.5 times
10 to the minus 3 per second.

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:12.270
That gives us a different
value that we read off here

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.780
for W over Es, and a
different value for W.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.950
And then we use this
value here for W

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:20.230
to make another guess
for the thickness.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.707
So that value is 0.14.

00:45:22.707 --> 00:45:24.290
And then we go through
the whole thing

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.580
again-- we get a revised strain
rate a revised W over Es,

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.510
and a revised W. And you can
see after just two iterations,

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.449
these two things are
almost exactly the same.

00:45:33.449 --> 00:45:34.990
And then on the
third iteration, they

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:38.730
both would give you a
thickness of point 0.15 meters.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.620
So even though you can pick
wildly wrong first iterations,

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.120
it converges very quickly,
and it's a fairly simple

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.310
calculation to do.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:51.210
So you know the thickness
that you want is in here,

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:54.180
and then you can get the
optimum density here.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.540
So you know that your sigma
p over Es is along this line

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.970
of 10 to the minus
4--we're somewhere in here.

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:03.210
These two strain rates
here-- one was 24,

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.400
one was 32-- so the
final value is going

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.210
to be somewhere around 30.

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.550
And if you look on
this thing here,

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:12.830
you can see there's a line
that corresponds to 10,

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.624
there's a line that
corresponds to 100.

00:46:14.624 --> 00:46:16.290
We're going to be
right around in there.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:20.180
So the relative density is
going to be right around 0.01.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.280
So you can use the diagram
to get the thickness

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.660
and to get the density.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.220
OK, are we good?

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.320
We're good?

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.190
So I've written some notes,
and I'll just scan those

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:34.370
and I'll put them
in the Stellar site.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:37.700
So here's another example
here-- and in this example,

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.190
it's set up a little
bit differently.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:44.212
So in this example here,
we're not told the material,

00:46:44.212 --> 00:46:45.920
but we're told the
thickness of the foam.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.910
So this time we want
to get the material,

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.460
and we want to get the
density of the foam.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.020
So here we've got
the specification.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.920
We're told the mass is
2 and 1/2 kilograms.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.724
The area of contact is
0.025 meters squared.

00:46:58.724 --> 00:47:01.224
We're told the thickness-- here
thickness is 20 millimeters.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.844
We've got a drop height
of 1 meter again.

00:47:04.844 --> 00:47:06.260
And the velocity
of impact is then

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.784
going to be 4.5 meters
per second again.

00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:11.200
And since we know T, we know
that the strain rate is going

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.960
to be around 225 per second.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.700
We can calculate the energy
absorbed-- [? MGH-- ?]

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.790
25 joules.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.154
We can calculate the energy
absorbed per unit volume,

00:47:24.154 --> 00:47:26.070
because we've got the
area and the thickness--

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.694
so I'm just going to divide that
by the area and the thickness.

00:47:28.694 --> 00:47:33.300
Now we have 5 times 10 to the
4th joules per cubic meter.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.520
And we're told that we're
supposed to design it

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.260
so the package can withstand
a deceleration of 100g--

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.530
and so that gives
you a maximum force.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:45.520
And here we've got a maximum
allowable peak stress of 10

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.460
of the 5 Newtons
per meter squared.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.327
So here we have our curve for
the elastomeric foams again--

00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:53.410
let's assume it's going
to be an elastomeric foam,

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.290
but we don't know
what kind of foam.

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:58.180
So the way you
solve this problem

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:01.050
is that you make a
guess for what Es is.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.480
So remember, these diagrams
are all normalized by Es.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.630
So to plot a point on there,
we need to know what Es is.

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.440
So here, we're going
to make a guess,

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.850
and we're going to assume that
Es is 100 megapascals to start.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:17.670
And if we had that value
of Es, we know W, up here,

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:19.700
and we know sigma p there.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.960
So we just divide those
values of W and sigma p by Es,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.990
and we get these
two values here.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:28.200
And we plot those two
values on the thing here.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.450
So here's our point A--
and that corresponds

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:33.300
to that first guess
of 100 mega Pascals

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.010
for the modulus of the solid.

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.200
So that's not necessarily
the final answer,

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.210
that's not the right answer--
that's just somewhere to start.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:44.877
So the thing to notice is,
if we have that point there,

00:48:44.877 --> 00:48:46.960
the strain rate there is
probably not quite right.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.580
This upper bound
here is-- let's see.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.790
Got to get closer.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.770
Oh, let's see-- that's 10 to
the minus 2, that's 10 to the 2.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.280
So the strain rate we want
to be is closer up to here,

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.830
it's not quite down there.

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.240
So we're not at the
right strain rate.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.650
But the thing to notice is that
if we draw a line of slope 1--

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:08.090
so there's this dash
line of slope 1--

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:11.895
when we move up and down that
line, we're just changing Es.

00:49:11.895 --> 00:49:13.770
Because everything is
normalized with respect

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:16.310
to Es-- if that line
has a slope of 1,

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:20.040
then we're just moving up
and down with respect to Es.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.300
So what we do is we
scoot up the line

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.700
to get to the point that's
on the right strain rate.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.720
So if this was a strain
rate of 100, or around 200,

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.590
we want to be at point
B. And then from point B,

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:35.380
we can read off what's
the value of W over Es,

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.960
and sigma p over Es.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.650
And from that, we can back out
what the solid modulus we want

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:40.350
is.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.560
So these are the values
that we read off the chart.

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.930
This gives us an Es
of 28 mega Pascals.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:50.240
And again, you can go to this
more detailed diagram here,

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.790
and if you read off the sigma
p over Es, and the W over Es,

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:56.370
the density you
want is about 0.1.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:58.092
So it tells you the
modulus of the solid,

00:49:58.092 --> 00:49:59.550
and from that you
can pick a solid,

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:02.060
and it tells you the density.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.232
Are we good?

00:50:04.232 --> 00:50:05.190
OK, so I have one more.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:08.154
So there's a slightly different
way you can do it, too.

00:50:08.154 --> 00:50:10.320
So now I want to talk about
bicycle helmets-- you're

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.400
my bicycle helmet person.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.810
So this is another
little case study

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:18.990
that involves a slightly
different way to do this.

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:21.410
And this involves a
slightly different diagram.

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:24.859
So the idea here is to choose a
material for a bicycle helmet.

00:50:24.859 --> 00:50:26.900
And as you probably all
know, the bicycle helmets

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.700
have a hard shell, and they
have some sort of foamy liner.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.660
And the foam's usually
around 20 millimeters thick.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.244
And you want something
that's light,

00:50:34.244 --> 00:50:36.410
because you don't want your
helmet to be too heavy--

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.035
but you want something
that will absorb

00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:39.310
the energy from the impact.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:43.760
So I've set this up here-- so
we assume the mass of the head

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.610
is about 3 kilograms.

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:47.170
And we assume that
it can withstand

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:50.120
a deceleration of
something like 300g--

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.190
and so then you can get a force
mass times the acceleration,

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:54.460
because you have the force.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.460
And I've assumed an area
of contact of something

00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:01.270
like 0.01 meters squared, so
that gives you a peak stress.

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:04.150
So this method here
is based on the idea

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.590
that you have these material
selection charts for foams.

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.770
Remember we talked
about that earlier.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:12.660
And this is the compressive
stress at 25% strain.

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.350
So the idea is
that axis there is

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:16.590
meant to represent
the plateau stress,

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:20.060
and this axis here represents
the densification strain.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.950
And these dashed
lines here correspond

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:26.090
to basically a value
of W-- and energy

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.290
absorbed per unit volume.

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:30.380
So this is an energy
absorbed per unit volume

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:35.470
of 0.001 megajoules per
cubic meter, 0.01, and so on.

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:39.846
So if you know the peak
stress that you can tolerate,

00:51:39.846 --> 00:51:41.470
for the numbers I
gave you it works out

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:45.220
to be 0.9 mega Pascals-- so here
it's just a little less than 1.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:48.240
So that's the peak stress
that you can tolerate there.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.800
And you can see that
the material that's

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.040
going to absorb the most
energy-- so you're absorbing

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:59.040
more energy as you move
over this way on the curve

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.820
on the plot-- so the material
that's going to do the best

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.480
is something like an expanded
polystyrene that's 5% dense.

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.440
So I've highlighted
that in red-- expanded

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.030
polystyrene that's 5% dense.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:13.060
And then this is the
densification strain here.

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.510
And you know that the lines
of the energy absorption

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.580
are just the stress
times the strain.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.580
So you can basically
just read off from here

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:22.940
that expanded polystyrene
that was 5% dense

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:26.680
would be a good choice
for a bicycle helmet foam.

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.570
Would you like to add anything
about bicycle helmet foams?

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:33.850
I think that is exactly
what they use, yes.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.180
So this is just another way
to do this kind of thing.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.640
And I did one more
little calculation here--

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:42.340
if you know the thickness of the
foam is, say, 20 millimeters,

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.110
and we've estimated the
area of the contact,

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.980
you can figure out what
the energy absorbed is

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:49.970
per unit volume, and from
that you can back out

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:53.020
the energy in terms of joules,
and from that you can back out

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.170
the velocity that's the
maximum speed that one

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:59.490
would want to get dinged
at on your bicycle.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:02.540
And the maximum speed works
out about 22 miles an hour.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:06.190
So that's just another example.

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:07.750
Are we good?

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:11.592
OK-- yeah, exactly,
your head would

00:53:11.592 --> 00:53:13.300
be hitting the ground
at 22 miles an hour

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:14.730
which, would be ouchy.

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.310
Which is why you want
to wear your helmet,

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:20.126
because your skull will not
be happy if that happens.

00:53:20.126 --> 00:53:21.500
And your brain
will not be happy.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.110
And you will not be happy.

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:26.780
And your mom and dad will be
really, really, really unhappy.

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.470
So you don't want
that to happen.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:31.540
so I have a few
minutes left-- and I

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.464
know I've done this
for the people in 3032,

00:53:33.464 --> 00:53:35.630
but I was going to buy
woodpecker talk, because it's

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:37.420
about energy absorption.

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.920
So if you don't want to watch
it, if you've already seen it,

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:40.572
you can go.

00:53:40.572 --> 00:53:42.780
But there are some people--
you guys haven't seen it,

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:43.590
and you haven't seen it.

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:45.215
There's a few people
that haven't seen.

00:53:45.215 --> 00:53:47.222
And it's cute, involves birds.

00:53:47.222 --> 00:53:48.680
And it involves
energy absorption--

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.576
so I thought I would do
this woodpecker talk.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:58.510
So Barry, this is
all just slides.

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:01.310
I don't know if you want to
do the lights differently.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:02.590
I'm not going to write
anything on the board,

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:03.440
I'm just going to talk.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.172
BARRY: Well, if it will help
them see the slides better then

00:54:05.172 --> 00:54:05.550
certainly.

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:07.050
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah,
I think maybe we

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.021
could turn the lights
down a little, please.

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:18.240
BARRY: Let's try this one.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.490
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, there we go.

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:20.060
That's good.

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:22.920
Yeah, now I don't feel like
I'm looking in the spotlight

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.420
so much.

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:24.510
That's good.

00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:28.380
OK, so you guys know that
I like to watch birds.

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:31.150
And you know that
I work on foams.

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:34.040
And if you look at bird books,
sometimes the bird books

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.940
say that woodpeckers
can withstand the impact

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.590
from pecking because they
have a special material

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.550
between their skulls
and their brains.

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:44.550
And I thought, oh,
well I study foams,

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.850
and I'm interested in
woodpeckers-- I should find out

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:48.440
what this special material is.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:49.980
So I started looking into this.

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.180
And it turns out there
is no special material.

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:55.160
People have looked at the
anatomy of woodpecker brains

00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.660
and skulls, and there
is no special material.

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.020
But it turns out there were
also a group of neurologists

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.740
in the late 1970s who got
interested in why woodpeckers

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:05.610
don't get brain injury, and
they took high speed video

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:06.710
of a woodpecker pecking.

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:09.110
And it was kind of amazing
what they found out.

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:11.230
So it turns out the
woodpeckers can withstand

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:14.810
incredibly high decelerations--
much higher than our brains

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:15.684
could withstand.

00:55:15.684 --> 00:55:17.350
And so I kind of got
interested in this,

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:21.050
and I decided to try to
figure out how it works.

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:23.650
So here's an acorn woodpecker.

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:27.590
And let's see-- I got
a little video here.

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:30.860
Wait a minute-- there we go.

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:31.420
There we go.

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:32.920
So here's a little
acorn woodpecker.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.160
These live in California.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.510
Anybody from California?

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:37.570
Yeah-- have you seen them?

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:39.430
No, OK.

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:41.230
Well you have not been
looking carefully.

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:44.810
So here's our little acorn--
and you can see they peck-- oh?

00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:46.240
Like around San Francisco.

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.586
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:48.586 --> 00:55:50.520
[LAUGHS]

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.010
LORNA GIBSON: So
they're pecking,

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.760
and when they're pecking--
they don't just go bonk.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.190
They do this repeatedly-- they
can peck at 10 or 20 times

00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:59.300
per second.

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:03.450
So the question is, why
don't they get brain injury?

00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:05.720
So, first of all,
why do they peck?

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.520
So as we in that little
video, that woodpecker

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.860
was foraging-- it was trying
to get little things out

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.470
of the bark.

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:16.320
And woodpeckers eat insects,
and so the bird books

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.890
say that they can actually
hear insects scurrying around

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:21.300
under the bark, and
they'll peck at the bark

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.607
and forage to try
to get insects.

00:56:23.607 --> 00:56:25.940
And there's one other anatomical
feature of woodpeckers,

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.601
which is kind of amazing-- and
you can see it in this picture

00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:29.100
here.

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.094
So this is the
woodpecker tongue,

00:56:31.094 --> 00:56:32.760
and the tongue is
connected to something

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.210
called the hyoid process.

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:37.736
And the hyoid process wraps
around their eyeballs.

00:56:37.736 --> 00:56:39.110
And then when they
peck-- I mean,

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.840
the idea is they're
making a hole in the tree,

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.930
and they've got to get
their tongue into the hole

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:44.950
to get the bug.

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.610
And the end of their tongue
has little barbs on it.

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:50.150
And when they contract
this thing here,

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:53.280
their tongue scoots out
and gets the little bugs.

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:56.020
So they pick partly to
forage, but they also

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.220
build something
called cavity nests.

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.000
So they'll find a tree
that's started to rot,

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.500
and they'll drill a
sort of horizontal hole,

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.542
and then they'll drill
a cup underneath that,

00:57:05.542 --> 00:57:07.250
and they lay the eggs
and have their nest

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:08.577
at the bottom of the cup.

00:57:08.577 --> 00:57:11.160
And then they also-- especially
at this time of year, in fact,

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.600
today I heard
woodpeckers drumming--

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.890
so it's one of these mating
things, one of these courtship

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:17.390
things.

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:21.210
So woodpeckers will peck on a
hollow branch or a hollow tree,

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:23.400
just to make a big
loud noise to say,

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:28.150
here I am, looking for sex, I'm
ready, this is my territory.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:30.200
And so in the spring--
so this time of year

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.780
you hear woodpeckers drumming.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:35.380
And I think naturally they
do this on hollow trees

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:36.880
to try to make a
big sound, but they

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.380
have adapted to metal
downspouts, which

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:43.350
are also very effective
for making this loud noise.

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:45.660
And people who've-- I
wrote a paper on this--

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:48.202
people who have read my paper
sometimes email me and say, oh,

00:57:48.202 --> 00:57:49.951
I heard you know about
woodpecker pecking.

00:57:49.951 --> 00:57:52.180
How can I get them to stop
drumming on my downspout?

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.360
Because it's kind of
annoying, if you're

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.850
the human inside the house.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:57.470
So anyway, they peck
for these reasons.

00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:59.990
And then acorn woodpeckers are
special-- acorn woodpeckers

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:03.320
are what I think of as
the champions of pecking.

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.260
And they do one
more behavior-- so

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.510
here's from David Sibley's
beautiful Guide to Birds,

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:10.160
here's the acorn woodpecker.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:12.850
They store acorns in
what's called a granary,

00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:18.360
and they look at old tree trunks
that are beginning to rot,

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.560
and they pick holes
in the tree trunk

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.530
and they store the
acorns in the holes.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:25.510
So see all those little
dark dots on that trunk?

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:29.310
Those are all holes that the
acorn woodpecker has pecked.

00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:31.430
And they'll do this-- they
live in social groups,

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:34.530
so there might be like 10 or
20 of them living together,

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:38.210
and they'll peck like 10,000
holes into their granary.

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:40.960
There will be thousands and
thousands of these holes.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.550
And here we have
the acorn woodpecker

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:46.390
with the acorn in its beak, and
you can see some of these holes

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:48.120
have acorns, and some
of them are empty.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:51.350
So here is the acorn
woodpecker in action.

00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:53.940
And here's the little video
again-- I won't play the video.

00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.140
So I often give this
talk for non-engineers,

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.290
so I'm going to explain
some things-- there's

00:58:58.290 --> 00:58:59.370
going to be some
writing on the slides

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:00.660
that you guys already know.

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:03.180
So the impact force depends
on the deceleration--

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:06.969
how quickly the brain stops
when the beak hits the tree.

00:59:06.969 --> 00:59:09.260
And I should mention, these
videos are from the Cornell

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:13.420
Lab of Ornithology-- they have
an amazing collection of bird

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.890
audio, like bird calls, bird
songs, and bird photographs

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:18.600
and videos.

00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:22.730
It's incredible, the
collection that they've got.

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:24.320
And then I explain
what acceleration

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.650
is-- so I'm going
to put acceleration

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:27.740
in terms of gravity.

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.720
And when the beak
hits the tree, there's

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.250
going to be a
deceleration on impact.

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:34.790
And just as a comparison,
human brain injury

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.500
occurs roughly at about 100g.

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.200
And so the question is,
how much deceleration

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.350
can the woodpecker brain take?

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:45.820
And that's where the
neurologists in the Bay Area

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.230
come into the picture.

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:49.910
They found out that
there was a park

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:53.110
ranger-- I think maybe at
Point Reyes, just north

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:54.440
of San Francisco.

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.702
And he had an acorn
woodpecker that, I don't, had

00:59:56.702 --> 00:59:57.910
an injured wing or something.

00:59:57.910 --> 01:00:01.810
Anyway, he had this acorn
woodpecker that he kept.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:05.440
And they were able to use
this acorn woodpecker,

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.760
and they took high-speed video
of the woodpecker pecking.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.523
So from the high-speed video,
the video that they took

01:00:11.523 --> 01:00:14.260
went at something like
2,000 frames a second.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:17.420
So they have a picture of
where the head is every 2,000th

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.459
of a second.

01:00:18.459 --> 01:00:20.250
So if you know the
position at these times,

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.900
you can get the velocity, and
you can get the deceleration.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.510
So they measured
the deceleration,

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:27.470
and they measured
some amazing things.

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:30.510
So they measured that on
impact, the woodpecker's bill

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.090
was going something
like 15 miles an hour.

01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:35.570
And the decelerations
were up to 1,500g--

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:39.450
so many times more than
what we can withstand.

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:41.240
And they also measured
the stopping time--

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.190
and they thought it was between
about 1/500th to 1/1,000th

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.970
of a second.

01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:48.889
And that's going to
be important later on.

01:00:48.889 --> 01:00:50.680
So one of the interesting
things about this

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.810
was how they got this
whole thing set up.

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:55.150
So I don't know how many of
you do UROPs-- but you know,

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:56.960
part of the thing in doing
UROPs, and doing experiments

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.950
in the lab is just how do
you do the experiments?

01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:01.241
So you know, the park rangers
got the acorn woodpecker,

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:02.332
that's all very good.

01:01:02.332 --> 01:01:03.790
But they have to
get the woodpecker

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.340
to peck in front of
a camera, and they

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.714
have to get the
camera to turn on

01:01:06.714 --> 01:01:09.890
as it's pecking-- so there's
some experimental challenges.

01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:11.710
So the important thing,
the critical thing,

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:12.960
is the date of the paper.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.780
This was written in 1979,
which meant they probably

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.770
did the experiments in 1978.

01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.960
And I was a graduate
student in 1978.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.010
And I can report there were
no Apple computers in 1978--

01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:25.360
there were no laptops.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.280
You couldn't just kind of do
your little PowerPoint slides.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.530
And most offices had something
called an IBM Selectric

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:34.240
typewriter-- I don't know if
you've ever seen the old IBM

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.089
typewriters.

01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:37.380
But the typewriters, when
you typed on the typewriters,

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.730
they made these noises,
and it sounded kind of

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.180
like a woodpecker pecking.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.410
And the ranger had one of these
typewriters in his office,

01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:46.786
and he had discovered that if
he typed on the typewriter,

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:49.076
the woodpecker thought, oh,
there's another woodpecker.

01:01:49.076 --> 01:01:49.990
I'll start pecking.

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:51.700
And so they used the
typewriter as a way

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.310
to get the woodpeckers to peck.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:54.810
And I think they
had some old stump,

01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:56.620
and I don't know if they
put nuts or peanut butter

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:58.390
or something into the
stump to get the woodpecker

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:59.350
to peck at it--
because they needed

01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:01.724
to peck at a particular spot,
so they have the camera all

01:02:01.724 --> 01:02:02.310
set up.

01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:04.530
So anyway, they had
this whole arrangement

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:10.230
to do this high-speed video
of the woodpecker pecking.

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.190
OK, so it goes
that up to 1,500g,

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:13.380
which is kind of amazing.

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.900
And then, remember also,
they do this repeatedly--

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.185
they do it at like 10
or 20 times a second.

01:02:19.185 --> 01:02:20.560
Then this is just
explaining what

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.560
stress is-- but you already
know what stress is,

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.580
so I'm going to skip over that.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.520
And so the way you
can think about this

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.420
is to think about it in
terms of a scaling argument.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.610
So imagine there's the
brain and there's the skull,

01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.450
and when the head hits the
tree, the brain's going

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:37.010
to accelerate, and the
brain and the skull

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:38.790
are both going to decelerate.

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:43.470
And you can think of the stress
as the force over the area.

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.680
So the force is the mass times
the deceleration over the area.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.470
So that value for the
woodpecker, you can say,

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:54.460
is roughly equal to the same
values, but for the human.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.290
So what that argument
relies on is the idea

01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:01.300
that the stress to cause
damage in the woodpecker brain

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.910
is similar to the
stress to cause damage

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:05.320
in the human brain.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.310
And that's not
totally unreasonable.

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:10.201
So if you look at
bone, for example,

01:03:10.201 --> 01:03:12.450
like when you measure the
strength of the whale bones,

01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:14.100
it's not going to be that
different from what you

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.630
would measure from human bones.

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.850
So when you look at a
particular type of tissue,

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:21.692
and you look at the strength
of it in different species,

01:03:21.692 --> 01:03:23.900
the properties aren't that
different from one species

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:24.810
to another.

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:27.470
So let's say the
brain tissue gets

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:31.010
damaged at the same
stress in the two species.

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:33.250
So we can write this
sort of equation down.

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:39.310
And the mass is going to depend
on the density of the brain

01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:41.750
tissue times the
volume-- and the volume

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:43.380
goes as the radius cubed.

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:46.035
And the density is going to be
the same for the woodpecker,

01:03:46.035 --> 01:03:48.290
or for the human-- so
assume the brain tissue has

01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:50.380
the same kind of basic stuff.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:53.760
So the mass goes as the radius
cubed, and the area of contact

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.880
is going to go as
the radius squared.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.790
And so there's a radius term.

01:03:57.790 --> 01:03:59.870
So you can say the radius
times the deceleration

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:02.290
in the woodpecker should
be equal to the radius

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:04.470
times the deceleration
of the human.

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:06.000
And obviously, the
woodpecker radius

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.104
is going to be a lot smaller,
so the woodpecker deceleration

01:04:09.104 --> 01:04:10.270
is going to be a lot bigger.

01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:13.930
So part of the thing is the
brain is just a lot smaller.

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:16.510
Then there's another
factor that comes into it--

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:20.390
these are photographs
of an acorn woodpecker

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.740
skull and a human
skull that I got

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.790
from the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Harvard.

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:27.490
So this is looking
down on the top,

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:29.866
and this is an elevation view.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.490
And if you think of the brain as
roughly a hemisphere-- I mean,

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:33.850
obviously it's not a
perfect hemisphere,

01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:35.558
but let's say it's
roughly a hemisphere--

01:04:35.558 --> 01:04:37.750
the orientation of
the brain in the skull

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:40.309
is slightly different in
the birds and in the human.

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.100
So if you think of it
as being this way on,

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.540
and in the woodpecker it's
turned roughly this way on,

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:48.480
and the contact area-- think
of this as the contact area.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.590
The projected area would be a
full circle, and in the human,

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:53.240
the brain is more this way on.

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.800
And then the projected
contact area is a semicircle.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.540
So there's a factor
of 2 difference,

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:01.910
just because of the
orientation of the brain.

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:04.970
And so I've put the factor
of 2 that accounts for that.

01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:06.470
So then I could say
the deceleration

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:08.800
that the woodpecker
can take is twice

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.940
the ratio of the radii of the
human and the woodpecker brain,

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.730
times the deceleration
the human can take.

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:16.080
And this was around
100g, remember.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.440
So then I wanted to know
what the ratio of the sizes

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.910
was, and I thought,
oh geez-- I'm

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:22.190
going to have to mess
around with skulls,

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:23.940
and try to make some
sort of measurements,

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.320
and this is going to be a drag.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.630
And then I found this paper--
I couldn't believe it--

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:29.830
I found this paper called
"Brain Size in Birds."

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:31.700
And this guy had
table after table

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.910
after table of the mass of
the brain in different birds--

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:37.720
and he had the acorn
woodpecker, lucky for me.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.804
So if you just assume that the
brain is roughly a hemisphere,

01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:42.720
if you have the mass,
you can work out roughly

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.030
what the radius is.

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:45.880
So it turns out
there's a factor of 8

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.600
difference between the radii.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.880
And so the human brain is
about eight times the size

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.030
of the woodpecker.

01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:55.292
And then if you take into
account this factor of 2,

01:05:55.292 --> 01:05:56.750
that means the
woodpecker should be

01:05:56.750 --> 01:06:01.655
able to tolerate a deceleration
of 16 times what the human can.

01:06:01.655 --> 01:06:03.030
So remember, I
said the human can

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:06.490
take about 100-- so this would
get the woodpecker up to 1,600.

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:07.960
But they measured 1,500.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.280
And I'm a civil
engineer, originally,

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.430
I like big factors of
safety-- that's a little too

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:14.630
close for comfort for me.

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:18.360
And so it turns out there's
one more factor that matters.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.690
People have studied human brain
injury pretty extensively,

01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:23.350
and one of the things
they've looked at

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:27.500
is how much acceleration you
can tolerate without injury,

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.730
relative to the
duration of the impact.

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:33.337
So this is from a car crash
conference-- so here's

01:06:33.337 --> 01:06:34.920
the tolerable
acceleration, and here's

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.560
the duration of the impact.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.480
And typically, for
human head impacts,

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.320
the deceleration occurs
over a few milliseconds--

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.950
like over 3 to 10 milliseconds.

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:46.810
So if this is the duration
of the typical head

01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:49.960
impact for a human, here's
the range of the tolerable

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.080
accelerations between about
80g and 160g-- so you know,

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.490
I said around 100.

01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:57.650
So we can take this curve, and
now we have this factor of 16,

01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:59.760
and we can just scale it
up by our factor of 16

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.070
for the woodpecker.

01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:04.660
So if I scale it up by the
factor of 16, we're there.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:08.264
But the duration of the
impacts was more around 1/2

01:07:08.264 --> 01:07:09.930
a millisecond, to a
millisecond, so I've

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:11.730
extrapolated this a little bit.

01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:14.610
And the duration of
them is up in here.

01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:16.190
So this is saying
the woodpecker can

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:19.550
take these sorts of
decelerations here,

01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:22.180
and that adds on
another factor of 4.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.130
And these were the
measured decelerations--

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:27.320
1,500 was about the
biggest, and I think it

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.510
went to about a few hundred g.

01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:31.935
So there's really
three factors--

01:07:31.935 --> 01:07:33.560
one is the small
brain size, so there's

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.470
this sort of scaling factor.

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:37.140
One is the orientation
of the brain,

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.440
that was another factor of 2.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.148
And then there's this
duration of impact,

01:07:40.148 --> 01:07:41.650
which is a factor of 4.

01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:44.377
And so that's how you can
get this huge decelerations

01:07:44.377 --> 01:07:46.210
that they've measured
in the woodpecker when

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:48.250
they're pecking.

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.320
So now I have just a
couple more slides.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:54.640
So woodpeckers have various
adaptations to pecking, too.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.910
So one of the things is they
have amazingly stiff tail

01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:58.760
feathers-- you see
the tails here?

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.176
You can't quite see it because
this didn't reproduce quite

01:08:01.176 --> 01:08:03.750
properly, but the woodpecker
is perched on a tree here,

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.197
and the tail is pressed
up against the tree.

01:08:06.197 --> 01:08:08.030
And if you think about
pecking, like imagine

01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:10.071
if its tail was not pressed
up against the tree--

01:08:10.071 --> 01:08:12.080
it would be kind of
grabbing on with its feet,

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.666
and it would be trying to peck,
and it would be hard to push.

01:08:14.666 --> 01:08:16.540
You know, you need
something to push against.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.164
And so it's got these stiff tail
feathers, which make it easier

01:08:19.164 --> 01:08:22.149
to push against the tree.

01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:24.750
And so here's the stiff
tail feathers here.

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.840
It's also got kind
of unusual feet

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.011
for birds-- it's got two toes
forward and two toes back.

01:08:30.011 --> 01:08:31.760
And again, if it's
grabbing with its feet,

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.260
that helps it get some
purchase to push against.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.939
That's called zygodactyl
in the bird world.

01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:40.934
So it's got these
adaptations, the pecking.

01:08:40.934 --> 01:08:42.600
And then finally, I
just like this slide

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.080
here from The New
Yorker, because it's

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.760
a woodpecker pecking
out a woodpecker,

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.540
so it seemed kind of cute.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.279
And several people helped
me with this project.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.740
Trey Crisco studies
head injury at Brown.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:57.520
He actually does work for the
NFL on football brain injuries,

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.790
and looks at football helmets.

01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:00.410
Sharon Swartz is a
friend of mine at Brown,

01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:01.229
who's a biologist.

01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:02.310
She studies bat flight.

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:04.720
And she just thought this
was kind of a cool project.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.380
So, in fact, I was walking the
dog last week, a few days ago,

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.899
and I saw bats flying
around overhead at night.

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:14.069
And it was so great to
see the little bats.

01:09:14.069 --> 01:09:15.979
So I had to immediately
email Sharon,

01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:18.240
and say, bats-- there's
bats in my neighborhood.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.470
Andy Biewener runs the
Concord Field Station,

01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:23.970
and studies animal locomotion,
and I talked to him about it.

01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:26.270
Jeremy Trimble was the one who
gave me the skull pictures,

01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:27.770
and Matt Dawson was
a student helped

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.840
me do some of the images.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.120
So that's my woodpecker talk.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.890
So that's the end of
energy absorption,

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:36.180
I just thought that
was kind of amusing.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:39.120
So next time, we'll start
talking about sandwich panels.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.170
So, let's see--
Monday's a holiday.

01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:43.754
I will be in Toronto on
Monday, seeing my family.

01:09:43.754 --> 01:09:45.920
In fact, I'm going to see
one of my old professors--

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.211
I'm going to my old fluid
mechanics professor on Monday

01:09:48.211 --> 01:09:48.880
and have lunch.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.689
I'll see my family
on the weekend.

01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:53.850
And so we'll meet
Wednesday next week,

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.550
and I'll start the bit
on sandwich panels.

01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:59.860
So I think there's two lectures
on engineering sandwich panels,

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.930
and then there's a lecture
on natural sandwich panels--

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:06.630
so bird skulls, for example,
are natural sandwich panels.

01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:07.890
So I'll talk about that.

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:09.720
And then I think
the last lecture--

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.080
there's only a handful of
lectures left-- the last one I

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.475
think I talk about natural
materials, because you know,

01:10:14.475 --> 01:10:15.270
I like that.

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:17.890
So I just do that for fun.
