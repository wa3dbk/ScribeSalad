00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:28.410
LORNA GIBSON: So
I was just going

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.584
to be here to answer questions.

00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:33.740
AUDIENCE: Just clarifying,
What was the material

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.656
that we were covering?

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:37.410
LORNA GIBSON: In the test?

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.570
LORNA GIBSON: So the
test covers everything up

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.410
to the end of the part
on modeling foams,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.886
but not the bit on the
performance indices,

00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:49.733
and the material selection
charts for foams.

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.274
So I think up to the end of the
fractured toughness of foams.

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:53.202
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.130
OK.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.009
So not covering
past [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.092
LORNA GIBSON: Not covering
thermal properties, no.

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:02.020
It doesn't cover
thermal properties.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:19.484
Here you go.

00:01:19.484 --> 00:01:22.160
So you know I got
this MacVicar award,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.310
and we had a lunch on Friday
at the Catalyst restaurant.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.709
And I had to get up and speak.

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:29.250
And just as I got
up and spoke, there

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.285
was a red-tailed hawk
swooped by the window.

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:31.910
It was perfect.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.063
It was perfect.

00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:35.562
Yeah.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:36.960
Hi.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.970
So I'm just here to
answer questions.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.300
So come on.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.920
Somebody must have questions.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.280
It's all perfectly clear?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.100
You want me to do--

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.565
AUDIENCE: Talk through test one
from last year a little bit.

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:52.190
LORNA GIBSON: You
would have to give me

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.295
test one from last year.

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:54.040
I didn't bring it with me.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.030
I just brought the problem sets.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.910
AUDIENCE: I have
it on my computer,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.760
and I could read
you the problems

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.652
or just hand you the laptop.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:00.620
Whichever you prefer.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.536
LORNA GIBSON: Why don't
you hand me the laptop

00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:03.780
and I'll try to do it.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.110
Is that OK?

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.760
OK.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.200
So the question is
about the test for 2014.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.250
OK.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.970
So the first question was,
describe four processes

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.930
for making honeycombs, and
comment on the type of material

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.880
usually used for each process.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.580
So I did post the
solutions, right?

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.486
Did you look at that?

00:02:23.486 --> 00:02:24.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I looked at them.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.500
I guess I just feel like
I don't fully understand

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.649
why things are there.

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:32.940
But I can look at it some more.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.582
LORNA GIBSON: Well, I can
go over it, if you want.

00:02:35.582 --> 00:02:37.290
AUDIENCE: I'll just
look at it some more.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.440
LORNA GIBSON: No,
I can go over it.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.390
So four processes.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.020
Let's see.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.466
So there's the expansion
process, where you take sheets

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:44.840
and you glue the
sheets together,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.590
and then you pull them apart.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.600
So you can only really
use that process

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.280
for materials that
are going to have

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.860
large plastic deformations.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.260
So you could use it for
metals, some polymers.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.420
But you couldn't really
use it for ceramics.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.700
You couldn't use it for
glass because as soon

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.571
as you yanked on it, you'd
break the sheets, right?

00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:04.070
So--

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.860
AUDIENCE: Is it rigid polymers
that you can use it for?

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.360
LORNA GIBSON: Well, something
like nylon you can use it for.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.660
Something that's
got a little yield,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.326
that will have some
sort of yield point.

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:15.250
Not like if you had epoxy,
you couldn't use it for epoxy.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.304
So, OK.

00:03:16.304 --> 00:03:17.220
So that's one process.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.410
Another process is a
corrugation process

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.610
where you have a wheel that
has little gear knobs on it.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.440
And you run your flat
sheet through that

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.860
and it comes out with the
half hexagonal profile,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.310
and you glue those together.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.760
So again, you need something
that's going to yield.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.420
So that would
typically be a metal

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.600
that you would use that with.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.150
Let's see.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.250
Another processor making
honeycombs is 3D printing.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.550
You can 3D print honeycombs.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.480
And there's different
ways to do it.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.420
One way is by having an ink.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.440
So if you want to print
in ink, typically that's

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.860
some sort of polymer
that you're printing.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.902
I suppose physically it's
possible to print glass

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.360
or to print a metal,
but you'd have

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.290
to have some very high
temperature setup to do that.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.810
So typically a
resin of some sort.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.500
Let's see.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.320
Other ways to make honeycombs.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.000
You can extrude honeycombs.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.310
So the ceramic honeycombs
we saw were made

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.810
by extruding a ceramic slurry.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.180
And typically, you would
do that with a ceramic

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.570
that's a slurry and a powder.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.510
You wouldn't necessarily
do that with a metal.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.979
I don't think I've seen
any metal honeycombs that

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.440
are extruded like that.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.959
OK?

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:24.500
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.250
LORNA GIBSON: Are we
good with number one?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.992
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:04:27.992 --> 00:04:29.658
LORNA GIBSON: We now
need your password.

00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:30.546
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:38.825
So is there an actual
difference between 3D printing

00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:40.790
and the extrusion process?

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.780
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.840
So the extrusion you have a die,
and you squeeze the material

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.520
through the die, right?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.230
So extrusion's kind of
like the toothpastey thing.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.780
And 3D printing,
you can have an ink

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.850
or you can do 3D printing where
you have, let's say, a powder.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.080
And then you print the binder.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.550
And then you heat it up some
way to get the binder to cure.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.790
And then you get rid of the
powder that's not bound.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.110
That's another way to
do the 3D printing.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.130
OK?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.239
AUDIENCE: Can you also
pour it into a mold?

00:05:13.239 --> 00:05:14.030
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.900
Yeah, those silicon rubber
honeycombs that I showed you,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.560
those are all made by
pouring a liquid into a mold

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.390
and then curing it.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.890
Yeah.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.060
Yeah, there's other ways,
it just asked for four,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.800
so I randomly thought of four.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.330
OK.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.640
OK, are we good?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.740
So the next one is a
hexagonal titanium alloy

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.390
honeycomb has h/l is two,
theta is 45, and t/l is 0.05.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.890
It says, the end constraint
factor for elastic buckling

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.020
is n equals 0.806.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.870
The titanium has a modulus
of 110 gigapascals,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.802
and yield strength of 880.

00:05:49.802 --> 00:05:51.760
And then you have to
calculate some properties.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.896
So would you like me to do that?

00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:54.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.490
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, you would?

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.182
OK.

00:05:56.182 --> 00:05:58.382
AUDIENCE: Does anybody
else want that?

00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:00.340
LORNA GIBSON: I don't
see a lot of other people

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.110
wanting anything else, so
I might as well do that.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.680
Let's see.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.880
I would need a piece of chalk.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.850
Here we go.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.540
OK.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.150
So it's a titanium
alloy honeycomb,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:30.810
and we're told h/l is 2,
theta's 45, and t/l is 0.05.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.120
And we're told that n-- why
don't I put the n over here-- n

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.135
is 0.806.

00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:46.270
And we're told the modulus of
the solid is 110 gigapascals,

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:54.131
and the yield strength of the
solid is 880 mega pascals.

00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:54.630
OK.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.230
So it says calculate
the value of

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.750
and describe the mechanism
of deformation failure

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.980
for-- and the first part is
the Young's modulus in the two

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.440
direction, e star 2.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.500
OK.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.950
So I don't remember
these formulas either,

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.210
so I need to look at my notes.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.415
And oh, I don't have the
formula for e 2 in my notes.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.760
Let me see.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.102
Is it in any of the problems?

00:07:22.102 --> 00:07:23.560
AUDIENCE: I have
the formula sheet.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.268
LORNA GIBSON: You have
the formula sheet?

00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:27.910
I didn't bring the
formula sheet with me.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.634
You have it?

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:34.028
Yeah, I think it's there.

00:07:34.028 --> 00:07:37.940
I'm pretty sure it's there.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.770
OK, so this is just
like substituting,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.450
and there's nothing
complicated about this.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:56.580
So it's equal to Es times t/l
cubed times h/l plus sine theta

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:01.230
divided by cos cubed theta.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.730
So then you just
plug everything in.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.360
So this is 110 gigapascals.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.580
And I'm going to put
110,000 mega pascals,

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.406
because it's probably going
to be less than a gigapascal.

00:08:12.406 --> 00:08:14.480
Then t/l is 0.05.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.120
So that's 0.05 cubed.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:28.980
And then h/l is 2 plus
sign of 45 is 0.707.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:35.480
And then we divide by cos
theta cubed, 0.707 cubed.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.510
And then I'm not going to
work it out, but that's OK.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.580
I assume that's what's
in the solution.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.387
Are we good?

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:43.470
So it's just substituting.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.880
That's all it is.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.530
In the second part-- OK.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.080
You need to change the time
on this, because it just

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.065
keeps timing out.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:56.540
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I don't know
how to change it, but I'll try.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.650
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, is
that what this is?

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.850
OK, this is the test.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.970
Oh, this is from 2013.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.890
Oh, the next-- if we keep going.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:07.610
Here we go.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.345
He's got it, so you
take your computer.

00:09:09.345 --> 00:09:10.780
AUDIENCE: That's
probably better.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.660
LORNA GIBSON: That's
perfect for everybody.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.160
OK.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.420
The second part is
the plateau stress

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.930
for loading in the x2 direction.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.530
So that's that.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.220
For loading in the
x2 direction, it

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.830
could either be an
elastic buckling collapse

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.294
stress, or a plastic
buckling collapse stress.

00:09:29.294 --> 00:09:30.960
So I'm going to
calculate both, and then

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.250
whichever one is lower,
that's the one it would be.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.330
So let's see here.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.880
So that's going to be-- I'm
missing my formulas again.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.440
Here we are.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.920
So here's the buckling one.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:50.200
It's n squared pi squared
over 24 times t cubed over lh

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.860
squared times 1 over cos theta.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.960
So you put 0.806
squared in here.

00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:06.860
Pi squared 24.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.690
So here you go.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:14.650
This is t over l cubed
times h over l squared.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.590
So that would be 0.05 cubed.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:28.180
And that would be 1 over 2
squared, and then 1 over 0.707,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.550
and then whatever that equals.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.225
OK?

00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:31.430
Are we good with that?

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.615
And then you'd want to
calculate sigma star to plastic.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:52.570
And that's equal to sigma
ys, t over l squared,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:59.850
and 1 over 2 cos squared theta.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.410
All right?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.910
So then sigma ys was
880 mega pascals.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.545
And t over l was our 0.05.

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:16.780
And that's 1 over 2
times 0.707 squared,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.540
and then whatever that equals.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.820
OK?

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.620
And then whichever one
of those would be less

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.910
is the plateau stress.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.325
So I don't-- yeah?

00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:30.366
AUDIENCE: So I know-- I
think I made this mistake

00:11:30.366 --> 00:11:34.950
in the problem set, but
here, because it's titanium,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.607
we don't consider it brittle.

00:11:36.607 --> 00:11:37.440
LORNA GIBSON: Right.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:37.870
Right.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:38.620
I mean, you could.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.130
But you don't need to.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.070
AUDIENCE: That was
something with ceramics?

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.850
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, or if it was
a glass, or ceramic, or maybe

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.770
an epoxy.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.430
Something that was brittle.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.400
And besides which, if
you look at the question,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.070
I only give you a yield
strength and a solid modulus.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.570
So to get the brittle
thing, I would

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.025
have to give you a
fracture strength.

00:11:56.025 --> 00:11:57.858
AUDIENCE: That's true
with all the problems.

00:11:59.392 --> 00:12:01.350
LORNA GIBSON: I usually
give you what you need.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.550
Especially on the
test, I'm going

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.410
to give you what you need.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.220
You're not going to
be looking things up.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.340
OK?

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.370
So we're good so far?

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.360
OK, let me go back
to the question.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.530
So then the third one is the
out of plane Young's modulus

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.810
in the x3 direction.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.350
And that's just going to be
Es times the relative density.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.470
And the relative
density-- let's see.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.940
So it's Es times
rho star over rho s.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:39.236
So that's 110,000 mega pascals.

00:12:39.236 --> 00:12:41.110
And then there's also
the very first equation

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.720
on this is the relative density.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:51.920
So it's t/l times h/l
plus 2 divided by 2 cos

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.350
theta h/l plus sine theta.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.170
So I'm not going to
substitute everything in, OK?

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.310
So that was it.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:05.000
It was very plug and chug.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.640
Are you good?

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.402
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a question
about a specific question.

00:13:12.049 --> 00:13:14.340
LORNA GIBSON: I'm going to
go through the rest of them.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.410
She wants me to
do the whole test.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.640
You want me to do the
whole test, right?

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.999
AUDIENCE: That would be
great, but if other people

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.290
have other questions it's fine.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.090
LORNA GIBSON: Why don't
I do the whole test.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.213
And then there's going
to be time, I think.

00:13:23.213 --> 00:13:24.129
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:35.652 --> 00:13:38.260
LORNA GIBSON: Let me do
the test from last unit.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.585
OK, so that's number one.

00:13:40.585 --> 00:13:42.870
Or that's one and two.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:50.800
And then three is, a closed
cell elastomeric polyethylene

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.210
foam has a relative
density of 0.05

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.869
and a volume fraction of
solid in the edges of 0.6.

00:13:57.869 --> 00:13:59.785
They give you the Young's
modulus of the solid

00:13:59.785 --> 00:14:01.464
is 0.2 gigapascals.

00:14:01.464 --> 00:14:02.880
The pressure within
the cell walls

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.360
is atmospheric,
0.1 mega pascals.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.170
And the Poisson's ratio
of the foam is 0.3.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.650
And you're asked to get the
Young's modulus of the foam,

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.320
the compressive plateau stress.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.450
And then there's a
question about why

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.870
does the Young's modulus
depend on the solid modulus

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.330
and relative density, while
the Poisson's ratio does not.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.725
So let me go through, then.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.200
So the first one
is, what's e star.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.690
And we're told relative
density is 0.05.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.096
The volume fraction
in the edges is 0.6.

00:14:41.096 --> 00:14:42.860
So remember, that was
what we called phi.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.610
So phi's 0.6.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:54.140
The Young's modulus of the
solid is 0.2 gigapascals.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:00.130
The initial pressure within
the cells is 0.1 mega pascal.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:08.410
and Poisson's ratio
for the foam is 0.3.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.874
And it's a closed cell.

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.580
So if you remember--
oh, let's see.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.955
I think back here,
was I supposed

00:15:16.955 --> 00:15:18.774
to-- I was supposed
to say something

00:15:18.774 --> 00:15:20.190
about the mechanism
of deformation

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.440
and failure for the first one.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.630
So the mechanism of deformation
in the modulus in the 2

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.510
direction is bending.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.591
The mechanism of failure
here is buckling.

00:15:28.591 --> 00:15:30.340
The mechanism of failure
here is yielding.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.700
And the mechanism of deformation
here was axial deformation, OK?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.400
So I forgot to say that.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.030
OK, let me go back here.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.110
So for this one, if
it's a closed cell foam,

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.280
remember there were three
terms to the modulus.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.710
There was one from
bending of the edges, one

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.790
from stretching of
the faces, and one

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.960
from the gas
contribution if you've

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.840
got gas inside the cells.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.756
So again, I'm going to have
to peek at the equation.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.290
Foams.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.125
Here we go, foams.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:15:59.625
OK.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:19.740
And then this gas one.

00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:29.240
Get rid of that.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.540
OK, so this one is just
the same kind of thing.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.760
It's just plug and chug.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.413
Do I need to put
all the numbers in?

00:16:44.413 --> 00:16:47.144
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:47.144 --> 00:16:49.450
I guess I'm a
little bit confused

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.108
why you need the pressure term.

00:16:53.108 --> 00:16:56.730
Because you talked
about faces bursting.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.692
LORNA GIBSON: Ah, so if it's the
modulus, remember the modulus--

00:17:01.692 --> 00:17:03.150
so the question
is, why do you need

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.240
to worry about the
pressure because I talked

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.390
about the faces bursting.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.380
And remember, the
stress strain curve

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.599
looks something like that.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:18.079
Maybe the slope of the curve is
a little bit higher over here.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.040
But this is the modulus
down here, right?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.609
The modulus is related to
the initial stress strain

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.920
relationship.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.800
And initially, they're
not going to burst.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.080
You'd have to load it up
to some amount of stress

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.460
before the faces burst, right?

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.434
So when you're down
here, the faces

00:17:36.434 --> 00:17:38.850
certainly down at the beginning,
they're not burst, right?

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.400
You have to get some stress
before they're going to burst.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.750
And in some materials, when
you get up around here,

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.480
around the plateau stress--
let's just call that sigma

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.340
star-- then they might burst.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.970
And then the pressure
term would disappear

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.890
and the face term
would disappear.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:01.150
So if I don't tell you to
ignore them, if I don't say

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.720
they're going to burst, or I
don't say they're negligible,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.930
I would calculate them.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.640
And then if they're
small, then you say,

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.440
well, they're negligible.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.854
OK?

00:18:10.854 --> 00:18:11.770
Are we good with that?

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.650
You're good?

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.590
You're good?

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.670
Sardar, you don't
need to be here.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.320
But you can stay if you want,
but you don't need to be here.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.120
OK, are you good?

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.130
Everybody else good?

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.180
OK.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:32.450
That was A. B, what's
the compressive plateau

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.680
stress of the foam.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.660
So here, they want to
know what sigma star is.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.730
You're told it's elastomeric.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.610
So if it's elastomeric,
it's like a rubber.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.692
It's rubbery.

00:18:43.692 --> 00:18:45.400
So if it's rubbery,
it's going to buckle.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.400
It's not going to yield.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.940
It's not going to be brittle.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:53.600
So you can just calculate
the elastic stress here.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:01.512
And if we flip over to our handy
dandy list of equations-- blah,

00:19:01.512 --> 00:19:02.220
blah, blah, blah.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:02.896
Oh, pooh.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.300
I'm realizing--
yeah, so I don't have

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.770
the term here for the
faces or for the gas,

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.233
so here we could assume
it's going to rupture.

00:19:17.233 --> 00:19:18.816
So let's assume it's
going to rupture.

00:19:27.179 --> 00:19:28.970
So if we assume that
it's going to rupture,

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:33.670
it would be just like
the open celled foams.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:39.955
And then you can just use that.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.310
And that's been found to work
fairly well for the open celled

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.912
and the closed cell foams.

00:19:48.912 --> 00:19:54.340
AUDIENCE: And we assume
that faces rupture because--

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.860
LORNA GIBSON:
Well, to be honest,

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.154
I can't remember if last year
I got to this point in the test

00:19:59.154 --> 00:20:01.070
and somebody said, we
don't have the equation,

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.530
and I gave them the equation
with the other terms,

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.410
or if we just assumed
that the faces ruptured.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.040
I can't remember.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.820
To be honest, I think
probably for elastomeric foam,

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.162
you could assume that they'd
probably don't rupture

00:20:15.162 --> 00:20:16.453
unless they're very, very thin.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.265
AUDIENCE: So what kind of foams
do they typically rupture in?

00:20:23.265 --> 00:20:25.390
LORNA GIBSON: So certainly
if you had a metal foam,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.390
they'd probably rupture.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:35.310
If you had, say, a polymer
foam that was more rigid,

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.520
like a rigid polyurethane.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.005
So polyurethanes
can be flexible,

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:41.880
which means they're made
out of an elastomer,

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.410
or they can be rigid.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:48.336
And the foams that are
typically used for insulation,

00:20:48.336 --> 00:20:49.710
thermal insulation,
are typically

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.550
closed celled
polyurethane foams.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.200
And those typically
have very thin faces,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.420
and they would rupture.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.100
Yeah?

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.040
AUDIENCE: Are you looking
for the Young's modulus

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.385
in this problem?

00:21:04.385 --> 00:21:05.760
LORNA GIBSON: The
Young's modulus

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.040
was the first part, right?

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.824
So part A was the
Young's modulus.

00:21:08.824 --> 00:21:09.490
AUDIENCE: In B--

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.614
LORNA GIBSON: In B is the
collapse stress, the compressor

00:21:12.614 --> 00:21:13.114
strength.

00:21:13.114 --> 00:21:19.100
AUDIENCE: So I think in my
notes, I think it has this.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.000
If the--

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.470
LORNA GIBSON: Right, if p0 is
bigger than-- so what she's

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.630
showing me in her notes is I
had a little note in the class,

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.610
in the lecture, that if the
initial pressure in the cells

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.280
is greater than atmospheric,
then the cell walls are

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.390
pre-stressed and you have to
overcome that in the buckling.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.640
AUDIENCE: Is that atmospheric?

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.700
LORNA GIBSON: That is
atmospheric pressure.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.684
AUDIENCE: So you don't
need the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:39.684 --> 00:21:40.392
LORNA GIBSON: No.

00:21:40.392 --> 00:21:41.840
Yeah.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.010
OK?

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.880
OK.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.300
Yeah, you don't know
that that's atmospheric.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.240
So do you ever do things in PSI?

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.040
No, you don't.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.200
Because when I was a
student a long time ago,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.450
the thing I remember learning
was atmospheric pressure

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.400
is 14.7 PSI, more or less.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.870
And the conversion between
mega pascals and PSI

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.710
is there's more or less
145 PSI to a mega pascal,

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:11.120
so the atmospheric pressure
is about 0.1 mega pascals.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:11.620
Yeah?

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.266
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
this is a silly question,

00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:17.230
but for part B, how do
we get from the Young's

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.105
modulus of the foam--

00:22:18.105 --> 00:22:19.979
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:22:19.979 --> 00:22:21.660
I put the wrong thing down here.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.740
Sorry, my mistake.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.768
OK, now you happy?

00:22:26.768 --> 00:22:27.267
Sorry.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.252
OK, shall I move on
to the next part?

00:22:32.252 --> 00:22:32.960
Another question?

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.174
AUDIENCE: Well, I had a
question about number two,

00:22:35.174 --> 00:22:36.900
but maybe we can
come back to that--

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.441
LORNA GIBSON: OK,
let me finish this,

00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:40.110
and then we'll go
back to number two.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.080
So this one here,
the part C is why

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.436
does the Young's
modulus foam depend

00:22:45.436 --> 00:22:47.310
on the solid modulus
and the relative density

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.470
while the Poisson's
ratio does not.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.400
So when I write the equation
for the Young's modulus,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.820
the solid modulus comes into
it, the relative density

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.800
comes into it.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.910
And remember when we
had the Poisson's ratio,

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.140
it's just a constant that
depends on the cell geometry.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:08.710
So here's C, nu star
just as a constant.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.223
And that constant just
depends on the cell geometry.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.750
So if you think of
the Poisson's ratio,

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.790
it's the ratio of
two strains, right?

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.730
So say I have my foam here.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.710
So say that's just
a block of foam.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.600
Little cells in it here.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.800
Little cells.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.480
And say I press on
it this way here.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.504
And let's call this
the one direction

00:23:34.504 --> 00:23:35.420
and the two direction.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.380
If I press it in
the two direction,

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.460
the Poisson's ratio is
then just nu would be--

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.550
let's see, this would be 2, 1.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.640
It'd be the strain
in the one direction

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.430
over the strain in
the two direction.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.250
So it's the ratio of
two strains, right?

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:58.780
And if you think of our model
for the elastic behavior

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:03.240
of the foam, each
of those strains

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.270
is going to be related to some
bending deformation in the cell

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.560
walls or the cell struts.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.720
And this strain here
is going to be--

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.740
let me make this proportional.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.215
It's going to be proportional
to a delta over l.

00:24:17.215 --> 00:24:19.090
And this one here is
going to be proportional

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.060
to the delta over l.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.100
So this might be delta
in the one direction,

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.260
and this will be delta
in the two direction.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.760
But those two things
are both going

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.360
to be related to the bending
deflection of the beams, right?

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.060
And since both of
those deltas are

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.304
related to the bending
deflection of the beams,

00:24:39.304 --> 00:24:40.720
we could write
them-- if you want,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.690
I could write that as f l cubed
over E of the solid times t

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.110
to the fourth.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.600
And then that's times 1 over l.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.270
And then this thing here is also
f l cubed over E of the solid t

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.000
to the fourth 1 over l.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.592
So everything cancels out
except the geometrical constant.

00:25:02.592 --> 00:25:04.550
And if you remember when
we did the honeycombs,

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.040
it looked exactly the same.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.530
When we looked at the Poisson's
ratio of the honeycombs,

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.830
we had the strain
in one direction

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.600
over the strain in
another direction.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.170
And each of those
strains was related

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.810
to some component of delta.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.640
There was a delta
1 and a delta 2.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.130
But the delta 1 might
be delta sine theta

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.440
and delta 2 was delta cos theta.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.680
So if the deltas are the same,
then it all just cancels out.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.598
And all you're left with
is a geometrical constant.

00:25:32.598 --> 00:25:33.590
OK?

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:37.150
Do you get physically
why that is?

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.130
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about this.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.595
Because we're given most of
the equations that we need,

00:25:42.595 --> 00:25:45.210
is it only in
conceptual questions

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.434
that we should know how we
actually derived that version?

00:25:48.434 --> 00:25:49.850
LORNA GIBSON: I'm
not going to ask

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.015
you to derive that equation
for a closed cell foam.

00:25:53.015 --> 00:25:54.390
AUDIENCE: I meant
this last part.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:58.720
LORNA GIBSON: Well yeah, you
should be able to explain that.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.490
But I mean just at this level.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.070
Nothing very
mathematically involved.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.870
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.570
LORNA GIBSON: OK, are we good?

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.472
So that was the end of the test
for the undergraduates, OK?

00:26:11.472 --> 00:26:12.930
And then for the
graduate students,

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.210
just like the problem sets, I
just have an extra question.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.750
And that's what I
did this year, too.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.791
So the graduate students
have one extra question.

00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:19.477
So you and you.

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:20.935
Is anybody else a
graduate student?

00:26:20.935 --> 00:26:23.350
I think it's just
the two of you.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.140
You're post post-graduate.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.020
OK.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.700
OK.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.607
So let's see.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.410
So this one says,
the performance--

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.504
so this is on the performance
indices which I told you

00:26:38.504 --> 00:26:41.170
you didn't need to know for this
test, partly because, remember,

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.128
we missed two lectures.

00:26:42.128 --> 00:26:45.014
We're not exactly on the same
spot as we were last year.

00:26:45.014 --> 00:26:46.180
But I can do it if you want.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.454
Do you want me to do it, or
should we do other questions?

00:26:49.454 --> 00:26:54.174
AUDIENCE: What do the
grad students think?

00:26:54.174 --> 00:26:54.965
LORNA GIBSON: Sure.

00:26:54.965 --> 00:26:55.430
OK.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.138
So the question is,
the performance index

00:26:57.138 --> 00:26:59.920
to minimize the mass of a beam
of a given bending stiffness,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.547
length and square cross-section
is e to the one half over rho.

00:27:02.547 --> 00:27:04.630
So you remember, we derived
that e to the one half

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:06.024
over rho in class.

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:08.440
In the section on wood, we saw
that this performance index

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.230
for wood is higher than
that for the solid cell wall

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.186
material in wood.

00:27:12.186 --> 00:27:13.060
Do you remember that?

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:18.190
The e to the one half over
rho for the wood was, I think,

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:23.890
rho s over rho star to
the one half times Es

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.560
to the one half over rho s.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.100
So explain why wood
has a higher value of e

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.500
to the one half over rho than
the solid cell wall material.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.880
And then part B is, suggest
a design for an engineering

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.663
material based on wood
that has high values of e

00:27:38.663 --> 00:27:41.310
to the one half over rho.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:54.400
So one way to explain it is to
say that if you're looking at e

00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:05.140
to the one half over rho, you
can say for wood, E over Es

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.250
is equal to rho star
over rho s for loading

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.820
in the axial direction.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:20.730
So this will be for loading
actually along the grain.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.030
And that's what we
were looking at.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.340
So that's what I'm
talking about here.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:50.160
So I think-- let me just
see if this is right.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:50.680
Yeah.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.320
So this equation here is exactly
the same as that equation

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.630
there, right?

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.190
And this is basically saying
that this is the performance

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:01.130
index for the wood.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.150
This is the performance
index for the solid.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.920
And this factor here
is bigger than 1,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.990
because the solid density is
higher than the wood density.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.150
OK?

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:15.690
So really, all you have to
do is say that for the wood,

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.440
the modulus in the longitudinal
or the axial direction

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.310
along with grain varies linearly
with the relative density.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.110
And it probably
would be a good idea

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:29.947
to say that this is a result
of the cell walls deforming

00:29:29.947 --> 00:29:30.446
axially.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.540
So when you take the cells,
if you think of the wood cells

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:42.760
as being something like that and
you're loading it this way on,

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.770
the cells just actually
shorten, and the modulus

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.560
depends on the-- it just is the
volume fraction of solid times

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.760
the modulus of the solid.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.260
And that's where
this comes from.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:57.050
And once you have this, that
basically gives you that.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.050
OK?

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.500
Are we good with that?

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.680
So that's why it's higher.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.680
Another way to
look at it as sort

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.017
of more of a
hand-wavy argument is

00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:11.850
that if you have a
certain amount of solid--

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.960
so say you have a
certain mass of solid.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.751
If it's solid, it takes up a
certain cross-sectional area.

00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:18.750
So say that your beam's
a certain length, that's

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.624
going to have a certain
cross-sectional area.

00:30:20.624 --> 00:30:23.560
And if you have wood, if you
have a cellular material,

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.170
if you have the
same mass, you're

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.360
essentially making the
dimensions of that piece

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.160
bigger.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.420
So you're moving the
material further away.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.320
And as you're making
it bigger, you're

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.030
increasing the
moment of inertia.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:40.890
And so you're increasing the
bending resistance of it.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:45.090
That's another, more hand-waving
way to talk about it.

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.970
And then the second
part is to suggest

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.020
a design for an
engineering material

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.240
based on wood that would
have high values of e

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.847
to the one half over rho.

00:30:54.847 --> 00:30:57.180
So remember when we looked
at those material performance

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.340
charts, we said that wood was
similar to engineering fiber

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.460
composites.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.540
But those data for
fiber composites

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.700
are assuming that it's solid,
the fiber composite's a solid.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.880
So if you could take
fiber composites

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.940
and make little tubes
of fiber composites

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.580
and assemble the tubes together
so that it was like wood,

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.860
would get something that
would be even higher.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:24.090
So if you could make, say,
a fiber composite honeycomb

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:33.820
material, and you'd want
to have the fibers aligned

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:51.330
along the prism axis
of the honeycomb,

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.140
then you would
get higher values.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.870
It would be the same-- it'd be
this sort of argument again,

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.720
but now with a fiber composite.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:07.360
So you'd want-- if this was
your fiber composite like this,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.500
you'd want the
fibers-- well, in wood,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.000
they're at a little
bit of an angle.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.170
But say they were
lined up like that.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.670
You'd want them
something like that,

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:21.280
then loading it
that way on, right?

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.120
And if one way to think
about those charts

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.520
is if you-- say we had a plot.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:33.880
And say this was
log of the modulus

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.860
and that was log of the density.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.730
And I think I'll just
draw the envelope.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.140
So foams were
somewhere down here,

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:47.720
metals were somewhere over
here, and with elastomers we're

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.760
somewhere in here.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.257
I think ceramics were up here.

00:32:56.257 --> 00:32:58.590
And then I can't remember
exactly where composites were,

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.650
but composites were
around about here.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.270
I'll just say FRC for fiber
reinforced composites.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:08.480
And I think woods
were kind of in here.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.606
Something like that.

00:33:09.606 --> 00:33:11.480
And then we had our
performance index, right?

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.440
So remember, there was
a performance index,

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.530
something like that.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:20.320
And that slope of that was
e to the one half over rho.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.710
So every point on that line
had the same value of e

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:23.862
to the one half over rho.

00:33:23.862 --> 00:33:25.820
And essentially, if you
had the fiber composite

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.470
and you made a
honeycomb out of it,

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.550
you would be taking
the data from here

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.410
and shifting them out that way.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.000
You'd be pushing
them out over here,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.750
so you'd get a higher value
of that performance index.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.250
OK?

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.450
So that's the test
from last year.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:42.410
That's the end-- yeah?

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.815
AUDIENCE: So for
along right here

00:33:44.815 --> 00:33:49.624
or different it would be cubed.

00:33:49.624 --> 00:33:52.040
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, so the
thing about the honeycombs is--

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.790
AUDIENCE: The opposite.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:53.623
LORNA GIBSON: Right.

00:33:53.623 --> 00:33:54.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.826
LORNA GIBSON: It'd be
worse, that's true.

00:33:56.826 --> 00:33:58.200
So the thing about
the honeycombs

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.326
is they're very stiff
in the axial direction,

00:34:01.326 --> 00:34:03.200
but you pay for that in
the other directions.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.030
And it's the same for wood.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:08.739
So the wood is very good when
you load it along the grain,

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:10.840
but you pay for
it the other way.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.429
But if you think of from
the tree's point of view--

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.730
if you're a tree.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:16.460
So here's my little tree.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.440
So here, say we have a tree
trunk, and we have some branch.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.909
Branch over here,
branches, tree.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:25.830
So the grain is
lined up this way.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.699
And then when there's
a branch, the grain

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.540
turns around and
goes that way, right?

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.473
So if you think of
the tree as a whole,

00:34:32.473 --> 00:34:35.650
the whole tree blows
in the wind like this.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.630
So it's like a column like
this, and everything's

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.799
lined up that way.

00:34:40.799 --> 00:34:42.090
And you're loading it this way.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.219
So that is the stiff
direction, right?

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.639
And if you're a
branch, the branches

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.239
are more loaded by gravity.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.070
So they're loaded that way.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.520
And then because the fibers,
the grain turns around,

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.950
they're also oriented
in the good direction.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:03.440
So from the tree's point of
view, it's optimized things.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.540
Then you remember when I talked
about the old wooden sailing

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.980
ships, when they made
the old wooden sailing

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.100
ships, if this was the deck here
and that was the haul there,

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.480
they would get pieces
of wood to fit in here

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.560
that were called the knees.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.990
That was the knee.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.050
And they would try
to get a piece that

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:25.710
was from a branch like this.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:29.890
And they would try to match
the curve of that joint

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.450
with the branch with the curve
that they needed in here so

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.780
that the grain followed
the pattern of what

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.630
they needed for the boat.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.164
OK.

00:35:39.164 --> 00:35:39.830
Other questions?

00:35:42.442 --> 00:35:44.843
AUDIENCE: I'm not
quite sure what

00:35:44.843 --> 00:35:47.890
the difference between
tangential versus ray here.

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.000
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, OK.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.210
So in the wood, you mean?

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.793
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:50.793 --> 00:35:52.040
LORNA GIBSON: OK.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.720
So can I rub this stuff off?

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.375
We're happy?

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:23.890
Let's see.

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:24.500
Say again?

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.160
So tangential and radial.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.020
OK.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:32.970
So say the wood cells
look something like this.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:42.910
So these would be the fiber
cells or the tracheids

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:48.400
And then the rays typically
are more rectangular cells.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.510
So they might look
something like that.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:55.909
And then they would be some
more fibers or tracheids,

00:36:55.909 --> 00:36:57.950
depending on if it was a
soft wood or a hardwood.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:05.892
So these would be either
fibers or tracheids

00:37:05.892 --> 00:37:07.940
in a hardwood or a soft wood.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.260
And then these would be
the ray cells in here.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.009
So they have a
different structure.

00:37:12.009 --> 00:37:13.050
They just look different.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:13.805
They're different shape.

00:37:13.805 --> 00:37:14.430
AUDIENCE: This is the top?

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:15.171
From the top?

00:37:15.171 --> 00:37:17.420
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, this is
looking from the top down.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:23.450
And then if you
think of the tree--

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.450
so the tree's going to
have growth rings, right?

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:27.699
So the growth rings are
going to look-- obviously

00:37:27.699 --> 00:37:29.490
I'm not making perfect
circles, but you get

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.840
the idea-- something like that.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.810
And then the rays go this way.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:36.050
They go radially.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.020
OK?

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:42.170
So this would be the
radial direction,

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.470
and then those are the rays.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.453
Are we good?

00:37:45.453 --> 00:37:49.330
AUDIENCE: So which
way's the tangential?

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:52.570
LORNA GIBSON: So the tangential
would be this way on, OK?

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.980
So if I loaded
this way like that,

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.735
that would be loading it in
the tangential direction.

00:37:58.735 --> 00:38:00.110
And if I loaded
it this way, that

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:01.943
would be loading it in
the radial direction.

00:38:01.943 --> 00:38:04.538
The length of the rays runs
in the radial direction.

00:38:04.538 --> 00:38:06.365
The length this way on.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.760
So this thing here
corresponds to one

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.390
of these lines I've drawn here.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:24.160
And then these guys here are
the stuff in between here.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:29.890
AUDIENCE: How do you know what
the tangential, the Young's

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:34.120
modulus and stiffness is?

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.930
LORNA GIBSON: So say we were
loading it tangentially,

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.140
we're loading it like that.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.820
Then--

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.830
AUDIENCE: If you have
a tree, how do you

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.450
apply a tangential load on it?

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.700
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, well it's
not the whole tree, right?

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.620
So say we have a piece of wood
that we cut out like this.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.290
So say I have that.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:56.820
And if I loaded it this way on,
I'd be loading it tangentially.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.350
The tree's big, right?

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.351
So I'm not talking about
loading the whole tree,

00:39:00.351 --> 00:39:02.683
I'm talking about taking a
piece of wood out of the tree

00:39:02.683 --> 00:39:03.588
and loading it.

00:39:03.588 --> 00:39:06.565
AUDIENCE: OK, so you can't
really load tangentially

00:39:06.565 --> 00:39:09.475
for the entire trunk.

00:39:09.475 --> 00:39:11.750
LORNA GIBSON: No, I'm talking
about taking a piece out

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.664
and loading that piece.

00:39:13.664 --> 00:39:15.562
AUDIENCE: How about a ray here?

00:39:15.562 --> 00:39:16.270
Do you take the--

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.150
LORNA GIBSON: So the same thing.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.390
You'd take-- say this
was the piece of wood

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.710
that you were looking at.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.640
Now you would just
load it this way on.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.280
OK?

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:30.030
I think-- I brought my thing
because I have the slides.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:31.870
Let me see if I can
find-- I think there

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.415
was a slide that showed this.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.010
OK.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.626
That was Furry Fridays.

00:39:46.626 --> 00:39:47.750
That was the wood sculptor.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:50.490
Here we go.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.296
OK, so imagine that that
cube is your piece of wood

00:39:53.296 --> 00:39:54.420
that you're loading, right?

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.819
So imagine this is the--
you cut a little piece out.

00:39:57.819 --> 00:39:59.110
Then you're loading it tangent.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.000
Can you see, then?

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.225
You can load it-- you're
not loading the whole tree.

00:40:02.225 --> 00:40:04.725
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was thinking
about loading the entire tree

00:40:04.725 --> 00:40:06.950
and then applying the
tangential load on it.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.276
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, because
then-- I see the problem.

00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:10.900
AUDIENCE: It's going
to give us shears.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.897
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah.

00:40:11.897 --> 00:40:13.605
Yeah, because I could
say, well, if I was

00:40:13.605 --> 00:40:14.896
trying to load the whole thing.

00:40:14.896 --> 00:40:17.120
Say I was loading it
from here to there.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.349
Well if you look at it one
way, it looks tangential.

00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:22.390
If you look at it the
other way, it looks radial.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.260
So think of cutting a
piece out, because that

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:24.940
is what you're going to do.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.580
You're going to cut a piece out.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.060
OK?

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.172
All right.

00:40:29.172 --> 00:40:30.255
Are there other questions?

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:34.610
Yes?

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:35.062
AUDIENCE: With
that formula sheet,

00:40:35.062 --> 00:40:37.774
do you only give that
formula for the honeycombs,

00:40:37.774 --> 00:40:39.077
or also for the foams?

00:40:39.077 --> 00:40:41.660
LORNA GIBSON: I'm going to give
you-- if you look at, I think,

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.300
problem set 2, I
gave you a sheet that

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.260
had three pages of equations.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.570
And it looked exactly like this.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.720
So there was one
saying, properties

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.554
of two dimensional cellular
solids-- honeycombs.

00:40:54.554 --> 00:40:56.470
There was a whole thing
of in plane properties

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:58.240
and out of plane properties.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.730
That was one page.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:05.070
The next page was properties of
regular hexagonal honeycombs.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.780
And then the next
page was properties

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.656
of three dimensional
cellular solids foams.

00:41:10.656 --> 00:41:11.655
AUDIENCE: OK, excellent.

00:41:11.655 --> 00:41:12.440
Thank you.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.320
LORNA GIBSON: OK?

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.700
Like I just said,
I think there's

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.575
maybe one or two equations
missing from this.

00:41:16.575 --> 00:41:19.033
But if it was something you
needed, I would give it to you.

00:41:19.033 --> 00:41:20.230
I would give it to you.

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:22.370
OK?

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.370
AUDIENCE: So I should
have scrolled down for it?

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:25.310
LORNA GIBSON: What?

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:26.380
You should have scrolled?

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.687
So you're like me.

00:41:27.687 --> 00:41:29.020
This happens to me all the time.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:29.950
I have some website.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:30.700
I'm looking at it.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.310
I'm like, OK.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.810
I got it.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.680
I think I've got everything.

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.130
And then I realized I'm
supposed to-- I missed something

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:36.558
because I was supposed
to scroll down.

00:41:36.558 --> 00:41:37.474
AUDIENCE: Problem set two
was only the honeycombs.

00:41:37.474 --> 00:41:38.390
That's why.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:39.320
LORNA GIBSON: Well, I
think that was probably

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.866
all we covered was the
honeycombs on that problem set.

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:43.740
AUDIENCE: So that's why
I only got that part.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:44.524
LORNA GIBSON: OK.

00:41:44.524 --> 00:41:45.190
All right, yeah.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:48.950
So I'm going to give you, this
will be attached to the test.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:49.850
OK?

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.740
So I think on the test that
I posted it was attached,

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:54.910
wasn't it?

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:55.547
Yeah.

00:41:55.547 --> 00:41:57.088
[INAUDIBLE], did
you have a question?

00:41:57.088 --> 00:42:01.516
AUDIENCE: For 2 part D, I
don't think we went over that.

00:42:01.516 --> 00:42:07.150
I was confused as
to how-- is it just

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:12.880
that equilateral triangular
cells always have-- is always

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.671
truss behavior?

00:42:14.671 --> 00:42:15.670
LORNA GIBSON: Let's see.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:16.503
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:42:16.503 --> 00:42:18.560
It's the 2014 test.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.620
LORNA GIBSON: 2014-- oh, sorry.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.400
I missed a part.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.990
Sorry.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:25.760
Yeah, so it says, the
same titanium alloy

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.844
is used to make a honeycomb with
equilateral triangular cells.

00:42:28.844 --> 00:42:30.510
And what is the in
plane Young's modulus

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:34.400
for loading in the x 2 direction
of the triangular honeycomb?

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:50.950
So this is-- say you have
cells that look like that now.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:56.100
And that's x 1.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.123
That's x 2.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.800
OK.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:07.110
So the Young's
modulus for this--

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.517
so I happen to
remember the formula.

00:43:09.517 --> 00:43:11.100
So I guess I'm
thinking you might have

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.330
put this on your cheat sheets.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:18.960
It's 1.15 times Es times that,
times the relative density.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.790
So I'm trying to remember.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.180
Do I have that on here?

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.291
I don't have it on here.

00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:27.255
AUDIENCE: Are we just
supposed to know that?

00:43:31.183 --> 00:43:32.660
Are we just supposed to--

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.076
LORNA GIBSON: Well,
I guess what I

00:43:34.076 --> 00:43:37.580
would hope that you would know
is maybe not the constant,

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.710
but that it should
go as Es and linearly

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.540
with the relative density.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.330
Because it's a truss and
because it deforms axially.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.880
I don't really expect that
you would remember the 1.15.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.116
Yeah?

00:43:49.116 --> 00:43:52.792
AUDIENCE: So does that mean for
all the foams, of which there

00:43:52.792 --> 00:43:55.950
were like 10 constants, we
don't need to write all down,

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:57.860
like what C1 equals--

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.860
LORNA GIBSON: I think that's
what this thing gives you.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:02.370
Let's see.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.240
It gives you all the Cs.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.930
All right, then I'll make
sure I give you the Cs.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:11.086
I'll make sure I
give you the Cs.

00:44:11.086 --> 00:44:13.460
But who's got a pen so I can
write that down to make sure

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:14.165
that I do that?

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:19.580
Does somebody got
a piece of paper.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.940
Or I could write it down here.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.900
Oh, here we go.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.070
I can write it down this
little sticky thing here.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:38.755
OK.

00:44:38.755 --> 00:44:41.050
So I'll stick that on there
so I remember to do that.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:45.066
AUDIENCE: Will you also
be writing what Cs?

00:44:45.066 --> 00:44:47.442
Because you have, in
your equation, C1, C2--

00:44:47.442 --> 00:44:48.900
LORNA GIBSON: Well,
I think I would

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.890
say-- say I asked you
for, I don't know,

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:57.050
the yield stress for
a foam in compression

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:58.830
that yields plastically.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:03.006
I would say, the
constant for that is 0.3.

00:45:03.006 --> 00:45:04.330
I wouldn't give you C2.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.270
I wouldn't do it by
numbers, I would tell you

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.030
what the number was for
the thing you needed,

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.810
because I mean the
way the numbers are,

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:11.970
the only reason
they're numbered is

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:13.928
because that's the number
they are in the book.

00:45:13.928 --> 00:45:16.240
They're just ordered
sequentially in the book.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.510
But I don't expect you
to remember which--

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.140
it's C6, or C5 or something.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.430
So anyone else?

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.418
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain the difference

00:45:28.418 --> 00:45:35.235
between uniaxial yield
and plastic buckling?

00:45:35.235 --> 00:45:36.110
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, OK.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:54.930
So if you have something and
it fails by uniaxial yield--

00:45:54.930 --> 00:46:01.540
so say you have a
honeycomb like this,

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.190
and you're loading
it this way on, OK?

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.320
So if you're loading
it that way on,

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.530
these walls of the honeycomb
are just axially deforming,

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:12.170
initially.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:12.669
Right?

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:16.790
So the elastic behaviors,
they just axially deform.

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:22.290
So it works out that if these
cell walls are very thick, then

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:26.200
you can reach a yield stress
before any buckling occurs.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.860
And then the strength would
just be that yield stress

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:35.780
of the cell wall material
times the relative density.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:36.780
OK?

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.299
But the cell walls have to
be thick for that to happen.

00:46:39.299 --> 00:46:41.340
So then imagine that the
cell walls aren't thick.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.630
Imagine that the
cell walls are thin.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:49.781
So say I have the same
honeycomb like this.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.840
If the walls are thin,
and say the solid material

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.400
itself-- so this is
for the solid-- it

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.490
has some stress strain curve.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:10.400
And it may have a linear
elastic part, and then

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.060
a yield thing like that.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.850
So say this is the
yield strength here.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:22.480
Say we compress that this way
on the same thing in the three

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.860
direction.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.180
Then if a material's
got a yield point,

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.310
there can be an
interaction between plastic

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.190
yielding and elastic buckling.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:34.210
And you can get
plastic buckling.

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:36.190
And the plastic
buckling, you're going

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:38.860
to get the wrinkles
that go along

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.700
the length of it this way.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.150
remember I showed you that
tube that kind of collapsed

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.440
and folded up kind of thing?

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.840
That's plastic buckling.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.970
OK?

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:53.910
And typically, people use what's
called the tangential modulus

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:59.830
to calculate the buckling
stress for plastic buckling.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.900
And the tangential modulus
would be something related

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.190
to the tangent over there.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:08.890
I don't expect you
to be able to derive

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:11.590
plastic buckling equations.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:16.930
But the plastic
buckling-- you know what

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.810
elastic buckling is, right?

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:20.580
Yeah.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:21.420
Yeah.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:24.550
So one way to think
about plastic buckling

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:31.290
is, if you have-- and
I'm trying to remember.

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.365
This is called the
slenderness ratio.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.110
And I'm trying to
remember, is that l over r?

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:42.300
Imagine you had just a
circular cross section

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.460
and you had a length, l.

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:48.960
So you have a column here,
and it's got a length, l,

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.610
and it's got a radius, r.

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:52.470
Like that, OK?

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:55.060
So the longer it gets,
the more slender it is,

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.420
the higher the
slenderness ratio is.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:04.070
And this, I think, is
some sort of stress.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.270
If the slenderness ratio
of just a single column

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:08.600
is short-- if it's
stubby, if you

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.599
had a column that looked
kind of like that,

00:49:11.599 --> 00:49:12.640
It's not going to buckle.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.180
It's going to yield.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:18.872
And so if you compress
that, it would just yield.

00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:21.205
And it's just going to yield
at the yield stress, right?

00:49:21.205 --> 00:49:24.480
It's just going to yield at
sigma y of the solid, whatever

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.650
the solid is.

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:30.840
If you have a long column,
it would buckle elastically

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.770
by an Euler buckling.

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.394
And Euler buckling-- let's see.

00:49:35.394 --> 00:49:36.810
I'm going to run
out of room here.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:43.770
If you think of it in terms
of a stress instead of a load,

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:48.840
it's going to be in
squared pi squared Es i.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.970
Let's say i goes
as r to the fourth.

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:56.420
And this is going to
be l squared r squared.

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:56.920
Right?

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.350
This is going to
be a pi in here.

00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:59.766
There's going to
be a pie in here.

00:49:59.766 --> 00:50:03.180
I might have lost a
factor of 4, but it's

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:07.650
going to be-- let me make
this proportional, OK?

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.160
So the slenderness
ratio, there's

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.650
going to be an l over
r squared term here.

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:17.600
So I could cancel out the
four there and put a squared.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:29.940
So sigma Euler is going to go
as Es times r over l squared.

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.660
Like that.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.209
And so this is the Euler
buckling stress here, OK?

00:50:36.209 --> 00:50:37.250
So this would be elastic.

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:44.020
And right here at
this little corner,

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:48.340
it turns out life isn't quite
that mathematically exact.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.090
If you're near that
corner, it's not

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:51.920
like here it's
buckling elastically,

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.760
and here, it's
buckling plastically.

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.290
What happens is, if
you looked at data,

00:50:56.290 --> 00:51:01.490
data might do
something like that.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:04.770
So the sum interaction between
the elastic and the plastic.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:07.774
And that's kind of what's
going on with this thing here.

00:51:07.774 --> 00:51:08.690
Does that makes sense?

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:16.461
AUDIENCE: Plastic
buckling can-- OK,

00:51:16.461 --> 00:51:19.000
so if you unload
plastic buckling,

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.851
you get some of the
elastic part back?

00:51:21.851 --> 00:51:23.850
LORNA GIBSON: You're not
going to get much back.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:24.725
AUDIENCE: You're not?

00:51:24.725 --> 00:51:31.600
LORNA GIBSON: No, because once--
to get the plastic buckling,

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.680
you're very close to this.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.740
By the time you get
that deformation,

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.580
you've got locally,
it's yielded.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.430
It's not all elastic everywhere.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.870
It's going to yield in places.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:51.950
And once it starts yielding,
it's-- if you think of these

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:54.560
buckles forming, it's not like
you're at one spot on this

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.960
curve throughout
the whole thing.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.390
Some of it's more deformed,
and some of it's less deformed.

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:04.880
Let me pull up those plastically
buckled columns, those tubes.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.920
Get rid of that one.

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:14.740
Let me try and remind
myself where they were.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:18.300
I think-- honeycombs,
I want honeycombs.

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:21.062
Out of plane,
that's what I want.

00:52:21.062 --> 00:52:24.450
It was this thing here.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.830
So you see when you have--
that's just one tube,

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:29.900
but the whole honeycomb
would-- imagine that you have

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.530
groups of tubes put together.

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:35.420
They would have to fail
in some compatible way.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.662
But the deformation
and the stresses

00:52:38.662 --> 00:52:40.870
are not going to be uniform
through this whole thing,

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:41.060
right?

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.730
One part of it's going
to be at one stress,

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:44.920
and something else is going
to be at another stress.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.900
So parts of it are going
to yield plastically,

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.290
and you're not going
to recover that.

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:50.790
OK?

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:54.570
So in fact, they use these sorts
of things for energy absorption

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:58.490
devices, like in cars
and things like that.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:02.100
To absorb the energy
from the impact.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:02.760
More questions?

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:08.770
Let him have a turn.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:13.740
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I have a
question about I think 2013.

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:14.978
LORNA GIBSON: 2013, OK.

00:53:14.978 --> 00:53:16.144
AUDIENCE: The last question.

00:53:18.672 --> 00:53:19.630
It's about the plastic.

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:25.190
LORNA GIBSON: 2013.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:26.870
Let me rub some
of this stuff off.

00:53:58.887 --> 00:53:59.387
OK.

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.890
Here we go.

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:06.770
OK.

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:09.850
Oh, we haven't
covered this at all.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:13.204
So the last question,
this one here?

00:54:13.204 --> 00:54:13.870
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:14.920
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah,
so this question's

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.890
on energy absorption.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:17.400
We haven't got there yet.

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.997
AUDIENCE: How about-- OK.

00:54:20.997 --> 00:54:22.580
LORNA GIBSON: And
the third question's

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.500
on sandwich structure.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:27.060
So when I taught
the course in 2013,

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.440
I did the topics in
a different order.

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.145
So I did honeycombs,
and I did foams.

00:54:31.145 --> 00:54:32.770
And then I think I
did sandwich panels,

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:34.270
and I did energy absorption.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.480
And I left the stuff on the
wood and the cork to the end.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.480
So we haven't done that.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.550
So don't panic if you
haven't-- if you can't do that.

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:44.064
OK?

00:54:44.064 --> 00:54:44.980
You should have known.

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.521
Come on, you should have known
that if it talked about things

00:54:47.521 --> 00:54:50.310
we haven't covered yet, I'm not
going to give it on the test.

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:51.600
OK, what else?

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.220
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
more plastic hinges?

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.420
LORNA GIBSON: Plastic hinge, OK.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:03.413
So let's just say we have
a beam in bending, OK?

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:10.740
And say it just has a load
p in the middle, all right?

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.020
Are we good?

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:18.230
So this load in the middle,
then this reaction is p over 2,

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:20.540
and that reaction is p over 2.

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:25.770
And if I drew the sheer force
diagram, it'd go p over 2 up,

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:30.370
we go over, go p over 2
down, like 2 p over 2 down.

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:33.120
Over and back up.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.820
OK?

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:38.980
And then if I drew the
bending moment diagram,

00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:41.792
it would go up and
down like that.

00:55:41.792 --> 00:55:42.750
And that would be zero.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:43.708
And that would be zero.

00:55:43.708 --> 00:55:46.350
And this would be PL over 4.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.190
OK?

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:59.260
Are we OK with that?

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.726
We haven't got to the
end of the answer, but--

00:56:01.726 --> 00:56:03.110
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:04.570
We're not expected to--

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:05.810
LORNA GIBSON: No, no, you
don't need to do this.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:07.226
I'm just trying
to explain it now.

00:56:07.226 --> 00:56:10.650
You don't need to
retain that information,

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:11.480
for heaven's sakes.

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.720
No.

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.860
Come on, I'm so disappointed.

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:18.222
AUDIENCE: For the
moment, is it positive

00:56:18.222 --> 00:56:20.430
for the counterclockwise turns?

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:22.929
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, so you
remember for the beam bending,

00:56:22.929 --> 00:56:24.220
there's a different convention.

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.774
It's positive if it's
tension on the bottom.

00:56:26.774 --> 00:56:28.190
Are you in mechanical
engineering?

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:29.804
I though you were in
mechanical engineering.

00:56:29.804 --> 00:56:31.190
AUDIENCE: No, I take physics.

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:32.565
LORNA GIBSON: Oh,
you do physics.

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.850
All I really want to say is the
moment's maximum in the middle,

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:37.350
OK?

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:41.730
So let me just say the moment's
maximum in the middle, OK?

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:43.600
So then let's look
at the cross section.

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.220
So say I look at a
cross section here.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:56.470
Let's just make it rectangular
to make it easy for me to draw.

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:58.760
So it has width,
b, and a height, h.

00:56:58.760 --> 00:56:59.350
OK?

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:03.150
So this would be h on
this picture over here.

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:07.290
And remember, the neutral
axis goes through the middle

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.450
on the cross-section here.

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:12.140
And so one half of the
beam is in tension,

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.290
and the other half of the
beam is in compression.

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:17.380
So for this situation
here, this half of the bean

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.740
is going to see compression,
and that half of the beam

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:24.190
is going to see tension, OK?

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:25.494
Are we happy with that?

00:57:25.494 --> 00:57:26.410
We're happy with that.

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:27.420
OK.

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.530
Now let me draw the
stress distribution.

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:43.370
So if it's linear elastic
and it hasn't yielded yet,

00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:45.830
the stress distribution is
going to look like this.

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:48.180
So this is h again.

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.770
That's the height.

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:51.430
And now b is into the board.

00:57:55.775 --> 00:57:58.140
And I'm plotting
the stress this way.

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.020
So this thing here
is my neutral axis.

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:03.660
It has no stress.

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:05.750
Remember, there was one
plane that has no stress,

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:07.270
and for a rectangular
cross-section,

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:09.565
it goes through the middle
of the cross-section.

00:58:09.565 --> 00:58:12.820
It goes through the centroid.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.280
Is this ringing a bell?

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.880
I'm hoping this
is ringing a bell.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.270
Come on.

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:19.970
I know we did this in 302, too.

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.596
I know we did.

00:58:21.596 --> 00:58:22.096
OK.

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.030
OK, so this is all
linear elastic, right?

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.860
So at some point-- so I'm going
to get to the plastic hinge.

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.300
At some point, If
you keep loading it

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.070
and p gets bigger and
bigger, the moment

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:44.530
gets bigger and bigger, the
stress gets bigger and bigger

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:47.480
remember, the equation
here for the stress

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:50.580
is equal to My over i.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.650
This moment, the
maximum moment's

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:55.380
going to be this moment here.

00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.760
The maximum y is going to
be h over 2, the distance

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.140
from the neutral axis.

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:03.020
And i is going to
be bh cubed over 12

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:06.060
for the rectangular section.

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:08.020
So if I keep loading
it up, at some point,

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:11.013
the maximum stress is going
to equal the yield stress.

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:21.080
right?

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.840
And in our cellular
things, is going

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.930
to equal the yield
stress of the solid.

00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:30.080
So our beam is one of
our edges in the foam,

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.400
or struts in the honeycomb.

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.710
So at some point, is
going to equal the yield

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:39.290
strength of the solid.

00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:42.150
So let me draw the stress
distribution again,

00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:43.610
where we start to
have plasticity.

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:50.319
So here, the stress is
equal the yield stress.

00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:52.610
And it's going to equal the
yield stress at the bottom,

00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:54.849
too, because it's
all symmetric, right?

00:59:54.849 --> 00:59:57.390
And the neutral axis is still
going to be in the middle here.

00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:59.650
So it's going to 0 down there.

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:03.780
So initially, when it's just
barely reached the yield stress

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:08.140
at the outer part of the beam,
then this stress distribution

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:10.490
would still be
linear in between.

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:15.120
But once you start to
load it more than that,

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.660
then the plastic region
starts to seep in

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.690
from the outside inwards.

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:26.410
And what we do here is we
assume that the solid is

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:28.160
elastic perfectly plastic.

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:36.560
And if you remember, when we
said things were perfectly

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.607
plastic, or if they were
elastic perfectly plastic,

01:00:40.607 --> 01:00:41.440
they look like that.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.090
The stress strain curve for
the solid, I'm assuming,

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:46.235
looks like that.

01:00:46.235 --> 01:00:48.110
So I'm assuming the
yield stress in the solid

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:49.470
is just a constant.

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:52.630
That if I strain it more,
there's no work hardening.

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:53.914
I'm neglecting work hardening.

01:00:53.914 --> 01:00:55.413
AUDIENCE: You said
inward that the--

01:00:58.042 --> 01:00:59.000
LORNA GIBSON: In board?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.996
AUDIENCE: Inward, you
said something like--

01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:03.870
LORNA GIBSON: Inward.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:06.960
So this is-- let's see.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.050
I didn't bring a
bean with me today.

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:09.750
No beam.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.000
Do we have anything beam-like?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.470
Ah, here we have
a beam-like thing.

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:13.330
OK.

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:17.720
So say this is my beam, and
I'm loading it this way on, OK?

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.760
And this is b, and that's h.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:26.490
So this picture here is
looking at it that way on, OK?

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:30.250
And this picture
here, I've drawn h,

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:34.950
but now I'm just looking at the
stress distribution across h.

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:38.190
And b is into the board.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:39.130
Is that OK?

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.400
Does that answer your question?

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.740
AUDIENCE: No, I mean
for the plastic.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.810
LORNA GIBSON: For this part?

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:47.470
OK.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:48.270
I'm working up.

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:50.600
I haven't finished it yet.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.470
So this is the same
kind of view as here.

01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:53.554
I drew it a little bigger.

01:01:53.554 --> 01:01:55.178
It shouldn't have
draw bigger, I should

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.510
have drawn it the same height.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:57.620
But it's the same thing.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:58.120
OK?

01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:02.550
So you'll buy that
at some point,

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:04.640
we reach the yield
strength here.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.160
And if I keep
loading it up and I

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.760
assume that the solid
is perfectly plastic,

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:15.580
that there's no work hardening,
then the stress distribution

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:16.940
would look like this.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.150
OK?

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:23.230
And then if it yields more, then
it's going to look like that.

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:26.580
And if it yields more,
eventually I'm going to get

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.940
to the stage here, where
it's-- let me redraw this.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:34.950
That would be-- you
get the idea, OK?

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:37.400
This will go over here, and
down here, and like that.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.751
OK?

01:02:38.751 --> 01:02:39.250
OK.

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.690
So are we happy with
this stress distribution

01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:47.100
across the cross-section?

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.840
Yeah, OK.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.170
So that's when it forms
the plastic hinge.

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:57.170
So when it forms
a plastic hinge,

01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:59.790
the stress distribution
looks like this.

01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:06.220
So these are supposed
to be the same size.

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:07.170
They're not quite.

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:17.390
Let's see.

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:20.560
So one of the things
I talked about

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.230
was the plastic moment
that kind of characterized

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:25.580
that plastic hinge.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.680
And the plastic moment is just
the internal amount of moment

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.580
that the beam can withstand
when it's yielded completely

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:33.970
across the whole cross-section.

01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:36.040
So when we're at
this point here.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.080
So you calculate that
by saying, that stress

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.650
there is equivalent to a force.

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:45.350
That stress there is
equivalent to a force.

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:49.230
And you get the moment by
multiplying those forces

01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:51.020
times that distance there.

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:51.660
OK?

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.993
Because you think of those
two forces as being a couple,

01:03:53.993 --> 01:03:58.810
and the moments the force times
the distance between them.

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:03.120
So the plastic
moment was sigma ys.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:10.800
And say we're talking about our
honeycomb or foam or something.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.990
That was our cell
wall thickness t.

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:15.320
So let me call it t
instead of h for the foams

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.290
and the honeycombs.

01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:23.870
So this force here is going
to be the stress time the area

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:25.980
over which it acts.

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.960
And let's say we look
at it for a honeycomb.

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:37.710
Then I've got the stress is
acting over this distance

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:41.400
here, and then times the
depth into the page, right?

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.360
And if it's the honeycomb,
that depth into the page

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.140
is just b, OK?

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:51.170
And then this moment arm
here is just t over 2

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:53.540
as well, because that's t
over 4, and that's t over 4.

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:57.030
So it's t over 2 again.

01:04:57.030 --> 01:05:06.290
So it's sigma ys bt squared
over 4 for the honeycomb.

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:08.015
And say we have
an open cell foam.

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:17.180
The edges aren't of thickness
b, they're of thickness t.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:24.660
So then it's m p is just
sigma ys t cubed over 4.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.950
Are we happy?

01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:32.770
And really, physically
what that is is it

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:36.339
means that the beam can't
hold any more force.

01:05:36.339 --> 01:05:37.880
You can't apply any
more force to it.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.840
It's just going to rotate
like this once you've

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.730
gotten to that plastic moment.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.050
That's why it's called
a hinge, because it just

01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:48.480
can rotate like hinge rotates.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.020
Like a door hinge, OK?

01:05:52.906 --> 01:05:54.830
AUDIENCE: How does it rotate?

01:05:54.830 --> 01:06:00.220
LORNA GIBSON: Well, where's
my original picture.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:04.170
So if this was the beam, when
you form the plastic hinge,

01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:05.670
your beam would
just look like that.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:09.610
And this would be
your hinge point.

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:11.630
I'm a civil engineer originally.

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:15.280
We try to avoid this.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.680
So that's why, in the foam
and in the honeycomb, that's

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.220
when it fails is when you get
that plastic hinge forming.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.080
OK?

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:24.580
All right.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.571
We have a few more minutes.

01:06:26.571 --> 01:06:28.910
AUDIENCE: That kind of
looks like plastic buckling.

01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:33.570
LORNA GIBSON: Well yeah, it's
not buckling, but it's plastic,

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:34.460
yeah.

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.085
It's permanent.

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:38.205
Anyone else?

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.109
OK.

01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.900
No other questions?

01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:51.300
Should we call it a day?

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.030
Is that helpful?

01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:55.910
All right, then.

01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:56.790
It's what I do.

01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:57.350
Come on.

01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:58.432
It's what I do.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:02.680
All right.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.350
So I'll see you Wednesday.

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:09.570
And my plan is to grade the
tests before spring break,

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:12.180
so I shall have it back to you.
