00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.130
LORNA GIBSON: All right.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.670
I should probably start.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.850
Last time, we were talking
about the honeycombs

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.700
and doing some modeling
of the mechanical behavior

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.440
and we started off talking
about the in plane behavior.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590
We're talking about loading
it in this direction

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.460
or that direction there.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.810
And we talked about
the elastic modulus.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.350
I think I derived
a Young's modulus

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.630
for the one direction, a
Poisson's ratio for loading

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.870
in the one direction.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.740
And then we started talking
about the stress plateau

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.450
and we went over the
elastic buckling stress,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.030
for one of these elastomeric
honeycombs like this.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.330
And we went through the plastic
collapse stress, for, say,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.582
a metal honeycomb
that would yield.

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:06.040
And I think I started talking
about a brittle honeycomb and

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.610
brittle crushing.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.410
The idea with a
brittle honeycomb--

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.320
like a ceramic honeycomb-- is it
could fail in a brittle manner.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.870
And the failure is going to
be controlled by the cell wall

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.650
in bending.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.980
And when that bending stress
reaches the modulus of rupture,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.120
or the bending strength
of the material,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.720
then you get wall fracture.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.860
I think that's where we
left it last time, right?

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.430
I had written down something
about cell wall fracture.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.350
Now, I wanted to do
the little derivation.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.120
Here's our little
schematic up here.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.990
Here's the honeycomb.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.480
You've loaded it with sigma
1 here to such an extent

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.230
that one of these cell walls has
reached the modulus of rupture

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.200
and has broken.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.460
And this is the little free
body diagram that corresponds.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.330
I'm going to go through
sigma 1 for loading

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.220
in the one direction.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.760
This is the same thing for
loading in the two direction.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.840
And the result for
that's in the book.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.340
OK.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.410
If I have loading in
the one direction,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.270
I can relate that
horizontal force p

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.098
to the stress in
the one direction.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.370
The little p is equal to sigma 1
times h plus sin theta times b.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.310
And remember, b's the
depth into the page.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.360
And I'm going to define sigma
fs as the modulus of rupture

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.430
of the cell wall material.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.920
It's the bending strength
of the cell wall material.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.200
And we're going to say that we
get fracture of that bent wall

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.430
when the applied moment is
equal to the fracture moment.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.910
From the plastic collapse
stress from last time,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.210
we had the applied moment
was equal to p times l

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.200
sin theta over 2.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.780
That was just using
static equilibrium,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.040
looking at that free
body diagram of the beam.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.900
And if I write p, in
terms of sigma 1 up here,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.740
I can just write that like
this sigma 1 times h plus l

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.260
sin theta times b.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.020
And then I've got this
other term of l sin theta

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.250
and we divide that
whole thing by 2.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.270
That's the applied moment.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.270
And we're going to
get fracture when

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.480
we reach the fracture moment.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.780
I'm going to call that mf--
the moment at fracture.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.690
Last time, we figured
out a plastic moment

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.470
to form a plastic hinge.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.630
And this is an analogous thing.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.290
But in this case,
remember, if we have a beam

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.170
and we have the stress profile
through the cross section

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.860
of the beam, it's going to
look something like that.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.590
So for our beam, that's going
to be the thickness of the beam

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.440
there.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.190
So if it's linear elastic,
we get the maximum stress

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.320
at the top and the bottom.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.780
And the neutral axis
is here in the middle.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.110
There's no stress there.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.740
This is the normal
stress distribution here.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.920
And as we increase the stress
for a brittle material that's

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.467
going to be linear
elastic till fracture,

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:15.050
this is going to
stay linear like this

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.969
until we reach this modulus
of rupture stress here.

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.510
When we reach that
stress, then we're

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.960
going to get
fracture of the beam.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.890
And we can say that there's some
moment associated with that.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.300
I could say that this
stress block here

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.800
is equivalent to some
concentrated force

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.900
and this stress block
down here is also

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.320
equivalent to the-- it's
going to the same magnitude,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.260
but the opposite
direction force.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.380
And I can get the
fracture moment

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.980
by figuring out how
big those forces are

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.400
and multiplying by this moment
arm between the two forces.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.500
OK?

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.750
The magnitude of
those forces is just

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.840
going to be the volume,
essentially, of this stress

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.920
block here.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.450
Imagine there's stresses there.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.330
It's a triangle,
so the area of it's

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.650
going to be a half times t
over 2 times of sigma fs.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.090
And it's going to
go b into the page.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.591
So if you think of the force--
if this was the stress--

00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:20.340
if that stress was
constant, it would just

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.040
be sigma fs times b times t.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.120
But it's not constant.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.510
It's a linear relationship.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.400
So I'm taking the
area of that triangle.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.380
That's the force.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.880
And then I want to multiply
that times the moment arm.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.130
And the moment arm between
those two forces-- each

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.140
of these forces acts through
the centroid of the area.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.760
The centroid of the area is not
in the middle for a triangle,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.470
and that total distance is
2/3 of the thickness, t.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.204
OK?

00:05:54.204 --> 00:05:55.620
That's the moment
arm that you get

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.510
by figuring out where the
centroid of these areas are.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:08.210
I multiply that times 2/3
t and one of the 2's is

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.820
going to cancel.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:17.630
I can rewrite that and sigma fs
times b times t squared over 6.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.885
OK?

00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:20.260
I think, last time
when we talked

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.090
about the plastic moment,
we did a similar calculation

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.580
and it worked out to
sigma y bt squared over 4.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.730
So now this is sigma fs,
the modulus of rupture,

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.994
times bt squred over 6.

00:06:31.994 --> 00:06:33.910
The 6 is just slightly
different because we've

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.890
got a triangle here instead
of a square shape like we

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.620
had before.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.940
And now I can get the
brittle crushing strength

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.680
and compression by just
equating that applied moment

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.980
to this fracture moment.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.030
And if you do that,
the result you get

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.520
is this plateau stress
for brittle crushing

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.230
and compression.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.240
In the one direction,
it's sigma fs--

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.040
the modulus of rupture of
the cell wall-- times t

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.680
over l squared.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.595
And then divided by
a geometrical factor.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.640
And her regular
hexagons, it works out

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.303
to 4/9 of the modulus of
rupture times t over l squared.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.210
OK?

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:01.816
Are we good?

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.990
We've got the in plane
compressive properties now.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.310
We've got the elastic
moduli and we've

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.130
got the three plateau stresses
that correspond to the three

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.290
mechanisms-- to the elastic
buckling failure mechanism,

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.580
the plastic yielding mechanism,
and then the fracture mechanism

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.770
for brittle crushing.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.030
OK?

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.130
If you think of the
stress-strain curve

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.620
of these materials
in compression,

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.380
the stress strain curves all
look something like that.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.030
And now we've
figured out equations

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.931
that give us the modulus here
and our collapse stress there.

00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:45.430
OK?

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.212
So we can describe that
stress-strain curve.

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:50.180
All right.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.710
That's compression.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.987
And the next thing I wanted
to talk about is tension.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.580
And if we think about
the tensile behavior,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.190
the elastic moduli are
going to be just the same.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.530
So the moduli are the same
in tension and compression.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.520
And then, if we think
about the stress plateau,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.720
we don't really have
a stress plateau

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.740
for an elastomeric
material because there's

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.750
no elastic buckling.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.130
If you pull it in
tension, you're

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.671
not going to get
buckling in tension.

00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:18.790
You only get buckling
if it's in compression.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.510
If you have a material
that yields like a metal,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.400
you can get a plastic collapse
stress and a plastic plateau.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.210
And that's very similar in
tension and compression.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.230
There's a very small
geometrical difference,

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.272
but you can,
essentially, ignore it.

00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:34.230
If you're loading the
material in compression--

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.931
and imagine this was a metal--
if you load it in compression,

00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:39.180
the cell walls are getting
a little further apart when

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.856
I compress it.

00:09:39.856 --> 00:09:41.230
And if you're
loading in tension,

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.250
like this, the cell walls
are getting a little closer

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.800
together.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.900
So there's a small
geometrical difference.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.460
But if we ignore
that, we can say

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.580
that the plateau stress
for plastic behavior

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.750
is about the same in
tension and compression.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.040
And so really, the only
property that's left

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.290
is to look at a
brittle honeycomb.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.240
And for a brittle honeycomb,
you can have fast fracture

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.720
and we can calculate
a fracture toughness.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.920
So this next slide describes the
fracture toughness calculation

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.380
that we're going to do.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.840
Here's our honeycomb.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.010
I'm going to load it in
the sigma 1 direction here.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.620
I've turned the
honeycomb 90 degrees,

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.140
so this is still sigma 1.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.620
And imagine now that
we've got a crack here.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.350
And I'm going to
consider a situation

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.060
where the crack is very large,
relative to the cell size.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.210
So it's not a crack
in the cell walls.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.176
It's a crack that goes
through multiple cells.

00:10:29.176 --> 00:10:30.800
I'm going to assume
the crack is large,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.660
relative to the cell size.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.470
I'm going to assume that the
bending is the main deformation

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.170
mode.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.750
And what I'm going to do is
look at-- if I have my crack tip

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.310
here, I'm going to
look at this cell wall

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.550
a just ahead of the crack tip.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.489
And I'm going to say,
that cell wall is bent.

00:10:48.489 --> 00:10:50.030
And I'm going to
figure out something

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.120
about the stress
in that cell wall

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.864
and look at when that fails.

00:10:54.864 --> 00:10:56.780
And I'm going to assume
that the cell wall has

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.430
a constant modulus of rupture.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.764
So the cell wall has
a constant strength.

00:11:00.764 --> 00:11:02.430
You can imagine the
cell wall could have

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.290
little tiny cracks in it, too.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.430
And if a cell wall
has a bigger crack,

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.580
it's going to fail
at a lower stress.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.550
But let's imagine that the cell
walls are all the same strength

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.640
and they all have a
constant modulus of rupture.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.335
Let me write some of this down.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.386
In tension, the elastic
moduli are going to the same

00:11:24.386 --> 00:11:25.135
as in compression.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.048
There's no elastic
buckling in tension,

00:11:42.048 --> 00:11:43.297
so that's not going to happen.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:53.396
The plastic plateau
stress in tension

00:11:53.396 --> 00:11:55.520
is going to be very similar
to that in compression.

00:12:16.864 --> 00:12:19.155
As I mentioned, there's a
small geometrical difference,

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.590
but we're going to ignore that.

00:12:37.368 --> 00:12:39.300
And then, if we had
a brittle honeycomb,

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.560
like one of those ceramic
honeycombs I showed you,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.955
then we can have fast fracture.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.600
What we want to calculate
is the fracture toughness.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.690
And I'm going to make
a few assumptions here.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.390
I'm going to assume that
the crack length is large

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.485
compared to the cell size.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.647
And if I do that,
I can say that I'm

00:13:26.647 --> 00:13:28.230
going to use the
continuum assumption.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:33.720
Hello.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.950
We'll come back to that.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:43.014
I'm going to say that axial
forces can be neglected.

00:13:43.014 --> 00:13:44.805
We're just going to
look at bending forces.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.360
And I'm also going to assume
that the modulus of rupture

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.100
is constant for the cell wall.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.760
First, let's just think
again about the continuum.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:28.140
Imagine we just had a solid and
we have a plate of the solid

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.530
and it's loaded in tension
with some remote stress--

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.840
some far away stress-- sigma 1.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.310
And the plate has a crack
of length 2c perpendicular

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.410
to that normal stress.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:47.360
And we're going to look at
the stress-- local stress

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:53.480
at the crack tip-- some distance
r ahead of the crack tip there.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.170
In fracture mechanics,
it's been worked out what

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.210
that local stress field is.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.250
And it depends on
the crack length,

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.930
and then how far ahead
of the crack tip you are.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:10.730
So you can say that if you've
got a crack length of 2c

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:23.990
in a linear elastic
solid, and the crack is

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:32.530
normal to a remote
tensile stress-- which

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:38.020
I'm going to call sigma
1-- then that crack

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:43.590
is going to create a local
stress field at the crack tip.

00:15:56.396 --> 00:15:58.770
And we're going to use this
equation for the local stress

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.590
field.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:03.370
The local stress field is
equal to the far away field

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.510
divided by-- or multiplied
by the square root of pi c

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.710
and divided by the
square root of 2 pi r.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.350
So there's a stress
singularity at the crack tip.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.280
And then the local stress
decays as you move away

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.376
from the crack tip.

00:16:27.982 --> 00:16:29.740
AUDIENCE: And what is r?

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.020
LORNA GIBSON: r is the
distance from the crack tip.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.205
So if that's the tip
of my crack there,

00:16:34.205 --> 00:16:36.480
then r is my distance out.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.970
OK.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.740
In the honeycomb wall, if
we look at the crack here,

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.579
and then we look
at that cell wall a

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:09.410
that's just ahead of the crack
tip, that cell wall is bent.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.880
So in the honeycomb, we're going
to be looking at the bent cell

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.380
wall.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.800
And that wall is going to fail
when the applied moment equals

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.086
the fracture moment.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.940
If we look at wall
a, we could say

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:11.490
that the applied moment is
going to be proportional to p

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.390
times l.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.520
Getting ahead of myself there.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.150
I'm going to do
this-- because it's

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.100
hard to say exactly where the
crack tip is because there's

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:21.862
a void there.

00:18:21.862 --> 00:18:23.570
I'm going to use that
argument here where

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.430
I make everything proportional.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.040
The moment's going to be
proportional to p times l

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.600
on wall a.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.880
And the fracture stress is going
to be proportional to sigma fs

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.840
times bt squared.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.520
Last time, we said it was
sigma fs bt squared over 6.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.420
It's the same thing.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.800
I'm just dropping the 6 out.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.290
And then I can also say
that this applied moment,

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.600
if it goes as pl--
p is just going

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.500
to be my local stress times lb.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.604
And then I multiply times l.

00:18:56.604 --> 00:18:58.270
So if you think of
just thinking about--

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.610
if you got a load p
on this member here,

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.140
l, there's going to be
some local stress there.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.660
And p is just going to be that
local stress times the cell

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.700
wall length times the
width into the page.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.800
And then, that local
stress, sigma l,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.350
I can replace with that
equation over there.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:22.440
So that local stress is going
to go as sigma 1 times the root

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.750
of c over the root of r.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.620
And I'm going to say the
distance ahead of the crack tip

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.310
goes as l.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.274
Instead of having r,
I'm going to say it's l.

00:19:33.274 --> 00:19:34.940
It's not necessarily
exactly l, but it's

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:40.310
going to be some fraction of l.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.000
That's my local stress there.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.710
And then I've got an
l squared times b.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.970
And if I set that equal
to the fracture moment,

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:56.150
that's going to be proportional
to sigma fs bt squared.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.935
Are we good here?

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.150
You have to think
of the crack tip.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.050
And there's some local stress
field ahead of the crack tip.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.710
And we're saying
that the load p is

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:12.200
equal to that local stress times
a cell length times the depth

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.850
into the board.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.300
And then multiply it
times l to get the moment.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.160
And then I replace
that local stress

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.010
with this standard equation for
the remote stress and the crack

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.890
length and the distance
ahead of the crank tip.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.470
So here, the b's are
going to cancel out.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.980
And now I can solve for a
fracture stress in the one

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.090
direction.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.700
And that's going
to-- well, let me

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.700
get proportional-- that's going
to be proportional to sigma fs.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.820
Then there's going to
be a t over l squared.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.496
And then, this is going to
go as the square root of l

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:49.420
over c like that.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.980
And now, if I want to
get a fracture toughness,

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.330
the fracture toughness
is just the strength

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.220
times the square root of pi
times the half crack length c.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:05.690
So here, my fracture toughness
is just that strength

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.100
times the root of pi c.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:15.710
So I can say that's equal to a
constant times sigma fs times t

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.720
over l squared.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.165
And now, times the
square root of l.

00:21:20.165 --> 00:21:22.080
These root of c's
have canceled out.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.505
So that's my equation for
the fracture toughness.

00:21:31.505 --> 00:21:32.880
And one of the
interesting things

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.338
here is that the
fracture toughness

00:21:34.338 --> 00:21:35.930
depends on the cell size.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.280
This is the first
property that we've

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.920
derived an equation for where
it depends on the cell size.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.317
OK.

00:21:55.317 --> 00:21:57.067
And here, c's just
going to be a constant.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.770
All right.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.280
Now we've got a set of
equations that describe

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.560
the in plane properties.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.020
We've got equations
that describe

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.480
the linear elastic
moduli in the plane.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.440
We've got three equations that
describe the compressive stress

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.870
for elastic buckling failure,
for plastic yielding failure,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.780
and for a brittle
crushing failure.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.040
And we've got an equation
for the fracture toughness,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.650
as well.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.250
OK?

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.210
We've got a description
of the in plane behavior

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.460
of these hexagonal honeycombs.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.420
The next thing I wanted to
do was talk a little bit

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.520
about in plane behavior, but
for a different cell shape--

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.930
for triangular honeycombs.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.450
Because they deform by
a different mechanism.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.650
And they can be used to
represent the lattice materials

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.980
that we looked at earlier, too.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.120
If we have a
triangular honeycomb

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.380
with triangular cells,
triangulated cells

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.370
behave like a truss.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.490
And you can analyze trusses by
just saying that the joints are

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:09.640
pin jointed.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.010
There's no moments at
the end of the joints

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.270
or end of the members.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.527
And the forces are
all axial and so

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:17.110
the behavior's a
little bit different.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.180
I wanted to show you how these
triangular honeycombs work,

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.210
too.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.500
I can scoot this up.

00:23:49.771 --> 00:23:51.520
Imagine that you've
got a honeycomb that's

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.870
an array of triangular
cells like this.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:24:01.560
And say we're applying some bulk
stress sigma to it, like that.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.665
And say it's got a
depth b into the page.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.660
When we have a triangulated
structure like this,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.400
it behaves like a truss.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.080
And we can analyze it as
being a pin-jointed structure.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.446
There's no moments at the joint.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.160
And if it's
pin-jointed and there's

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.750
no moments at the
nodes, then we just

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:56.794
get axial forces
along the members.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.710
And even if the
nodes were fixed--

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.370
as they are in these
ceramic honeycombs--

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.310
you can show that if
it's triangulated,

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.060
even if you accounted
for any bending,

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.237
it really is a very tiny
contribution to the deformation

00:25:11.237 --> 00:25:11.820
in the forces.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.130
It's less than a
couple of percent.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:25.470
I'll say even if
the ends are fixed--

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:37.255
I'll just say the bending
contributes less than 2%

00:25:37.255 --> 00:25:38.630
to the forces in
the deformation.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.100
If I have a triangular
cell like that,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.630
and say I pick a
unit cell like this,

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:52.580
and I say that the
bulk stress produces

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.630
a load of p on the
top and p over 2

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.760
at each of the
bottom nodes there,

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.550
then the force in each member is
going to be proportional to p.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.091
And for a given
geometry of triangle,

00:26:17.091 --> 00:26:19.590
you can figure out exactly what
the force distribution would

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.677
be in each of the members.

00:26:20.677 --> 00:26:23.010
But I'm going to use one of
these proportional arguments

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.239
again, just to get
a general result.

00:26:25.239 --> 00:26:27.530
Because I don't really care
that much about the details

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.196
of the geometry.

00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:56.570
OK.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.370
If I have a little
set up like this,

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.900
I can say that
the overall stress

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:08.632
is going to be
proportional to p over lb.

00:27:08.632 --> 00:27:11.500
And the stress in
each member is going

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.580
to be proportional to p
over l times the thickness--

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.950
or b times the thickness.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.846
This is the overall stress.

00:27:17.846 --> 00:27:19.220
The overall strain
is going to be

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.960
proportional to some deflection
of the triangle divided

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.920
by the length.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:31.930
So if I said, say, this
length here was a length l.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.270
And then the deflection
of each member

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:37.750
is going to be
proportional to p times l

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.820
over es times the cross
sectional area of the member,

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.930
and that's just b times t.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:45.812
OK?

00:27:45.812 --> 00:27:47.520
So this is the stress
on the whole thing,

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.600
the strain on the whole
thing, and relating

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.390
the delta to the p.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.630
And then, the modulus
of the whole honeycomb

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.450
is going to go as the
stress over the strain.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:02.816
So that's p over lb
divided by delta over l.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.220
These l's here cancel.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:15.320
And delta here is pl
over es bt, and so

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.336
the b's cancel and
the p's cancel.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.070
And the modulus I get
for the honeycomb is just

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:28.150
some constant related to the
cell geometry times the modulus

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.260
of the solid times t over l.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.330
And if you did an
exact calculation

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:50.910
for equilateral triangles, you'd
find that that constant's 1.15.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.400
The interesting
thing to note here

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.480
is that the modulus for
these triangular honeycombs

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.460
goes as t over l, not
as t over l cubed.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.410
For the hexagonal honeycomb,
it went as t over l cubed.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:04.110
And here, because
the deformations

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.905
are axial-- not bending--
it's much stiffer.

00:29:06.905 --> 00:29:08.280
And it's much
stiffer to have one

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.460
of these triangulated
structures.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:21.270
I'll just say, here,
that the modulus goes

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.170
as t over l cubed
for the hexagonal

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:33.230
honeycombs due to the bending.

00:29:41.567 --> 00:29:44.150
One of the reasons that people
are interested in those lattice

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.200
materials is that
they, too, have

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.000
moduli that go as t over l.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.860
That basically go with
the relative density,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.930
rather than with the
relative density cubed.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:59.000
So they're much stiffer than,
say, a hexagonal honeycomb.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.440
OK?

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.440
Are we good with the
triangulated honeycombs?

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.292
Yes?

00:30:05.292 --> 00:30:06.472
AUDIENCE: What is c?

00:30:06.472 --> 00:30:08.680
LORNA GIBSON: c's just a
constant related to the cell

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.179
geometry.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:26.850
For equilateral
triangles, it's 1.15.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.500
You could work it
out, but it just

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.930
makes the whole thing a little
more complicated to do that.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.430
OK.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.140
That's the in-plane behavior.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.140
And next, I wanted to talk
about the out-of-plane behavior.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.180
Remember, we said the hexagonal
honeycombs are orthotropic

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.430
and the orthotropic materials
have nine elastic constants.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.390
And we've figured
out four so far.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.620
We've figured out the four
in-plane elastic constants.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.740
There's five out-of-plane
elastic constants

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.690
to describe the elastic
behavior completely.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.890
And so we want to talk about
these other elastic constants.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.630
The honeycombs are
also-- I should just

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:03.760
back up a little bit.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.991
The honeycombs are used
in sandwich panels.

00:31:05.991 --> 00:31:07.740
And when they're used
in sandwich panels--

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.260
I brought a little panel
in with carbon fiber faces

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.040
and a nomex core.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.730
If you bend that
panel like that,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.470
you're going to get shear
stresses in the core.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.220
And the shear stresses
are going to be

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.600
going this way and this way
on, and that way, that way on.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.160
And so those shear
stresses are out-of-plane.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.580
They're in the x1,
x3, or x2, x3 planes.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.810
And so you need the
out-of-plane properties

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:36.800
for the shear properties
in the sandwich panels.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.380
Honeycombs are
also sometimes used

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.070
as energy absorption devices.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.734
Not these rubber ones, but
imagine there was a metal one.

00:31:43.734 --> 00:31:45.900
And when they're used for
energy absorption devices,

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.720
they're typically
loaded this way on.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.804
Again, that's the
out-of-plane direction

00:31:49.804 --> 00:31:51.512
and you need the
out-of-plane properties.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.980
And for the
out-of-plane properties,

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.600
the cell walls
don't tend to bend.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.450
Instead, they just
extend or contract.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.362
And you get stiffer and
stronger properties.

00:32:04.362 --> 00:32:06.320
Let me just write something
down and then we'll

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.028
start to derive some
of those properties.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:30.950
The cell walls contract or
expand instead of bending,

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.290
and that gives stiffer
and stronger properties.

00:33:55.084 --> 00:33:55.583
OK.

00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:43.810
OK.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:48.740
There's five elastic constants
in the out-of-plane directions.

00:35:00.419 --> 00:35:01.960
We'll start with
the Young's modulus.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.680
And if I take my
honeycomb and I load it

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.270
in the x3 direction-- just
taking this thing here and just

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:21.290
loading it like that-- the cell
walls just axially contract

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:24.360
and the stiffness just depends
on how much cell wall I've got.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.510
So the modulus in
the three direction

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.500
is just equal to
the area fraction

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.177
times the modulus of the solid.

00:35:30.177 --> 00:35:32.010
That's just the same
as the volume fraction,

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.050
or the relative density.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:37.340
So it's quite straightforward.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:40.728
The cell walls contract
or extend axially.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:21.650
e3 is just es times
the relative density.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.920
And that's just
es times t over l.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.710
And then there's a
geometrical factor here.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:33.410
h over l plus 2 over 2.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:38.950
h over la plus sin
theta times cos theta.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.920
Again, a little bit like
those triangular honeycombs.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.450
The thing to notice here is
that in the three direction,

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.070
the modulus goes
linearly with t over l,

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.954
whereas in the
in-plane directions,

00:36:57.954 --> 00:36:59.120
it goes with t over l cubed.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.130
So there's a huge
anisotropy in the honeycombs

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.540
because of this difference.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.790
Imagine a honeycomb
might be 10% dense.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:10.360
t over l might be something
like a tenth-- 0.1.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.515
So e star 3 is
going to 0.1 of es,

00:37:13.515 --> 00:37:16.080
roughly, and in the
other direction,

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.410
it's going to be 1/1000th.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.614
So there's a huge
anisotropy because of this.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.413
Let me just-- square honeycombs.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.180
This just shows looking at
the out-of-plane directions

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.385
and the different
stresses and properties

00:37:57.385 --> 00:37:59.799
that we're going
to look at here.

00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:02.090
The next one we're going to
look at is Poisson's ratio.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:14.010
And first, we're going to look
at loading in the x3 direction.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.770
And if we load it
in the x3 direction,

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:19.760
the cell wall's just strain by
whatever the Poisson's ratio

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.490
is for the solid times the
strain in the three direction

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:24.480
in the other two directions.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:39.050
We'll say for loading in the
x3 direction, the cell wall's

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:43.710
strain by nu of the
solid times whatever

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:46.777
the strain is in the three
direction in the other two

00:38:46.777 --> 00:38:47.276
directions.

00:38:54.359 --> 00:38:56.400
If we load it in the x3
directions and everything

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.080
contracts by that much in the
other two directions, that just

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:06.160
means that the Poisson's
ratios-- nu 3 1 and nu 3 2

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.555
are going to be the same.

00:39:07.555 --> 00:39:09.680
And they're just going to
be equal to the Poisson's

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.420
ratio of the solid.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.515
So if each wall is going
to contract by that amount,

00:39:14.515 --> 00:39:16.640
the whole thing's going to
contract by that amount.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.850
And that's going to give
you that Poisson's ratio.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.900
Let me just say, here,
also-- and remember

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:32.680
that I'm defining nu ij as
minus epsilon j over epsilon i.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.450
We're loading in the
three direction here.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:39.890
And then you can get the
other two Poisson's ratios

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.530
using those reciprocal
relationships.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:49.240
So nu 1 3 and nu
2 3 can be found

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.600
from the reciprocal relations.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.130
And remember,
those relationships

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.750
come from saying
that the compliance

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.091
tensor, or the stiffness
tensor, is symmetric.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:18.370
We can write, for instance,
that nu 1 3 over e1

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:22.536
is equal to nu 3 1 over e3.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:28.230
So I can write that like that.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:33.250
And then I can say nu 1
3-- that is going to equal

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:42.050
to nu 3 1 times e1 over e3.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:45.501
And we just saw that nu
3 1 was equal to nu s.

00:40:45.501 --> 00:40:50.140
And we see, from before, the
e1 is equal to some constant.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:56.270
Let me just call it c1 times
es times t over l cubed.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:01.040
And e3 is going to be some
other constant times es

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.060
time t over l.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.310
The es's are going to go.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.970
And if t over l is
small-- even if it's say,

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.740
a 10th-- and this is
going as t over l cubed

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.000
and that's going
as t over l, then

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.640
I can say this thing
is about equal to 0.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.599
It's going to be small.

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:18.140
It's not to be
exactly [INAUDIBLE] 0,

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.560
but it's going to be small
so we're going to say it's 0.

00:41:23.512 --> 00:41:29.810
So I'll just say
for small t over l.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:33.870
And then, similarly, nu 2 3
is going to be close to 0,

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:34.370
as well.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.176
So there's the Poisson's ratios.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:22.182
We've got the Young's
modulus, the Poisson's ratios,

00:42:22.182 --> 00:42:23.890
and next we want to
get the Shear moduli.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.790
And the shear moduli is
little more complicated.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:32.780
The cell walls are
loaded in shear

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.470
but the neighboring cell
walls constrain them

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.281
and they produce some
non-uniform strain.

00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:39.030
I'm talking about
shearing it this way on.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.430
You can see on this
figure here, we're

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:48.330
talking about shearing it, like
tau 2 3 or tau 1 3, this way.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.210
And so each wall
is going to shear,

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.980
but the walls are
attached to each other

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.210
so they can't just
do it independently.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:58.110
They have to be
constrained by each other.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:01.177
And the exact solution is
a little bit complicated.

00:43:01.177 --> 00:43:03.260
And I'm just going to give
you an estimate of what

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.890
that modulus is.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:08.330
And we're going to see that it
depends linearly on t over l,

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:09.834
as well.

00:43:09.834 --> 00:43:11.875
I'll just say the cell
walls are loaded in shear.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:12.020
An estimate is g star 1 3 is
equal to g of the solid times

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.130
t over l times a
geometric function.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:20.520
It's cos theta over h
over l plus sin theta.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.810
And for regular
hexagonal honeycombs,

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:27.932
it's 1 over root 3
times gs times t over l.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.870
Again, just note the
linear dependence

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.890
of the modulus on t over l.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:00.010
And in the book,
there's a method

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:01.800
using upper and
lower bounds that

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.954
gives an estimate for g 2 3.

00:45:04.954 --> 00:45:06.120
I'm not going to go into it.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.880
I just want you to
notice that the shear

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.097
moduli go as t over l, just
like the Young's modulus does.

00:45:11.097 --> 00:45:12.930
And Sardar, who's sitting
in the back there,

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:17.480
has done even more involved
calculations and analysis

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.420
of the shear moduli of the
honeycombs in this direction.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.081
So I'm not going to go into
all the gory details on that.

00:45:24.081 --> 00:45:24.580
OK.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.030
That gives us the moduli now.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.680
So now we've got all
nine elastic moduli.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.928
OK?

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:35.310
And the next thing
to do is, then,

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:36.970
to figure out the
compressive strength.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:38.400
So we're going to look
at compression again,

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.010
and then we'll look at tension.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:41.720
If we look at
compressive strengths,

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.910
again, we've got different
modes of failure.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.720
And if I have an elastomeric
honeycomb like this one

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.480
here-- if these cell walls
were a little longer,

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.040
I might be able
to actually do it.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.250
If you compress this
enough, you produce

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.130
buckling in the cell walls.

00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:00.580
And this is a schematic of
this buckling pattern here.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.580
And you can see there's
a diamond pattern where

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:07.300
it alternates up and down
in the different cell walls.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.780
We're going to do some
approximate calculations,

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.590
but you can see the idea
of how the material behaves

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:17.500
in this direction, just from
these approximate calculations.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:41.980
OK.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:47.660
Say we have our
honeycomb like this,

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.050
and here's the
prism axis this way.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.610
And now, we're
going to load it up

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.880
with some stress in
the three direction.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:01.060
I'm going to call this sigma
star elastic 3 when it buckles.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.850
And what we're going to do is
just look at a single plate.

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.410
And look at the
buckling of a plate.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.760
We're going to analyze it
just looking at a single plate

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.740
and then adding up how many
plates we have per unit cell.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.450
It's actually more
complicated than this

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.250
because, obviously, the
plates are attached together

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:28.540
and there's some constraint
by attaching the plates.

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.330
But we're not going
to worry about that.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.150
If you have a
column-- just a, say,

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:42.820
circular cross-section
column-- and you

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.100
apply a compressive load to it,
it buckles at the Euler load.

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.680
And similarly, there's
an Euler load for plates.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.070
And that equation
is usually written

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:54.910
as a p critical is equal to
some end constraint factor.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:58.290
For plates, it's usually
called k instead of n.

00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.835
So this is an end
constraint factor.

00:47:59.835 --> 00:48:02.545
It depends on the
modulus of the plate.

00:48:02.545 --> 00:48:05.190
It goes as t cubed.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:09.420
Then, there's a factor of 1
minus mu of the solid squared

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.960
and the length of the plate.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.060
Say this plate here--
actually the width

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:20.500
of the plate there is h
and the length here is b.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.730
And this thickness
here is t like that.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:27.560
Here, k is an end
constraint factor.

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.694
And it's going to depend on the
stiffness of the adjacent cell

00:48:38.694 --> 00:48:39.194
walls.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:49:01.350
If I had a honeycomb, and
say it was-- these walls

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.890
here-- the adjacent
walls-- were thicker,

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:06.470
then you can imagine those
thicker walls-- it'd be harder

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:07.800
to get them to deform.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.110
And the end constraint
for the plate

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:12.390
is going to depend on
those thicker walls.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:15.370
So that the end
constraint, k, depends

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:19.345
on these-- say I'm looking
at this wall here of width h

00:49:19.345 --> 00:49:21.560
here, then how stiff
these other two walls

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:26.860
are is going to affect
that end constraint factor.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.460
What we're going to do is just
do something very approximate.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.480
We're going to say if these
vertical edges here-- if this

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.700
edge here and that one there--
if they were simply supported--

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:39.760
if they're just pinned
to the next column,

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.770
the next member--
then k has some value.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:45.120
And if they're fixed,
it has some other value.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.030
And we're going to pick
a value in between.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:49.030
So we're going to do
something very approximate.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:27.520
I'll say if those
vertical edges are simply

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:41.770
supported-- that means
they're free to rotate-- then

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:44.820
k is equal to 2.0.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:51.040
And this is if b is bigger
than three times the length.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.140
So this is h here,
or we could say l.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.150
Either way.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:59.050
It's really the--
it's the length when

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:00.591
we look at the
honeycomb this way on,

00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:05.470
but it's the width in
that picture there.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:15.130
And if the vertical edges
are clamped, or fixed,

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:19.130
then k is equal to 6.2.

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:23.517
These are values you can look
up in tables of plate buckling.

00:51:23.517 --> 00:51:25.100
And we're just going
to approximate it

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.560
by saying k is equal to 4.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.850
We're just picking a value
that's in between those two.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:39.150
And then, the p
total is going to be

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:43.110
the sum of the p
criticals for the columns

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:44.660
that make up a unit cell.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:56.170
For the unit cell, I
have one wall of length h

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:57.645
and two of length l.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.510
And if you just
take that total load

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.080
and divide by the
area of the cell,

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.810
you get that this compressive
strength for elastic buckling

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:28.310
is approximately equal
to es over 1 minus nu

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:33.980
s squared times t over l cubed.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.055
And then there's a
geometrical factor here.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:04.060
And if you had regular
hexagonal cells,

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:08.730
this buckling stress works
out to 5.2 times es times

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:10.211
t over l cubed.

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.690
If you remember, for the
loading in the two direction--

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:21.250
in the in-plane direction--
it has the same form.

00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:25.210
And goes as es times t over l
cubed, but it's much smaller.

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:27.020
This number here
was, I think, 0.2.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.456
It was much smaller.

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:49.580
So it has the same form,
but it's a lot bigger.

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.090
OK?

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:52.590
Are we good with that?

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:55.080
The idea is we just use
the standard equations

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.010
for plate buckling.

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:58.510
We make some estimate of what
that end constraint factor is.

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:02.100
And we just have an
approximate calculation here.

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:27.224
OK.

00:54:27.224 --> 00:54:28.390
That's the elastic buckling.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.210
If I had a metal
honeycomb, then it

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:33.310
might not fail by elastic
buckling like that.

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:35.400
Instead, we'd
probably get yielding.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:37.260
If it was dense
enough, we could just

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:40.160
get axial yielding that--
if you just loaded it,

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.320
you'd have axial forces.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.740
And at some point, you'd
reach the yield stress.

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.460
And so you can get failure
by just uniaxial yield.

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.060
That's one option.

00:55:03.705 --> 00:55:05.080
And if you get
that, then it just

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.427
depends on how much
solid you've got again.

00:55:08.427 --> 00:55:10.510
So it's just the yield
strength of the solid times

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:12.130
the relative density.

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:15.590
But usually, the honeycomb
is thinner walled than that.

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:18.240
And usually, you get plastic
buckling proceeding that.

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:46.590
In plastic buckling,
you can think of it

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:49.120
as-- say if you have a
tube-- this is just shown

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.930
for an individual tube here.

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:53.470
You can see how
the tube folds up.

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.345
And you can get that same kind
of thing with the honeycomb.

00:55:56.345 --> 00:55:57.220
Here's a single tube.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.840
It's been loaded along the
prism axis of the tube.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.700
And you can see,
you get these folds,

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:05.610
and the more you load it, the
more number of folds you get.

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:09.070
And the more the
folds concertina up.

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:12.070
To do an exact analysis
for the honeycombs,

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:17.510
you would have to take into
account not just one tube,

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:20.040
but the constraint of the
neighboring tubes again.

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.630
And again, that gets to be
a complicated, messy thing.

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:25.030
So again, we're going to do
a more approximate thing.

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.770
What we're going to do is
just say that we have members

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:30.410
that are folding up like that.

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:32.457
So the same geometry.

00:56:32.457 --> 00:56:34.540
But we're just going to
look at a single cell wall

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.350
and see what the
single cell wall does.

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:39.340
And someone else has done
the more exact calculation.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.560
We'll just compare our
approximate calculation

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.171
to the exact one.

00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:44.670
OK.

00:56:48.924 --> 00:56:51.048
We're going to consider an
approximate calculation.

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.090
What we're going do is look
at our isolated cell wall.

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:26.720
And if you look at
the figure here,

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.207
the wall is going to
be vertical, initially.

00:57:29.207 --> 00:57:31.290
And as we load it, eventually
it's going to buckle

00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:33.414
and we're going to form
one of those plastic hinges

00:57:33.414 --> 00:57:34.470
in the middle here.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.060
And then, the
thing is then going

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:39.460
to rotate about that plastic
hinge and just fold up.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.230
So at the bottom here,
it's completely folded up.

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:43.010
OK?

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:45.330
And we're going to do a
little work calculations.

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:47.500
We're going to look at
the internal work done

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.709
and we're going to look
at the external work done.

00:57:49.709 --> 00:57:51.250
The external work
is just going to be

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:55.320
this load p times
that deflection delta

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.510
that the p moves through.

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:01.370
And if we say this is
half of a wavelength--

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:04.530
if you think of this thing going
through multiple wavelengths,

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:06.920
just consider when it
folds up like that,

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.400
that's a half of a wavelength.

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.550
It would go two of those
to get a full wavelength.

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:13.410
That's lambda over 2.

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:18.140
And so to go from this stage
to that stage over here,

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:21.220
the external work done is
going to be approximately p

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.960
times lambda over 2.

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.920
Say that it's thin and that 2t
is small compared to lambda.

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.890
So it's going to be about
p times lambda over 2.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.890
And then, we're also going
to look at the work done

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:34.380
by the plastic moment.

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.400
And when we form the
plastic hinge here,

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.140
there's a plastic moment.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.800
And that moment is going to
rotate through an angle of pi.

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.390
So we start out straight here,
we end up folded up like that,

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:46.960
and we've gone from
straight to that.

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.990
We had to go through 180
degrees to get there.

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:52.340
So it goes through
an angle of pi.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.730
And if you have a moment
going through a rotation,

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:56.900
the work done is the
moment times the rotation.

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:03.560
We're going to equate
those two works done.

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:13.050
We're going to look at the
rotation of the cell wall

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:15.410
by an angle of pi at
the plastic hinge.

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.270
Our plastic moment-- it's
going to be the yield

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:36.220
strength of the
solid again times t

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:38.340
squared over 4,
the same as when we

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:41.050
were talking about the
plastic moment before

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.610
for the other loading direction.

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:45.320
But now, instead of
multiplying this times b,

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.210
we're multiplying
it times 2l plus h.

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:50.750
That's the length
of the cell wall

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:52.930
that's associated with one cell.

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:54.780
And now, it's not
b because now we've

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:56.240
turned the thing
the other way on.

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.800
We're loading it
the other way on.

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.460
And this plastic
hinge-- if I think

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.260
of-- if this was b before.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:08.080
And now that b is l plus
2h-- or 2l plus h, rather.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.150
That's the dimension of the--
let me draw a little hexagon so

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.980
maybe you can see.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:23.860
OK.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:27.821
Now we're forming a plastic
hinge halfway down the board.

01:00:27.821 --> 01:00:30.070
Imagine that this has some
length b that way and we're

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:31.510
halfway down the board.

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:33.920
And now, the plastic hinge
has to form all the way

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.360
around these members
here for one cell.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.590
Or you could think about it
as this guy plus these guys

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:42.359
is one cell.

01:00:42.359 --> 01:00:44.400
You can think about the
unit cell different ways,

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.130
but it's one h plus two l's.

01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:48.790
OK?

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:49.675
Are we OK with that?

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.280
OK.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:05.780
Then the internal plastic
work is that plastic moment

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:09.870
times the rotation
pho-- or pi, rather.

01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:10.370
Sorry.

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:35.830
Are we OK with this?

01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:38.750
That the work done
is m times our angle?

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:43.120
Imagine-- let me get rid
of my honeycomb here.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.120
Imagine you have a
point here and you

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.610
have some force over here.

01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:48.110
Let's call that f.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.970
And say, the force is
at distance r from f.

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:54.890
And say that it moves
through some distance.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:59.920
The moment here
would be r times f.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.800
And if that rotates,
say, through some angle--

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.110
let's call it alpha--
and here is f here, then

01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:09.210
this distance here that
the force moves through

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:11.300
is just r times alpha.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:16.590
So the work done is going
to be r times alpha times f,

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:18.664
or just the moment times alpha.

01:02:18.664 --> 01:02:19.480
OK?

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.821
So that's all that we're doing.

01:02:22.821 --> 01:02:23.320
OK.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.380
That's the internal
plastic work.

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.622
And now we have to look
at the external work done.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:39.150
And that's equal to p
times lambda over 2.

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:43.500
Here, lambda is the half
wavelength of the buckling.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.190
I'm going to say for these
tubular kinds of things,

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:56.470
it's in the order of l.

01:02:56.470 --> 01:03:01.181
So if you look at that
last slide here-- oops.

01:03:01.181 --> 01:03:01.680
Rats.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.736
How'd that happen?

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.928
Let me scoot back down here.

01:03:11.481 --> 01:03:11.980
There.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.740
If we look at that guy
again, the magnitude

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:20.610
of the buckling wavelength
is on the order of l.

01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:24.360
And here, below p, can
be related to the stress

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.400
in the three direction.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.760
We'll just multiply it times
the area of the unit cell.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:38.790
And so if I equate the internal
work and the external work,

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:43.430
I can say p times
lambda over 2 is

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:45.507
equal to pi times
my plastic moment.

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.070
And then, for p, I can
write sigma 3 h plus l sin

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:57.040
theta times 2l cos theta.

01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:05.910
And then, lambda is l
divided by 2 is equal to pi.

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:08.078
And then I've got my
plastic moment over there.

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:22.470
And then if I solve for sigma 3,
that's my compressor strength.

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:41.560
I've got pi by 4, the strength
of the solid, sigma ys, times

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.290
t over l squared.

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:51.380
Then h over l plus 2 divided by
h over l plus sin theta times

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:51.950
cos theta.

01:04:56.470 --> 01:05:03.250
And for the regular
hexagons, this

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:14.950
works out to about 2 sigma
ys times to over l squared.

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:23.670
And the exact calculation
for regular honeycombs

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:30.340
is equal to 5.6 times
sigma ys times t over l

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.310
to the 5/3 power.

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:37.150
This power here-- 5/3--
is a little less than 2.

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:39.070
And that's because the
additional constraint

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:41.020
of the neighboring cell walls.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.230
But the main thing
we're interested in,

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.770
in these sorts of calculations,
is the power dependence

01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:49.722
on the density and this
simple calculation.

01:05:49.722 --> 01:05:51.763
Obviously, it's not exact,
but it gets you close.

01:05:55.896 --> 01:05:56.396
OK.

01:06:36.305 --> 01:06:38.596
I'm just going to wait for
people to catch up a little.

01:06:46.761 --> 01:06:47.260
OK.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.843
The next property
I'm going to look at

01:06:48.843 --> 01:06:50.710
is out-of-plane
brittle fractures.

01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:54.570
Say we loaded in tension, and if
we had no cracks in the walls,

01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:57.350
we'd just see uniaxial tension
and the strength would just

01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:59.870
be the strength of the solid
times the relative density

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:02.950
times the amount of solid.

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:16.915
We'll just say if defect free,
the walls see uniaxial tension.

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:24.350
And then the fracture stress
in the three direction

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:28.100
is just equal to the relative
density times the fracture

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.063
strength of the solid.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:41.510
If the cell walls are cracked,
and if the crack length

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:45.980
is very much bigger
than the cell length,

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.250
then the crack
propagates normal to x3.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:06.410
Then we can say the toughness
gc-- or the critical strain

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:09.980
energy release rate-- is
just equal to the volume

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:15.430
fraction of solid
times gc for the solid.

01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:25.899
And then the fracture
toughness, k1c,

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:30.142
is equal to the square root of
the Young's modulus times gc.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:37.020
And that's just equal
to the relative density

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.260
times the modulus of the solid.

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:45.840
And then the relative
density times the toughness

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.740
of the solid.

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:51.460
So it's just equal to
the relative density

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.290
times the fracture
toughness of the solid.

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:57.290
It's just straightforward there.

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:33.460
Then we've got one last
out-of-plane property.

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.734
And that's brittle
crushing and compression.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.319
And if we have some compressive
strength of the cell wall--

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:53.120
say I call it cs-- then it's
just the relative density

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.063
times that strength.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.200
And for brittle materials,
that crushing strength

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.858
is typically around 12 times the
modulus of rupture, or fracture

01:10:23.858 --> 01:10:24.358
strength.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.410
We could say that's
about equal to 12

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:45.172
times the relative density times
sigma fs, a fracture strength.

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:48.440
OK.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.730
That's the modeling
of the honeycombs.

01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:55.620
I know there's been a lot of
equations and derivations,

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.757
but that's the basis
of a lot of the things

01:10:57.757 --> 01:10:59.590
we're going to do in
the rest of the course.

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:02.920
The modeling we're going to do
on the foams is based on this

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.989
and the mathematics
is just easier

01:11:05.989 --> 01:11:08.280
because we're going to use
these dimensional arguments.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.655
We're not going
to figure out all

01:11:09.655 --> 01:11:11.940
these geometrical parameters.

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:13.440
Before we get to
the foams, I wanted

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.902
to talk a little bit about
honeycombs in nature.

01:11:15.902 --> 01:11:17.610
And we've only got a
couple minutes left,

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:19.220
so I won't really get that far.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:23.540
But I wanted to talk a little
bit about honeycomb materials

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.140
in nature.

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.056
And the two examples
we're going to talk about

01:11:26.056 --> 01:11:28.454
are wood and cork.

01:11:28.454 --> 01:11:30.870
I'm going to talk a little bit
about the structure of wood

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:31.990
next time.

01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:34.710
Then, we'll see how we can apply
these models to understanding

01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:36.100
how wood behaves.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.200
And we'll see how you
can use these models

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.130
to predict the density
dependence of wood properties

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.930
and also the anisotropy
in wood properties.

01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:47.750
And I guess we'll probably,
maybe, start it Wednesday

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:49.010
next week.

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:50.720
We'll talk about cork, as well.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.360
Those of you who
took 3032 know that I

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.000
like cork because of Robert
Hooke and his drawing of cork.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.750
And I made a new video
that I'm going to show you.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:01.022
Remember in 3032, I
showed you the video

01:12:01.022 --> 01:12:03.480
from the Bodleian Library,
where they had the first edition

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.860
of Hooke's Micrographia.

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.170
Well, it turns out Harvard
has a first edition.

01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:10.461
Harvard has three
first editions.

01:12:10.461 --> 01:12:10.960
Yeah.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.690
Exactly.

01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:14.300
MIT has zero first editions.

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.480
Gee, why does that surprise me?

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.480
And I have a friend who's
a librarian at Harvard

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.063
and she arranged for
me to go and make

01:12:20.063 --> 01:12:22.380
a little video with the first
edition of Micrographia.

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.155
So I can-- I don't if
we'll play the whole thing,

01:12:25.155 --> 01:12:27.030
but I'll show you the
first little bit of it.

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:29.620
And you can watch
it at your leisure.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:30.470
And Sardar came.

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:32.687
You came and saw it with me.

01:12:32.687 --> 01:12:34.770
You came and saw the first
edition with me, right?

01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:35.150
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:35.610
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah.

01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:36.180
Yeah.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.030
It's very beautiful and you'll
see some of the nice drawings.

01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:42.010
And I talk about the
cellular structure

01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:43.340
of some of the drawings.

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:45.360
So we'll talk about
wood and cork next time.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.610
But I think I'm going to
stop there because that seems

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.940
like enough equations for now.
