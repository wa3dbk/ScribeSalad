00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:27.340
LORNA GIBSON: OK,
so what we're going

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.600
to talk about in this
course are materials

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.990
that have a cellular structure.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.590
So they're all very porous.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.280
And typically they have low
volume fractions of solids,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.290
like less than 30% solid.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.500
And we're going to talk
about different types

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.990
of cellular solids.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.610
So one type are honeycombs.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.570
And this would be kind of your
standard hexagonal honeycomb,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.630
something like that.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.979
We're going to talk about foams.

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:49.770
And I'm sure you've
all seen polymer foams.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.050
Here's an aluminum foam.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.570
We'll talk about other
sorts of foams as well.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.520
We're going to talk about
some medical materials.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.460
And I brought in some bone
samples, some trabecular bone

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.750
samples here.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.211
I brought in a little tissue
engineering sample here.

00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:05.710
And then, we're going to talk
about materials in nature that

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.362
have a cellular structure too.

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:09.320
So we're going to talk
a little bit about wood.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.930
And I brought in a
piece of balsa wood.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.080
I'll pass these
around in a minute

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.200
so you can play with them.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.283
This is the lightest wood.

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:15.900
And I brought in lignum vitae.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.403
This is the densest wood.

00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:21.130
Lignum vitae is so dense
that it sinks in water.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.915
And I have a couple of projects
right now on natural materials.

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:26.040
So I thought I'd talk a
little bit about those too.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.010
We have one on bamboo and
making structural products out

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.510
of bamboo.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.290
So this is like a beam
made out of bamboo.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.960
And this is a piece of
oriented strand board made out

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.880
of bamboo.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.320
So the same way you have like
wood oriented strand board,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.940
you can do the same
thing with bamboo.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.982
And we have a project
that involves this,

00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:42.690
so I thought talk a
little bit about that

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.550
later on in the course.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.290
So we'll talk a little bit about
the processing, how you make

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.960
these materials, the structure.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.337
We'll talk a little bit
about how we do the modeling.

00:01:52.337 --> 00:01:54.170
So we're going to start
with the honeycombs,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.330
partly because they have
a nice, simple unit cell

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.580
that you can repeat and you
can analyze fairly exactly.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.290
And then we're going to talk
about modeling the foams.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.290
And then once we've got
the modeling background,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.484
so we're going to get
equations describing

00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:10.900
the mechanical properties, the
stiffness and the strength,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.430
once we've got that, then we
can apply it to lots of things.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.010
So we can apply it to
understanding the trabecular

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.830
bone, the tissue
engineering scaffolds,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.370
or how cells interact
with scaffolds.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.280
We're going to look at
energy absorption in foams

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.030
because they're good
for absorbing energy.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.790
We're going to look at a
lightweight sandwich panels

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.490
as well.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.130
So we're going to look at
all these different things.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.130
And I have some slides I'm
going to go over today that have

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.220
more pictures of all of this.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.678
And I'll pass this
around to a sec,

00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:38.600
but let me go through
the logistics first.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.000
So this first hand out has a
few of the kind of details.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.840
There's two books that I've
coauthored with colleagues.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.260
The one on cellular solids,
if you wanted to buy a book,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.060
is probably the most
relevant one to buy.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.510
If you don't want to buy it,
you certainly don't have to.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.820
I'm sure the library has
multiple copies of it.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.290
And the other more recent one
is called Cellular Materials

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.529
in Nature and Medicine.

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.070
And that's a little
more specialized.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.080
And again the library has that.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.264
So you don't need to
run out and buy that.

00:03:08.264 --> 00:03:09.680
You can just get
it there, but let

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.590
me just mention
there's that reference

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.800
and it might be helpful.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.220
OK, so let me talk a little
bit about the projects.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.400
What we do in this class is
everybody does a project.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.685
And I like for you to do it
in pairs, just so that you

00:03:20.685 --> 00:03:21.810
have somebody to work with.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.902
I think it's nice to have
somebody to do it with.

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:25.360
And the project
has to be something

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.320
on cellular materials,
but I really

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.480
leave it pretty open
ended what the project is.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.510
It's really up to you to
decide what you'd like to do.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.510
And to give you some idea
what people have done,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.050
people have done all kinds
of stuff in the past.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.880
So people have worked on
negative Poisson's ratio

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.695
honeycombs.

00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:42.320
I didn't bring any
of those in with me,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.400
but you can design
these honeycombs

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.200
so that they have this
property that when

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.640
you push it this way-- instead
of if you make the strain

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.340
smaller in this direction, it
gets wider in this direction

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.980
normally, but with negative
Poisson's ratio materials,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.000
it will contract
in that direction.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.410
So I've had people
do projects on that.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.880
I've had people work
on osteoporosis.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.620
I had a group once who
worked on elephant skulls

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.930
and I brought part of
their project with me.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.060
So it turns out elephant skulls
have a sort of porous layer

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.982
to them.

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:15.690
And this is-- they
have these large pores

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.689
in the top of the skull.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.990
I don't have a whole skull,
but this is part of it.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.360
And what they did was they had
heard that elephant skulls have

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.510
these pores and that
the pores somehow

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.670
affect sound transmission
and how the elephant hears.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.590
And so they wanted to
do a project on that.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.730
And that was really all
they knew to start with,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.979
elephants have pores and we
want to do a project on it

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.060
because it's cool.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.570
So I helped them put
together this project.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.620
We went up to Harvard.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.370
We went up to the Museum
of Comparative Zoology

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.953
where they have elephant skulls,
which are like about this big

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:45.510
around, huge skulls.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.610
And some of them had the outer
part of the bone was broken

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.500
and you could see
these big pores.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.660
So they got some nice
pictures of elephant skulls.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.076
And then they found that the
University of Texas at Austin

00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:59.486
has computer tomography
images of all sorts of bones

00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:00.360
of different animals.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.110
And sure enough, they
had elephant skulls.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.730
So they got the file
for the micro CT

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.410
image, which gives you the sort
of 3-D picture of the skull.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.070
And then they use
that to 3-D print

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.340
small versions of the skull.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.780
So that's what this is, they
printed smaller versions.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.890
And these were just
a couple of slices

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.744
that I got from them
at the end project.

00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:20.660
And then what they did
with one of the skulls,

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.940
they suspended it from a
wire, and they took speakers,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.802
and they had sound that
vibrated the skull,

00:05:24.802 --> 00:05:26.760
and then they put an
accelerometer on the skull

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.890
and they measured the vibration
response of the skull.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.280
And they also made, I think,
it was a dolphin skull,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.370
which did not have these
pores, and they kind of

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.420
compared the vibration response
from the sound for these two

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.050
skulls with two
different structures.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.220
So that was a project
for this class.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.920
People have worked on tissue
engineering scaffolds.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.440
Often there's people
who work on food foams.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.860
So one year, people
worked on bread.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.170
They did bread processing.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.970
They made bread by
having different amounts

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.880
of yeast, different rise
times, different ingredients.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.240
And they made bread.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.110
And I have a little-- I like
these historical things.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.850
And I have a little thing
here I wanted to show you.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.000
So the people in 3032
last year, last fall,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.130
will know that I went
to England in November.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.300
And I went to the Royal Society
for an editorial board meeting.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.036
But I also went and
looked at their archives.

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:20.410
And one of the
things they showed

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.480
me was this article, which is
in the sort of an original, sort

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.390
of archives of the Royal
Society from 1600s.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.450
And it's by a guy
called John Evelyn.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.820
He's famous for writing
a book called Silva

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.202
about trees and wood.

00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:34.660
But he's written
this article here.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.850
And I love the title.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.710
It's "The Several Manors of
Making Bread in France, Where

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.940
by General Consent, the Best
Bread in the World is Eaten,"

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.090
by Mr. Evelyn.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.740
So here we have in the
Official Royal Society bread

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.800
making science.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.390
And in fact, the article
was several pages long.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.580
There was quite a lot on bread
and how you make it in France,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.086
where the best bread is eaten.

00:06:56.086 --> 00:06:57.960
So if you want to do
something on food foams,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.080
people have done meringue
before, various things.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.330
They look at typically
changing something

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.620
about the recipe, or the
composition, or the processing,

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.399
or the baking.

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.690
And they look at the structure.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.120
Sometimes they look at
mechanical properties too.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.590
So anyway, there's a whole
list of things there.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.080
You can think of other things.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.496
If you look through
the books, you

00:07:18.496 --> 00:07:21.010
might get some ideas
as well for projects.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.810
So what I'd thought
I'd do next is

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.910
I wanted to just kind of
give an overview of what

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.450
we're going to talk about.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.410
And I've got a bunch of slides.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.730
Let's see I forgot some
things, because I do that.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.160
Books, yeah, OK, let me
pass some of these things

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.310
around so you get to
play with them too.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.070
So here's some honeycombs.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.410
I don't know if we can pass
all these things around

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.701
because it's a little unwieldy.

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.770
So this is an
aluminum honeycomb.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.942
I like bringing toys in.

00:07:50.942 --> 00:07:52.400
These are little
rubber honeycombs.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.210
This is a little
ceramic honeycomb.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.053
This is a little
paper honeycomb.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.210
And let's see, we
have some foams here.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:12.830
So here's a metal foam
and a ceramic foam.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.150
And this is a sort
of, not quite a foam,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.620
it's made of hollow spheres
by centering hollow spheres

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.540
together.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.809
So you can play with that.

00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:21.850
And what else do we have?

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.080
We have little
lattice things here.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.382
So here's a sort of
3-D lattice material.

00:08:26.382 --> 00:08:28.090
So this has sort of
a cellular structure,

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.300
but it's very, very regular.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.740
It's not like a foam.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.240
So that's called a 3-D
lattice material or sometimes

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.770
a 3-D truss.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.230
And what else should
we pass around?

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.820
We need to do the bones.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.809
Here's the wood.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.755
You can feel how different the
densities of the two woods are.

00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:45.130
I would like these
all at the end

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.290
because I show these around
for different classes.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.780
Here's some bone, you can see
of the bone looks like the foam.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:56.250
And this is a tissue engineering
scaffold for generating skin.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.260
All right, so while those
are getting passed around,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.530
I'll talk a little
bit about what

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.900
we're going to cover in
the class with some slides.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.114
OK, let's see, should
I dim the lights?

00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:09.530
Would that be a good thing,
Craig, if I dimmed the lights?

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:14.100
CRAIG: They're kind of
preset, you can try maybe two.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.880
LORNA GIBSON: OK.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.360
Doesn't seem to-- there we go.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.312
How about that?

00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:26.290
That OK?

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:31.150
All right, so I like
these historical things.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.946
So this is a picture of
Robert Hooke's drawing of cork

00:09:34.946 --> 00:09:36.070
from his book Micrographia.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.530
And he was the first person
who used the word cell

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.640
to describe a biological cell.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.610
And it comes from the
Latin cella, which

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.300
means a small compartment.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.710
So you can think of the
cells as small compartments.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.090
That kind of makes sense.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.860
And he kind of very
modestly says, "I no sooner

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.930
to discerned these,
which were indeed

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.940
the first microscopical
pours I have ever saw,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.500
but me thought I had with
the discovery of them

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.790
perfectly hinted to me the true
and intelligible reason for all

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.265
the phenomena of cork."

00:10:04.265 --> 00:10:06.390
So he's saying by looking
at the structure of cork,

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.848
he thinks he
understands everything

00:10:07.848 --> 00:10:11.600
about the properties
of cork-- very modest.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.634
But in fact, this is kind of the
foundation of material science.

00:10:14.634 --> 00:10:16.300
So material science
is all about looking

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.052
at the structure of
materials and trying

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:20.260
to say something about the
properties of the behavior

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.270
of the materials.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.160
And that sentence
kind of sums that up.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.724
So that's why I
like that sentence.

00:10:25.724 --> 00:10:27.890
So what we're going to do
is look at different kinds

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.140
of cellular materials.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.220
We'll look at engineering ones.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.460
And these we typically refer
to as honeycombs or foams.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.400
Honeycombs have two
dimensional prismatic cells,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.070
while foams have three
dimensional polyhedral cells.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.150
And we'll look at applications
for the honeycombs and foams

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.520
in things like lightweight
sandwich panels,

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.870
in energy absorption
devices, and things

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.890
like thermal insulation.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.290
We'll talk a little bit
about the thermal properties.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.530
We're also going to talk about
cellular materials in medicine,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.710
so trabecular bone.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.910
We'll talk about osteoporosis
and how loss of bone

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.000
reduces the strength, and
how you might estimate that.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.480
We'll talk about tissue
engineering scaffolds,

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.990
something about their
mechanical properties.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.380
You may think the mechanical
properties aren't probably

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.797
the most important thing.

00:11:13.797 --> 00:11:15.380
But in fact, the
mechanical properties

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.800
do have some effect on
how the cells interact

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.780
with the scaffold.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.572
So we'll talk a little bit
about cell scaffold mechanics.

00:11:21.572 --> 00:11:23.780
And then we're going to talk
about cellular materials

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.360
in nature at the
end of the course.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.290
So we'll talk a little
bit about honeycomb

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.940
like materials, like wood and
cork, and foam like materials,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.520
like the trabecular bone.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.990
There's also a type of tissue
in plants called parenchyma

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.510
that looks just like a foam.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.540
And there's some sponges that
have some interesting features.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.270
And often, in nature
the cellular material

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.210
appears in combination
with some solid material.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.470
And so it's sort of a
structural component.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.050
And you can see
sandwich structures

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.730
in nature, leaves and skulls.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.100
You can see materials that
have density gradients,

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.830
palm stems and bamboo
are examples of that.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.230
And you can see materials
that have cylindrical shells

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.400
with compliant cores, and
things like plant stems

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.130
and animal quills are like that.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.600
So that's kind of the
range of materials

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.964
that we're going to talk about.

00:12:07.964 --> 00:12:10.380
And one of the interesting
things about cellular materials

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.460
is that you can make
cellular materials out

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.780
of almost anything now.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.640
And this is really a huge
range of materials and lots

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.650
of different
applications for this.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.100
So one of the fundamental
things we're going to do

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.010
is look at the mechanisms by
which the materials deform

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.370
and how they fail.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.260
And we'll use a
structural analysis

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.800
to obtain the bulk mechanical
properties, so things

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.290
like the stiffness, the moduli,
the strength, the fracture,

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.320
toughness.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.480
We'll look at how
you can control

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.370
the design of the microstructure
to get the properties that you

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.440
might want, and also how you
might select for the best

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.220
material for a given engineering
application in engineering

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.290
design.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.070
So we're going to get
those three things.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.870
So let me start by showing
you some more examples

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.320
of engineering cellular
solids, and in particular, some

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:52.919
micrographs.

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:55.210
So that you can see what it
looks like on a small scale

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.214
too.

00:12:56.214 --> 00:12:57.380
So these are the honeycombs.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.796
These are the sorts of things
that I'm passing around now.

00:12:59.796 --> 00:13:03.400
The aluminum one, paper
resin, and the ceramic ones.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.650
The aluminum and
the paper resin ones

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.190
are typically used in the
cores of sandwich panels.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.770
And the ceramic ones are used
in the catalytic converter

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.920
in your car.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.080
So what they do is they block
off every other cell at one

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.730
end and then the opposite
cells at the other end

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.940
and exhaust gas from
your car is forced

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.540
to go through those
channels in the honeycomb.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.380
And the walls, if you look
at that triangular one,

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.780
those triangular walls
themselves are porous,

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.020
and they're coated with the
catalyst, which is platinum.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.547
And that forces the exhaust
gas through the wall

00:13:35.547 --> 00:13:37.130
in contact with the
platinum, and then

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.231
comes out the other end.

00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:40.480
And they're ceramic, obviously,
because the gas is hot

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.470
and they need something that
has a high thermal resistance.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.580
So these are some
examples of honeycombs.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.910
These are some examples
of engineering foams.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.532
When I tell people
I work on foams,

00:13:49.532 --> 00:13:50.990
they always think
of polymer foams,

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.884
like polystyrene or something.

00:13:52.884 --> 00:13:54.300
And there's lots
of polymer foams.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.320
But you can actually
foam any materials now.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.560
There's metal foams.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.200
There's ceramic foams, and
glass foams, carbon foams,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.620
all sorts of foams.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.840
So those are some examples.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.560
You can see when you
look at these images

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.780
here that the foams have a
low volume fraction of solids,

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:15.610
like if you look at say
this polyethylene one here.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.906
Say we look at this
guy up here, then

00:14:18.906 --> 00:14:21.280
you can see there's not much
solid, there's a lot of gas.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.210
So the volume
fraction of solids is

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.094
fairly low on that foam there.

00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:27.010
So one of the things
we're going to talk about

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.560
is how the volume fraction of
solids affects the properties.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.220
You can also see on the
top left and the top right,

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.550
the top left one has
what we call open cells.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.770
There's just edges
along the polyhedra,

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.940
there's no faces
over the membranes.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.700
And the right hand one
is a closed cell foam.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.680
So there's like membranes that
cover the faces of the cells.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.230
So we're going to talk a little
bit about the differences

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.580
and the behavior of open cell
and closed cell foams too.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.530
These are food foams.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.820
So I've already
said you might want

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.130
to do a project on food foams.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.340
And these are just some examples
of different kinds of foods

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.810
that are in fact foams.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.340
And it turns out
the food industry

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.370
spends quite a lot
of time and effort

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.580
thinking about the mechanical
properties of food.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.140
And it turns out if the texture
of the food isn't right,

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.260
then people don't like the
way it feels in their mouth.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.380
There's something they
actually called mouth feel.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.980
So it turns out if your
cereals too soggy, it's icky.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.610
If it's too crunchy, it's icky.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.500
So it's sort of a happy medium.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.850
And food companies spend
quite a lot of time and money

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.897
worrying about the mechanical
properties of food.

00:15:29.897 --> 00:15:31.980
This is an example of
showing that the cells could

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.180
be antisotropic, the cells could
be elongated in one direction.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.590
For instance, in the top one
on the polyurethane foam.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.470
And if they're elongated
in one direction,

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.969
it's not too surprising, you
might have different properties

00:15:43.969 --> 00:15:47.140
in that direction from the
plane perpendicular to it.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.180
And then the bottom
images is of pumice.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.770
Pumice is a volcanic rock.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.890
And you can see how the pores
are kind of flattened out

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:54.470
there.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.428
And they're flattened
out because that was once

00:15:56.428 --> 00:15:57.340
molten lava.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.960
And the molten lava
was flowing down

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.710
a mountain side of a volcano.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.650
And as it flowed,
it got sheared.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.090
And the shape of those
pours reflects the shearing

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.010
as the molten lava
flow down the volcano.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:15.815
And so this kind of sort
of stretched out cell shape

00:16:15.815 --> 00:16:17.690
is going to give you
antisotropic properties,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.320
different properties in
different directions.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.530
This is the 3-D truss
that I'm passing around.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.279
I don't know if it's
exactly the same one,

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:25.410
but it's a similar one.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.820
And these trusses are
triangulated structures.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.090
And we'll talk a little bit
about their properties too.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.180
And then we also are going to
talk about some applications.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.590
So obviously, these
materials are mostly air.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.440
And that gives
them a low weight.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.890
And that means they're often
used in structural sandwich

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.890
panels as the core of the panel.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.330
And these panels have
stiff faces separated

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.629
by a lightweight core.

00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:49.920
And the idea is to make it
a little bit like an I-beam.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.836
So the way you have the
flanges on the I-beam,

00:16:51.836 --> 00:16:54.100
the faces are like the
flanges, and the porous core

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.410
is like the web of the I-beam.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.800
They can also undergo
large deformations

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.020
at relatively low stress.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.140
And that means they can
absorb a lot of energy.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.880
So if you think of the energy
as the area under the stress

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.924
strain curve, if there's big
strains and big deformations,

00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:10.990
then there's going
to be a large area.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.130
And that sort of
energy absorption

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.190
occurs at a fairly low stress.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.280
So typically, when you
want to absorb energy,

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.672
it's not just how much
energy you want to absorb.

00:17:19.672 --> 00:17:21.880
You have to do it without
actually breaking the thing

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.921
you're trying to protect.

00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:25.660
So you don't want to generate
high stresses as you go along,

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.329
and foams are good at this.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.930
Foams are also good at
being thermal insulators.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.680
They have a low
thermal conductivity.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.680
And that's because they're
largely made of gas

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.190
and the gas has a lower
conductivity than the solids.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.490
So that gives them a
lower conductivity.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.956
And they have a
large surface area.

00:17:41.956 --> 00:17:43.830
And the smaller the pore
size, the bigger the

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.790
surface area per unit volume.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.520
And that makes them
good for things

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.230
like carriers for catalysts.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.910
And that's why they're used for
these catalytic converters too.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.650
OK, so here's some examples of
cellular materials in medicine.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:00.410
So here's some examples
of trabecular bone.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.250
Trabecular bone exists at
the ends of your long bones.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.110
So say in your hip
or in your knee.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.770
It also exists in your vertebrae
in the middle of the spine

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.125
in the vertebrae there.

00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:13.389
And it also exists
in your skull.

00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:15.180
And you can see it's
a porous type of bone.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.430
It looks very similar to
the foams and the sorts

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.840
of mechanical models
we make for foams can

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.829
be applied to the bone as well.

00:18:21.829 --> 00:18:23.370
And so that's one
of the things we're

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.180
going to do later in the course.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.890
These are two slides
showing what happens

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.680
when people get osteoporosis.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.330
The left hand slide is
from a 55-year-old female

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.710
to the same bone,
the same slice.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.610
And the right hand one is
from an 86-year-old female.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.680
This thing here,
row star over row S,

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.230
that's the relative density,
the density of the bone

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.400
divided by the solid
that it's made from.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.300
That's the same as the
volume fraction of solids.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.880
And so on the normal bone on
the left it's about 17% solid.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.340
And on the osteoporotic bone
on the right it's, about 7%.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.666
So you can kind of see the
bone density has gotten lower,

00:18:59.666 --> 00:19:01.040
partly by thinning
of the struts,

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.080
but partly by resorption
of the struts, as well.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.120
And obviously the
one on the right

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.661
is going to have a
lot lower strength

00:19:05.661 --> 00:19:08.700
than the one on the left.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.980
These are micro
CT images of bone.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.890
And again, you can
see how the structure

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.234
looks different at different
relative densities.

00:19:15.234 --> 00:19:17.650
The one on the left is sort
of in the middle at around 11%

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:18.330
dense.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.460
The one in the middle
is the most dense 25%.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.170
And the one on the
right is 6% dense.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.470
So it's not too surprising
that the one on the right

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.030
would have a much lower
strength from the other ones.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.430
And we'll look at how
we can model that.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.970
This is just showing
some deformation in bone.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.410
I have a colleague,
Ralph Mueller

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.840
who's got a micro
CT machine, which

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.720
allows you to do compression
tests in the micro CT.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.600
So he can make
these sort of images

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.441
where he scans it
at zero strain.

00:19:44.441 --> 00:19:45.690
He compresses it a little bit.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:46.464
He scans it again.

00:19:46.464 --> 00:19:47.630
He compresses it a bit more.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.860
He scans it again.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.950
And he these are
stills from his images,

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.910
but he makes
animations from this.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.000
And if you look at
the top right up here,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.510
you see these struts here.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.380
They're pretty
straight in this one.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.810
They're a little bent and
starting to buckle here.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.970
And then if you look at
that one strut there,

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.660
you can see how it's
buckled right over.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.620
So you can look at the
deformation mechanisms

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.570
by looking at the CT scans
and things like that.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.340
People are starting
to think about using

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.700
metal foams for coatings
of orthopedic implants.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.270
So one of the
issues with implants

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.300
is that say you have a hip
implant or a knee implant,

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.237
you remove the bone
that's preexisting,

00:20:26.237 --> 00:20:28.320
and then you replace it
with some sort of implant.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.900
Typically, the
implant has a stem

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.160
that fits into the
hollow part of the bone

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.710
and then has a sort
of joint piece to it

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.410
that fits into the joint.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:41.120
And you can get some loosening
of the stem in the remaining

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:41.620
bone.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.011
And one idea is that you use
porous coatings to minimize

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:46.510
that.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.120
And right now, typically
what they do is center beads,

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.062
metal beads on to the stem.

00:20:52.062 --> 00:20:54.270
And another idea is maybe
you could use a metal foam.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.370
And these are some different
types of metal foams

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.920
that people are looking at.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.150
Another type of cellular
material in medicine

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.220
is a tissue
engineering scaffold.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.160
And this just shows
some different examples

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.490
made by different processes.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.110
And we'll talk more about
these later on in the course.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.840
This one here at the
top left is a collagen

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.416
based one made by a
freeze drying process.

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:19.540
And I don't know if you
saw MIT's website yesterday

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.250
and today, Ioannis Yannas was
the one who developed this.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.910
And he's just being inducted
into the National Inventors

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:25.730
Hall of Fame.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.690
And this is what he
really was inducted

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:32.850
for is he's invented
a skin-- well,

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.890
he calls it a dermal
regeneration template

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.920
for regenerating skin, mostly
in people with serious burns.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.880
Then these are some other
sorts of scaffolds that are

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.690
made by different processes.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.914
This is by a sort of rapid
prototyping process here.

00:21:47.914 --> 00:21:49.830
The bottom two, these
are kind of interesting.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.210
These are actually the
extracellular matrix

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.000
in the body.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.319
And they've had all the
cells removed from it.

00:21:55.319 --> 00:21:56.860
So these tissue
engineering scaffolds

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.440
are really designed to mimic
the extracellular scaffold

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.880
in your body or extracellular
matrix in your body.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.576
And you can see how when
you remove the cells,

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:07.950
the structure of
those two things

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.890
looks a lot like a
closed cell foam.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.570
So that's the kind of structure
you're trying to replicate.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.110
We'll look a bit
at cell mechanics.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:18.090
This is a cell
contraction of a scaffold.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.990
So here these sort of
very thin transparent bits

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.520
of the collagen based scaffold,
and this is a fiber blast on it

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.130
right here.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.040
And I had a student,
Toby [? Fryman, ?]

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.246
who worked with me and
Ioannis Yannas on this.

00:22:30.246 --> 00:22:32.370
And you can see from the
video the cell is actually

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.230
contract in the scaffolding
making it deform.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.410
And you can
calculate what forces

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.360
the cell must be
imposing on the scaffold

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.630
by knowing something about
the geometry of the struts

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.510
and how the cells attached.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.770
And then it's going
a little bit more.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.170
So we'll talk more about that.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.400
And then there's a
final picture down here,

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.930
where you can see these
two, the two points

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.060
up here and down here have now
been brought pretty much right

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.120
together.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.710
So we'll talk about
that in more detail.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.140
We've also done studies
on cell attachment

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.410
and how that attachment rate or
the amount of cells that attach

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.560
is related to the
surface area, the surface

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.140
area per unit volume.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.780
So these are just
some tests from that

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.570
done by [? Fergal ?] O'Brien,
a post-doc that worked with me.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.980
We've also done some
studies on cell migration.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.210
And Brendan Harley was
the student who did this.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.130
And he stained the
cells with one stain

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.500
and he stained the scaffold
with something else.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.810
So red are the scaffold
and green are the cells.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.100
And then he used a confocal
microscope to track the cells.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.556
And he tracked the cells and
where they moved versus time.

00:23:38.556 --> 00:23:40.430
And if he has the location
at different times

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.682
he can get the velocity.

00:23:41.682 --> 00:23:43.140
And one of the
things he did was he

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.610
changed the stiffness
of the scaffold

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.880
and he found that the
migration speed depended

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.110
on how stiff the scaffold was.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.120
So he was looking at
sort of interactions

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.760
between mechanical
properties of the scaffold

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.074
and behaviors like
cell migration.

00:23:59.074 --> 00:24:01.240
And then we're going to
look at materials in nature.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.150
So here is wood.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.179
So you can see the
cellular structure of wood.

00:24:04.179 --> 00:24:05.470
It's a lot like the honeycombs.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.680
It has sort of a
prismatic structure.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.820
That one happens to be cedar,
but other woods look similar.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.850
Now, this is balsa wood.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.220
And this is showing just
how the balsa deforms.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.810
I think this was loaded
from top to bottom.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.340
And this is at zero load.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.860
And then this is more load,
and more load, and more load.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.350
And if you look
at that cell there

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.920
with this little kind
of tear in it here,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.657
that's the same as
the cell down here,

00:24:26.657 --> 00:24:27.740
and that's the tear there.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.000
So you can see how the cell
walls bend and how they deform.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.880
And you can model that
using the honeycomb models.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.890
This is just another image
showing actual failure of wood,

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.360
buckling of the cell walls.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.380
This is cork.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.185
So these are modern scanning
electron micrograph of cork.

00:24:45.185 --> 00:24:46.560
And one of the
interesting things

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.644
is the cork cells have
these little corrugations.

00:24:48.644 --> 00:24:50.060
You see how they're
not flat, they

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.900
have little kind of
wrinkles in them.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.510
And that gives rise to sort
of an interesting property

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.010
of cork.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.660
If you take cork
and you load it.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.640
So here we were pulling it in
the direction of these arrows,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.240
pulling it like along
this direction here.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.490
And again, this is
the same set of cells.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.252
That tear there is the
same as that tear there.

00:25:07.252 --> 00:25:09.210
And you see all these
little corrugations here,

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.010
they've all straightened out
when we're pulling on it.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.300
And the Poisson's ratio
of the cork is zero.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.169
It's kind of like a bellows.

00:25:16.169 --> 00:25:17.710
Like if you had an
old camera, or you

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.140
have an accordion bellows.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.830
If you pull the
bellows in and out,

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.600
it doesn't get any wider
this way or the other way.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.700
You're just sort of
opening the bellows

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.744
and closing the bellows.

00:25:24.744 --> 00:25:26.910
And the cork cells are doing
kind of the same thing.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.881
And it gives them this
Poisson's ratio of zero.

00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:30.630
Which it happens is
one of the things that

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.080
makes it easy to get the
cork into your wine bottle,

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.530
because as you're pushing
on it, it's not pushing out

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:36.401
in all directions.

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:37.900
This is only for
this one direction,

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.840
but it's not pushing
out in all directions.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.090
These are parenchyma
cells in plants,

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.440
in carrots and potatoes.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.700
All those little blobs in the
potato, those are starch blobs.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.460
This is called a Venus
flower basket sponge,

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.062
and Joanna Aizenberg,
at Harvard,

00:25:54.062 --> 00:25:55.270
has studied this quite a lot.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.900
This has a
hierarchical structure.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.410
If you look at
the overall sponge

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.030
and then you look at each
of the sort of struts

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.600
that make up the
lattice, that too

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.607
has a hierarchical structure.

00:26:05.607 --> 00:26:07.940
And she's looked at the optical
properties of this glass

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.440
sponge.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.731
It's kind of a beautiful thing.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:17.224
And then there's some cellular
structures in nature as well.

00:26:17.224 --> 00:26:18.390
There's sandwich structures.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.473
There's density gradients.

00:26:19.473 --> 00:26:21.690
And there's tubes
with a cellular core.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.130
So here's some examples of that.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.350
Here's the iris leaf,
you know the iris plant

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.340
has these long kind of leaves
that stand up like this.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.080
And it's just like
a sandwich panel.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.910
The parenchyma are kind of
like a foam in the middle here.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.930
And there's very
dense fibers called

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.690
sclerenchyma that run up and
down the length of the leaf.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.190
And they're like fibers
in a fiber composite.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.940
And here's a bull rush
or a cat tail leaf.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.720
And they're like
little I-beams almost.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.511
It's like a whole series
of little I-beams.

00:26:46.511 --> 00:26:49.360
And again that's sort
mechanically efficient.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.680
These are examples of sandwich
structures in bird skulls.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.370
Some of you know I'm a birder.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.166
So I sort of sneak in bird
stuff from time to time.

00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:00.790
But you can see how these birds
skulls are all sandwich panels,

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.640
and obviously birds want
to minimize their weight

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.720
for flight.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.070
And this is one of the
ways that they do that.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.690
This is a horseshoe crab,
sort of similar kind of thing.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.040
This is from Mark
Myers in San Diego.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.420
He did a study on the crab
in its shell as a sandwich.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.040
And this is the ever
so handsome cuttlefish.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.500
And the cuttlefish has something
called a cuttlefish bone.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.390
This is the bone
here and the bone

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.350
is made up of these kind of
sandwich type structures.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.170
The cuttlefish is related to
octopus and squid and things

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.110
like that.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.070
And it's hard to see
in this picture here,

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.736
but these little things here are
actually like little tentacles.

00:27:35.736 --> 00:27:38.180
There's several tentacles
that it eats stuff with.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.340
The cuttlefish is
actually a mollusk.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.410
All those things are mollusks.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.460
It's called a fish, but
it's not really a fish.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.490
And here's an example of
a natural material that

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.817
has a radial density gradient.

00:27:49.817 --> 00:27:51.650
Have you ever noticed
if you look at a palm,

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.627
like you see those pictures of
Hollywood in LA, and the palm

00:27:54.627 --> 00:27:56.210
trees, you know,
they line the street.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.834
But they're all about
the same diameter

00:27:57.834 --> 00:27:59.452
from the bottom to the top.

00:27:59.452 --> 00:28:01.910
And when you think of like an
oak tree, it's not like that.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.990
It's big diameter at the bottom,
skinny diameter at the top.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:09.282
So when wood grows, the wood has
more or less the same density

00:28:09.282 --> 00:28:10.490
in the bottom and at the top.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.040
So as it's growing, the density
is more or less the same.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.800
And it resists the bigger
loads from getting taller

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.201
by adding circumference.

00:28:17.201 --> 00:28:19.450
So it gets wider and wider
as it gets older and older.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.730
But palms don't do that.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.840
They come out of the
ground a certain diameter.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.480
And most palms just
grow that same diameter.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.107
As they get taller
and taller, you

00:28:27.107 --> 00:28:29.690
can imagine there's wind forces,
and different kinds of forces

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.160
are on it, the stresses
get bigger and bigger.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.430
And the way they resist
those is that the cell walls

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.220
get thicker, and
they preferentially

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.170
get thicker on the outside.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.320
And if you think of
moment of inertia,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.300
remember moment of
inertia is increased

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.050
more with the material
on the outside of a beam.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.160
And that's kind of
what the palm is doing.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.940
So if you look at young cell
walls and old cell walls,

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.780
here's some SCM
pictures of young ones

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.110
and it's sort of skinny.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.780
And SCM pictures of older
ones, and the cell wall

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.600
has gotten thicker.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.080
So we're going to talk
a little bit about that.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.288
And it turns out, this is
an incredibly efficient way

00:29:02.288 --> 00:29:09.660
to deal with getting taller and
needing to resist bigger loads.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.920
Another material that has
a radial density gradient

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.610
is bamboo.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:17.090
So this again shows these sort
of dense sclerenchyma fibers.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.120
Do you see these kind
of dense parts here?

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.840
And you can see there's
not very many of them here.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.464
And there's more and more as you
get towards the outside there.

00:29:23.464 --> 00:29:25.700
So there's a density
gradient there.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.410
So we'll talk about that.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.560
And some plant materials
have a cylindrical shell

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.950
with a compliant core.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.930
Plant stems or commonly like.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.507
This is a milkweed stem.

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:37.590
And you can see it's got
these sort of fibers that

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.380
are almost completely dense.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.470
And then a sort of
lower density core,

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.350
cellular core, here, and
a void in the very middle.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.310
And you can show that that core
helps prevent local buckling.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.310
So if you take a drinking
straw and you bend it,

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.380
you get that kinking
kind of failure.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.490
You can show that
having this sort of foam

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.870
like core in the middle
helps to resist that.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:57.245
Imagine you have
a drinking straw

00:29:57.245 --> 00:29:58.370
and now you put
foam in the middle.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.536
It's going to be harder to
get it to kink like that.

00:30:00.536 --> 00:30:02.370
So that's what the
plants are doing.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.980
Animal quills do the same thing.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.150
That's a porcupine
and a hedgehog quill.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.910
And all of this stuff
is in these two books.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.912
So it doesn't really
matter to me if you go out

00:30:12.912 --> 00:30:13.620
and buy the book.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.661
I don't make very many
much money on these books.

00:30:15.661 --> 00:30:18.302
So this is not an
income producing thing.

00:30:18.302 --> 00:30:20.260
But those are the books
that all these pictures

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.850
have been taken from.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.680
All right, so I
think that's my sort

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.060
of introduction to the class.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.880
Are there any questions
about how we're organized

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.940
or what we're going to be doing?

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.152
Are we good?

00:30:34.152 --> 00:30:35.270
It's OK?

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.029
OK.

00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:38.570
So then I think what I'm going
to do for the rest of the time

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:42.830
is start the next section of the
course which is on processing

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.980
of cellular materials.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.845
Now, I have another
little hand out here.

00:30:49.307 --> 00:30:51.890
So I don't know if I'll remember
to do this for every lecture,

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.260
but I like to have a
little outline, that

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.540
partly makes me be organized.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.844
So it's just a little
outline for the lecture.

00:31:02.484 --> 00:31:03.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.939
LORNA GIBSON: You
asked me to do what?

00:31:11.939 --> 00:31:13.480
AUDIENCE: Put the
room light back up.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.190
LORNA GIBSON: Put the what up?

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.290
AUDIENCE: Lights.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.498
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, the lights.

00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:18.350
I'm going have another
set of slides though.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.745
So let me get out
of the intro slides.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.250
I know I have another
set of slides.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.280
So I'm going to just
leave the screen up.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.728
And kind of put stuff
on the board and talk

00:31:32.728 --> 00:31:33.436
about the slides.

00:31:33.436 --> 00:31:34.230
AUDIENCE: That's fine.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.313
LORNA GIBSON: You're good?

00:31:35.313 --> 00:31:36.420
OK.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.799
OK.

00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:39.840
So I wanted to talk a
little bit about processing

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.420
of cellular solids and
then, next time we'll

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.050
start talking about
the structures.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.841
It seemed good to talk
about the processing

00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:47.330
before we got to the structure.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.080
So I'm going to talk a
little bit about honeycombs

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.955
and how they make
honeycombs, and then foams,

00:31:50.955 --> 00:31:52.120
and then lattice materials.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.242
Yeah?

00:31:53.242 --> 00:31:57.090
AUDIENCE: The slide you're
showing with the the shell

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.014
with the foam
inside it, are there

00:31:59.014 --> 00:32:00.938
techniques for analysis of it?

00:32:03.005 --> 00:32:04.380
LORNA GIBSON:
Well, I don't think

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.890
we're going to get into
all the gory details,

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.230
but I can certainly
give you references.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.797
That's something that one of
my students did at one point.

00:32:09.797 --> 00:32:11.880
And in fact, I've been
collaborating with Jennifer

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.060
Lewis up at Harvard
and she has a student

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.160
who's making sort of
cylindrical shells

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.080
with foams out of ceramic foam.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:24.180
So he's 3-D printing sort
of with coaxial nozzles

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.610
a cylindrical shell
that's pretty solid.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.480
And then a ceramic
foam on the inside.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.940
And that's one of the things
he's playing around with.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.523
So he's looking at
ways you might make

00:32:31.523 --> 00:32:34.820
engineering versions of that.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.350
So I wanted to start with
looking at honeycombs

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.360
and how they make honeycombs.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.515
And I thought what I'd do
is I've got some slides.

00:32:42.515 --> 00:32:44.140
And I'm going to talk
about the slides.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.681
And then I'll put some notes on
the board to kind of describe

00:32:46.681 --> 00:32:48.000
what we're doing, OK?

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.570
So this is the first sort
of slide on the honeycombs.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.240
And the two main
techniques that they're

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.720
made by, especially
those aluminum honeycombs

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.670
and paper honeycombs that I
passed around, one technique

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.590
is an expansion process.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:04.750
So what they do is they take
flat sheets of some metal,

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.680
say aluminum, and they put
little stripes of glue on it

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.520
in different places.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.186
So these little kind
of specialty things

00:33:11.186 --> 00:33:12.520
are where the glue goes.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.410
And then they
stack those guys up

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.140
in a sort of
particular arrangement.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.700
And then what they do is
they pull it all apart, kind

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.700
like a paper doll thing.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.190
They pull it all apart and
when they pull it apart,

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.960
they get the hexagonal shape.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.721
So let me just show on the
board how you do the gluing

00:33:28.721 --> 00:33:29.512
and how that works.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.200
So they would start
with some sheets.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.860
Say we start with
two sheets like that.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.850
They'd put some glue
down, say there.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.250
And then there's a gap.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.720
And then they put glue on
the opposite side over there.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.050
And then there's another gap.

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.680
And then they put glue there.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.170
And then they do
the same positions

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.830
but the opposite sides
on the next sheet.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.520
So they do that.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.710
And then if you glue
those together-- well,

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.620
let me do another one.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.199
Maybe do a couple more.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:22.440
So then if I do one like
that, it's glued there,

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.330
and there, and there.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:28.550
That guy gets there,
and there and there.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.139
And when glue that-- when
you push that together

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:38.536
and then take it
apart, you've got

00:34:38.536 --> 00:34:39.827
something that looks like this.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:47.110
So say I call that one,
two, three, and four.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.239
Then this would be 2 and 3.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.739
OK, so this thing here is that.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.530
Where it's not glued,
you get them doing that.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:57.310
And then it's glued
again down here.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.430
And so you get this
kind of pattern.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.390
And one of the things
about these honeycombs

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:06.500
that are made by the expansion
process is these inclined walls

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.500
have a thickness t.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.850
And because there's
two sheets up here,

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.850
the vertical walls
have a thickness 2t.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:19.130
So that's typically what you
see in the commercial honeycombs

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.110
that are made by this way.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:29.390
And this process is used
for aluminum honeycombs,

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:36.110
for paper resin honeycombs,
for Kevlar honeycombs.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:45.360
And I'll just say note that the
inclined walls have a thickness

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.285
t, and the vertical
walls are 2t.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.190
So that's the expansion process.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.920
And the process that's
commonly used for honeycombs

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.621
is called a corrugation process.

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:13.700
And for the corrugation
process, it's

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.490
just like the lower
schematic here shows.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.860
You take a flat sheet.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.700
So you've got a roll
of a flat sheet.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.600
And you've got some rollers
that have the right shape

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.490
to give you the corrugated
profile that you want.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.340
You pass the sheet
through the rolls

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.490
and you get
individual sheets out.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.901
And each sheet is kind
of a half hexagon.

00:36:33.901 --> 00:36:35.400
And then you put
the sheets together

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.560
and that forms
the whole hexagon.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.200
So you have a flat
sheet that's fed

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.902
through a shaped wheel to
form half hexagonal sheets,

00:36:42.902 --> 00:36:44.110
which you then bond together.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.410
And it's the same kind of
thing that the inclined

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.090
walls have thickness t
and the vertical walls

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.304
have thickness 2t.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.880
And this corrugation
process, you

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.730
can only really
use it in materials

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.510
that you can deform
a fairly large amount

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.890
to get the corrugations.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.930
So typically, this
is for metals.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:38:01.170
And aluminum is probably
the most common metal

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:02.213
that this is used for.

00:38:06.095 --> 00:38:08.720
AUDIENCE: How are the corrugated
sheets attached to each other?

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.190
LORNA GIBSON: I think they're
just bonded with epoxy.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.250
Yeah, so obviously if you wanted
to use it for high temperature

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:17.100
performance-- you know,
all of these things

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.796
are bonded with some sort of
epoxy or some sort of resin.

00:38:19.796 --> 00:38:21.170
So there's an
issue if you wanted

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.960
to use it higher temperatures.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.890
So another process that's used
to make ceramic honeycombs

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.160
is an extrusion process.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.260
And you just take
a ceramic slurry

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.520
and you pass it through a die.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.700
And you can make a ceramic
honeycomb by doing that.

00:39:03.884 --> 00:39:05.300
And I believe
that's how they make

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.550
the ceramic honeycombs
I passed around,

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.410
the catalytic converter ones.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:13.860
Other techniques involve
rapid prototyping.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.220
You can 3-D print honeycombs.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.950
And Jennifer Lewis has a
project on 3-D printing

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:20.804
of honeycombs up at Harvard.

00:39:20.804 --> 00:39:22.970
And one of the interesting
things they're looking at

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.650
is not just printing with an
ink, but printing with a fiber

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:26.510
reinforced ink.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.780
So they're making cell
walls of the honeycomb that

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.160
are fiber reinforced.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.980
And one of the tricks is trying
to orient the fibers in the way

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.810
that you want them
to be oriented.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.570
So there's rapid prototyping
techniques as well.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.240
You can use also
selective laser centering.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:07.750
Let's call it selective
laser scanning.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.910
So you can have a
photosensitive polymer

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:14.350
and use a laser to cure that
and build up a honeycomb type

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.430
structure.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:19.494
And you can also cast
honeycomb structures.

00:40:19.494 --> 00:40:21.660
So those rubber honeycombs
that I pass around, those

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.350
are made by casting.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.360
You take a liquid silicone
rubber and you add a hardener

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.610
and you pour it into a mold.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:26.874
Another kind of interesting way
that people have made-- well

00:41:26.874 --> 00:41:28.540
here's another example
of the honeycombs

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.940
that are 3-D printed.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.070
And this is an example
of-- or a couple

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:36.500
of examples of looking
at a bio carbon template.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.110
So what that means is
that these materials are

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:42.240
based on the wood, but none
of them are actually wood.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.577
So what they do is they take
wood, like they take pine,

00:41:45.577 --> 00:41:46.910
or they take beech or something.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.550
They take some kind of
wood and they carbonize it.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.490
So that they do the
same processes as

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.100
used for making carbon fibers.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.450
So you put the wood in
an inert atmosphere.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.140
And you pyrolyze it.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.940
You heat it up to I
think 800 degrees C.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.580
And all you're left
with is the carbon.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.017
And it preserves the structure.

00:42:06.017 --> 00:42:07.350
And you replicate the structure.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.802
You just get the same structure.

00:42:08.802 --> 00:42:09.760
There's some shrinkage.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.640
The shrinkage is about 30%.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.250
But you get the same
structure as the wood.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:17.240
So this material up here
is actually all carbon.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.640
It's just replicating
the wood that was used,

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.180
the pine that was used.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.700
An then what people
have been doing

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.110
is using that carbon structure
and then infiltrating

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.070
that with gaseous silicon.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.920
And they form silicon carbide.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.540
So these structures down
here are all silicon carbide

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.990
replicas of wood.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.100
And they're thinking about
using that for things

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.840
like filters for
high temperatures

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.584
or for catalyst carriers.

00:42:46.584 --> 00:42:48.000
And one of the
attractive features

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.720
is wood has fairly small cells.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.370
The cells around
50 microns across.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.310
And so you get a
large surface area.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.730
And this is a
similar thing here.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.407
These two are the
carbon template.

00:42:58.407 --> 00:43:00.490
And here they've used
silicon and they've actually

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:01.560
filled in the voids.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.740
And so they've got
silicon carbide

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.500
where the cell walls used to be.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.587
And they've got silicon
where the void used to be.

00:43:08.587 --> 00:43:10.170
So people are playing
around with this

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.790
is another way of making a
honeycomb type of structure.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.610
And they use other kinds of
plants besides wood as well.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.030
But that's the kind
of general idea.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.370
So the idea is that wood has
a honeycomb like structure.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.730
And the cells are fairly small.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:40.680
the cells are in the order of
50 microns sort of in diameter

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.390
and maybe a few
millimeters long.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.906
And this bio carbon template
replicates the wood structure.

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:14.100
So the wood is pyrolized
at 800 degrees C

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.421
in an inert atmosphere.

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.650
So say an inert gas.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.230
And that gives you the
bio carbon template.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:38.480
And you maintain the
structure, although there's

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.385
some shrinkage.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:45:15.099
structures

00:45:15.099 --> 00:45:17.640
And then this carbon structure
can then be further processed.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.950
So for example, you
can infiltrate it

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:34.405
with a gaseous silicon.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.935
And you end up with a
silicon carbide wood replica.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.490
So possible applications are
things like high temperature

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:09.058
filters, or catalyst carriers.

00:46:34.638 --> 00:46:36.497
I think that's it
on the honeycombs.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.955
Are we good with all
sorts of methods?

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.179
And my little talk
here on processing

00:46:48.179 --> 00:46:49.470
is certainly not comprehensive.

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:52.430
I'm sure there's other
ways people have developed.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:53.568
These are some main ways.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.880
All right then, I want to
talk about foams as well.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.280
People have developed
different types of processes

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.140
for different types of solids,
so polymers, and metals,

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.140
and ceramics.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.870
So I just go through each class
of solid and talk about that.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.350
So the idea with
polymer foams is

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.700
that you want to
introduce gas bubbles

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:17.370
into either a liquid
monomer or a hot polymer.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.620
And then you want
the bubbles to grow.

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.020
And then you want to
stabilize them and solidify it

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:26.239
by other cross linking or
by cooling the hot polymer.

00:48:26.239 --> 00:48:28.030
So there's a variety
of ways of doing that,

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.700
but let me just put that down.

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:19.690
So there's a few ways to
get the bubbles in there

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.620
in the first place.

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.340
One, is just by
mechanical stirring.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.304
So if you've ever
made meringue, you

00:49:25.304 --> 00:49:26.970
know what that is,
you just take a whisk

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:29.260
and you beat egg
whites and bubbles.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.860
The air will get enveloped
in the egg whites.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.750
They also do that with polymers.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.720
Or you can use a blowing agent.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.740
And there's several
varieties of blowing agents.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.880
So the blowing
agents are divided

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.280
into physical and
chemical blowing agents.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.440
And the physical ones,
they force the gas

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.490
into solution under
high pressure,

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:19.900
and then you reduce
the pressure,

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:23.010
and the gas bundles expand.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.600
So you can use physical
blowing agents.

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:18.290
Or you can introduce
liquids that, if you're

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:21.450
using a hot polymer, that at the
temperature of the hot polymer,

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:22.290
they form a gas.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:24.684
So that the liquid
just turns into a gas.

00:51:24.684 --> 00:51:26.100
And that would
form vapor bubbles.

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:02.806
And then the chemical
blowing agents.

00:52:02.806 --> 00:52:04.930
There's a couple of different
ways that those work.

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.000
You can either use
chemical blowing agents

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.920
where you have two parts that
react together to form a gas.

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.950
And so that gas
then blows the foam.

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:19.580
Or you can have a
chemical blowing

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.040
agent that reacts
with the polymer

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.100
to form a gas and
that blows the foam.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.360
So either way.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.780
And you can have them
decompose on heating.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:28.890
So the same kind of thing.

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:31.430
Evolved the gas when it
gets into the hot polymer.

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:07.960
So there's these different
ways of blowing the foams.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.110
And there's many, many different
types of these blowing agents.

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.920
But, these are kind of
the general techniques.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.200
And whether or not the foam
forms an open cell or a closed

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.080
cell structure depends
on the rheology

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.580
of the polymers, so
the viscosity of it,

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.980
and also the surface tension.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:54.620
Another way to make a
foam is to make something

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.065
called a syntactic foam.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:01.590
A syntactic foam
is made by taking

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:04.350
thin walled hollow
spheres and then using,

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:06.950
say a resin, like an epoxy
resin, to bond them together.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:09.210
So you end up with
something that's porous.

00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:11.779
And you've got the void
from the hollow sphere,

00:54:11.779 --> 00:54:13.320
but you don't foam
it in the same way

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.460
that you blow bubbles
through it in some way.

00:55:17.302 --> 00:55:18.760
One other thing
about polymer foams

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.110
is they sometimes have
a skin on the surface.

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:23.430
So when you blow them,
say you've got a mold,

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.020
there will be a skin that
forms against the mold,

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:29.230
and sometimes the process
is designed in a way

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:31.120
that the skin is
thick enough that it

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.160
acts like a skin in
a sandwich panel.

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.530
So they control the mold in
a way and the blowing process

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.794
so that they get a foam in
the middle and thicker skins

00:55:39.794 --> 00:55:41.210
on the top and the
bottom surface.

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:42.460
And that forms a sandwich panel.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.880
Those are called
structural foams.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.050
Let's see.

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:50.030
So I think what I'm going to
do next is the next section's

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:50.850
on metal foams.

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:52.347
And I've got a few
slides on that.

00:56:52.347 --> 00:56:54.430
So I think I'm going to
run through the schematics

00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:55.320
and just talk about it.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.980
But, I'll put the notes
on the board next time.

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.500
And there is one thing I
forgot to do at the beginning.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.302
I like to tell you
a little about me.

00:57:00.302 --> 00:57:01.510
And I want to hear about you.

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:03.900
So I wanted to leave a
few minutes for that.

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.030
So let me just wait
until people are

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:07.380
finished writing stuff down.

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.426
And I'll go through
these in a few minutes,

00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:11.550
and then we'll through it
in more detail next time.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:14.045
And I'll write notes down.

00:57:14.045 --> 00:57:14.545
OK?

00:57:14.545 --> 00:57:16.930
Are we good?

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:21.622
So there's a whole variety of
ways of making foamed metals.

00:57:21.622 --> 00:57:23.580
And most of them have
been focused on aluminum.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:27.800
But you could in theory do them
with other types of metals.

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.440
So this was one of
the first processes

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.610
and it just involved
taking a molten aluminum,

00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:34.420
so here's the aluminum
down here in a crucible.

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:37.390
They added silicon
carbide powder to it

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:39.350
and then they just
used a stirring paddle,

00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:43.120
like they just stirred it up
and mixed gas in that way.

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.615
And they found that they
got bubbles that rose up.

00:57:45.615 --> 00:57:46.990
And then they used
conveyor belts

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:49.076
to just kind of
pull the foam off.

00:57:49.076 --> 00:57:50.700
And the thing about
the silicon carbide

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.860
was that if you
didn't have that,

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.610
then the bubbles
wouldn't be stable enough

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.380
that you could do this.

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:56.921
The bubbles would
collapse before you

00:57:56.921 --> 00:57:58.290
got to be able to pull them up.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:02.650
But the silicon carbide I think
makes the aluminum melt more

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:05.920
viscous and it helps prevent
sort of drainage and collapse

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.000
of the bubbles.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.320
And so that's one way.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.750
And there's a type
of foam called Cymat,

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:12.510
and this is an example
of the foam that's

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:13.900
made with that process.

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.210
Maybe I'll bring it next time
and we can pass it around.

00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:21.810
Another method is to use a metal
powder and titanium hydride

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:22.680
powder.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.460
Then you can consolidate that.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.000
So here's-- it's hard
to see the writing,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.400
but this is a aluminum powder.

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.150
This would be the
titanium hydride powder.

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:32.600
You mix them together and
then you compact them.

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.190
You press them together.

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:37.180
And the titanium hydride
decomposes and forms

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.350
the hydrogen gas
at a temperature

00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:41.080
at which the aluminum
is not really

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.460
quite molten but it's kind of
viscous-y, kind of softening.

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:48.850
And so when the aluminum is
soft like that and the titanium

00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:51.910
hydride decomposes and
forms the hydrogen gas,

00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:54.190
you get a foam
from that process.

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:56.830
And I think, somewhere,
yeah, this foam here

00:58:56.830 --> 00:59:00.260
I think was made
by that process.

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.730
Then in a similar thing, you
can just put titanium hydride

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:07.080
powder into molten aluminum,
and again the titanium hydride

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:11.050
powder evolves the hydrogen
gas and you get foamed aluminum

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:12.370
from that.

00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:15.550
And I think this foam here
was made with that process.

00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:18.100
They all look kind of similar.

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.800
Another method is by replicating
an open cell polymer foam.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.860
So I think I passed an open
cell polymer foam around.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:28.440
And that's made by taking an
open celled-- an open cell

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.330
aluminum foam-- it's made by
taking an open cell polymer

00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:34.120
foam, you fill up all
the voids with sand.

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.230
You then burn off the
polymer, but now you've

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:40.090
got sand in all the sort of
places where there were voids.

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.840
And then you infiltrate
molten metal into that.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.290
And then you get
rid of the sand.

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:46.110
And then you're left
with an aluminum

00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:49.670
foam that replicates the polymer
that you started off with.

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:52.170
So this replication technique.

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:55.110
There's a vapor
deposition technique.

00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:57.790
And this was developed by
Inco to make nickel foams.

00:59:57.790 --> 00:59:59.680
So they take again an
open cell polymer foam,

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:05.000
that's kind of this thing here
is, and they infiltrate into it

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.780
nickel CO4.

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:10.420
The only teeny detail that's
a problem with this process

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:13.280
is that happens to
be highly toxic.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.010
So they put this
gas through here.

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:19.070
And then they get nickel
depositing on the polymer

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.450
and they burn the polymer
out and they center it.

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:23.390
So it is possible to do this.

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:24.310
They have done this.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:27.060
But it's not that
practical because

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.520
of the toxicity of the gas.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.810
Now another method is something
called entrapped gas expansion.

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:37.940
And here, what you do is you
take a can, like a metal can.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.360
This one's titanium,
a titanium alloy.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.310
And then you put a
titanium powder in here.

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:44.980
You evacuate the can.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.590
So the can has a little valve
on it, so you can evacuate it.

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:49.640
And then you backfill
it with argon gas

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.420
and you pressurize
the argon gas.

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.050
So you've got a powder with
sort of pressurized gas

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.720
inside of a can.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.840
And then you hot
isostatically press it.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.040
So you heat it up and
you press it uniformly

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.520
in all three directions.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.700
And you compact it.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.390
And then, if you
want you can roll it.

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:06.730
Sometimes people
roll it because they

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:07.980
want to make sandwich
panels, and they

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.354
want to have a
certain thickness,

01:01:09.354 --> 01:01:11.447
and they want to have
faces on the panel.

01:01:11.447 --> 01:01:12.530
But then you heat that up.

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:14.810
And as you heat it up,
the gas evolves again.

01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:17.890
And the thing expands and
you get a foam that way.

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:20.210
So that's another method.

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.760
Another method is by
making hollow spheres

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.150
and then bonding the
spheres together.

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:27.690
And in this process-- this
was developed at Georgia Tech.

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:29.940
They used the titanium
hydride again.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.120
They made a slurry of
the titanium hydride

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.330
in an organic
binder in a solvent.

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:36.250
And then they had a
little kind of needle

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:37.550
that they injected gas.

01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:42.470
And so they had this slurry
and they were blowing gas

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.860
through this needle and they got
hollow spheres of the titanium

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.817
hydride.

01:01:46.817 --> 01:01:49.400
And then they heated it up, and
again evolved the hydrogen gas

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:49.570
off.

01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:51.570
But now they're just left
with titanium spheres.

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:54.220
And then they bonded
the spheres together.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.550
And these aren't titanium.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.770
This is an iron
chromium, like it's not

01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:59.480
quite a stainless steel.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.740
But this is the same thing.

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.460
I can pass that
around next time too.

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:04.870
Those are the little
beads that they make.

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:07.950
And then there's also
fugitive phase technique.

01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:11.490
So you can take say salt
particles, put them in a mold

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:14.220
and pour a liquid
metal into that,

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.810
and then, leach the salt away.

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:20.777
And I think that's it
for the metal foams.

01:02:20.777 --> 01:02:22.610
So I think I'm going
to stop there for today

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:23.830
in terms of the lecture.

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:25.280
I'll go over that
again next time.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.710
And I'll write
stuff on the board.

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.230
But I wanted to tell
you a bit about me.

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:29.688
So the people in
3032, they already

01:02:29.688 --> 01:02:31.970
know me because they
had me in the fall.

01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:33.850
But I see some unfamiliar faces.

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.850
So I thought I would tell
you a little about me.

01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:41.230
So I grew up in Niagara Falls
in Canada, big power station.

01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:43.890
Lots of big civil engineering
works in Niagara Falls.

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.340
And my father worked at
an engineering company

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.780
that specialized in the
design of hydroelectric power

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:49.330
stations.

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:51.663
It was founded by the guy who
designed the Niagara Falls

01:02:51.663 --> 01:02:52.490
power station.

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:56.210
And then I went to
university in Toronto.

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:58.990
And I did a degree in civil
engineering in Toronto.

01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:01.494
And then when I finished my
degree in civil engineering,

01:03:01.494 --> 01:03:03.410
I wasn't really sure
what I wanted to do next.

01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:05.710
And I applied for some jobs, and
I applied to graduate school.

01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:06.640
I applied to MIT.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.270
And I didn't get in-- ouch.

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:11.730
But I did OK, it turns out.

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:13.950
And I ended up-- I
had an advisor when

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.330
I was in Toronto who had taken
a sabbatical in Cambridge,

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:16.830
England.

01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:20.180
And he said he thought I might
enjoy Cambridge, England.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.040
And I ended up going
to Cambridge, England

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.350
to doing my PhD there.

01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:26.855
And I worked on the
cellular solids for my PhD.

01:03:26.855 --> 01:03:28.480
And it was a nice
combination because I

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.800
was interested in material
behavior and mechanics,

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.192
but I had a background in
me in civil engineering.

01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:35.400
And these are just like
civil engineering structures,

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.530
but they're on a little
teeny weeny scale,

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:39.770
not like big buildings
or bridges or something,

01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:41.880
like little teeny things.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.490
And really all of
this has come out

01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:47.240
of doing that PhD in Cambridge.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.090
But when I was there,
I never even thought

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:50.250
about being an academic.

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:53.220
And I never applied
for any academic jobs.

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.970
I didn't think I wanted
to be an academic.

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:58.890
And I went and got a job in
Calgary in the oil business.

01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:00.760
And I was working at
a consulting firm that

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.270
did work for the oil business.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.990
I hated it.

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.730
I just hated it.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:04.850
It was like I had a boss.

01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:06.810
I hated having this boss.

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.789
And, you know, the projects
were too short term.

01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:11.830
The winter in Calgary--
if you think this is bad,

01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:13.670
you've seen nothing.

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:15.120
Like less snow, but cold.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.140
I mean like 30, 40
below, everyday, cold.

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.400
Real cold.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.010
So I stayed there one winter.

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:22.510
And somewhere along
the way there, I

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:25.600
decided maybe the academic
job thing would be good.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.835
And I just sent my CV out to a
bunch of Canadian universities.

01:04:28.835 --> 01:04:31.210
And I ended up getting a job
at the University of British

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:32.550
Columbia in Vancouver.

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:34.390
And I lived in
Vancouver for two years.

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:35.630
And I probably would
have stayed there,

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:37.230
except there was a
gigantic recession,

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:39.580
and it was all very depressing,
and there was no money.

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.650
And that the
universities in Canada

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:43.900
are almost all run by the
provincial governments.

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.233
And the government had no money.

01:04:45.233 --> 01:04:47.109
It was all, you
know, frustrating.

01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:48.900
And I sort of thought,
oh, I'll look around

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.700
and see what else I can get.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.270
And I answered a little ad
in Civil Engineering Magazine

01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:53.600
for a job at MIT.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.695
And I got the job at MIT.

01:04:54.695 --> 01:04:56.570
And I was in the civil
engineering department

01:04:56.570 --> 01:04:57.580
for about 12 years.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.700
And then I moved over to
the materials department.

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.658
Because my work started
off on sort of sandwich

01:05:01.658 --> 01:05:02.990
panels and structural things.

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:05.000
And then it kind of became
more biomedical stuff

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.822
and had less and less
to do with civil.

01:05:06.822 --> 01:05:09.030
And I've been in the materials
department since then.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.071
And this is kind of what
I do, this kind of work.

01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:13.900
So that's kind of my
little five minute story.
