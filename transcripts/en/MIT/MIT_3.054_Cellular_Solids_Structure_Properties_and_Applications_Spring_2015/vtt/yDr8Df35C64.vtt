00:00:27.384 --> 00:00:28.800
LORNA GIBSON: So
last time we were

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.710
talking about trabecular bone
and that it's this porous kind

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.390
of foam-like type of bone.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.770
And we talked a little
bit about the modeling.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.570
And I think I got
as far as starting

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.700
to talk about osteoporosis.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.220
And I wanted to talk today about
how we can model osteoporosis

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.900
using those voronoi
honeycombs that we

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.490
talked about a while
ago when we were

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.500
talking about the structure.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.920
So Bruno has a project on
trabecular bone for the class.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.010
And he needed bone samples.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.540
And so we talked about
different kind of bone samples

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.760
we could get.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.440
And the thing is if you
get human bone-- well,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.580
there's all sorts of
issues about just handling

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.360
human bone and permissions,
and it's complicated.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.050
So that was too complicated.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.526
We've used bovine bone before.

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:11.900
You just go to
the slaughterhouse

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.420
and get bovine bone.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.170
But one of the things
with trabecular bone

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.567
is because it grows in response
to loads, the geometry of it

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.150
can be different,
sort of architecture

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.140
can vary from one spot
in the bone to another.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.350
And I have a colleague
who started doing tests

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.850
on whale bones,
just because it's

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.730
a way of getting
nice, uniform bone.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.240
So I was on a Ph.D. Committee a
few years ago for a student who

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.840
was in the Woods Hole program.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.087
She was at MIT, but was
doing Woods Hole thing.

00:01:39.087 --> 00:01:41.670
And I don't know if you've heard
of the Atlantic right whales,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.003
the North Atlantic right whales.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:44.090
They're endangered.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.820
There's about 500 of
them left in the world.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.330
And they migrate between like
typically the Bay of Fundy

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.180
and off the Florida coast.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.130
So they go up and
down the coast.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.710
And they sometimes
get hit by ships.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.460
And then bones break
and that kills them.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.535
And her study was on ship
impacts on right whales.

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:06.410
And so I got to know
people at Woods Hole who

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.640
worked on whales.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.370
So Bruno, I called up
my friend at Woods Hole.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.330
And the Woods Hole guy
didn't have any bones.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.562
But he put me in
touch with somebody

00:02:14.562 --> 00:02:16.270
at the Mass Fish and
Wildlife Department.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.540
And he had a couple
of whale vertebrae

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.060
that he was willing to give up.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.750
So I got one of them for you.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.090
So here it is.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.110
So I went out to the Mass
Fish and Wildlife yesterday.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.211
And they produced
this bone for me.

00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:32.460
I could either pass it around.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.210
It's not too heavy.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.332
Or you could come up
and look afterwards.

00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:39.290
Shall I pass it around?

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.100
Or do you want
came up afterwards?

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.940
Maybe come up-- pass it?

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.060
OK.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.140
So one of the things
is our like vertebrae,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.467
there's these things
that stick up like this.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.300
There's one that's
missing off of this bone.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.008
There should have been
one down here too.

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:53.510
But this is sort
of what's called

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.860
the body of the vertebrae.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.320
And in human vertebrae
it's about that big.

00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:01.710
But it's the same kind
of general structure.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.310
There's these kind of
bony plates that come off.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.060
And the body is almost
all trabecular bone.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.110
So you can see on this side,
this is a growth plate here.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.770
But on this side,
there normally would

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.529
have been a thin shell
of the cortical bone.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.070
And when I pass it around, if
you look up at this point here,

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.790
you can see there's just
a little bit of that left.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.260
But it's kind of
gotten worn out.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.810
And the rest of
this, if you look,

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.680
you can see it's
the trabecular bone.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.060
And you can see
it's pretty uniform,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.290
which is why I thought this
might be good for your tests.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.000
So I thought you should get
in touch with Mike Tarkanian.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.020
And I talked to him a
little bit about cutting it

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.306
with a water jet cutter.

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:40.180
So I think we could use
the water jet cutter.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.264
And I think I emailed you.

00:03:41.264 --> 00:03:42.804
If you could cut it
in half, I'd like

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:44.640
to have some pictures
of it cut in half.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.662
And he's got a diamond
corer, cylindrical corer.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:51.620
So you could make little
cylindrical specimens.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.580
And I know if you want to do
compression tests or beams.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.110
AUDIENCE: Well, I was planning
to do compression tests.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.818
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah,
so you could probably

00:03:56.818 --> 00:04:01.430
use some kind of a bands or
something to cut them up.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.800
So, and this is where the
spinal column goes through

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.600
in the whale.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.612
So there you have it.

00:04:08.612 --> 00:04:10.820
Anybody want to ask me
anything about the whale bone?

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.495
OK, so let me pass that around.

00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:14.870
And I guess I have to tell
you a couple of other stories.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.950
So while I was there, they
have a brand new building.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.040
And it's all got solar
panels and geothermal heat.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.390
And it's all very groovy.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.275
And the guy who I was
talking to about the bone,

00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:25.400
he wanted to give me a
little tour of the building.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.400
And he said, oh, you've
got to see your freezer.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.200
OK, so the freezer.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.550
So he opens the freezer door.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.050
The freezer's like a room.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.160
And there's like a bear.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.630
I'm serious, like a
bear on the floor,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.580
like a dead bear on the
floor of the freezer.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.990
And he said it was like a
two-year-old bear that had,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.060
I guess, just come out of
hibernation a couple weeks ago.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.040
I think it had gotten hit
by a car or something.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.623
And somebody must
have called them up.

00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:45.410
And they have it.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.600
So they had this bear.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.060
They had like several deer.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.970
They had a coyote.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.664
They had like boxes full
of all kinds of animals.

00:04:51.664 --> 00:04:53.330
So anyway it was kind
interesting to see

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.160
all these animals there.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.880
And you know what he
said about the deer?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.945
He said, normally deer in
Massachusetts don't starve.

00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:02.820
Like if you live in the
suburbs, you actually

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.270
have a problem with deer
eating your vegetable garden

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.030
because there's deer
all over the place.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.850
But he said, this winter, you
know how much snow we've had

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.480
and how cold it's been?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.560
He said, deer have been
starving this winter.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.630
And I think a couple
of the deer they'd had

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.960
had actually starved to death.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.001
And people had called up.

00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:17.579
And they had come and kind
of collected the carcasses.

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:19.120
So anyway that was
my little trip out

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.410
to Mass Fish and
Wildlife yesterday.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.690
OK, so let's go back to
talking about the bone.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.490
And I think last time we kind
of left off more or less here.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.740
So this was a slide of what
osteoporosis looks like.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.780
And you can see the bone
loss is a combination

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.840
of thinning of the struts
and resorption of the struts.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.090
And we wanted to
try to model this,

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.990
sort of an engineering sense.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.600
And the way we did that is we
used our voronoi honeycombs.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.110
So the bone has an
irregular structure.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.030
And we wanted to look and see
if we could model something that

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.320
had an irregular structure.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.114
So we used the
voronoi honeycomb.

00:05:56.114 --> 00:05:57.530
And if you remember
when we talked

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.980
about the structure
of cellular materials

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.750
earlier on in the
course, we said

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.510
that these are generated by
putting down random seed points

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.050
and then drawing the
perpendicular bisectors.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.580
And if you have a constraint
that the seed points can't

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.580
be closer than some
exclusion distance,

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.330
then you get structure
where you have

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.280
cells that are not all exactly
the same size, but roughly

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.205
the same size.

00:06:20.205 --> 00:06:21.330
So that's what we did here.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.032
We got this structure here.

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:24.740
And I had a graduate
student, Matt Silva,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.780
who did a lot of these studies.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.410
And then he used
this and analyzed it

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.420
using finite element analysis.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.360
So the first thing he did was
he calculated the elastic moduli

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.650
of the structure.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.220
So he applied loads.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.880
We calculated deformations.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.340
Figured out elastic moduli.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.590
And so this plot here
shows a comparison

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.760
between the analytical
equations that we derived

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.680
at the first part of
the course and what

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.420
he calculated for these
voronoi honeycombs

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.890
for the final element analysis.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.250
So here's Young's modulus
down here, for example.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.940
In the closed form,
the line, that's

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.580
just the analytical
equation we had originally.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.880
And the little dashed line
is his finite element.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.960
Here's the Shear
modulus down here.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.712
And here's the
possum's ratio up here.

00:07:11.712 --> 00:07:13.670
So you can see, there's
a pretty good agreement

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.950
between these two things here.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.720
So let me write some
of this on the board.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.600
And then I can keep
going after that.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.410
So for the 2D voronoi honeycomb,
we have the random seed points.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.685
And we used the
perpendicular bisectors.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.350
And we used a minimum separation
distance between the points.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.266
So we generated the structure.

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:18.015
And then we did a
finite element analysis.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.600
And from that, we
calculated the modulus.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.600
And what we found was
the finite element

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.200
analysis results were pretty
close to our closed form

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.253
analytical model.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.730
And if we think
about the modulus,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.780
the modulus is the
average stiffness

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.510
over the whole honeycomb.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.142
And when we look at
the strengths next,

00:09:13.142 --> 00:09:14.600
the strength is
going to be related

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.020
to the weakest few struts.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.310
And we're going to find
that the strength doesn't

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.440
work quite the same way.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.520
So first, we got the modulus.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.599
That's sort of the simplest
thing to calculate.

00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:22.390
And then after that,
we wanted to calculate

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.370
the compressive strength.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.730
So we did a similar thing.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.050
We set up the voronoi honeycomb
in the finite element analysis.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.710
We had a few more elements
along the length of each strut.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.200
And then we modeled
the elastic buckling

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.850
and the plastic
failure behavior.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.530
And we looked at honeycombs
that had different densities.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.770
And the lowest densities
failed by buckling.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.360
And the higher densities failed
by a sort of plastic yielding.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.300
And we assumed that the cell
walls were elastic, perfectly

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.010
plastic.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.490
Remember we said if we have
a material where-- this

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.720
is for the solids-- so say
this is the stress in the solid

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.030
and that's the
strain in the solid.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.060
If it behaves like that, we
say that's elastic, perfectly

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.560
plastic.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.240
So we modeled the walls as
elastic, perfectly plastic.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.260
And we made the ratio
of the solid modulus

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.810
to the yield strength
similar to what it would be

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.120
for bone, which is about 0.01.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.220
And for that particular
value, the transition

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.710
between the elastic buckling
and the plastic yielding failure

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.604
was at a relative
density of about 0.035.

00:11:24.604 --> 00:11:26.520
So then what we did was
we analyzed structures

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.630
that were a little lower
than that were equal to that

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.710
and then a little
higher than that.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.251
So we would try and
see what happened

00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:32.720
with these different
failure modes.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.080
And then we found that if we
look at the compressive stress

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.200
strain curve, this model here
had a relative density of 15%.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.420
And the transition occurred at
a relative density about 3.5%.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.040
So this one here failed
by a plastic failure.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.290
You can see, if we
unload it, there's

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.330
some plastic deformation.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.020
We get a little
strange softening here,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.710
which is kind of characteristic
of the plastic failure.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.180
When we look at the overall
deformation of the honeycomb,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.920
we saw local kind
of failure, like we

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.449
do in aluminum honeycombs.

00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:06.990
So that was the kind
of stress strain

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.300
curve for a relatively
dense honeycomb that

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.600
failed by yielding.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.060
And then this is one for
a much lower density.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.670
This is now point 1.5%.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.440
And this one fails
by elastic buckling.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.070
And if we load it
up and unload it,

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.160
we recover most of
the deformation.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.440
Barry, do you think you
could make that stop?

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.136
Yeah.

00:12:32.136 --> 00:12:34.970
AUDIENCE: There's a
chance it could be--

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.390
LORNA GIBSON: Below.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.850
Just because we're recording it.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.230
It just doesn't seem very good.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.110
OK, so what we did was we
made five different voronoi

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.640
honeycomb.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.300
So we had five sets
of seed points.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.150
And we had five slightly
different geometries.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.690
And then we averaged
the results of those.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.880
So if we make that
calculation, this

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.160
is the strength of the
voronoi honeycomb here divided

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.260
by the strength of the periodic
regular hexagonal honeycomb.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.750
And this was plotted
against relative density.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.980
And you can see the strengths
for the voronoi structure are

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.580
a little bit lower than for
the regular periodic hexagonal

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.520
honeycomb.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.090
And they reach a minimum here.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.900
And the minimum's around
about 0.05 relative density.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.720
So this was the 1.5.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.280
That was a 3.5.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.210
That's 5% and 15%.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:30.967
AUDIENCE: Why is there like
a wide gap between 0.05 and--

00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:32.550
LORNA GIBSON: Well,
I think because we

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.112
felt-- I think this one failed
by some combination of-- there

00:13:35.112 --> 00:13:37.320
was a limit to how many of
these we were going to do.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.140
And this is what we chose to do.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.640
We wanted one that
we knew was going

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.840
to fail by plastic yielding.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.670
And that was this one.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.850
And we wanted one that
we knew it was going

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.016
to fail by elastic buckling.

00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:46.800
And we wanted a
couple in between.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.830
So we didn't do--
I guess we were

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.040
lazy is the real reason there's
not another point in the middle

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.540
there.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.194
AUDIENCE: It just seems like
there might be a variable--

00:13:55.194 --> 00:13:57.860
LORNA GIBSON: You think it might
go [CAREENING NOISE] like that.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.960
Except there's a physical
reason why this happens.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.177
And I'm going to get
to that in a minute.

00:14:02.177 --> 00:14:03.760
So let me I'll finish
explaining this,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.080
and then I'll put the
notes on the board.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.409
So first of all,
the strength is less

00:14:09.409 --> 00:14:10.950
than the regular
hexagonal honeycomb.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.575
And then there's also
this minimum here

00:14:12.575 --> 00:14:15.580
around about 5% density.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.650
And I think the reason that
the strength is not the same

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.700
as in the voronoi in
the periodic honeycomb

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.140
is because if you look at
the distribution of strains--

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.340
or you can think of the
distribution of stresses--

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.340
so these were the normal strains
at the nodes in the honeycombs.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.464
And the distribution here is
for the voronoi honeycomb.

00:14:34.464 --> 00:14:35.880
So the voronoi
honeycomb, you have

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.260
lots of members of
different lengths.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.690
There are different
orientations.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.880
And so there's some distribution
of stresses and strains

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.090
in each member.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.950
And that gives you
the distribution.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:50.040
In the regular
hexagonal honeycomb,

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.670
if you look at just
the nodes, there's

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.500
really just the vertical member,
which has a certain strain.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.083
And all the vertical
members are going

00:14:57.083 --> 00:14:58.680
to have the same
strain at the nodes.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.010
And then the obliques members,
if you just look at the nodes,

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.840
there's just going to
be a maximum tension

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.110
and a maximum
compression at the nodes.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.910
Because there's a unit
cell and it repeats,

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.625
all the oblique ones are
going to have the same maximum

00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:11.820
and the same minimum.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.650
So the dashed lines here are
for the regular hexagonal

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:15.420
honeycomb.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.650
So the thing to observe
here is that the voronoi has

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.250
some strains and
correspondingly some

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.950
stresses that are
outside the range

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.000
of the regular
periodic honeycomb.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.510
And so if there's parts of it
that are seeing higher strains

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.370
and higher stresses, it's
going to fail at a lower load.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.162
So I think it's
this distribution

00:15:34.162 --> 00:15:35.870
because you've got
this random structure,

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.190
and you've got different lengths
and different orientations

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.340
of the members.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.950
So that's one reason why
these strengths are less

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.490
than the periodic structure.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.016
I think there's a
minimum here, because-- I

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.390
think before the
test I mentioned

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.300
there's some interaction between
elastic buckling and plastic

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.190
yielding.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.310
And when you get
that interaction,

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.320
that also reduces the strength.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.220
And so there's a
minimum near where

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.690
the crossover is between
the elastic buckling

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.670
and the plastic yielding.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.070
So let me write some notes
of the compressive strength.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:32.680
So we'll say the cell wall--
so the cell wall elastic,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.380
perfectly plastic.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.100
And the yield strength relative
to the modulus for the solid

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:44.290
was 0.1, which is pretty
much what it is for bone.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:52.210
And we assumed that the possum's
ratio of the solid was 0.3.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:59.830
And for this value
of sigma Ys over Es,

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:10.430
the transition between elastic
buckling and plastic yielding

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.060
is at about 3.5%
relative density.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.890
So then we made
models with densities

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.730
that were a little bit less
than that and a little bit more

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.348
than that.

00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:06.860
And then the strengths
we got from the voronoi

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.221
were between about
0.6 and 0.8 times

00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:11.470
what we got from the periodic.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.430
So then what we looked at
were these maximum strains

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:32.870
of the nodes.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.230
And we found that because
the voronoi honeycomb

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.780
had a much broader distribution
of those strains, that

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.960
led to the lower strengths.

00:21:22.957 --> 00:21:24.540
And then we found
the minimum strength

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.900
was at a density of about 5%.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.640
And if you think just
about a pin ended column,

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.000
and you make a plot
of the strength--

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.400
so I'm just going
to say the strength

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.420
of that columm-- against
l/r, the slenderness ratio.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.336
So say it's a cylinder,
l would be the length.

00:22:02.336 --> 00:22:04.540
r would be the radius.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.014
If you just had
Euler buckling, you

00:22:07.014 --> 00:22:08.430
get a curve that
looked like that.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:15.410
The Euler buckling load is pi
squared EI over l. squared.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.630
So I goes as r to the 4th.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.131
And if we get the
stress, then it's

00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:22.255
going to be that divided
by the area of the column.

00:22:22.255 --> 00:22:27.400
So it's pi squared
E. Moment of inertia

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.180
is pi r to the 4th
over 4 l squared.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.620
And the area is pi r squared.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.970
So it goes is as r over l
squared, or 1 over l over r

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:43.830
squared.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.330
So this would be
the Euler buckling.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.455
So that's elastic buckling.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.900
But at some point, the
column is going to yield.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.310
If I make it really,
really short, then it's

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.340
going to yield
before it buckles.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.860
And at some point, this would
be the real stress here.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.605
And this would be failure
by the plastic yielding.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.240
And in practice, there's not
like a sharp corner here.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.489
You know, if you made columns
of progressively longer length,

00:23:15.489 --> 00:23:17.780
and you tested them, the
little short ones would yield.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.470
So they'd be along here.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.700
But they don't kind of yield
and the next one buckles.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.370
In fact, you get
something like that.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.070
So that when you're near
that transition, when you're

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.665
near this point here,
the actual failure stress

00:23:29.665 --> 00:23:32.010
is a little bit less than that.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.482
And I think that's partly
what's going on over there.

00:23:34.482 --> 00:23:35.190
It's the minimum.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.420
OK, so those two
studies, we just

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.870
looked at the modeling and
the strength of honeycombs.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:51.520
And we were kind of looking at
how does the random structure

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.124
change the properties.

00:23:53.124 --> 00:23:54.540
So the randomness
of the structure

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.750
didn't really change
the modulus much at all.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.274
But it did affect the strength.

00:23:59.274 --> 00:24:00.690
And then the next
thing we did was

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.430
we looked at putting
defects into the bone.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.230
So we knew that the
bone, partly the density

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.540
is reduced by
thinning of the struts

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.610
and partly by resorption
when there's a lot of density

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.065
loss, a lot of bone loss.

00:24:13.065 --> 00:24:15.440
So we wanted to look at putting
defects where we actually

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.040
removed some of the struts.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.810
So we did another series
of voronoi models.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.000
So we did another
series of tests

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.410
where we looked at it if we have
a certain density that we start

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.760
with and then we look at
losing the same bone mass

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.150
or relative density
in our honeycomb,

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.550
and we look at what happens if
we thin the struts versus if we

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.010
remove struts.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.870
So these plots here show that.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.660
And Matt Silva also did this.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:52.060
So this is the residual modulus
plotted against the reduction

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.570
in relative density.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.550
So residual modulus
is the modulus

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.780
after we've reduced the
density by some amount

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.540
relative to the initial modulus.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.220
And if we have an intact
honeycomb where we just

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.930
thin the struts, we don't
remove any of the struts,

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.670
if we have an intact honeycomb,
as you reduce the density,

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:11.822
the modulus just
goes down like that.

00:25:11.822 --> 00:25:14.280
So that's really just the same
as those analytical formulas

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.500
that we had.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.900
But if you start
removing struts,

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.000
not too surprisingly,
the modulus

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.410
goes down substantially more.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:26.630
And at this value here, I
think it was 30% or 35% density

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.220
reduction, you reach what's
called the percolation

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:29.910
threshold.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.430
At the percolation
threshold, you

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.710
have two separate
pieces of material.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.620
So obviously the
mechanical properties

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.119
are going to go down to zero
when you reach that percolation

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:38.639
threshold.

00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:40.930
And then this plot over here
is the same sort of thing,

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.010
but now for strength.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.840
So it's the strength
of the bone,

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.570
or the strength
of the honeycomb,

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.380
after you've either
thinned or resorbed

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.850
the wall, divided
by the strength

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.080
of the intact honeycomb.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.820
And again, you're
reducing the density here.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.200
And this is for the intact
model where you're just

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.850
thinning the struts.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.690
And this is for the models where
you're removing the struts.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.140
So you can see that
if you think of-- this

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.701
is kind of a simple model,
but if you think of the bone,

00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:08.200
if you first thin
the struts, you're

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.640
going to lose a little
bit of strength.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.400
But then if you start
removing the struts,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.024
you're going to lose
a lot of strength.

00:26:13.024 --> 00:26:15.630
So that's really where
people run into-- there's

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.230
much higher risk of fracture
once you get to the point

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.017
where you might be
resorbing struts.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:33.090
OK, so let me see,
what's next thing?

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.930
OK, let me just
finish the slides,

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.290
and then I'll put the notes up.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.706
So this is the
same sort of thing,

00:26:37.706 --> 00:26:40.450
just plotting the strength and
the modulus on the same plot.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.790
So you can see the shape of
the curves is very similar.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.700
The modulus is a little bit more
sensitive than the strength.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.900
And here we are
thinning, and here we

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.850
are removing the struts.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.930
And then the next step was
that we made a model that

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.074
was more similar to bones.

00:26:56.074 --> 00:26:57.740
So let me write down
the notes for this.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.031
And then we'll do that one
that's more similar to bone.

00:28:47.405 --> 00:28:48.655
Thought it didn't makes sense.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.269
OK, so then we were
interested in trying

00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:44.060
to model something that
was a little closer

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.266
to the structure of bone.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.840
And so we set up
this model here.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.950
So we started with
just a square voronoi.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.660
So you just force the points
into a square, voronoi,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.322
or a square pattern, you
get a square voronoi.

00:31:09.322 --> 00:31:11.030
And then what we did
is we just perturbed

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.350
the points a little bit.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:15.440
And we got this
perturbed voronoi array.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.740
And so we made this model here.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.600
And we took a piece
of vertebral bone.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.280
And we measured the
angle of orientation

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.690
of a lot of the struts.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:30.060
And we matched our voronoi
model to that distribution

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.330
in the bone.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.260
So our model looked
something like this.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.400
So you can kind of
see how it's more

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.280
or less vertical and
horizontal, but not exactly.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.205
And here's a sort of comparison
with a slice of vertebral bone.

00:31:42.205 --> 00:31:44.080
And again, because the
loads are more or less

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.430
vertical in the
bone, the trabeculae

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.470
tend to orient that way.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.557
And then have some
horizontal struts.

00:31:49.557 --> 00:31:51.140
So here you can see
on the left, we've

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.761
got a voronoi model that's
more or less representative

00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:55.260
of the bone.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.330
And we've removed
some of the struts.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.371
So we're going to the same
thing with this model.

00:31:59.371 --> 00:32:00.270
We thin the struts.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.660
And we remove the struts.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.970
And we try to see what
the residual strength is.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.570
And you can see there's for
of at least a 2d model this

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:11.950
isn't a bad representation of
the vertebral trabecular bone.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.220
And this was the
stress strain curve

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.780
for both the specimen of
the vertebral bone that

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.490
was tested and then the
honeycomb model that we

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.430
made to kind of match it.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.410
So a similar kind of behavior.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:29.010
This is how our model failed,
this sort of a local band

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.050
of struts that fail.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.500
Let's call it local
deformation band.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.540
And then what we
did was we thought

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.870
about changing the density.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.180
And what we did was we
removed either horizontal

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.930
or vertical struts, or we
thinned either the vertical

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.470
or the horizontal struts.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.890
So these are the same kinds
of plots as I showed before.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.430
This is the residual modulus.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.330
This is the residual strength.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.210
This is the density reduction.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.570
And here we're
reducing the density

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.620
by making struts thinner.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.740
So it's still intact.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.990
We haven't removed any struts.

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.480
But each of the
struts gets thinner.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:09.052
And this top line is for
thinning the longitudinal

00:33:09.052 --> 00:33:10.010
or the vertical struts.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:13.560
And this was for thinning
the transverse or horizontal

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.290
struts.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.160
And then this is for
removing struts here.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.100
So we're removing
a bigger number.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.950
So the more we remove, the
more the density changes.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.560
And then this plot here
is for the strength.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.020
So again, this is thinning.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.650
So we're moving
either the horizontal

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.185
or the vertical
ones-- I'm sorry,

00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:30.560
thinning either the horizontal
ones or the vertical ones.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.800
And then this is
for removing struts.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.205
And again removing more to
reduce the density more.

00:33:37.205 --> 00:33:38.580
So you can kind
of see we're kind

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.840
of working our way to
more complex models here.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.836
So this one here was
looking at the bone.

00:33:44.836 --> 00:33:46.210
Let me write some
notes for this.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:47.950
And then we did a
3D voronoi model.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.860
So I'll do that one next.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.690
Oop, over here.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.480
So I'll just say the
model was adapted

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.210
to reflect the trabecular bones
study in the vertebrae more.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:02.130
So we perturb a square
with array of seed points

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.180
to get a structure that
was more like the bone.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:40.030
And then we looked at the
reduction in the thickness

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.691
and the number of strides in
the longitudinal and transverse

00:35:43.691 --> 00:35:44.190
directions.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.220
OK, and then the next model
we did was the 3D version.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.790
So we made a same kind of thing.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:49.140
But with the 3D model, we had
fewer cells in that model,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.880
because once it
goes to 3D, you've

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.136
got more struts in each cell.

00:36:54.136 --> 00:36:55.260
But this was the same idea.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.106
We uniformly thinned the struts,
or we removed the struts.

00:36:59.106 --> 00:37:00.980
And again, you can see
removing the struts is

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.134
a much bigger effect.

00:37:02.134 --> 00:37:03.800
And also the other
thing to look at here

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.130
is for 3D the percolation
threshold is 50%.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.144
So it kind of makes
sense that if it's in 3D,

00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:10.810
and you've got struts
in all directions,

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.196
you're going to have
to remove more of them.

00:37:13.196 --> 00:37:14.820
You're going to reduce
the density more

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.370
to break it into two separate
pieces at the percolation

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:19.280
threshold.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.140
So that was the 3D model there.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.210
And then this is just
a comparison of the 3D

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.710
with the 2D for the modulus.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.740
We just did the modulus
for the 3D structure

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:33.050
because it sort of gets
computationally more involved.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.300
So the 3D, these two
lines here corresponded

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.500
to removing the struts and
the change in the modulus.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.740
And the little triangles were
the 3D voronoi calculation

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.830
that we did.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:48.770
The little crosses here were
the same sort of calculation

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.310
done for tetratridecahedron.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.380
One of my former
students had loaded that.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.710
And then at the bottom
here are the lines

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.260
for the 2D structures, for
either a regular hexagonal cell

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.714
or for a 2D voronoi cell.

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:05.630
And you can see, there's
not a huge difference

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.770
whether or not you take
a regular structure

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:09.910
or a voronoi random structure.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.620
But there's a fairly
significant difference

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:13.790
between the 2D and the 3D.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:17.310
So the 3D, just you have
to remove more material

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:20.886
before you get the same
reduction in modulus.

00:38:20.886 --> 00:38:22.920
So let me write
some notes for that.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.370
So it's the same
kind of analysis,

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.860
but just with a 3D model.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.070
So do you see the idea
with these models?

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.850
It was an attempt
to look at a way

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:07.220
that you could computationally
estimate how much modulus loss

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:10.610
or strength loss you get by
either thinning the struts

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:12.000
or removing the struts.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.350
So I gave you a way to
model the osteoperotic bone.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:19.718
Yes.

00:40:19.718 --> 00:40:22.651
AUDIENCE: Can you clarify
the percolation threshold?

00:40:22.651 --> 00:40:24.400
LORNA GIBSON: So the
percolation threshold

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.480
is say you have some network
and you start removing things.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.030
If your remove enough, you have
two separate pieces of things.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:35.320
If you remove enough struts,
you have two separate pieces.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.090
That's called the
percolation threshold.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.627
So I think it's-- you want
to know why it's called that?

00:40:40.627 --> 00:40:42.460
So I think that originated
because it wasn't

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.900
used in this kind of context.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.400
I think instead it
was used in a context

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:51.080
where imagine you have 2D plate.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.080
So you put 2D holes in
it, little circular holes.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.797
And they we're looking at flow
of a fluid through the plate.

00:40:57.797 --> 00:40:59.630
So you can imagine, if
you put enough holes,

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.339
eventually they line
up or they-- line up

00:41:01.339 --> 00:41:03.421
is not the right term--
but there's enough of them

00:41:03.421 --> 00:41:04.390
that they connect.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:05.764
And you end up
with two separate.

00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:07.864
You have a path
through for the fluid.

00:41:07.864 --> 00:41:09.530
That's called the
percolation threshold.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.740
But in mechanics it's sort
of two separate pieces.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.490
OK, does that makes sense?

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:16.290
So you know, at the
percolation threshold,

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:19.360
the stiffness is zero because
you have two separate things

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.408
and the strength is 0.

00:41:22.408 --> 00:41:26.910
AUDIENCE: So the two doesn't
have to be like separated by--

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.890
LORNA GIBSON: It
could be-- yeah, yeah,

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:32.454
it doesn't have to
be a straight line.

00:41:32.454 --> 00:41:33.870
AUDIENCE: Does it
make a threshold

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.610
between whether everything
is interconnected?

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:37.640
LORNA GIBSON: Yes.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.960
Or there's some path
that separates them.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.410
Yeah, that's what it is.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.860
OK, so that's the end of
the bit on osteoporosis.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.430
I had a couple more things I
wanted to talk about on bone.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:52.490
So the next part is on the idea
of using metal foams as a bone

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.280
substitute materials.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.490
So when they make hip implants--
so they're typically metals.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.920
They're titanium or
stainless steel or something.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.570
Often what they do is they
coat the outside with some sort

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.010
of porous coating.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.560
And the idea is
the porous coating

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.260
allows the bone to grow in.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:12.300
So you can kind of imagine,
like especially on the stem

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.860
and around the head of a
femur, you'd like the bone

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.840
to grow into that to attach.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.217
And having a porous
coating helps.

00:42:20.217 --> 00:42:22.300
And there's a couple of
ways they do it currently.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.320
They use porous sintered beads.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.590
So they put little beads
of metal on the outside.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.000
And the idea is that the bone
grows into the little gaps

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.020
between the beads.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.570
Or sometimes if they
have-- not so much for hip

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:36.510
implants but sometimes when
people have say car accidents

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:39.040
and their face get
sort of smashed up,

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.590
and they have to have, say,
a plate put in their face,

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:43.290
and they need like
a flatter plate,

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:44.472
they use like a wire mesh.

00:42:44.472 --> 00:42:46.930
And they have sort of a wire
mesh that goes on the outside.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:47.930
And it's the same thing.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.050
It's the idea to try to get the
bone to grow into that plate.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.600
So some people are
thinking instead

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.430
of using the porous
sintered beads,

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.590
or instead of using one
of these wire mesh plates,

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.010
that you could use metal foams.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.385
And so there's
been some interest

00:43:01.385 --> 00:43:04.889
in using metal foams in
coatings of implants.

00:43:04.889 --> 00:43:06.680
And longer term, there's
been some interest

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.770
in trying to make sort
of a vertebral body that

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:12.460
would involve using a metal
foam from the vertebral body.

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.126
So you know that whale
bone that we just

00:43:14.126 --> 00:43:16.770
passed around, that vetebral
body, that cylindrical part,

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.870
it's almost all trabecular bone.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.500
So there's some
interest in trying

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:27.080
to use metal foams
for spinal surgeries.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.750
Maybe not to replace
the whole body.

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:31.050
But to use in part
of the surgery.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.510
So I have a little
slide here which

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:35.310
shows a bunch of metal
foams that people

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:40.610
have made with the idea in
mind that perhaps some of this

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:44.350
could be used in
orthopedic surgery.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.000
So these are some different
kinds of metal foams.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.750
And these ones are made
from titanium or tantalum.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.810
So typically, the metals that
they use in orthopedic implants

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.630
are the cobalt chromium alloys.

00:43:56.630 --> 00:44:00.070
Titanium, they sometimes use
tantalum or stainless steel.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.540
And they use those because
they're biocompatible.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.890
And they're very
corrosion resistant.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.980
So these ones here
are mostly titanium.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.900
And this is one
that's a tantalum.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.750
So let me just go over
how they make them.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.430
And then I've got another
slide that goes over it

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:13.160
in more detail.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.060
And I'll write a few notes down.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.500
So this guy on the
top left up here,

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.160
that's made by taking an
open cell polyurethane foam,

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.540
like a seating foam,
like a cushion.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:29.290
And then what they do
is they heat that up

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.410
in an inert atmosphere,
so that they

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.330
are left just with the carbon.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.380
So it's a sort of
vitreous carbon.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.910
And then what they do
is they coat that carbon

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:41.010
by a CVD process with tantalum.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.620
And so they end up
with a tantalum foam

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:49.020
with a very thin layer
of carbon at the core.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.840
The carbon makes up
something like 1%

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.850
of the final composition
and the tantalum is the 99%.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.890
So that's sort of a
replica process there.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:00.330
This one here is made by
another replica process.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.700
They take an open cell
polyurethane foam.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.390
They infiltrate
it with a slurry,

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:07.105
which has the titanium
hydride particles in it.

00:45:07.105 --> 00:45:09.230
Remember when we talk about
processing of the foams

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:12.320
at the beginning, I said, if you
heat up the titanium hydride,

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.200
eventually the hydrogen
would be driven off,

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.190
and you'd be left
with the titanium.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.430
So they do that, and
then they sinter it,

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.830
and they get a titanium foam.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.316
This one is made by a
fugitive phase process.

00:45:23.316 --> 00:45:24.690
So the idea with
a fugitive phase

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:26.810
is you burn off some phase.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.869
So you could mix powders,
consolidate the powders,

00:45:29.869 --> 00:45:31.410
then you burn off
one of the powders.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.620
And you're left
with the other one.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.380
And then you need to
sinter that together

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.730
to make it have some reasonable
mechanical properties.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.880
This one here is made by
using a foaming agent.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.116
This one's made by
expansion of argon gas.

00:45:46.116 --> 00:45:47.990
I think when we talked
about the metal foams,

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.060
we talked about the
idea of packing, say,

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.230
titanium powder in a can.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.010
And then you evaporate the can.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:57.690
And you then pressurize
the can with argon gas.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.060
And then you heat treat it.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.210
So you heat it up.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.280
And as you heat it up,
the argon gas expands.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.480
And you're left with the pores.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.390
This one's made by a
freeze casting process.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:10.060
I have a slide.

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.830
And I'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:14.510
This one's made by a
selective laser sensory.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.960
So it's like a 3D printing.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.440
But instead of printing
in ink, this time

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.090
you have a bed of a powder.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.240
And you've got a laser
that selectively sinters.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.900
So you turn the
laser on and off.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.040
And where it's on, it's
going to bind the material.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.030
When it's off, it's not
going to bind the material.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.810
And then you raise the thing.

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:31.990
You make a little
bit more powder.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:33.250
You do it all over again.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.070
And you can get
different patterns.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.960
And then this is made
by a sort of process

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.390
in which they take powders and
press them and ignite them.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.730
But I think that's not
very commonly used.

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:47.960
So this is some more details
about how they might do it.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.070
So this is the fugitive
phase process here.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:53.790
You could take a titanium
and a filler powder,

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:54.610
pack them together.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:56.530
You know, you'd mix them
up, pack them together.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.321
You would raise it to
a certain temperature

00:46:58.321 --> 00:46:59.370
to decompose the filler.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.220
So typically the
filler decomposes

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.970
at a lower temperature than
what you sinter the powder,

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.910
the metal powder that's left.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.590
So you decompose the filler.

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:08.399
You drive that off.

00:47:08.399 --> 00:47:09.940
And then you sinter
the metal powder.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.470
And you're left with
porous titanium.

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.450
This one's the expansion
of the foaming agent.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:17.150
So you take your
titanium powder.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.420
You might have a binder
and then a foaming agent.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.870
Mix those all together.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:23.430
They heat them up until
typically the binder

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:24.250
becomes a liquid.

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:27.710
And the foam foams
up the liquid binder.

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.184
Then they drive off the binder.

00:47:29.184 --> 00:47:31.600
And then they sinter at a
higher temperature the titanium.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.140
So you you've got a
porous titanium left.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:40.350
This is the freeze casting
or the freeze drying process.

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:44.220
So here they would take titanium
powder and put it in agar.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.320
And the agar's in water.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.830
So the agar is like
a jelly, like a gel.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.270
But it's mostly water.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:53.380
And then if you freeze it, what
happens is the water freezes.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.510
And it drives off
the titanium agar

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:58.710
into the interstitial zones
between the frozen ice

00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:59.532
crystals.

00:47:59.532 --> 00:48:01.490
So these little dots here
are the ice crystals.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:03.870
The ice crystals are
growing as it gets colder.

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:05.900
And as the ice crystals
get bigger and bigger,

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.160
you're left with the
titanium and the agar

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.390
in between those ice crystals.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.527
And then if you
sublimate the ice off,

00:48:12.527 --> 00:48:13.860
you're left with a porous thing.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.940
And you can sinter the
titanium if you want

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.410
to make it a little more dense.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.890
And this is a rapid
prototyping thing here.

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.690
So you spread the powder.

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:25.360
You could either
print a binder or you

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:30.520
could use a laser to sort
of almost weld the particles

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.870
together.

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:34.220
Then you would drop the
piston, put more powder down,

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.260
have the binder go again
until you made your product.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.900
And then you would get rid
of all the unbound material.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.461
And you'd have
your final product.

00:48:41.461 --> 00:48:42.960
OK, so these are
some of the methods

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.459
they can use for
making metal foams.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:49.500
I don't know, should
I write notes?

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.970
Or are you good if I just
put the notes on the website?

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:55.970
I'll put the notes
on the website.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:49:01.070
And then this is a stress strain
curve for a titanium foam.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.270
So it looks like all
these other kinds of foams

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.830
and bone and wood and everything
else that we've looked at.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.940
And this is some data
for titanium foams

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.650
that are made by
different processes.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.745
And we've just taken different
data from the literature

00:49:13.745 --> 00:49:15.150
and put it together.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:16.490
So this is the modulus here.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.360
This is a slope of 2.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.720
You can see some of the data
is sort of near that slope,

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.410
but below it.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:25.490
And there is obviously a
large spread in the data too.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:27.890
But if you go back and
look at the different types

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:29.640
of structures,
then not all these

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.940
have this kind of typical
foam-like structures.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:34.740
The structures aren't all
quite like a foam either.

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.348
Yeah?

00:49:35.348 --> 00:49:39.590
AUDIENCE: So is there
any objective in this

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:44.340
to make the foam similar in
structure to the bone that

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.366
will be growing into it?

00:49:45.366 --> 00:49:48.192
Or does it just need
to be scaffolding?

00:49:48.192 --> 00:49:49.900
LORNA GIBSON: I think
for this, they just

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.060
want to make a porous thing.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.559
And they're thinking
about coatings.

00:49:52.559 --> 00:49:54.030
So the coatings
aren't necessarily

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:56.022
similar to the bone.

00:49:56.022 --> 00:49:57.480
When we finish the
section on bone,

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.160
we're going to start
talking, I think,

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.520
about tissue engineering.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.350
And when we talk about
tissue engineering,

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:05.100
people have made
scaffolds to try

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:10.410
to make them the same shape
as the anatomical part

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:12.440
that they're trying to mimic.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.950
And then they make a
cellular kind of core.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:18.536
So they have made some more
of an attempt to do that.

00:50:18.536 --> 00:50:19.910
I could give you
a sneak preview.

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:21.520
Would you like a preview?

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:28.330
So these are some scaffolds
that are generated from a making

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.430
different kinds of tissue.

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:31.370
These aren't all from bone.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.170
But this one here, for example,
is for regenerating bone.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:37.940
And they've printed it
in this exact geometry,

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.400
because that's going to
replace some anatomical piece.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.990
And they want it
in that geometry.

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:45.199
So I'll talk more about that.

00:50:45.199 --> 00:50:47.239
But so for the scaffolds,
they sometimes do that.

00:50:47.239 --> 00:50:49.060
But not so much for
these bone coatings.

00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:53.410
Let's see.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:54.070
Se we did that.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:55.844
We did that.

00:50:55.844 --> 00:50:56.760
So these are the data.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.070
And then over here, there's
the compressive strength.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.670
And again, you know, this is
our line with a slope of 3/2.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:04.670
Again, there's a lot of
scatter, because there's

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.039
a lot of variation in the
structure of these things.

00:51:07.039 --> 00:51:08.080
But it's in the ballpark.

00:51:11.157 --> 00:51:12.490
So are we good with metal foams?

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:14.800
And there's just like a page
and a half of little notes.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.383
Should I just put
that on the website?

00:51:16.383 --> 00:51:17.190
You're good?

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.240
OK.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.030
OK, so the last topic I
wanted to talk about on bone

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:24.510
has to do with how people
look at the structure of bone

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:28.310
in evolution and in
evolutionary studies.

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:30.950
So the idea here
is, in particular

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:34.480
in looking at sort of
pre-human species, sort

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.240
of hominid species, people
are interested in when

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.520
primates went from being
quadruplets to bipeds.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.560
So obviously, bipedalism,
walking on two legs,

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.850
is characteristic of us.

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:48.410
And people would
like to know if they

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:52.940
find some fossil-- you can't
just tell from the fossil

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.400
directly is it a
biped or a quadraped.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.320
You can't see the
species moving because it

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.640
doesn't exist anymore.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.330
So you'd like to have some
way of making some estimate of

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.860
whether or not it was
a biped or a quadruped.

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.460
Let me get my notes
together here.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.010
So I wanted to kind of look at
the big picture a little bit

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:18.320
and look at the evolution
of different species.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.120
And this is a phylogenetic
sort of chart.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.220
And this is kind of-- have
you heard of the tree of life?

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:26.470
This is like the tree of life.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:29.230
So this piece of it is--
metazoa is for animals.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.860
So not plants, animals.

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.830
And this goes back
about 1.2 billion years.

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.490
So these are millions
of years ago.

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:39.800
And then these are different
sort of eras and ages

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.060
that are defined.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.500
And when we have a branch here,
this is a common ancestor.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.760
And then this is a
branch in one direction,

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.950
and that's a branch
in another direction.

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:52.850
So these points
here, like 1 and 2

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:54.764
and so on, the
implication there is

00:52:54.764 --> 00:52:56.680
that there was a common
ancestor to everything

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.480
that traces back to there.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.330
So this point here, 1,
is 1.2 billion years ago.

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.620
So this was sort of very
early kind of species.

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:09.240
And the very first things were,
well, multicellular things.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.670
I mean, there were little
amoeba type things.

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:14.470
But the more sort of
sophisticated animals

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:15.840
were sponges.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.080
And there's three kind of
classes of the sponges.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.760
There's calcarea.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:22.250
And they're called calcarea
because they're mineralized.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:25.020
And they're mineralized
with a calcium carbonate.

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.390
And then there's
another branch of them

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.600
called-- I don't know if
I'm going to say this right,

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.870
but hexactinellida.

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:33.805
And those have glass.

00:53:33.805 --> 00:53:36.290
Those are called glass
sponges because they have

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:38.710
SiO2 is the mineral in those.

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:41.180
And then there's these
guys here the demospongiae.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.460
I think some of those have
calcium carbonate and some

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:44.670
of them don't.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:46.640
Oh, no, some of
them have silica.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.740
And some of them don't.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:52.750
So these things here are sort
of very early multicellular

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:53.810
structures.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:55.870
And the mineral in
them is either calcium

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:57.881
carbonate or silica.

00:53:57.881 --> 00:53:59.380
And then if we move
up, I've sort of

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:00.463
highlighted a few of them.

00:54:00.463 --> 00:54:02.120
The cnideria-- I
know there's a C,

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.260
but that's actually--
when I say s-nideria,

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.740
my biologist
friends laugh at me.

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.750
And they say no, no,
no, it's nideria.

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:11.040
The cnideria are the
corals and the jellyfish.

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.280
And corals are also mineralized
with calcium carbonate.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.940
And you can see they
branched off something

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.260
like a billion years ago.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.250
Then we get up here.

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:22.370
These are the mollusks.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:24.210
So the mollusks are
things like bivalves,

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.480
like if you like to eat
claims, things like that.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.110
So bivalves, snails, and
things like octopi, octopus.

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:33.500
So those are all molluscs.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.970
And molluscs, when
they're mineralized,

00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:38.430
also are calcium carbonate.

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:42.261
So those are the calcium
carbonate kind of shell.

00:54:42.261 --> 00:54:44.010
So we haven't got up
to anything bony yet.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:47.120
Bone is collagen plus
a calcium phosphate.

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.960
So we haven't gotten to anything
that's a calcium phosphate yet.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:54.030
Then another large
class is arthropoda.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.480
That's insects and
spiders and crustaceans.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.030
Those all have a
chiton skeleton.

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:02.290
So if you think of like the
exoskeleton of an insect

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:05.180
or a spider, those are chiton.

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.570
And crustaceans, things
like lobsters, those

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.580
also have a chiton shell.

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.540
And in crustaceans, it
might be mineralized.

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:14.300
But again, the mineral
is a calcium carbonate.

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:17.070
So all the way up here,
most of these things,

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:22.570
if there is any mineral,
it's calcium carbonate.

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:24.800
And if we get up finally
to the vertebraes,

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:29.780
the vertebraes have the calcium
phosphate and have a bone,

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.389
like what we think
of as real bone.

00:55:31.389 --> 00:55:33.180
So the vertebrates
obviously involve things

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.614
like mammals, birds,
snakes, and fish.

00:55:35.614 --> 00:55:37.530
So this is kind of the
big picture going back.

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.238
And sort of one of
the interesting things

00:55:39.238 --> 00:55:41.320
is that bone doesn't
come along until you

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.220
get somewhere over here.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.122
And I have one more
little, nice slide here.

00:55:46.122 --> 00:55:47.580
So when I talked
about the sponges,

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.710
they were these guys here
with the glass sponges.

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:54.770
Joanna Aizenberg at Harvard did
a nice study on glass sponges.

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:56.500
And she looked at this one here.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.080
It's called the
Venus flower basket

00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.690
is kind of the common name.

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.470
And it has this
hierarchical structure.

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:04.560
And it's remarkably
stiff and tough.

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.180
And what she did
in her paper was

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.030
look at optical and
mechanical properties.

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.809
But they looked at the structure
at different length scales.

00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:14.350
So there's kind of a cellular
structure at this length scale.

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:17.220
It's kind of a tube.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.570
This was just a picture I took
in a natural history museum.

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:22.690
But if you look at
higher magnification,

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:27.350
each little strut is
made up of sort of fibers

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:30.580
and has a hierarchical
structure itself.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.150
So that's just one
of the sponges.

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:36.930
And here's a similar
chart for the vertebrates.

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:40.150
So this point here is where
the other chart kind of

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:41.480
branched off.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.760
And if we start with the
earliest things again,

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.170
the earliest ones with
the most common ancestor

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:50.180
back here is something
called cyclostomata.

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:52.730
And those are things
like jawless fish,

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:55.095
so things like
lamprey and hagfish.

00:56:55.095 --> 00:56:56.870
Do you know what a hagfish is?

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:58.320
It's this kind of eely thing.

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.190
And I have the
video for you if you

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:01.990
don't know what a hagfish is.

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.510
So let me get out of
here because it's just

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:06.650
an amazing thing, the hagfish.

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:11.416
OK, so let's see,
I got my sound on.

00:57:11.416 --> 00:57:12.110
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:14.150
REPORTER: Here, at the
University of Guelph,

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:17.850
about an hour outside
Toronto, materials scientist

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:22.170
Atsuko Negishi and
biologist Julia Herr

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:25.930
think that these lovely
creatures, called hagfish,

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:30.760
may revolutionize how we
make strong materials.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.780
ATSUKO NEGISHI: These
are specific hagfish.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:36.569
They're well known for their
unique defense mechanism.

00:57:36.569 --> 00:57:38.860
REPORTER: So if I wanted to
see this, what would we do?

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.467
Like could we poke
at it with a stick?

00:57:40.467 --> 00:57:43.050
JULIA HERR: I think the best way
to do it is to reach in there

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:46.850
and grab one.

00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:50.400
REPORTER: Oh, my gosh,
look at that disgusting--

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:56.536
oh, no, I've been slimed.

00:57:56.536 --> 00:57:59.490
I feel like an outtake
from Ghostbusters.

00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:02.030
Look at the quantities
of this stuff.

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:03.320
[END PLAYBACK]

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.720
LORNA GIBSON: He used to do
this for The New York Times.

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.414
And I think he's got
his own going on,

00:58:06.414 --> 00:58:08.080
but he used to make
these little videos.

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:11.490
And he had a show on PBS a year
or two ago all about materials.

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.420
And there were like
four different episodes.

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:15.040
And he talked about
different kinds of materials.

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.289
And he went to different labs.

00:58:16.289 --> 00:58:17.917
But he's quite a character.

00:58:17.917 --> 00:58:20.000
But anyway the hagfish
have this defense mechanism

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.374
where they make the slime.

00:58:21.374 --> 00:58:23.540
And I don't know if you
know Professor McKinley over

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:26.180
in mechanical
engineering here at MIT,

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.510
but he collaborates with
those people of Guelph.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:31.350
And he studies what he
calls non-Newtonian fluids.

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:33.840
Well, a lot of people
call non-Newtonian fluids.

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.720
A Newtonian fluid is
a thing like water,

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:39.540
where the viscosity is a
constant no matter what sort

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.110
of strain rate you shear it at.

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:44.870
And a non-Newtonian fluid
does not have that property.

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:46.170
The viscosity changes.

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.990
And some of them have a
strength, like in the hagfish

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:50.200
one has a strength.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:54.084
So Gareth's studies things like
this kind of hagfish slime.

00:58:54.084 --> 00:58:55.500
I don't know if
he still has them.

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.310
He used to have hagfish
in his lab over him

00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:01.100
building, whatever it is, 1
or 3 or something over there.

00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.750
OK, so that's what
the hagfish are,

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:04.930
just because that's amusing.

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:07.630
And they don't have bone.

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:11.350
So they and the jawless
fish don't have bone,

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:13.440
even though they're
called vertebrates.

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.520
Then the next sort
of most recent thing

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.350
is the chondrocytes.

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:21.480
Those are the cartilaginous
fish, so things like shark.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.610
So sharks don't
actually have bones.

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:24.470
They have cartilage.

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:26.303
And they have a little
bit of mineralization

00:59:26.303 --> 00:59:29.390
in the cartilage, but they
don't actually have bone.

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:31.330
And the first thing
that actually has a bone

00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:34.090
is the ray finned fish,
which are these guys here.

00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:37.740
And that occurred about
450 million years ago.

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.307
And then everything in the
vertebrate since then is bony.

00:59:40.307 --> 00:59:42.890
So there's coelacanth-- I don't
know if you've ever see those.

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:45.348
Every now and then they find
one of these things in Florida

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:46.560
or something-- lung fish.

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.976
There's these guys here, which
are the frogs and the toads

00:59:48.976 --> 00:59:50.360
and the salamanders.

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.010
So it's finally
getting to be spring

00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:53.680
after the winter from hell.

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.520
And the salamanders
are going to come out

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.100
into the vernal pools and mate.

00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:57.830
And it's cute.

00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.830
So anyway, they come
out this time of year.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.830
And then there's
the amniota, things

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:04.947
that have eggs of
one sort or another.

01:00:04.947 --> 01:00:07.280
So that includes us, the
mammals, the birds, the snakes,

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.740
and the turtles.

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:12.290
And so those would have
branched off about there.

01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:14.210
So the last thing I
wanted to point out here

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:16.700
is that there's this
huge kind of diversity

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.690
of animals that have
evolved over millions

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:21.160
and millions of years.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.340
And that the first ones
that were mineralized

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:27.150
used the calcium carbonate and
that the bony type materials

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:30.230
didn't really evolve or
didn't appear until about 450

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:31.996
million years ago.

01:00:31.996 --> 01:00:33.620
And then these are
the vertebrates that

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.085
have these kind of bony things.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.310
So as I've said many
times now, the bone

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:43.140
grows in response to loads.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.690
And the bone structure
reflects the mechanical loads

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:46.760
and the function.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.280
And evolutionary studies have
looked at both cortical bone

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.980
and trabecular bone
architecture to try

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.710
to say something about the
locomotion of the animal

01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:56.869
or of the species.

01:00:56.869 --> 01:00:58.660
So there's ones that
look at cortical bone.

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:02.310
But I'm just going to talk about
one that deals with trabecular

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:03.630
bone.

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:06.950
So this study was done
by a group of peoples,

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:08.630
the first author was Rook.

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.740
And what they studied
was the ileum.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:13.130
So this is a pelvis.

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:16.480
And there's the ileum is one
of the bones in the pelvis.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.000
And they found fossils
of a hominid species that

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.095
was about 8 million years old,
called Oreopithecus bambolii.

01:01:25.095 --> 01:01:27.360
And bambolii refers
to the place in Italy

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.090
where these fossils were found.

01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:33.290
And so they found two--
or at least somebody

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:36.240
found two pieces of an ilium.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.160
And they took x-rays.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.750
And they made a
digital reconstruction

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.800
so that they would get
one ilium-- it turned out

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.299
that the two pieces were two
different parts-- so they could

01:01:44.299 --> 01:01:46.310
make a whole one out
of the two pieces.

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:48.040
And then they looked at the
structure of the trabecular

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:48.540
bone.

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.690
And they compared that
structure to the structure

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:53.107
of the trabecular bone in
humans and other primates.

01:01:53.107 --> 01:01:55.440
And they wanted to see is it
more like the humans, which

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.856
are obviously
biped, or is it more

01:01:56.856 --> 01:01:59.540
like some of the primates,
which are quadrupeds.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:06.100
So this just shows for a
human and a non-human primate

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.570
what the structure
of the ilium is.

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.260
And these little black
boxes with the letters

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.410
are what are called
anatomical landmarks.

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.990
So they're sort of
comparable spots on the bone

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:17.310
of different species.

01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:18.810
And what they were
doing was looking

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:22.924
at the trabecular architecture
at these different spots.

01:02:22.924 --> 01:02:24.340
So you can kind
of see how they're

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:28.430
more or less analogous in
the two different species.

01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:31.460
And this is the digitally
reconstructed ilium

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.000
that they put together
from their fossil species.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.230
And again, these
little letters refer

01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:39.420
to these anatomical landmarks.

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:43.110
And then what they
did was they compared

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:48.140
the Oreopithicus, the fossil,
with the human and then three

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.380
non-human primates.

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.080
So these four images
are all from the fossil.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.270
These are the human.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.280
These are champi,
siamang and baboon.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.760
And this square here
corresponds to that one there.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.780
This is B, corresponds
to that one.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.840
And C and D are those two there.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.070
So they had two
fossils, they made

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.430
the digital reconstruction.

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:13.170
They looked at certain areas.

01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:15.630
And then they looked at
the same or analogous areas

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:16.840
in these other species.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.470
And they tried to look for
similarities and differences

01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:21.140
in the bone structure.

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:26.160
So let's look at this first
box A. You can see there's

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.470
a very white bit here.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.450
And the white corresponds
to more dense.

01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:32.430
So there's a white bit that's
more dense in their fossil.

01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:36.260
And in the human bone, you
see is a similar sort of band

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.220
right there.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.220
And if you look at the
other non-human primates,

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.710
that band is missing.

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:43.080
So that says to them,
OK, this feature,

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.040
this one feature at least, is
more similar to the-- sorry,

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.410
in the fossil here is
more similar to the human

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:51.400
than it is to the
non-human primates.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.070
And then they had
three other landmarks

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.680
that they looked at like that.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:57.030
So this one here again is
a sort of dense regions.

01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:58.979
So you can see that
white dense region.

01:03:58.979 --> 01:03:59.770
There's some there.

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:00.640
There's some here.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.795
So those are the
fossil and the human.

01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:04.920
But there's a teeny bit
here and a teeny bit there.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.180
But it's not as pronounced
in the non-human primates.

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:07.680
Yes.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.832
AUDIENCE: From I
get at least so far,

01:04:13.832 --> 01:04:18.560
the portions of the bone that
are dense versus not dense

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.050
seem less relevant
to the direction

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:24.920
of loading than the
orientation of the foamy parts

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.707
of the trabecular bone.

01:04:26.707 --> 01:04:28.790
LORNA GIBSON: So the density
reflects more or less

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:30.570
the magnitude of the stresses.

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:33.690
So if the stresses are higher,
it's going to be denser.

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:37.030
And the orientation of the
bone, like whether or not

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:38.790
which way the
struts are oriented,

01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:43.500
that reflects the sort of ratio
of the principal stresses.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.250
So if the principal stresses
go in a certain direction,

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.500
the bone's going to tend to
line up in that direction.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.310
That's what that Guinea fowl
study was kind of about.

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:51.810
OK?

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:52.620
Are we good?

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:53.780
OK.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.897
And then these
other two, so in B--

01:04:55.897 --> 01:04:57.480
and you can't really
see it from here,

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.281
but they looked at the sort of
architecture of the trabecular

01:05:00.281 --> 01:05:00.780
bone.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.300
And they said that it was
more similar in the fossil

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.900
in the human than it was in
these other three primates.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.121
And this region here, this looks
very similar to that bit there

01:05:10.121 --> 01:05:10.620
to me.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.837
But I think there was some
other feature about this region

01:05:13.837 --> 01:05:14.920
that they were looking at.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.340
And again, it was more
similar to the human

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.410
than it was to the
non-human primates.

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:21.450
So by just looking at
the pattern of the bone

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.283
and the density of the
bone and comparing it

01:05:23.283 --> 01:05:25.727
to these other species, they
said that the-- and you know

01:05:25.727 --> 01:05:27.680
the hip, because we're
standing like this,

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.971
you would kind of expect to
see differences in the hip.

01:05:29.971 --> 01:05:33.830
That's why they wanted
to look at the ilium.

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:36.970
So the conclusion they made
was that these observations

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.450
suggested that the
species was bipedal,

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:44.880
or at least spent some of
its time as a bipedal animal.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.150
And I think that might be it.

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:48.770
Do I have more I have
one little summary here.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:51.090
So just to summarize what
we've done on bone this week.

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:52.840
We talked about the
structure of the bone.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.730
We talked about mechanical
properties in the foam models.

01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:57.920
We talked about osteoporosis
in the voronoi models,

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.260
how you can try to
represent the loss of bone

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.430
and the loss of bone
strength using those models.

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.180
We talked just a little
bit about the idea

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.350
of using metal foams
as bone substitutes

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:08.390
or coatings as
implants, and then

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:10.780
this little bit on
trabecular architecture

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:14.220
and evolutionary studies.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.720
I have some notes,
but I think we've

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.011
got just a couple minutes left.

01:06:17.011 --> 01:06:19.490
So maybe I'll just scan those
and put them on the website?

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:21.480
Are we good with that?

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.010
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about what we just looked

01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:25.440
at about the different species.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.485
We always consider on
the density changes.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.282
Can there always be
changes in the solids?

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:37.750
LORNA GIBSON: So it
changes a little bit

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:38.970
from one species to another.

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:42.190
So the question is, does the
solid properties of the bone,

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.780
the solid bone itself change?

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:47.030
So if you look at cortical
bone in different species,

01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:50.130
it changes a little bit, but
like 10%, not a huge amount.

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:52.365
So the two most common
things people have compared

01:06:52.365 --> 01:06:54.460
are bovine bone and human bone.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.220
And there is a slight
difference between them.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.960
But it's not a huge difference.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.760
One of the other things people
have looked at in osteoporosis

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.630
that I didn't really
talk about was

01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:07.020
there's another
whole set of things

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.670
that can go on that reflect
what you're talking about.

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.060
So they talk about
bone quality as well.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:14.000
And when they talk
about bone quality,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.860
they're talking about are there
micro cracks in the solid.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:18.900
So you might imagine
as you get older,

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.549
it's not just that
you lose the struts

01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:22.590
or that the struts get
thinner, but the solid bit

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:24.510
itself has more cracks in it.

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:27.060
So you can imagine if
the solid bone itself had

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:30.360
little micro cracks, then
it too would be weaker.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.080
And then you think
what I put up was bad.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.180
It gets even worse if
you put that in as well.

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:39.160
So, yes, people do look
at bone quality, which

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.950
is sort of looking at with age.

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:45.590
And typically it's
fairly elderly people

01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:47.290
that the bone
quality is an issue.

01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:49.581
I guess there are certain
diseases where it's an issue.

01:07:49.581 --> 01:07:53.170
But in osteoporosis, it's
sort of elderly people.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:54.610
Any thing else?

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.719
Should I stop there for today?

01:07:56.719 --> 01:07:58.510
So there were hardly
any equations in this.

01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:59.250
Did you know that?

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.500
So we got to the part where
there's lots of equations.

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.467
So next week I'm going to
talk about tissue engineering.

01:08:04.467 --> 01:08:06.050
I think I'm going
to talk a little bit

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:09.130
about different kinds of
scaffolds, how they make

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.690
scaffolds, how the
scaffolds fit sort

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:14.830
of into an anatomical
things, what is that supposed

01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:18.640
to represent, how they use
them clinically a little bit.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.514
And we had a research project
on osteochondrol scaffold,

01:08:22.514 --> 01:08:26.220
so scaffolds for replacing
bone and cartilage.

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.830
And I'm going to
talk a little bit

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.740
about that as sort of a case
study in tissue engineering

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.760
scaffolds.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.240
And I have some stuff
on cell mechanics

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.520
and how biological cells
interact with scaffold.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.478
I don't if we're going
to get to that next week

01:08:38.478 --> 01:08:40.560
or not, but somewhere
close to that.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.460
So the next bit is on tissue
engineering scaffolds,

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:48.120
osteochondrol scaffolds,
cell mechanics.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.840
And there's not that many
equations in that part either.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.000
So OK.
