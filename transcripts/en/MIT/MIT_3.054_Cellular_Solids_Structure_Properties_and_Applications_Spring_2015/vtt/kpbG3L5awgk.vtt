00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:28.975
LORNA GIBSON: All right, well,
I guess I may as well start.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:31.050
I don't know if anybody
else is going to come.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.050
So I wanted to finish up
by talking a little bit

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.180
about the biomimicking.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.156
And some of these examples,
you've seen before.

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.030
But I just thought I'd
put them all together,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.354
and we could look at
them as one thing.

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:42.770
So if you remember,
when we talked

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.880
about wood, one of the
things that I showed

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.850
you was that people have
taken wood and pyrolized it.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.120
So they get a carbon
template of the wood cells.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.510
And then they infiltrate
that with silicon carbide--

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.730
or, with a silicon
vapor infiltration.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.600
And they make a silicon
carbide ceramic.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.107
So they can get a
replica of the structure.

00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:05.940
So sometimes when people
say "biomimicking,"

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.390
some people think of it
as replicating something.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.050
But it doesn't have to be
just replicating something.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.680
It can be also just
some design inspired

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.220
by the biological material.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.190
But this thing
really is a replica.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.780
And this was another
version where

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.700
there was the-- they took
the silicon carbide material

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.590
and then infiltrated
that with liquid silicon

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.140
to get a fiber-reinforced
material, really.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.140
So there was the wood
composites we talked about.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.300
Jennifer Lewis's
group up at Harvard

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.530
is doing 3-D printing
of honeycombs.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.850
And one of the things
they've been interested in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.630
is not just printing
of the pure resin,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.950
but having a
fiber-reinforced resin.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.510
And the first thing
they did was they

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.960
made these honeycombs like this.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.091
And they had small
silicon carbon fibers--

00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:57.340
or, were they silicon carbide?

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.060
Maybe it was carbon
fibers-- in the ink.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.400
And so they would just-- if
the ink was being laid down,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.910
the fibers would just line up
in the direction of the ink.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.848
And so the fibers tended to be
in the plane of the honeycomb.

00:02:07.848 --> 00:02:09.389
And if you think of
things like wood,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.420
you want the fibers to
normal to that plane.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.040
And more recently,
they've-- hello.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.750
Oh, hello.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.250
Oh, look.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.740
Oh, look, almost
everybody is here.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.060
So more recently, they've
got a technology now

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.890
where they're
rotating the nozzle

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.480
as they print the honeycomb.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.200
And as they rotate
the nozzle, they

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.580
get some change in the
orientation of the fiber.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.180
So they're beginning to
be able to make honeycombs

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.900
that are fiber-reinforced.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.110
And they can get the fibers
aligned with the prism

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.670
axis of the honeycomb,
which is more or less what

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.740
the wood does.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.390
So I wasn't going to write
anything on the board today.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.306
I was just going to go
over some of the slides

00:02:46.306 --> 00:02:47.480
and do the review.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.380
So they're beginning
to make honeycombs

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.980
that have the same sort of
structure on the cell wall

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.980
level, or at least
a similar structure,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.690
as to what the wood
composites have.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.800
So that's another example there.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.180
This is just another close-up
of their fiber-reinforced walls

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.570
in honeycomb specimens.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.520
We talked about trabecular bone,
and we talked about the fact

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.630
that people are starting
to look at using

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.092
foamed metals as coatings
on orthopedic implants.

00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:17.800
And there's been some
interest in looking

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.270
at using foamed metals for more
permanent parts of the body,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.540
more permanent bone parts,
things like vertebral cages,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.510
stuff like that.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.110
And so this is just
an example here,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.770
with the trabecular
bone on the left

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.770
and the tantalum
foam that's made

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.119
by replicating an open-celled
polyurethane foam on the right.

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.660
And you can see the similarity
in the structures of those two

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.720
things there.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.010
Then we talked about tissue
engineering scaffolds.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.540
And if you remember, these two
scaffolds here on the bottom

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.460
were made from pig heart tissue.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.720
And they're made by just
removing all the cells.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.850
So that actually is the
natural extracellular matrix.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.010
And then, these other
structures up here, these

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.160
were all engineered tissue
engineering scaffolds that

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.600
are made in a synthetic way.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.720
And the idea is to try to
mimic the extracellular

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.020
matrix in the body.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.580
So you can see the
similarities there.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.560
And then more recently, we were
talking about sandwich panels.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.200
So this is the example from
the helicopter rotor blade.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.330
That's from an aircraft
flooring panel.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.107
And this was the Irish leaf,
and these were the bird skulls.

00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:26.690
So the same sort of
idea, that there's

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.050
these engineering lightweight
structures, and there's

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.430
also similar things in nature.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.060
And then, I think, last time, we
also were talking about palms.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.100
And the palm stems had
density gradients in them.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.560
And one of the
things we showed was

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.170
that by having that
density gradient,

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.660
the stress distribution across,
say, the radius of the palm

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.940
was almost matched by the
strength distribution.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.820
So it was a very efficient
way to use the material.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.370
And at MIT, that was a
student in architecture

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.680
who was looking at doing this
with concretes with aerated

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.740
or foam concretes and making
a radial density distribution.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.700
So he made beams.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.400
He made columns.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.417
He made different
kinds of things.

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:06.750
With the concrete, there's a
little bit of a limitation,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.916
because the concrete is
much stronger in compression

00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:10.740
than it is in tension.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.840
So if you had a beam
loaded in tension

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.689
or a concrete column
that might buckle,

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.980
you'd still have to have some
reinforcing bars in there

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.610
to take the tensile loads.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.610
And one thing I think I
didn't really talk about

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.090
was animal quills and other
sorts of plants stems.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.070
And many of these
have a structure

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.020
that's made up of
a cylindrical shell

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.610
with a foam or a honeycomb core.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.590
So here are some
examples in nature.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.990
If you look at
grass stems, there's

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.021
a dense layer on the
outside, and then

00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:41.770
a foamy layer on the
inside, and then just

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.459
a hollow layer in the middle.

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:45.000
And if you look at
porcupine quills--

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.330
this is a porcupine quill--
these are made of keratin.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.700
They're like modified hairs.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.810
So it has a dense
layer on the outside,

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.880
and then this foamy
stuff on the inside.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.650
This is a hedgehog spine here.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.108
And again, you can see there's
a dense layer on the outside

00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.380
and these ribs on the inside.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.865
And this is the toucan beak--
you know, the toucans that

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:03.950
live in Central America.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.440
And the beak has a foam core.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.070
Again, they're
keratin structures,

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.390
and yet the outside is solid.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.090
But the inside has
a foamy structure.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.894
And Mark Myers did a
paper on this a while ago.

00:06:14.894 --> 00:06:16.560
So we got interested
in these structures

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.810
that have a solid
shell on the outside

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.620
but a foamy thing on the inside.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.860
And we wondered if there was
a mechanical reason for that.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.600
And you can show that,
at least in some of them,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.500
if, say, you have
a grass stem-- it's

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.920
really common in plant stems.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.260
Do I have some more plant stems?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.968
Yeah, here we go.

00:06:31.968 --> 00:06:33.340
Here's a milkweed stem.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.200
So it's got these dense fibers
with this foamy core here.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.130
And blue jay feathers--
feathers have this as well.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.280
So they have an outside layer
on the quill that's solid,

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.170
and then an inside
layer that's foamy.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.610
If you look at things like plant
stems, they blow in the wind.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.590
And you can look at the
buckling resistance of the stem.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.631
And because there's this
shell with the foam-like core,

00:06:57.631 --> 00:06:59.880
it's not just the overall
buckling of the whole thing.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.860
You can get that local
face-wrinkling mode again.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.050
So the outer shell can wrinkle.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.350
And you can show that
having a foam-like core

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.700
helps prevent that wrinkling
from happening, the same as

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.670
with the sandwich panel.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.990
You remember we talked
about the face wrinkling

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.170
on the sandwich panel?

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.190
Well, on these
stems, you can get

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.840
wrinkling of the outer shell.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.904
And the foam helps prevent
that from happening.

00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:20.570
And you can show that
you can actually--

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.790
for the same buckling
load, you can reduce

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.340
the weight of the plant stem,
or the bird feather quill,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.430
or whatever by having
that foamy core.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.829
So people have
looked at this too.

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:33.245
And there's a group
in Germany who

00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:36.330
had looked at the idea of
mimicking the horsetail stem.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.690
So this is a plant stem
here, the horsetail plant.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.110
And they made something they
called a technical plant

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.610
stem, where they made
this structure here.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.680
And they made it out of
fiber-reinforced composites.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.290
And you can see,
the little holes

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.110
here represent those holes
there, in the plant stem.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.910
So the idea was to
try to get something

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.490
that was good at
resisting the buckling,

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.880
but at a lower weight.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.500
And they were doing that
with this thing here.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.460
And there was a group in Japan
that did a similar thing.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.580
They used-- I think
they took a copper tube,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.990
and then they took
copper and aluminum wires

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.400
and filled the copper
tube with the wires.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.490
They extruded that.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.980
And then they melted out the
aluminum, which, I think,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:27.790
also helped to soften and
make the copper bond together.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.595
And they got these
structures here.

00:08:29.595 --> 00:08:31.220
And you can see,
that's similar to some

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.940
of the plant stems as well.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.669
So these are all examples
of cellular structures

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.000
that have-- mechanically
efficient structures.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
They're lightweight, and they're
strong, and they're stiff.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.460
And these natural structures
have been mimicked

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.140
in engineering applications.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.305
So that's really all I
wanted to talk about today.

00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:56.930
But I think we wanted to use the
rest of the class as a review.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.070
So I haven't made a one-hour
summary of the last six weeks,

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.619
because that's not
really possible.

00:09:09.619 --> 00:09:11.410
So I thought I would
just answer questions.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.600
If you have questions,
I'll try and answer them.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.100
So for the test-- so,
the test is on Wednesday.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.000
You can bring one 8
and 1/2 by 11 sheet.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.350
I wasn't going to give you
all those honeycomb and foam

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.130
equations, partly because-- the
only thing I would really want

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.590
you know is open-cell foams.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.680
And I was hoping,
by now, that you

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.010
might have registered
those equations somewhere

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.970
in your brain.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:43.790
So I'm not going to ask you
for-- some equations are

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.460
obscure.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.262
I might ask you--
expect you to know

00:09:46.262 --> 00:09:48.220
what the Young's modulus
of an open-celled foam

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.403
is by now, or the axial modulus
of a honeycomb or something.

00:09:52.403 --> 00:09:55.060
But I don't think I'm
going to ask you anything

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:01.220
like, calculate air pressure
contributions to the modulus

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.220
of the closed-cell foam.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.660
I don't think we're going
to do that on this test.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:11.417
So I think you should know what
the modulus of a-- the Young's

00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:13.250
modulus of an open-celled
foam is, the shear

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.980
modulus of a foam,
because you need

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.780
that for the sandwich panels.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.340
But you don't need reams and
reams of those equations,

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.338
so I wasn't going to
give you those this time.

00:10:23.338 --> 00:10:24.800
OK?

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.300
So Jenny, did you have-- so
I finished the biomimicking

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:27.550
thing.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.883
We're just going to do a review.

00:10:28.883 --> 00:10:32.004
I don't know if you want to
stay or if you want to go.

00:10:32.004 --> 00:10:32.926
You want to stay?

00:10:32.926 --> 00:10:33.850
Well, whatever.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.630
So do you have questions, Jenny?

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.986
AUDIENCE: I do.

00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:44.116
I just wanted to have question 4
from the last pset reexplained.

00:10:44.116 --> 00:10:47.664
Because I know that
you explained it to

00:10:47.664 --> 00:10:50.080
in office hours, and I know
that the solutions are online,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.500
and I looked at them.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.330
I'm still confused.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:52.560
LORNA GIBSON: OK.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.420
So, you're going to have to
remind me what problem 4 is,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.570
because I don't remember.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.606
AUDIENCE: Question 4 says,
polymethacrylate foam

00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:06.042
at solid strength of 3.0-- or,
solid Young's modulus, rather,

00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:10.452
of 3.0-- gigapascals
is being considered

00:11:10.452 --> 00:11:13.862
for the energy absorption
layer in a bicycle helmet.

00:11:13.862 --> 00:11:14.570
LORNA GIBSON: OK.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.111
I'll tell you what, I think I
have it on my little disk here.

00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:20.562
Maybe that's easier,
because then I can read it.

00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:22.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.450
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, let me just
see if that's going to come up.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.170
There it is.

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:43.465
OK.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.614
So this one here about
the foam, about the--

00:11:48.614 --> 00:11:50.030
AUDIENCE: The one
with the graphs.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.446
LORNA GIBSON:
--energy absorption?

00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:55.302
AUDIENCE: I'm just a little
bit confused by the graphs.

00:11:55.302 --> 00:11:56.010
LORNA GIBSON: OK.

00:12:04.456 --> 00:12:06.392
Let me see if I can
make this bigger.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.975
Hang on a sec, my
computer's thinking.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.580
OK.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:20.950
OK.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.284
And I think I gave you-- right,
I gave you this graph here.

00:12:24.284 --> 00:12:24.783
Right?

00:12:24.783 --> 00:12:25.710
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.100
LORNA GIBSON: OK.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.120
So can you read
what I've got here,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.320
or is that-- should
I make it bigger?

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.670
AUDIENCE: I can't really
read it, [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.930
LORNA GIBSON: Does that help?

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.500
OK.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.760
So I have to admit, when
I put this together,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.760
somebody-- I can't remember
who it was-- told me

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.218
you thought it was
overconstrained.

00:12:48.218 --> 00:12:51.070
And it turned out it
was overconstrained.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.521
And then I said,
forget the thickness.

00:12:53.521 --> 00:12:55.520
Forget that I've given
you the thickness, right?

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.732
So disregard the thickness.

00:12:56.732 --> 00:12:58.285
AUDIENCE: No, the velocity.

00:12:58.285 --> 00:12:59.785
LORNA GIBSON: Oh,
speed-- the speed?

00:12:59.785 --> 00:13:01.687
The speed-- all
right, OK, the speed.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.290
No, I don't want to register.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.310
OK.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.310
So from what I gave you, you can
figure out the normalized peak

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.790
stress, right?

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.940
So you can get-- so if
I do this, is this good?

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.720
You can see what
I'm pointing at?

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.380
So you can get, the peak
stress is just the mass times

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.580
the acceleration over the area--
are we good with that-- divided

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.590
by Es, which I gave you.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.240
So I think most people probably
got the peak stress here.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.760
And then, because
I had given you

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.720
the velocity and
the thickness, I

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.400
was thinking you could
calculate the strain rate.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.080
But if I don't give
you the velocity,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.700
say we're not calculating the
strain rate at this point here,

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.550
OK?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.987
So here, we're--
did I put this--

00:13:48.987 --> 00:13:51.070
I don't know if I have the
graph on this solution.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.569
There we go.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.140
So this point here is the
2.5 times 10 to the minus 4

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.100
for the peak stress.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.230
And if you're not
given the velocity,

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.620
I think what I thought you would
do then would be just assume

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.120
a velocity.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.140
And then you can
check it at the end.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.220
So since I had given
you this velocity of 12,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.190
let's just say that's
what we assumed.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.510
OK?

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.460
So then you get a strain
rate of 480 per second.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.280
So let's just say we
assumed that velocity.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.350
Then we could scoot
back over here.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.330
So we know we're on this line
here for the sigma p over Es.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.620
And we want to be up towards the
top of these different strain

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.120
rates.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.786
So if you look at the
strain rates, see,

00:14:39.786 --> 00:14:42.410
the very last one at the
top is 1,000 per second,

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.280
and the next one's
100 per second.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.770
So we're halfway
in between those.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.830
And they're so close
together, you can't really

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:48.663
read the difference.

00:14:48.663 --> 00:14:50.030
But we're up here somewhere.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.030
So then we read off
a w over Es for that.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.240
OK?

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:55.810
Are we good?

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.080
Then, if we know
the w over Es, this

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.180
is the number, here,
that I read off.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.570
You know what the Es
is, so you can get w.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.460
If you can get w, w is in
joules per cubic meter.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.567
It's in energy per unit volume.

00:15:16.567 --> 00:15:18.650
But you know the area, and
you know the thickness.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.900
So you can get the
energy in joules.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.929
And then-- oh, did I-- I
must have rubbed that off.

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:25.220
Didn't have it on this version.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.820
The version in my
notebook, I think,

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.450
calculated what
the velocity would

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.425
be that corresponds to this.

00:15:30.425 --> 00:15:32.550
And I think it turned out
to be 8 meters per second

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.560
or something.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.280
So I had assumed 12, and I
think it worked out to 8.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.550
And on those log log
graphs, whether or not

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.310
it's a strain rate of
480, or a little bit less,

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.470
or a little bit more, you
can't read the difference

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.390
on these things.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:48.890
OK?

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.556
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain how this graph

00:15:50.556 --> 00:15:56.719
relates to the other graphs
from lecture that were simpler?

00:15:56.719 --> 00:16:02.186
Because we had ones that
were all density, and ones

00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:04.174
that were all the
same strain rate.

00:16:04.174 --> 00:16:05.670
And I guess I'm
just confused why.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:06.930
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, OK.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.160
Hang on.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.143
So let me see if
I can-- hang on.

00:16:12.143 --> 00:16:13.620
No, I think I know
what you mean.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.120
Let me see.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.439
I want to pull up
the lecture notes.

00:16:16.439 --> 00:16:20.495
I think I'm finding
the right thing.

00:16:20.495 --> 00:16:21.851
Here we are.

00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:32.200
So in the lecture
notes, there was

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.440
a thing that looked like this.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.240
Is that what you're
talking about?

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.040
Yeah.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.310
So the top set are the
stress strain curves.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.340
So those are OK.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.400
You do a compression
test, you measure that.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.310
Then, the middle set, you
take, say, for one density,

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.440
for one stress
strain curve-- say

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.940
that's your curve, the
middle one there, 0.03.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.560
Say you loaded it
up to some point,

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.790
or say you looked at some
point here, on the curve.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.869
You would figure
out, for that stress,

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:08.450
what's the area under the
curve up to that stress.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.609
So you'd have a stress and
an area under the curve

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.300
up to that stress.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.986
And you could then-- say
we know what this foam is.

00:17:15.986 --> 00:17:18.069
It's-- I don't know-- a
polyurethane or something.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.050
So say we know Es.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.220
Then we could divide
those two numbers by Es.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.799
And we would plot
that one thing.

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:26.839
Let me just walk over here.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.162
So this is the 0.03.

00:17:28.162 --> 00:17:29.870
So if it's in the
linear elastic reading,

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.260
it would be somewhere in here.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.720
Then I would scoot along,
say, to here someplace.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.490
I would do a whole bunch of
points all the way along there.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.089
And at every point, I would
say, what's the stress,

00:17:41.089 --> 00:17:43.130
and what's the energy
absorbed up to that stress.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.270
OK?

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.800
And then I would plot-- doot,
doot, doot, doot, doot-- up

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.514
here, I would plot
all those points.

00:17:49.514 --> 00:17:50.900
OK?

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.360
And then when I got
to this part here,

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.930
that corresponds to
that part over there.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.410
OK?

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.550
Are we all good with that?

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.050
OK.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.550
So then we repeat-- so we get
one curve on the middle chart.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.275
Then, for the
different densities

00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:10.900
and the different
stress strain curves,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.230
we plot a different curve for
each of the different densities

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.110
doing the same process.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:20.420
And the thing we notice
is that these points here

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.240
are really the optimum point.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.650
Because at that point there,
you absorb as much energy

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.160
as you possibly can
for that stress.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.460
OK?

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.420
And we notice, happily,
that those points

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.490
lie on a line, basically,
on a straight line.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.080
And we tick of what
the different densities

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.364
are-- so 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3.

00:18:42.364 --> 00:18:44.150
OK?

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.000
And that line there, and all
of these stress strain curves,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.390
and all these lines here,
curves here, they all

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.115
correspond to one strain rate.

00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:55.160
All right?

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.980
So now I could take that line
there for that first strain

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.100
rate, and it would be one
of these thinner lines

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.890
here for a particular
strain rate.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.990
And I would mark
off-- just the same

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.850
as I've got here, 0.01, 0.03--
I'd go 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.060
All right?

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.350
And then I would repeat
this whole process again

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.090
for a different strain rate.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.330
So I'd go back to doing
some mechanical tests

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.540
at, now, a new strain rate.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.260
And typically, the
new strain rate

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.126
is going to be bigger or
smaller by a factor of 10 or so,

00:19:26.126 --> 00:19:28.750
because you're not going to see
much difference in the behavior

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.320
unless you get big changes
in the strain rate.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.380
So you're going to change the
strain rate significantly.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.380
You get a new series of
these stress strain curves.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.140
Then you get a
similar-- very similar,

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.180
but not quite the same--
series of these curves here.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.990
And what you'd find is
you'd have another line here

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.960
that would be offset a
little from the first one.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.190
And the positions of
where these densities were

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.030
would also be offset a
little from the first one.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.730
And then you'd draw
the second one.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.740
So the second strain
rate line would go here.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.210
And the little density positions
would be offset a little bit,

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.040
and you would mark them off.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.600
And you basically repeat it
for different strain rates,

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.290
and then you build
this thing up.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:12.381
And then the density
lines connect too.

00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:12.880
Is that OK?

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.210
So that's how you generate that.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.370
So the idea is, this bottom
diagram is really summarizing

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.610
all of those shoulder points.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.310
The bottom diagram is really
summarizing all of these points

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.070
where the stress
starts to scoot up

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.880
at the densification machine.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.548
Yeah?

00:20:37.548 --> 00:20:39.532
AUDIENCE: So in
question 3, we were

00:20:39.532 --> 00:20:42.508
constructing the graph in the
middle for this particular one.

00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:46.290
What confused me is
that on the graph,

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.400
the variable on the
x-axis is stress,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.470
whereas in the question,
we were given the stress.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:21:00.447
So I drew something that looked
as it should have looked.

00:21:00.447 --> 00:21:03.493
And it turned out
to be right, but I'm

00:21:03.493 --> 00:21:05.020
very confused as to why.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.100
LORNA GIBSON: OK.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.880
Let me try and get rid of that.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.463
And I'm going to
have to remind myself

00:21:09.463 --> 00:21:10.650
what the question is again.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:11.150
OK.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.220
So we have an open
filled aluminum foam.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.140
I asked you to write
the equations for each

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.687
of the different regimes.

00:21:19.687 --> 00:21:21.770
And those were straight
out of the notes, I think.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.040
Right?

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.108
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
the three inputs were

00:21:24.108 --> 00:21:25.610
different relative densities.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.110
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah,
and then you had

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.910
to construct the
energy absorption

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:33.530
curve based on those equations.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.436
And I give you three
relative densities.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.760
So this was my solution.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.590
So all this stuff here, I think,
was straight out of the notes.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.560
So there was the--
oops, let me back up

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.010
so we start at the beginning.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.940
So there was the
linear elastic part.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.400
There was the stress plateau.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.187
That was just as it
starts to densify.

00:21:56.187 --> 00:21:58.270
And then, there's that
line joining up the points.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.780
So you were OK with all of that?

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.405
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:00.405 --> 00:22:04.770
No, the only part that
confused me is because once

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:09.580
I simplified-- I inputted all
of what we were given such

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.320
that I had equations in
terms of the relative density

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.075
so I could just apply it to
the different ones given.

00:22:15.075 --> 00:22:20.412
But then I wasn't very sure
how-- because I got constants,

00:22:20.412 --> 00:22:23.224
I wasn't really sure how--
the slopes should look like,

00:22:23.224 --> 00:22:25.674
because they were constants.

00:22:25.674 --> 00:22:27.090
LORNA GIBSON: So
you got-- I'm not

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.510
sure what you mean
about you got constants.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.270
So what I did was
I said, well, I

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.580
know that the diagram has to
have this basic shape, right?

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.052
In the first part here is
where it's linear elastic.

00:22:39.052 --> 00:22:40.760
And this part here is
the stress plateau.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.920
And that part there
is the densification.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.760
OK?

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.390
And I said, well, if I can
find these two points that

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.830
correspond to the change
between the linear elastic part

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.490
and the stress plateau and
the point that corresponds

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.960
to the stress plateau
and the densification,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.120
then I've got the diagram.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.600
Right?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.900
OK?

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think that--

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.758
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, can
I stop talking now?

00:23:03.758 --> 00:23:06.390
AUDIENCE: I mean,
if you wanted to--

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:07.770
LORNA GIBSON:
Well, it's for you.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:08.830
So you're OK?

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.210
AUDIENCE: I think.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.180
LORNA GIBSON: You.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.332
AUDIENCE: So what confused
me about this question

00:23:13.332 --> 00:23:15.040
was that in order to
find the two points,

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.560
you'd need to know the strain
at which that [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.640
So I wasn't sure how you
would find that strain.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.556
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, I
think I didn't tell you.

00:23:22.556 --> 00:23:24.910
Let's see.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.650
Well, let's see.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.106
Do you have to have the strain?

00:23:31.106 --> 00:23:34.000
You have that.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.360
I think if you have-- I think
you don't have to have it

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.600
in terms of the strain.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.972
I suppose you could put
it in terms of the strain.

00:23:46.972 --> 00:23:48.930
I mean, that would be a
different way to do it.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.591
AUDIENCE: But isn't the
equation for the stress plateau

00:23:50.591 --> 00:23:52.460
already in terms of the strain?

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.900
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, but this
assumes that the stress plateau

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.620
is just perfectly flat, right?

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:06.990
So this thing here would be
useful, the strain at which

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.760
the plateau starts.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.360
But I think that's
the same as saying--

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.200
that's the same point as
saying you're at that point

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.740
there, because that's
where the plateau starts.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.720
OK?

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.250
So I think there's
different ways

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.060
you could try to approach this.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:32.432
But I think--
let's see, I'm just

00:24:32.432 --> 00:24:33.890
trying to remember
what I did here.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.810
Yeah, so what I did
here-- so to get point a,

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.730
I said, well, this
is the equation

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.540
for the linear
elastic bit, right?

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.365
And this is the equation
for the stress plateau.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.610
Where I'm at point a here, this
stress is the stress plateau.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.460
So that's why I've put
sigma star plastic there.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:58.200
And then I said, this is--
the sigma star plastic is--

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.390
and this works out
to some number here,

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.077
some number times the relative
density to the 3/2 power.

00:25:04.077 --> 00:25:05.910
And then I just made
this little table here,

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.370
where I said, OK, these
are the densities I

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.690
need to get the curve for.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.180
This is going to
be my sigma star

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.040
plastic for those densities.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.990
And from that, then I
can get this column here.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.620
It's basically
just that equation

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.590
with this substituted in.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.800
And do you see that that
corresponds to the point a?

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.300
So I mean, you could
do it by figuring out

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.730
what that strain is
and then figuring out

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:37.520
all the points along that
line up to that strain.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.760
But you don't have
to do it that way.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.930
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:55.890
So you're saying-- if I had-- so
say I have my idealized stress

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.000
strain curve like that, right?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.270
You're saying, well, I
had to know that strain

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:04.330
there so that I know
where this stops, right?

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.867
And I'm saying that
corres-- and you could do it

00:26:06.867 --> 00:26:07.950
this way if you wanted to.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:15.440
You could say that this
is the energy absorbed up

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.170
to that point.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:21.160
And if you know that
the modulus goes

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.550
as the relative density
squared times Es,

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:35.445
and you know this, if you
know those two things,

00:26:35.445 --> 00:26:37.070
you can figure out
what that strain is.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.220
So you could do it that
way if you wanted to,

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.800
but I just did it a
slightly different way.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.248
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I don't
understand how you just

00:26:46.248 --> 00:26:48.936
were able to get rid of
the epsilon minus epsilon

00:26:48.936 --> 00:26:49.840
on that curve.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.340
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, let's see.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:57.810
So I think, in the first part,
where it's linear elastic,

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.470
I just go up to
epsilon 0, right?

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.890
So this part here doesn't
really involve the epsilon,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.514
because I've gotten
rid of it by taking

00:27:03.514 --> 00:27:04.750
the square of the stress.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.730
And then here, the other
point I'm looking at

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.340
is this point here.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.230
And I've assumed that epsilon 0
is much smaller than epsilon d,

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.220
and I've ignored it.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.560
And that's, I think, how I did
it in the notes in the class.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.630
OK?

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.300
So when you get to
that point, this strain

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.480
here is usually a
few percent at most.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.480
And this strain here is
typically 80% or 90%.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.200
So it's pretty
common to do that.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.440
OK?

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.330
Other questions?

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.490
So don't forget, the
test covers everything

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:45.110
from the thermal
conductivity of the foams,

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.360
it covers the stuff on
trabecular bone, sandwich

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.282
panels, and then, the
energy absorption stuff.

00:27:52.282 --> 00:27:55.010
Yeah?

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.040
Are you a little
exhausted already?

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.969
Yeah.

00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:02.010
So I'm guessing that this
week and next week, you

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.970
have everything due.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.530
You have papers, and
projects, and tests.

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:11.300
Do you have very many exams
left, like final exams?

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.350
Yeah, you've got finals?

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:13.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:13.988
LORNA GIBSON: Oh.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.490
All right.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.350
Anybody else have any questions?

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.640
Because I think we can
just go and do other things

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.540
if nobody has any
other questions.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.954
So the test is on-- so let's
just review where we're

00:28:29.954 --> 00:28:31.120
at for the rest of the term.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.474
So the test's on Wednesday.

00:28:33.474 --> 00:28:34.890
And you can bring
one cheat sheet,

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.980
but I am not giving
you all those equations

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.250
with honey combs and foams.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.750
So I think, on your
cheat sheet, you

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.370
would want to put Young's
modulus of an open-celled foam,

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.907
shear modulus of an
open-celled foam,

00:28:44.907 --> 00:28:46.740
compressive strength
of an open-celled foam,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.730
shear strength of
an open-celled foam.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.750
But I don't think there's going
to be anything more complicated

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.680
than that.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.370
And Monday, I was
going to do the

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.307
how I became a professor talk.

00:28:59.307 --> 00:29:01.640
So if you've seen it and you
don't want to see it again,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.290
you're welcome to not come.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:06.662
But for you guys, I just
talk about how I got here.

00:29:06.662 --> 00:29:07.620
And it's about my life.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.600
It's not about cellular
solids or anything.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.100
And I don't know,
you guys liked it.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.650
You like it, don't you?

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:13.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.850
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:14.350
Yeah.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.420
So if you want to
come, I'll do that.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.970
And then Wednesday,
I thought, I just

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.178
need to collect the projects.

00:29:19.178 --> 00:29:21.462
I wasn't going to do
anything on Wednesday.

00:29:21.462 --> 00:29:22.920
And so I've been
thinking about the

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.750
how I became a professor talk.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.880
And I think-- so I have
this idea that students

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.589
would like to hear more of
these talks from other faculty.

00:29:30.589 --> 00:29:31.380
Would that be true?

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.083
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:32.930
LORNA GIBSON: Ah.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.304
Because I've been in touch
with Cindy Barnhart, and we're

00:29:35.304 --> 00:29:37.541
going to try and organize
something for the fall.

00:29:37.541 --> 00:29:39.540
So I'm going to approach
some other professors--

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.640
not just in our department,
across all of MIT--

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.431
and see if I can get
other people to do the

00:29:43.431 --> 00:29:45.550
how I became a professor talk.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.390
So you would like that?

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.330
OK, yeah.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.740
So we'll see if we
can make that happen.
