00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.070
LORNA GIBSON: I
think, last time, we

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.210
got as far as talking
about processing of foams

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.960
and we talked a bit about
processing of polymer foams.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.420
And today, I want to pick
up where we left off.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.850
And I was going to talk
about processing metal foams.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.040
We'll talk a little bit about
carbon foams, ceramic foams,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.530
and glass foams.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.630
We'll finish this section
on processing today

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.630
and then we'll start
talking about the structure

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.870
of cellular materials.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.870
And hopefully-- we
won't finish that today,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.866
but we'll finish it the
start of tomorrow's lecture.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.990
And then, we'll start doing
mechanics of honeycombs

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.590
tomorrow.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.720
OK?

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.571
So that's the scheme.

00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:02.070
I thought what I'd do-- I have
a whole series of slides that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.519
show, schematically, a
variety of different processes

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.220
for making metal foams.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.440
So I thought I would just
go through the slides-

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.360
and I think I did this really
quickly last time-- but I would

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.900
write down a little bit of
notes on each of the slides

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.740
so that you've got
some notes on it, too.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710
This is the first method here.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.950
And many of these methods were
developed for aluminum foams.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.920
But you could, in principle, use
them for other types of foams,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.020
as well.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.800
This first method
here-- let me see

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.540
if I can get my little pointer.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.850
[INAUDIBLE] The idea here is
that you take molten aluminum.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.620
Down in this bath here,
you've got molten aluminum.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.860
And they put, into the aluminum,
silicon carbide particles.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.700
And the silicon
carbide particles

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.750
adjust the viscosity
of the melt.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.260
They make it more viscous.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.500
And then they just have a--
I've got this thing here--

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.934
they've got a tube here
that they blow gas in with.

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:52.600
And if you go to the
bottom of the tube,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.390
there's an impeller, or a little
paddle, that stirs the gas up.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.764
And so the gas just forms
in the molten aluminum here.

00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:01.180
And then they have
conveyors which

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.110
pull off the molt-- or the
metal foam, and then it cools.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.060
The idea is that if you
just had the aluminum,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.268
you couldn't really do this
because the bubbles would

00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:14.260
collapse before they cooled
down and became a solid.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.520
But adding the silicon
carbide particles increases

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.400
the viscosity of
the melt. It helps

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.040
prevent drainage of the foam.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.352
Normally, if you have a liquid
foam, just from gravity,

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:24.810
you're going to
have some drainage.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.510
It's going to tend to-- some
of the liquid is going to tend

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.060
to sink, just from gravity.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.330
By putting the silicon
carbide particles in,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.690
you increase the viscosity.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.430
It helps prevent the drainage.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.890
And you can get the foam
bubbles to be stable.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.810
Let me just write
one little note here.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.630
The first method here
involves just bubbling gas

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.030
into the molten aluminum.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.730
And that molten
aluminum is stabilized

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.640
by silicon carbide particles.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:12.190
Sometimes people use aluminum
particles and the particles

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:29.240
increase the
viscosity of the melt.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:42.924
And that reduces the drainage
and it stabilizes the foam.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.340
That process was developed
at Alcan in Canada

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.930
and at Norsk Hydro in Norway.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.780
And this foam here is an example
of the foam that they've made.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.880
And you can kind of
see-- there's a density

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.967
gradient in this foam.

00:04:13.967 --> 00:04:14.800
I'll pass it around.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.530
You can see it.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.360
But the bubbles are smaller down
here and there's fewer of them

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.630
than there are up here.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.630
And that's partly
from the drainage.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.290
The molten aluminum
is draining down

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.860
and you get more
liquid at the bottom

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.609
and then you get more
solid at the bottom.

00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:28.190
So that's the Alcan foam.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.580
OK.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.621
Another-- there's half a
dozen of these processes

00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:34.810
for metal foams.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.350
Another version of the process
involves taking metal powder

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.317
and combining it with
titanium hydride powder.

00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:44.150
And then you consolidate
it and you heat it.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.149
So if I can show through
the schematics here.

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:50.690
In the first step, you take the
two powders, you mix them up.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.880
So the second thing down here
is mixing the powders up.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.520
And then you press
them together.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.530
There's a dye here
that you press it,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.950
and then you get pieces.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.230
And then you can heat that up.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.540
And the way that this
works is that the titanium

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.490
hydride decomposes at
a temperature of about

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.530
300 degrees C. And if the
other powder is something

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.800
like aluminum-- aluminum melts
at something like 660 degrees

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.670
C-- the aluminum has become
soft at 300 degrees C,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.710
but it's not molten.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.920
And the titanium hydride--
when it decomposes--

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.320
forms hydrogen gas.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.000
So the hydrogen gas
forms the bubbles

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.940
that you need to make the foam.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.550
Are you riding your bicycle?

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.300
You are tough.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.369
Very tough.

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:34.410
I ride my bike, but I gave
up a couple weeks ago.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.701
Well, three weeks ago, I guess.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:38.150
When it started
snowing, I gave up.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.430
The idea with this process is
you can use titanium hydride

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.070
powder with aluminum
and the aluminum becomes

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.690
soft at the temperature that
the titanium hydro decomposes.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.310
And when it forms
the hydrogen gas,

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.290
that gives you the
bubbles, and so you get

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.010
the foam made by that process.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.560
And that was developed by
a place called Fraunhofer.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.330
And I have one of their
little foams here.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.390
This is an example of their foam
made by that powder metallurgy

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.434
process there.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.340
OK.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.190
Let me just write a
little note about that.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.460
So you can mix up titanium
hydride powder with a metal

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.286
powder and then heat that up.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.010
When you do this, you need
to have a metal powder that's

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.360
going to be deforming by,
say, high temperature creep

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.100
at the temperature that the
decomposition of the titanium

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.920
hydride happens.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.650
And for aluminum, that works.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.780
So you need to have
the metal material be

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.370
able to deform fairly
easily, in order

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.029
to get these bubbles
to form a nice foam.

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:26.570
But that's another
way you can do it,

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.410
is by consolidating
these two powders.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.800
Here's another way to do it.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.800
You can also make use of
this property of the titanium

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.060
hydride-- that it'll
decompose and form

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.930
hydrogen gas-- by just putting
it into molten aluminum.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.260
And in this example here, you've
got an aluminum melt in here.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.730
And this time, they've
added 2% calcium to it.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.230
Again, to adjust the viscosity.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.882
And then they add the titanium
hydride in this step here

00:07:52.882 --> 00:07:54.590
and they've got a
little mixer thing here

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.440
that's spinning around
and will mix it.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.100
And then they'll put a lid
on it to control the pressure

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.880
and the titanium
hydride will decompose,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.690
the hydrogen gas will
evolve, and you'll

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.550
get the foam made
by that method, too.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.890
So you can stir titanium hide
right into a molten metal,

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.496
as well.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.040
OK.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.710
So that's another method.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.240
And I think that was made by
something called the Alporas

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.890
process.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.765
And this is an example
of one of their foams.

00:08:54.765 --> 00:08:58.150
I'm pretty sure that's
an Alporas foam there.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.002
Yep.

00:08:59.002 --> 00:08:59.877
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.000
LORNA GIBSON: They can't
really control it perfectly.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.130
In that first example
that's going around-- maybe

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.390
you might have missed it--
there's this drainage.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.630
The first one's made by a molten
process and you get drainage.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.600
And you get different
sized bubbles.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.500
And you get different--
you get a density

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.280
gradient in the thing, as well.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.710
So you can't control
these things perfectly.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:24.920
OK.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.130
Here's another method
for the metal foams.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.820
This one here
involves replication.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.010
In this method here, what
you do is you start out

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.700
with an open-cell polymer foam.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.340
In this step up here, there's
an open-cell polymer foam.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.180
You fill that with sand.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.960
So you fill up all the open
parts of the cells with sand.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.560
Then you burn off the polymer.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.520
And so you've got
a little channels

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.180
where the polymer used to be.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.790
And then you infiltrate those
channels with the molten metal

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.820
that you want to use.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.870
So you replicate the
polymer foam structure.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.350
This is the infiltration
process here.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.012
This little thing
here is your furnace.

00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:05.720
And then you get rid
of the sand and then

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:12.380
you're left with a metal
replica of the-- a replica

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.960
of the original polymer foam.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.450
And this example here is one
of these things that's made

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.200
by this replication process.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.844
So that's an
open-celled aluminum.

00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:24.540
I think the-- if you look at
the density of these things,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.480
they're fairly low.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.100
And so there's quite a
large volume of pores

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.480
and they're all interconnected.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.420
So it's not that hard
to get the sand out.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.460
This method would
involve replication

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.930
of the open-cell foam-- the
polymer foam-- by casting.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:07.805
So you fill the open-cell
polymer foam with sand.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.095
You burn off the polymer.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.000
And then you infiltrate
the metal into that.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.630
And then you remove the sand.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.500
OK?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.640
Then, another process involves
just using vapor depositions.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.420
So you take an open-cell
polymer foam again.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.100
Here-- let me use
my little arrow.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.690
Here's the open-cell
polymer foam up here.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.490
And you have a furnace here
with a vapor deposition system.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.730
And they use a nickel
CO4 system to do this.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.680
You then burn out the polymer.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.480
You're left with a metal
foam with hollow cell walls,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.739
where the polymer used to be.

00:12:08.739 --> 00:12:10.780
And then usually, what
they do is they center it.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.070
They heat it up again to
try to densify the walls.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.720
The only teeny weeny
problem with this process

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.780
is that the gas they use
this incredibly toxic.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.099
And so it's not cheap and it's
got health hazards, as well,

00:12:24.099 --> 00:12:24.890
associated with it.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.023
But you can do it.

00:12:28.641 --> 00:12:31.140
That gives you a nickel foam
when you're finished with that.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.755
And you could also use an
electrodeposition technique

00:12:40.755 --> 00:12:41.380
that's similar.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.690
OK.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.440
That's another method.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.040
Another method is shown here.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.000
This is the entrapped
gas expansion method.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.600
And what they do in this
method is they have a can

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.450
and the can has a
metal powder in it.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.810
It's whatever metal you want
to make the foam out of.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.060
In this example here-- it's
probably too small for you

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.360
to read in the seats--
but it's titanium.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.690
They've taken a titanium alloy.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.690
They've got a powder
of titanium alloy.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.127
They then evacuate the can.

00:13:44.127 --> 00:13:45.460
They take all the air out of it.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.880
And then they back
fill it with argon gas.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.990
They put in an
inert gas in there.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.370
And then what they do is
they pressurize and heat

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.820
the thing up and so
the gas is internally

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.110
pressurized by doing that.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.780
And then, sometimes
when they do this,

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.210
they want to have a
skin on the two faces.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.110
So in this next
little image here,

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.500
it's done where
they roll the can

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.350
and produce a panel
that's got solid faces.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.880
And then when you heat
it up, the gas expands

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.220
and you end up with a
sandwich panel by doing this.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.446
So this bottom
figure down here--

00:14:19.446 --> 00:14:21.430
I'm not having much
luck with the pointer.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.240
This bottom figure down
here, they've heated it up.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.860
The gas expands and
you've got this solid skin

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.130
on the thing, which is from
where the can use to be.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.815
So that's trapping of a gas.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.480
OK?

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.910
There's a couple more
methods for the metal foams.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.310
One involves centering hollow
metal spheres together.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.150
And the trick there is to
make the hollow spheres.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.670
And the way that can be done
is by taking titanium hydride

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.170
again, if you want to
make titanium spheres.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.440
You put it in an organic
binder-- in a solvent--

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.530
so you've got a slurry here.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.240
And you've got a tube
that you blow gas through.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.390
And as you do that, you
get hollow titanium hydride

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.004
bubbles.

00:16:06.004 --> 00:16:08.420
And then you can do the same
thing where you heat that up.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.510
The hydrogen gas evolves off,
and you're left with titanium.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.020
You're left with
titanium spheres

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.210
down at the bottom here.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.840
And then you can
pack those together

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.810
and press those and form a
cellular material that way.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.865
You can also center
hollow metal spheres.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.139
And the last method I've
got for the metal foams

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:39.680
is that you can use
a fugitive phase.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.620
With the fugitive phase,
you would take some material

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.930
that you could get rid of
at the end of the process.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.500
Say, something like salt,
that you could leach out.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.330
Here, we have our
bed filled with salt.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.660
And then you would infiltrate
that with a liquid metal,

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.270
typically under pressure.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.180
And then, after the metals
cooled, you leech out the salt.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.560
You get rid of that.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:14.349
You can pressure infiltrate
a leachable bed of particles,

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.863
and then leach
the particles out.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.700
OK.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.430
We have a whole
variety of methods

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.840
that have been developed
to make metal foams.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.230
And most of these have
been developed, probably,

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.210
in the last 20 years.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.810
Something like that.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.726
Some of them are a little
bit older than that.

00:18:07.726 --> 00:18:10.730
But there's been a lot of
interest in this recently.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.754
Those are all methods
to make metal foams.

00:18:12.754 --> 00:18:15.170
I wanted to talk just a little
bit about a few other types

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.250
of foams.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.760
People make carbon foams.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.260
And they use the
same kind of method

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.990
as they do to make those
bio carbon templates

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.055
I told you about.

00:18:23.055 --> 00:18:25.555
When you take wood and you heat
it up in an inert atmosphere

00:18:25.555 --> 00:18:27.660
and it turns into
a carbon template,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.180
you can do the same thing
where you take a polymer foam,

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.440
you heat it up in
an inert atmosphere,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.482
and everything except
the carbon is driven off.

00:18:34.482 --> 00:18:35.940
And you're left
with a carbon foam.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.080
It's the same process they
used to make carbon fibers.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.200
There's carbon foams.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.940
There's also ceramic
foams that you can make.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.170
I brought the little sample
of ceramic foaming again.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.530
You can pass that around.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.280
And those are typically made
by taking an open-cell polymer

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.420
foam and passing a ceramic
slurry through the polymer foam

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.280
so that you coat the cell walls.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.210
And then you fire it so that
you bond the ceramic together

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.730
and you burn the polymer off.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.560
And you're left with a foam
that's got hollow cell walls.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.410
You can also make ceramic
foams by doing a CVD process

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.090
on the carbon foam
that you could

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.563
make by the previous process.

00:21:07.305 --> 00:21:10.670
And people also
make glass foams.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.330
And to make glass
foams, they use

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.180
some of the same
kinds of processes

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.720
as people use for polymer foams.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:21.285
I'll just say similar
processes to polymer foams.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.280
OK.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.640
That covers making
the foams, and I

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.950
think we talked about
the honeycombs last time.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.390
I wanted to talk a
little bit about making

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.880
what are called 3D
lattice materials, or 3D

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.170
truss materials, as well.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.533
Let me [? strip ?]
that up there.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.376
Yeah?

00:22:00.376 --> 00:22:01.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.916
LORNA GIBSON: Chemical
vapor deposition.

00:22:09.189 --> 00:22:11.997
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
use this for metal foams?

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:14.580
LORNA GIBSON: Well, people were
quite interested in using them

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.490
for sandwich panels-- the
cores of sandwich panels--

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:18.840
lightweight panels.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.620
There was interest in using
them for energy absorption,

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.932
say, car bumpers.

00:22:22.932 --> 00:22:25.140
The automotive industry was
quite interested in this,

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.110
in terms of trying to make
components with sandwich

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.960
structures that would
be lighter weight,

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.930
or energy absorption
for bumpers.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.120
Or filling up-- if you take--
say you take a metal tube.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.740
If you think of a car chassis
and it's made of tubes,

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.352
if you fill those
tubes with a foam--

00:22:41.352 --> 00:22:43.310
especially if you fill
them with a metal foam--

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.900
you can increase the energy
absorption quite substantially.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.040
So when you have a
tube in a chassis,

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.480
if it's loaded axially,
it will fold up

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.170
and you get all these
wavelengths of buckling.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.770
And if you've put
a foam in there,

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.380
it changes the
buckling wavelength

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.410
and it increases the amount
of energy you can absorb.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.740
So not only is the energy
absorbed by the foam

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.460
itself, it actually changes
the buckling of the tube

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.130
so you can absorb more energy.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.842
So there was a lot
of interest in that.

00:23:09.842 --> 00:23:11.300
There was an interest
in using them

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:17.490
for cooling devices for,
say, electronic components.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.100
The idea was you
would take, say,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.430
an aluminium
open-cell foam and you

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.190
would flow air through that.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.180
And say you have your device
that's generating heat,

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.880
you'd have a foam underneath it.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.020
And the aluminum conducts
the heat fairly well.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.644
And then you would
blow air through it

00:23:32.644 --> 00:23:33.560
to try to cool it off.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.330
So there were a bunch of
different applications

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.704
people have had
in mind for them.

00:23:36.704 --> 00:23:38.052
AUDIENCE: What about glass?

00:23:38.052 --> 00:23:39.510
LORNA GIBSON: Glass
foams, I think,

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.610
are largely used for
insulation in buildings,

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:42.360
believe it or not.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.220
I think, actually, one of
the dorms at MIT-- maybe

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.995
the Simmons dorm-- has
a glass foam insulation.

00:23:48.995 --> 00:23:51.296
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:53.644 --> 00:23:55.560
LORNA GIBSON: Well, I
think because the foam--

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.510
because the cells are closed,
the gas is trapped in the cell.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.240
Whereas with a fiberglass, gas
could move through the fibers

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.560
more easily.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.600
So I think that's
partly how it works.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.100
OK.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.558
Well, let me talk a little bit
about the lattice materials,

00:24:09.558 --> 00:24:11.260
too, and how we make those.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.550
We're going to start
talking about the modeling

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.290
of honeycombs and foams.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.850
And when we do that, we're
going to see that if we have

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.120
a structure that
deforms by bending,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.010
the properties vary with
the amount of material,

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.180
in a certain way.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.400
But if we have materials where
the deformation is controlled

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.360
by axial deformation, the
stiffness and the strength

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.110
are going to be higher
at the same density.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.832
People made these
lattice-type materials

00:24:37.832 --> 00:24:39.290
to try to get
something with a more

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.950
regular structure,
and especially

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.210
a triangulated structure.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.520
You see how these things
are like little trusses?

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.950
Triangulated?

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.570
Triangulated
structures, when you

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.570
load them-- say I
load this like this--

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.350
there's just axial
components-- axial forces

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.365
in each of the members.

00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:54.740
And so, theoretically,
this would

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.030
be higher stiffness and
strength for a given weight

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.464
than, say, a foam would be.

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:01.630
So people were interested
in these lattice material.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.269
This one here is
made of aluminum.

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:05.060
And I wanted to talk
a little bit about how

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.970
you can make these things.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.300
One way you can do it
is by injection molding.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.450
And this here is just the
centerpiece of something

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:15.860
that would look like this.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.840
So there would be a--
I didn't bring it,

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.790
but there's a top face and a
bottom face that fit onto this.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.140
And they would be
injection molded

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.990
as three different pieces,
and then assembled together.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.450
So you can make a mold in
this complicated geometry,

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:35.190
and you can make a lattice
material by injection molding.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:40.363
We'll start with
polymer lattices first.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.856
One way is injection molding.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:54.820
Another way to do it
is by 3-D printing.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.170
You can generate a structure
like that by 3-D printing.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:03.600
You can also make
trusses in 2D and you

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.630
can make them so that you
can snap fit those together.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:12.299
So you can make
little 2D trusses.

00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:13.840
Here's a little
truss here and here's

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.040
a little piece of a truss here.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.750
And you can make a
little snap fit joints.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:23.710
Do you see how these ones
have little divots in them?

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.170
And you can make it so that
these things will fit together.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.640
I think these
guys-- can I do it?

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.457
No.

00:26:30.457 --> 00:26:31.540
You'd have to take-- oops.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.123
Wait a minute.

00:26:32.123 --> 00:26:34.740
No, it's not that way.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.280
There we go.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.600
So you can snap them
together like that.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.100
OK.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.229
I can't get it to-- there we go.

00:26:43.229 --> 00:26:44.020
So you can do that.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.600
And you do that
over and over again.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.640
And if you do it
over and over again,

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.400
you get something
that looks like that.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.450
OK?

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.210
You can make a snap fit thing.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.790
Let me pass all
these guys around

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.105
and you can play with those.

00:26:56.805 --> 00:26:58.180
That's the injection
molding one.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.770
This is the snap-fit one.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.270
Got that?

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:06.940
Let's see.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.481
I think I have a
little picture here.

00:27:08.481 --> 00:27:11.430
This is an example of
the snap fit truss here.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.520
It's the thing that's
getting passed around.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.180
And another clever
way that was developed

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:21.140
was by taking a monomer
that's sensitive to light.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.490
You take a photo
sensitive monomer.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.410
And you put a mask on top of it
and the mask has holes in it.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.710
And then you shine
collimated light on it.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.550
You shine, say, a laser on it.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.030
And the light goes through
the holes in the mask.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.660
And it starts to
polymerize the polymer

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.330
because it's photosensitive.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.970
And then, as the polymer-- as it
polymerizes and becomes solid,

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.120
it then acts as a waveguide
and draws the light down

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.200
deeper into the monomer.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.720
And so the polymer
acts as a wave guide.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.080
It brings the light down.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.280
And this is a
schematic over here.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.340
This is a schematic
showing the set up.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.960
And these are some
examples of some 3D trusses

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.500
that they've made
using this technique.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.050
And one of the nice
things about this

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.160
is you can get a very
small size cell size.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.141
So this is-- I think that
bar-- it says 1,500 microns.

00:28:13.141 --> 00:28:13.640
That's what?

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.765
One and a half millimeters.

00:28:14.765 --> 00:28:18.480
So you can get a nice, small
cell size if you want that.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.753
Let me write that down.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:52.900
You take a
photosensitive monomer

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.200
and then you have it in
a mold beneath a mask.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:07.130
And then you shine
collimated light on it.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.375
And as the light shines on it,
it polymerizes the monomer.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.770
So then it solidifies and then
it guides the light deeper

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.890
into the monomer.

00:30:02.564 --> 00:30:04.080
OK.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.300
That's that.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.360
And then finally, there's
metal lattices, as well.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.670
And so this is, obviously,
a metal lattice here.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.140
It's an aluminum alloy.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.280
And the metal lattice
is made by taking

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.310
that polymer lattice that was
made by the injection molding

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.300
technique.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.620
You coat that with
a ceramic slurry.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.130
You burn off the
polymer, and then

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.110
you infiltrate the metal
where the polymer used to be.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.250
OK.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.150
That's the section on
processing of the honeycombs

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.872
and the foams and the lattices.

00:31:21.872 --> 00:31:23.705
So there's a variety
of different techniques

00:31:23.705 --> 00:31:25.730
that people have
developed for making

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.590
these kinds of materials.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.990
And I thought it'd be
useful to just describe

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.140
some of the techniques.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.455
As I think I said last time,
this isn't comprehensive.

00:31:34.455 --> 00:31:36.060
This doesn't cover
every technique.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.039
But it gives you
a flavor of what

00:31:38.039 --> 00:31:39.830
techniques people have
developed for making

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.990
these kinds of materials.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.940
OK?

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.100
Are we good?

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:44.900
We're good.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.740
OK.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.220
The next part, I want
to do on the structure

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.360
of cellular materials.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.877
And I have a little overview.

00:31:53.877 --> 00:31:55.460
I don't think we'll
finish this today,

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.090
but we'll finish it tomorrow.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:50.990
Yeah?

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.811
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:54.810
LORNA GIBSON: Down here?

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:57.010
AUDIENCE: What happens
to the ceramic?

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.760
LORNA GIBSON: They get
rid of the ceramic.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.320
Typically, the ceramic
is not very strong

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.075
and it's just fired enough
so they can infiltrate it

00:33:04.075 --> 00:33:04.700
with the metal.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.300
And then they-- yeah, I think
with mechanical smushing

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.280
around, you can get
rid of the ceramic.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.880
And the ceramic's brittle,
so if you break the ceramic,

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.530
you're not going
to break the metal.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.030
AUDIENCE: I'm
wondering if you could

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.678
make a type of metal
lattice [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:19.678 --> 00:33:21.625
with reducing [? the ?] oxides?

00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:24.000
LORNA GIBSON: I guess you
could, if you could-- but you'd

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.958
have to then make the
oxide in that shape, too.

00:33:25.958 --> 00:33:28.869
You've always got to make
something in that shape.

00:33:28.869 --> 00:33:29.744
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.640
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, maybe
you could make a foam.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.210
But to make these lattices, you
need this really regular kind

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.290
of structure and be able
to control the structure.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.680
OK.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.820
Let me scoot out of this set of
slides and get the next set up.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.370
OK.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:57.270
We want to talk about the
structure of cellular solids.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:01.410
And we classify cellular
materials into two main groups.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.460
One's called honeycombs.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.660
This thing down
here is a honeycomb.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.389
And honeycombs have polygonal
cells that fill a plane

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:11.730
and then they're prismatic
in the third direction.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:15.120
So you can think of them
as just being a prismatic--

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.239
and they can be hexagons,
they can be squares,

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.365
they can be triangles--
but you can think

00:34:19.365 --> 00:34:21.100
of them as prismatic cells.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.020
And the cells are
just in a 2D plane.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.389
And then we also have foams.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:29.060
All of these ones over
here are foamed materials.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.120
And they're made up
of polyhedral cells.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.469
The cells themselves are
three-dimensional polyhedra.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:36.659
And this slide
here shows a number

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:37.889
of different types of foams.

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:39.790
These ones are polymers up here.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.159
These are two metals.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:42.550
These are two ceramics.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.699
This is a glass foam down here.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:47.080
And this is another
polymer foam down here.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.376
OK?

00:34:48.376 --> 00:34:49.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:50.600
LORNA GIBSON: No.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.520
I just know that.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.567
LORNA GIBSON: I took those
pictures so I know that.

00:34:54.567 --> 00:34:56.150
No, you can't tell
by looking at them.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.250
In fact, that's one of
the things about how we

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.710
model the cellular materials.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.000
The fact that their
structure is so similar

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.810
is what gives them
similar properties.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.768
And they behave in similar
ways because they've

00:35:06.768 --> 00:35:09.751
got similar structures.

00:35:09.751 --> 00:35:10.251
OK.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:34.310
We've got 2D honeycombs,
where we have polygonal cells

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.700
that pack to fill a plane.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.110
And then they're prismatic
in the third direction.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.290
And then we have what we call
3D cellular materials, which

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.805
are foams, which have
polyhedral cells.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.950
And then they pack
to fill space.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.200
The properties of all
of these materials

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.062
depend, essentially,
on three things.

00:36:24.922 --> 00:36:27.380
They're going to depend on the
solid that you make it from.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.182
If you make the material from
a rubber or from an aluminum,

00:36:30.182 --> 00:36:31.890
you're going to get
different properties.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.806
So they depend on the
properties of the solid.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.860
And some of the
properties that we're

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.137
going to use that are important
for this type of modeling

00:36:52.137 --> 00:36:54.470
are a density of the solid--
which I'm going to call rho

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.990
s-- a Young's modulus of the
solid-- which I'm going to call

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:59.580
es-- and some sort of
strength of the solid--

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.390
which I'm going to
call sigma ys for now.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:03.890
And you could think
of other things.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.973
There could be a fractured
toughness of the solid.

00:37:05.973 --> 00:37:07.920
There could be other
kinds of things.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.800
One thing that the properties of
the cellular material depend on

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.560
is the properties of the solid.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:18.840
Another is the relative density
of the cellular material.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.110
And that's the density of
the cellular thing divided

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.810
by the density of the solid.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:26.295
And that's equivalent to the
volume fraction of solids.

00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:38.150
So it makes sense that
the more solid you've got,

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.370
the stiffer and stronger
the material's going to be.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:43.180
So it's going to depend on
how much material you've got.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.570
And it also depends--
the properties also

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:46.972
depend on the cell geometry.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.370
The cell shape can control
things like whether or not

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.460
the honeycomb or the foam
is isotropic or anisotropic.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.520
You can imagine,
if you have a foam,

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.320
and you've got
equiaxed cells, you

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.820
might expect to have the same
properties in all directions.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.300
But if you had cells that
were elongated in some way,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.300
you might expect you'd
have different properties

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.300
in the direction that
they're elongated relative

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.640
to the other plane.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.280
So cell shape can
lead to anisotropy.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:36.560
For the foams, you
can also have what

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.375
we call open-cell and
closed-cell foams.

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.620
If you look at this
slide here, and we

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:55.840
look at this top right
images-- these two up here--

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.690
the one on the left in the
top is an open-celled foam.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.440
There's just material
in the edges.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.330
There's no faces.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.515
And so a gas can flow
between one cell and another.

00:39:05.515 --> 00:39:07.390
And then if you look at
the one on the right,

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:08.750
this is a closed-celled foam.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.500
There's faces.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.041
If you think of the
polyhedra, you've

00:39:11.041 --> 00:39:14.412
got solid faces covering
the faces of the polyhedra.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:21.430
For an open-cell foam,
you've only got solid

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.065
in the edges of the polyhedra.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.190
And the voids are continuous,
so they're connected together.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.930
And for a closed-cell
foam, you've

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.765
got solid in the
edges and the faces.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.270
And then the voids are
separated off from each other.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.830
So we'll say, the cells are
closed off from one another.

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.840
Another feature of the cell
geometry is the cell size.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.690
And the cell size can
be important for things

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.790
like the thermal
properties of foams.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.540
It's important for
things like the surface

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.776
area per unit volume.

00:40:12.776 --> 00:40:14.650
But typically, for the
mechanical properties,

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:15.650
it's not that important.

00:40:23.867 --> 00:40:25.950
And we'll see why that is
when we do the modeling.

00:40:59.135 --> 00:40:59.635
OK.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.300
Yes?

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:12.070
AUDIENCE: For the closed-cell
foams-- because we can't really

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:17.580
see it without cutting it,
is it that all of the faces

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.260
are closed?

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.300
Or is it like some fraction
of the faces are closed?

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.180
LORNA GIBSON: If you look at
this one on the top right here,

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.550
they're pretty much all closed.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.300
But the reason we have
this little picture

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.660
down here is some of them
are closed and some of them

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.160
are open.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.880
So you can get ones
that are in between.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.820
But typically-- this
is kind of unusual.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.778
Usually, they're either
all open or all closed.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.240
If we look at the
mechanical properties

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.460
of cellular materials,
typically the cell geometry

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.960
doesn't have that
much of an effect.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.370
The relative density
is much more important.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.420
The relative density,
we define as the density

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.020
of the cellular solid.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.650
And when I use a parameter
like rho or e or something,

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.650
if it's got a star, it's
for the cellular thing

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.017
and if it's got an s,
it's for the solid.

00:42:35.017 --> 00:42:36.600
So rho star is going
to be the density

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.770
of the cellular material.

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.680
And rho s is going to be
the density of the solid

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.440
it's made from.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:05.282
And so the relative density
is just rho star over rho s.

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:06.990
And I just wanted to
show you how this is

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:08.920
the volume fraction of solids.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.800
So rho star is going
to be the mass of solid

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.047
over the total volume.

00:43:13.047 --> 00:43:15.380
Imagine you've got a honeycomb
or a foam and you've got,

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.350
say, a unit cube of
it, the sum total

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:19.375
volume of the whole
thing-- the density

00:43:19.375 --> 00:43:20.750
of the cellular
material is going

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.775
to the mass of the solid
over the whole volume.

00:43:22.775 --> 00:43:24.150
The density of
the solid is going

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:28.130
to be the mass of the solid
over the volume of the solid.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.937
This is really just equivalent
to the volume fraction

00:43:30.937 --> 00:43:32.520
of solids, how much
solids you've got.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.980
And that's also n equal
to 1 minus the porosity.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.820
Typical values for
cellular materials--

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.350
I think last time I passed
around one of those collagen

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.300
scaffolds-- those tissue
enineering scaffolds.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:03.680
It was in a little plastic bag.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.920
That collagen scaffold has
a relative density of 0.005,

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.290
so its 0.5% solid and 99.5% air.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:20.950
And if we look at
typical polymer foams,

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.510
the relative
density is typically

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:25.505
between about 2% and 20%.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.610
And if we look at something
like softwoods-- wood

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.510
is a cellular material.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:39.210
And we look at softwoods,
the relative density

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:43.860
is usually between
about 15% and about 40%.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.711
Something like that.

00:44:44.711 --> 00:44:45.210
OK?

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:51.370
As the relative
density increases,

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:53.410
you get more material
on the cell edges,

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.310
and if it's closed-cell
foam, on the cell faces.

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.480
And the pore volume decreases.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.550
And you can think of some limit.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:03.100
If you keep increasing the
relative density more and more

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.550
and more, eventually you've
got-- it's not really

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:06.950
a cellular material anymore.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:10.380
It's more like a solid with
little isolated pores in it.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.991
And so there's two bounds.

00:45:11.991 --> 00:45:14.490
And the density has to be less
than a certain amount for you

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.740
to consider it a cellular
material in the models

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.690
that we're going to
derive to be valid.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.040
And if the relevant density
is more than a certain amount,

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.373
people model it as a
solid with isolated holes.

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:10.627
If I have a unit
square of material,

00:46:10.627 --> 00:46:12.210
if it's a cellular
material, you might

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.390
expect that you've got pores
that would look like this.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.850
And you've got relatively
thin cell walls,

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:21.360
relative to the length
of the material.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.730
And for a cellular material,
typically, the relative density

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:31.290
is less than about 0.3.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:34.220
And when we come to the
modeling for the honeycombs

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:38.410
and the foams, we're going to
see that the cell walls deform,

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:40.610
in many cases, by bending.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:42.260
And that you can
model the deformation

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.780
by modeling the bending.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.340
And that the bending
dominates the behavior

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.870
if the density is
less than about that.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:52.230
And at the other
extreme, you can

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.110
imagine if you had just
little teeny pores.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.760
I have a little pore
here and one here

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.620
and one there and one there.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.350
That's not really a
cellular material.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.750
It's just got a teeny
weeny little bit of pores.

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:07.900
And that could be modeled as
isolated pores in a solid.

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.704
Each one is acting
independently.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.510
And people have found
that that is appropriate

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.440
if the relative density
is greater than about 0.8.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.430
And then, in between,
there's a transition

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.670
in behavior between
the cellular solid

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:26.830
and the isolated
pores in the solid.

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:28.020
OK?

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:28.691
Are we OK?

00:48:04.512 --> 00:48:06.720
The next thing I wanted to
talk about was unit cells.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:12.440
Especially for honeycombs,
people often use unit cells.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.450
A hexagonal cell
is an obvious one

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:18.150
to use to model this
kind of behavior.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:20.880
For honeycomb materials,
you can have unit cells

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.420
and you can have different ones.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.190
On the left here, we've got
triangles, in the middle,

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:26.610
I've got squares.

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:28.850
On the right-hand side,
I've got hexagons.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:31.130
And you can see, even if you
have a certain unit cell,

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:32.920
there's also different
ways to stack it.

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.920
So the number of edges
that meet at a vertex

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.200
is different for, say, this
example on the top left

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.950
and this example
on the bottom left.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:46.510
Here, we've got six members
coming into each vertex,

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.040
and here, we've got four.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.440
And again, this stacking
for the two square cells

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.700
is also different.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:58.070
So you can have different
numbers of edges per vertex.

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.800
Another thing to note
that's kind of interesting--

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.730
if you look at the
honeycomb cells here,

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:06.660
this one on the top left--
this equilateral triangle

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.040
one with the stacking-- and
this one on the top right--

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.790
the regular hexagonal cells--
those two are isotropic

00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:16.500
for linear elastic behavior,
whereas all the other ones are

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.650
not.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:22.890
So we have 2D
honeycomb unit cells.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:38.550
We can have triangles,
squares, and hexagons.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:40.656
They can be stacked
in more than one way.

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:53.377
And that gives different
numbers of edges per vertex.

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:04.370
And in that figure, a
and e are isotropic,

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:06.160
for linear elasticity.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:17.300
OK.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.160
When we come to
modeling the honeycombs,

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.780
we're going to focus
on the hexagonal cells.

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.300
We'll talk a little bit about
the square and triangular

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.490
cells, as well.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.371
And then, for
foams, when you look

00:50:28.371 --> 00:50:30.120
at the structure of a
foam, it's obviously

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.080
not a unit cell that
repeats over and over again.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.450
But people started off trying
to model the mechanical behavior

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:40.950
of foams by looking at periodic
repeating polyhedral cells.

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:43.540
And there's three cells
here that are prismatic.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.050
We're not really going to
talk about those beyond this.

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:49.800
So they're not really physically
realistic or interesting.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.310
But people would use these two
cells here in initial attempts

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:54.630
to model foams.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:58.220
And this one here is called
the rhombic dodecahedra.

00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.990
Rhombic because
each of the faces

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:05.770
has four sides and dodecahedra
because each polyhedra has 12

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:07.770
faces.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.640
I forget if I've bored
you with my Latin already.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.160
Hedron means face in-- oh,
this is Greek, I think.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.870
Hedron means face.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.600
Do is two, deca is 10.

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.530
So dodeca is two plus 10.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:21.930
It's got 12 faces.

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:22.700
OK?

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.870
So that's the rhombic
dodecahedra over here.

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:29.536
And then this bottom one down
here is a tetrakaidecahedra.

00:51:29.536 --> 00:51:30.410
It's a similar thing.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:32.930
Tetra's four, kai mean and.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:37.000
Four and 10-- tetra kai
deca-- it's got 14 faces.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:37.910
OK?

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:40.310
And those two pack
to fill space.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:44.320
I think those are the
only uniform polyhedra

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.900
that pack to fill space.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:51.545
Here is the 3D foams.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:52:02.640
We have the rhombic dodecahedron
and the tetrakaidecahedron.

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:38.920
And the tetrakaidecahedron
packs in a bcc packing.

00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:00.030
Initial models for foams--
they took these two unit cells.

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:02.760
And what they would do is
have an infinite array of them

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.060
to make up the whole material.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.900
And then they would
isolate a unit cell.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.900
And they would apply loads--
some say compressive stress,

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.860
for example.

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.420
And then they would figure out
what the load, or force, was

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:15.360
in every single member, and
how much that member deformed.

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.024
And they would figure
out the component

00:53:17.024 --> 00:53:18.690
of the deformation
in the same direction

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:19.820
that they were
putting the load on.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.153
And they would figure out
things like a Young's modulus,

00:53:22.153 --> 00:53:24.870
or they would figure out when
there was some failure of one

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:26.620
of these struts, and
they would figure out

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.690
a strength for the foam.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.070
But you can kind of
imagine, geometrically,

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:31.740
not that easy to keep straight.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.630
A little bit complicated.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.590
So one way to model foams is
by using these unit cells.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:38.530
But we're going to talk
about a different way

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:40.610
to do it, as well.

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:41.340
OK.

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.375
So those are unit cells.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:50.930
When they make foams,
as we just talked about,

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:54.380
one way to make a foam is by
blowing a gas into a liquid.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:57.040
And if you blow a
gas into a liquid,

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.720
then the surface
tension is going

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.420
to have an effect
on the cell geometry

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.430
and on the shape of the cells.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.890
And if the surface
tension is isotropic--

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:08.700
if it's the same in all
directions-- then the structure

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.940
that you get is one that
minimizes the surface

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.920
area per unit volume.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.560
And so people were interested
in what sort of cell shape

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.440
minimizes the surface
area per unit volume.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.530
And Lord Kelvin,
in the 1800s, was

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:22.890
the person who worked this out.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:26.550
And this is called the
Kelvin tetrakaidecahedron.

00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:29.310
And it's not just a
straight tetrakaidecahedron.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:33.160
There's a slight curvature to
the cells here, to the faces.

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.990
And you can kind of see it
in some of the edges here.

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:37.820
Like if we-- let me
get my little pointer.

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.979
If you look at that
edge, it's not straight.

00:54:39.979 --> 00:54:41.270
This edge here is not straight.

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:43.120
It's got a little bit
of a curvature to it.

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:47.360
But this minimizes the
surface area per unit volume.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.800
And then more recently,
in the 1990's, there

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.840
were two people-- Dennis Weaire
and Robert Phelan-- discovered

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.030
that this structure here--
which isn't a single polyhedron,

00:54:57.030 --> 00:55:00.410
but it's made up
of a few polyhedra.

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:03.560
That has a slightly smaller
surface area per unit volume.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.790
Smaller by 0.3%.

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.580
So, a tiny bit smaller.

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.810
OK.

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:10.370
Let's see.

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:15.360
What I'll say here is
that foams are often made

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.115
by blowing a gas into a liquid.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:40.600
And if the surface tension
controls and it's isotropic,

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.960
then the structure will
minimize the surface area

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:43.680
per unit volume.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.690
OK.

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:12.480
That's relevant if
the foam is made

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:16.820
by blowing a gas into a
liquid and surface tension

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:18.430
is the controlling factor.

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:21.620
Sometimes foams are made
by supersaturating a liquid

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:23.720
with a gas, and then
you nucleate bubbles,

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.020
and then the bubbles grow.

00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.811
So there's a nucleation
and growth process.

00:58:26.811 --> 00:58:28.400
So that's a little
bit different.

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:31.050
And if you have a nucleation
and growth process,

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:34.700
you get a structure that
is similar to something

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.940
called a Voronoi structure.

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.810
In an idealized case,
imagine that you

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:42.090
have random points that
are nucleation points

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:45.180
and that you start
to grow bubbles

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.880
at those nucleation points.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.850
So you start off with
these random points.

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:52.150
And the bubbles all start
to grow at the same time

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:54.460
and they all grow at
the same linear rate.

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.110
If you have that
situation, then you

00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:59.280
end up with this Voronoi
kind of structure.

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.660
And I've shown a
2D version of it

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.810
here just because it's
easier to see in 2D,

00:59:02.810 --> 00:59:05.320
but you can imagine a 3D system.

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.060
And in order to make one of
these Voronoi honeycombs,

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:11.571
you can imagine-- if you
have random points-- here,

00:59:11.571 --> 00:59:14.070
say that little point there is
one of the nucleation points,

00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:15.850
and here's another
point here-- you

00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:19.910
form the structure by drawing
the perpendicular bisectors

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:21.430
between each pair of points.

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:23.840
This is the bisector
between these two points.

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.100
Here's a bisector
between those two points.

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:29.260
And then you form the
envelope of those lines

00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.490
around each nucleation point.

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:33.660
And that, then, gives
you that structure.

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:36.770
And you can see, this structure
here is kind of angular.

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:39.430
It doesn't look that
representative of something

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:41.230
like a foam.

00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:43.450
But if you have an
exclusion distance,

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:46.250
where you say that you're not
going to allow the nucleation

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:49.660
points to be closer than some
given distance-- your exclusion

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:51.920
distance-- then you get
this structure here.

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.530
And this starts
to look a lot more

00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:55.340
like a foamy kind of structure.

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:58.140
So these Voronoi structures
are representative

00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.730
of structures that are
related to nucleation

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.990
and growth of the bubbles,
or nucleation and growth

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.340
processes.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:07.375
Let me write down something
about Voronoi things.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.470
And these Voronoi
structures were first

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:49.164
developed to look at
grain growth in metals.

01:00:49.164 --> 01:00:51.080
They weren't developed
for cellular materials.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.170
But you can use them to
model cellular materials,

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:57.426
as well, as long as it's a
nucleation and growth process.

01:00:59.954 --> 01:01:01.370
We'll say that
foams are sometimes

01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:24.030
made by supersaturating
a liquid with a gas,

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:26.590
and then reducing the pressure
so that the bubbles nucleate

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:27.340
and grow.

01:01:46.824 --> 01:01:48.990
So initially, the bubbles
are going to form spheres.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.410
But as the spheres
grow, they start

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:02.315
to intersect with each other
and form polyhedral cells.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.480
And you get the
Voronoi structure

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.480
by thinking about an idealized
case in which you randomly

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.760
nucleate the-- you have
nucleation points at a randomly

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.542
distributed space.

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:42.000
They start to grow
at the same time

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.720
and they grow at the
same linear rate.

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:01.250
OK.

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:13.570
The Voronoi honeycomb,
or the foam--

01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:16.680
you can form that by drawing
the perpendicular bisectors

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.775
between the random points.

01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:24.530
So each cell contains
the points that

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:30.050
are closer to the nucleation
point than any other point--

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:31.490
or any other nucleation point.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:13.070
And if we just do this process
as I've described here,

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.530
you end up with a
Voronoi structure,

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:17.850
where the cells appear
kind of angular.

01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:19.920
And if you specify an
exclusion distance,

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.140
where you say the nucleation
points can't be closer

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.890
than a certain
distance, then the cells

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:27.905
become less angular, and
of more similar size.

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:19.700
OK.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.830
So are we good with the Voronoi
honeycomb nucleation and growth

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:23.330
idea?

01:07:26.124 --> 01:07:26.624
Alrighty.

01:08:42.778 --> 01:08:43.630
All right.

01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:46.100
If we think about cell shape--
if we start with honeycombs

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:50.000
and we just think about it
hexagonal honeycombs, if I have

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.120
a regular hexagonal honeycomb
so that all the edges are

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:58.140
the same length and this
angle here is 30 degrees,

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:01.319
then that is an
isotropic material

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:03.483
in the plane in the
linear elastic regime.

01:09:26.342 --> 01:09:27.800
One of the things
we're going to do

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.279
is calculate-- if I
loan it this way on,

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:31.430
what's the Young's modulus?

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:33.660
If I load it that way on,
what's the Young's modulus?

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.300
And we're going to find they're
the same, in fact, no matter

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.399
which way on I loaded it.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:37.560
It would be the same.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.109
But if I now have my honeycomb,
and imagine that I stretched it

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:43.670
out-- and I'm kind of
exaggerating how much we

01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:45.370
might stretch it out.

01:09:45.370 --> 01:09:47.100
But if we did
something like that,

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.220
it wouldn't be too surprising
to think that the properties are

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.220
going to be different if
I loaded it this way on

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.080
and that way on.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.810
And in terms of
the cell geometry,

01:09:55.810 --> 01:10:00.520
I'm going to call that
vertical cell edge length h.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.860
And I'm going to call this one--
the inclined one-- of length l.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:08.140
I'm going to say that
angle is the angle theta.

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.160
And the cell shape can be
defined by the ratio of h

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.070
over l and that angle theta.

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.840
OK.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.770
When we derive equations for
the mechanical properties

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:24.250
of the honeycombs, we're
going to find that they depend

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:25.970
on some solid properties.

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:27.880
Say, the modulus
of the honeycombs

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.615
can depend on the
modulus of the solid.

01:10:29.615 --> 01:10:31.740
It's going to depend on
the relative density raised

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:32.490
to some power.

01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:34.100
And we're going to
figure out what that is.

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.599
And then it's going
to depend, also,

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:37.910
on some function of
h over l and theta.

01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:40.210
And that function really
represents the contribution

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:44.680
of the cell geometry to
the mechanical properties.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:45.180
OK.

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:47.300
That's the honeycombs.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:51.230
It's fairly straightforward to
characterize the shell shape

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:53.420
for the honeycombs.

01:10:53.420 --> 01:11:00.000
It's a little more involved
to do it for the foams.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.880
And the technique that's used
is called the mean intercept

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.380
length.

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.545
At least, that's one
technique that's used.

01:11:05.545 --> 01:11:06.920
Let me wait until
you've finished

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.300
writing because
I want you to see

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:11.270
the picture as I talk about it.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:13.410
OK?

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:13.910
OK.

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:14.770
Here's-- whoops.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.730
My pointer keeps disappearing.

01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:20.850
This top left picture here
shows an SEM image of a foam.

01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:23.770
And you can see, you've got
some big cells and little cells

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:28.530
and there's no obvious way to
characterize the cell shape.

01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:31.620
And what people do to calculate
this mean intercept length

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.170
is they would take an image.

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:38.090
They would then sketch
out just the cell edges

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:39.780
that touch a plane's surface.

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.210
So all these black
lines are just the--

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:44.620
if you took your-- if
you put ink on your foam

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:47.810
and you just put it on a pad
and put it on a piece of paper,

01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:50.600
you would get this outline of
the edges of the cells, where

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.300
they intersect that plane.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.480
And then what people do
is they draw test circles.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.680
Here's the test circle here.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.870
And they draw parallel
equiaxed, or equidistant lines.

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:03.420
So the lines here are parallel.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.050
They're all at,
say, zero degrees.

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:07.110
And they're all the
same distance apart.

01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:09.970
And then they count the
number of intercepts.

01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:13.060
They count-- say
we went out here.

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:14.530
The cell wall intercepts here.

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.157
There's one that
intercepts here.

01:12:16.157 --> 01:12:17.240
And then, it'd go up here.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.330
Here's another intercept.

01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:19.371
Here's another intercept.

01:12:19.371 --> 01:12:22.470
So they count the number of
intercepts of the cell wall

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:23.830
with the lines.

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:26.150
And then they get a
mean intercept length,

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:30.177
which is characteristic
of the cell dimension.

01:12:30.177 --> 01:12:32.010
And then what they do--
because this is just

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:34.240
in one orientation--
you would then

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.289
rotate those parallel
lines by, say, 5 degrees

01:12:37.289 --> 01:12:38.330
and do it all over again.

01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:40.121
And get another length
at 5 degrees and one

01:12:40.121 --> 01:12:41.760
at 10 degrees one at 15.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.290
And so you get different
lengths for the intercepts

01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:46.860
as you rotate your
parallel lines around.

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.610
And then you make a
polar plot, and that's

01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:50.680
what the thing is down
at the bottom here.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.240
And so you plot your
mean intercept length

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:56.480
as a function of the angle
that you measured it at.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.399
And you can fit
it to an ellipse.

01:12:58.399 --> 01:12:59.940
And if you do it in
three dimensions,

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.890
you fit it to an ellipsoid.

01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:06.660
And the major and minor axes
of that ellipse, or ellipsoid,

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:09.816
are characteristic of
how elongated the cell is

01:13:09.816 --> 01:13:10.982
in the different directions.

01:13:10.982 --> 01:13:13.000
And the orientation
of that ellipsoid

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.450
is characteristic of the
orientation of the cells.

01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:19.490
Those of you who took 303, too,
you remember Mohr's circles?

01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:21.200
Is this beginning
to look familiar?

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.810
It's the same kind of
idea as Mohr's circles.

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:26.340
Same way we have principal
stresses and orientation

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.160
of principal stresses, now
we have principal dimensions

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.160
and the orientation of
the principal dimensions.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.830
So it's the same kind of idea.

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:35.230
OK?

01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:36.230
Let's see.

01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:39.410
I feel like I'm getting
to the end here.

01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:42.300
Maybe I'll stop there for today.

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.840
But next time, I'll write
down the whole technique

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.030
about how we get
these mean intercepts

01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:49.770
and get this ellipsoid.

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:54.524
And I'm going to write the mean
intercepts down as a matrix.

01:13:54.524 --> 01:13:56.190
But you could also
write it as a tensor.

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:57.815
And there's something
called the fabric

01:13:57.815 --> 01:14:00.860
tensor, which characterizes
the shape of the cells.

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:03.280
And as you might imagine, the
same is with the honeycomb.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.770
If you have equiaxed
cells in the foams,

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:09.010
you might expect you would
get isotropic properties.

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:12.650
If you have cells that are
stretched out in some way--

01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:16.930
so you've got different
principal dimensions for them--

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:19.130
then you've got
anisotropic material.

01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:21.730
And you can relate how much
anisotropy to the shape

01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:22.681
of the cells.

01:14:22.681 --> 01:14:23.180
OK.

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.040
I'm going to stop
there for today.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.100
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.110
Seems very sudden.

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:30.820
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.010
I'll pick up and I'll finish
this section on the structure.

01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:35.159
We've got a bit more to do.

01:14:35.159 --> 01:14:37.450
And then we'll start looking
at honeycombs and modeling

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:38.480
honeycombs.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.950
The honeycombs are
simpler to model

01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:42.480
just because they have
this nice simple unit cell.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.490
So we'll start with
that, and then we'll

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:46.000
move from there to the foams.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.550
OK?
