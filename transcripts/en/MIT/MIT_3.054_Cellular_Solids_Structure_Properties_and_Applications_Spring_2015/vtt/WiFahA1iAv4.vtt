LORNA GIBSON: All right.

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:30.120
And I really wanted to show
you my little hook video

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.380
and I downloaded it so I
thought we'd start just

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.040
by watching that and then I'll
pick up about modeling phones.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.330
So this takes like
nine or 10 minutes,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.805
but I just thought it was cute.

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:42.430
And I made it and I
want you to see it.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.594
So let's do that to start.

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:45.260
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.780
We're here at the Harvard
University Botany Library,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.070
looking at a first edition of
Robert Hooke's Micrographia,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.850
published--

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.920
How do I get rid
of the bar, Greg?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.710
Oh, there it is.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.855
show the microscopic
structure of materials.

00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:00.930
And it has a number of
remarkable drawings in it.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.870
Here we see drawings of silk.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.120
These are two different silks.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.450
On the top here, we
have a fine-waled silk.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.240
And in this more details
drawing down here,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.510
you can see the patterned
weaving of the silk.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.960
The bottom image here is
a drawing of watered silk.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.760
And over here, there's another
higher magnification image.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.480
And you can see the pattern
here is more sharply angled.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.070
And it appears that
this sharper angle here

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.570
gives the different texture to
the surface finish of the silk.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.912
So here we see a
drawing of charred wood.

00:01:34.912 --> 00:01:37.370
And one of the things I find
interesting about this drawing

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.945
is how similar it is to modern
electron micrographs which

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:42.130
we've seen before.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.190
And in this drawing, we can
see two of the main features.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.340
We see these small cells,
which are fibers that provide

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.960
structural support to the tree.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.620
And we see these
larger cells here,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.330
which are vessels
which allow fluids

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.490
to go up and down the tree.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.730
And here we see a drawing of
the surface of a rosemary leaf,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.085
with the unexpected,
tiny, little bars.

00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:02.710
And this is something
that you can only

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.830
see with the microscope.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.960
You wouldn't expect to
see those when you just

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.860
feel the surface of
the rosemary leaf.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.068
So it's kind of interesting
that with the microscope,

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:14.250
you can see these features that
are invisible to the naked eye.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.260
One of the main themes
of material science

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.030
is that the property
of materials

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.776
are related to their structure.

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:21.540
And so being able
to see the structure

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.560
at a microscopic
scale is very helpful.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.221
And today, we can even see the
structure at the atomic scale.

00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:30.600
Robert Hooke
understood this idea.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.620
And in the description
of the cork,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.820
Hooke states, "I
no sooner discerned

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.100
these-- which were the first
microscopical pores I ever

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.420
saw-- but methought that I had
with the discovery of them,

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.630
perfectly hinted to me the true
and intelligible reason for all

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.620
of the phenomena of cork."

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.200
So what he's saying here is
that by looking at the structure

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.850
and looking at the cells
here in the drawing,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.780
he thinks he can understand
the properties of cork

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.000
or the phenomena of cork.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.600
What was it about
Robert Hooke that

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.110
allowed him to make this book?

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.110
Why was it him and
not somebody else?

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.560
Well, Robert Hooke had kind
of an interesting history.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.160
He grew up on the Isle of Wight.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.110
And as a boy, he
loved making drawings.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.500
And he got quite skilled
at making drawings.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.420
The other thing was, he loved
making models of things.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.030
He made models of ships.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.560
He made a wooden clock
that was a working

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.370
clock when he was a kid.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.800
And as a teenager,
he moved to London.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.080
And he became an apprentice
to Sir Peter Lilley,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.680
who was a famous
painter of the time.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.560
So his drawing was good enough
that he would be working

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.370
with a very well-known painter.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.410
After he did that, he went
to the Westminister School.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.810
And he studied classics.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.020
He studied mathematics.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.880
But he also learned
to use a lathe.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.920
And this was also very
helpful in him making

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.520
various sorts of apparatus.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.300
And as a student at
Oxford, he worked

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.410
in the lab of Robert Boyle.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.060
And his job in that lab was to
develop scientific apparatus.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.390
And he did things
like he built pumps

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.270
that allowed Robert Boyle
to do the experiments that

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.800
led to Boyle's Law.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.150
When he returned to
London after Oxford,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.950
he became the Curator
of Experiments

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.430
at the Royal Society.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.590
And one of the things he
did was he got a microscope.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.904
He improved that microscope,
increasing their magnification,

00:04:13.904 --> 00:04:16.279
which was what allowed him to
make the beautiful drawings

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.630
that we see today.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.450
And here in the
preface of the book,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.890
we see that he even made a
drawing of his microscope.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.310
So this thing down here-- this
is Robert Hooke's microscope.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.950
The development
of new microscopes

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.750
with higher and
higher magnifications

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.540
continues to this day.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.090
Scanning electron microscopes
were invented in the 1960s.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.600
And today, we have transmission
electron microscopes

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.220
and atomic force
microscopes with even higher

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.760
magnifications.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.360
At these higher
magnifications, we

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.960
can see details that Hooke
was unable to see because

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.110
of the limitations
of the microscope

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.290
that he had-- the
optical microscope.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.960
But it's interesting
to see today

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.760
the images we see in
a scanning electron

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.920
microscope at a similar
magnification to those

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.580
that Hooke saw in his
optical microscope.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.860
And it's remarkable to see
how many of the features

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.000
that we see in these much
more fancy microscopes

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.220
that he was able to
capture in his drawings

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.270
with his simple
optical microscope.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.770
So here we have a
picture of cork.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.240
We have Hooke's drawings showing
two perpendicular planes.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.130
We also have this nice, little
drawing of a cork branch here.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.340
Cork is the bark from
the cork oak tree.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.330
And in Hooke's drawings
of the microstructure,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.990
we can see these cells
here are roughly box-like.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.970
They're more or
less rectangular.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.257
And these cells here look
more or less circular.

00:05:31.257 --> 00:05:33.090
So there's these two
different perpendicular

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.750
planes in the cork.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.220
And when we look at these
scanning electron micrographs,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.390
we can see very
similar structure.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.750
There are some cells
that are roughly boxlike,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.030
and others that are more or less
hexagonal or roughly rounded.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.850
One feature that Hooke was
not able to see, though,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.440
that you do see on the
scanning electron micrographs,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.580
is the waviness
in the cell walls.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.830
And that was because the
resolution of his microscope

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.070
was insufficient to see
that level of detail.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.690
And here in this
illustration on the bottom

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.740
here is a drawing of sponge.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.380
And when we look at the
scanning electron micrograph,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.320
we see that the structure is
remarkably similar to what

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.870
Hooke has drawn.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.270
So here we have Hooke's
drawing of feathers.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.420
And we can see he's made several
drawings at different length

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.530
scales.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.630
And if we look at this one
here, we see the barbule.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.400
And you can see these
little hooked regions there.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.310
And those hooks lock
into the little feathers

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.050
over on this side over here
of the adjacent barbule.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.070
And in the higher
magnification picture,

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.000
you can see on one barbule,
there's hooks on one side

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.690
but not on the other.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.740
And it's this hooking of
the two sections together

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.060
that allows the
feathers to maintain

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.967
a smooth surface for the
wing when the bird is flying.

00:06:49.967 --> 00:06:51.550
And you can see the
same sort of thing

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.258
when you look at the
electron micrograph.

00:06:53.258 --> 00:06:57.320
So you can see the little hooks
on one side of the barbules.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.830
And you can see how they
interconnect together

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.570
with the next barb.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.580
One of the most reproduced
images from Hooke's book

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.037
is that of the flea--
this image we see here.

00:07:07.037 --> 00:07:07.870
And you can see why.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.460
It's a gorgeous image.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.330
And it shows details that
people had never seen before.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.450
People were amazed to see that
the little flea that they might

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.540
have found on their
dog or something

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.580
was actually made up
of this compound body,

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.570
with all these little plates
and little hairs here.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.530
And you can see these little
tiny claws on the legs,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.220
and the legs have
all these hairs.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.850
Nobody had any idea that
this is what a flea actually

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:31.840
looked like.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.640
And so it was an
amazing drawing.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.090
And it was something that
people were just stunned by when

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.620
Hooke's book came out.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.030
And if we look at a modern
electron micrograph,

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.210
we can see it's
remarkably similar if we

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.280
look at the same magnification.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.170
So Hooke showed many
of the same details,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.750
showed some of the
same hairs on the legs,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.760
showed the same sorts of
plates, showed the claws

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.450
at the ends of the legs.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.340
And our modern image is probably
from a different species

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:58.840
of flea.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.820
We don't know what
species of flea

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.160
that Hooke actually looked at.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.118
But you can see there's
a tremendous similarity

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:05.297
between the two images.

00:08:05.297 --> 00:08:07.130
And it's remarkable how
many of the features

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.730
that Hooke was able to
capture in his drawing.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.220
And here we have the
compound eye of the fly.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.450
And this, again, was astonishing
to people in Hooke's day.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.960
And even today, people
look at this image,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.230
and they're pretty amazed at
the detail in this drawing.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.750
And again, we can compare
this with a modern electron

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.850
micrograph.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.880
And again, you can
see the similarities

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.090
between what Hooke
saw and what we

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.909
see in a modern scanning
electron microscope

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.030
at a similar magnification.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.600
In the 1980s, atomic
force microscopes

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.320
were invented, which have
a resolution down to tens

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.710
of nanometers.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.380
And today, there's transmission
electron microscopes,

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.820
which allow you to see
the atomic structure.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.750
So for instance in
a crystal lattice,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.090
you can see the individual
atoms and the regular crystal

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.040
structure.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.990
Today, most experimental
studies of materials

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.790
include photographs of
the microscopic structure

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.420
of the material taken through
some sort of microscope.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.090
And the remarkable thing is
that all of these studies

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.540
really trace back
to this book here

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.947
that we're looking at today--
to Robert Hooke's Micrographia.

00:09:11.947 --> 00:09:12.530
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.350
There you have it.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.530
So I just thought
that was kind of cute.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.405
You might enjoy that.

00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:18.170
So that was that.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.820
All right, let's
get out of there.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.320
Stop.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.000
So let's go back to the foams.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.690
So I think last
time, we got as far

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.400
as talking about the linear
elastic behavior of foams

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.785
and modeling that.

00:09:33.785 --> 00:09:36.060
But we didn't quite
get to looking

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.949
at the compressive
strength of the foam.

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:39.490
So I think we got
as far as comparing

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.020
the models with
these equations here,

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.720
and these plots of the data.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.494
And what I wanted to
pick up with today

00:09:47.494 --> 00:09:49.160
was looking at the
compressive strength.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.730
And we'll look at the fracture
toughness as well in tension.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.520
So we're going to
start with nonlinear

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.055
elasticity and the
elastic collapse stress.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:15.750
So if we have an open-cell
foam, the derivation

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.910
for the elastic collapse
stress is really

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.370
pretty straightforward.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.840
We say the elastic
collapse occurs

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.120
when the cell walls buckles.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.980
So in this schematic here,
you can see the vertical cell

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.120
walls have buckled.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.490
And so there's going to
be some Euler load that's

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.310
related to that buckling.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.920
And that's just the usual
Euler load-- n squared, the n

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.780
constraint factor,
pi squared E. This

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.110
is going to be E of
the solid, I over l

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.300
squared-- the length
of the member.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.310
And then the stress
that corresponds to that

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.810
is just going to be proportional
to that buckling load

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.440
over the area of the
cell, which is just

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.000
l squared, so just P
critical over l squared.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.820
So that just goes as Es.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.760
I is going to go
as t to the fourth,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.737
because we have that
square sectioned member.

00:11:04.737 --> 00:11:06.320
And now this is going
to be l squared.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.850
And that's an l squared.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.830
So that's l to the fourth.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.030
And so if I combine
all of that together,

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.800
I can say that the elastic
buckling stress is going

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.420
to be some constant-- and
I think we're up to C4

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.650
now-- times the Young's
modulus of the solid times

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.130
the relative density
of the foam squared.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:33.270
So that's our equation for
the elastic buckling stress.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.900
And if you compare
this with data,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.050
you can make an
estimate of what C4 is.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:45.190
And we find that
C4 is about 0.05.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.130
And you can also
say that 0.05 really

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.220
corresponds to the strain at
which the buckling occurs.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.470
Because the Young's modulus
goes as the constants 1 times

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.310
Es times the relative
density squared.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.030
So the strain's just going to
be the stress over the modulus.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.615
So that does correspond
to the strain.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.650
So that's saying that
buckling compressive stress

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.145
occurs at a strain of about 5%.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.470
So that's open cells.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.670
And then if we look
at closed cells,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.829
if you recall when we
looked at the moduli

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:35.370
we looked at a couple
of extra terms.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.609
One was associated with face
stretching for the modulus.

00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:40.650
And the other was associated
with the compression

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.920
of the gas.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.834
For the buckling, the
faces don't really

00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:46.250
contribute that much, because
typically the faces are very

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.240
thin relative to the struts.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.850
And because they're
so thin, they

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.730
buckle at a much lower load, and
they don't contribute too much.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.450
So we're not going to worry
about that contribution.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.360
So I'm just going to say that
the thickness of the face

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.960
is often small
compared to the edges.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:18.060
And that really is from the
surface tension in processing

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.525
that draws material away from
the face and into the edges.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.550
There can be some contribution
from the internal pressure.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.220
So if the internal
pressure is greater

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.350
than atmospheric pressure,
then the cell walls

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.870
are pre-tensioned, and you'd
have to account for that.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.310
So the buckling would have to
overcome that pressure as well.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.370
So then you would have
the buckling stress

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.920
would just be what we
have up there-- C4 times

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.560
Es times the relative
density squared.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:38.070
And then we just add on that
factor P0 minus P atmospheric.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.336
The thing with the gas
which tends to affect more

00:14:40.336 --> 00:14:41.710
than the buckling
stress, though,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.860
is the post-collapse behavior.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.830
So let me just show you
a couple of things here.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.290
So here's some data for the
elastic collapse stress.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.600
And you can see on
the y-axis, we've

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.460
got the stress normalized by the
Young's modulus of the solid.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.140
And on the x-axis, we've
got the relative density.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.660
And that solid line there--
sort of solid, dark line--

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.610
is that equation there, which
is the same as this one up here.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.237
And you can see the data
lie fairly close to that.

00:15:11.237 --> 00:15:13.320
But what's interesting is
if you look at the-- why

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.153
is this not working?

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:19.610
Maybe my batteries finally died.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.600
If we look at the
post-collapse behavior,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.450
you can see if these are
the stress-strain curves,

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.110
they're not flat here.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.920
They have some rise to them.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.692
And this is a closed-cell foam.

00:15:33.692 --> 00:15:35.400
And you can imagine
as you're compressing

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.910
the closed-cell
foam, you're reducing

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.200
the volume of the cell.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.408
And as you doing that, you're
increasing the pressure

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:43.060
inside the cell from the gas.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.880
And you can calculate
what that is.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.540
And I'll do that in a second.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.810
And if you subtract off that
gas pressure contribution,

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.090
that works out to
this line here.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:56.320
Then these lines will
be more flat, like this.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.270
And we already really
pretty much worked

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.521
out that gas contribution.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:13.360
So I'll just say for the
post-collapse behavior,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.900
the stress rises due
to the gas compression.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.201
And that's as long as
the faces don't rupture.

00:16:33.252 --> 00:16:34.710
So if you have an
elastomeric foam,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.918
typically they don't rupture.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.760
And what we had
worked out before

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.185
was that that
pressure-- we called

00:16:46.185 --> 00:16:51.360
it P prime-- it was P0
minus P atmospheric-- that

00:16:51.360 --> 00:17:00.340
was equal to P0 times
the amount of strain,

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:06.609
epsilon, times 1 minus 2
times the Poisson's ratio

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:12.795
divided by 1 minus
epsilon times 1 minus 2 nu

00:17:12.795 --> 00:17:13.920
minus the relative density.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.530
And once you get to
the buckling stress,

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.573
then the Poisson's
ratio becomes 0.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.270
So if you take a foam-- so I
brought a little foam in so you

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.580
can play around with this one--
so if you take a foam like this

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.090
and you compress it, once
you've buckled it like this,

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.632
it's not getting
any wider this way.

00:17:45.632 --> 00:17:47.340
And part of the reason
for that is you've

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.540
got all these pores in here.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.660
And the cells just
collapse into the pores.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.755
They don't really need
to move out sideways.

00:17:52.755 --> 00:17:54.380
So you can smush that
yourself, and try

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.480
to convince yourself that the
Poisson's ratio is just 0.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.770
Yes, Matt.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:05.405
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I guess
I want to measure [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:05.405 --> 00:18:06.787
the gas contribution?

00:18:06.787 --> 00:18:08.620
LORNA GIBSON: Yes, so
there is a strain rate

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.940
effect with these things.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.648
But I wasn't going to
get into that here.

00:18:11.648 --> 00:18:13.900
If you look in the book,
it's described in the book.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.320
So I think there's two things.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.537
One is that the solid itself
can have a rate dependency.

00:18:18.537 --> 00:18:20.370
And then there could
be something connected.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.194
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah, I mean, I'm
not going to go into that here.

00:18:24.194 --> 00:18:27.720
But one could look at that.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.790
So let me just write
down one more thing here,

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.180
because if we let nu be
0, then this thing here

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.035
becomes simpler.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.330
So we could say the
stress post collapse

00:18:53.330 --> 00:19:03.190
as a function of strain would
be our buckling stress and then

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.566
plus this factor here.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.350
So that curve on the
bottom over here--

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.350
if this is the stress-strain
curve-- this little

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.210
dashed line here-- that's
the gas contribution.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.257
And that is this term here.

00:19:39.257 --> 00:19:41.340
So you can kind of see how
the shape of the curves

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.035
reflects that gas contribution.

00:19:43.035 --> 00:19:44.410
And when you
subtract it out, you

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.245
get pretty much a horizontal
plateau over here.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.230
Are we happy?

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.230
Yeah?

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.620
LORNA GIBSON: This is
for the closed cell.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.120
Because the closed
cell are the ones

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.118
that are going to
have the gas pressure.

00:20:01.118 --> 00:20:03.576
If it's open cells, the gas
can just move out of the cells.

00:20:03.576 --> 00:20:04.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.059
LORNA GIBSON: Oh, sorry,
that was to show you

00:20:07.059 --> 00:20:08.350
that the Poisson's ratio was 0.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.725
And that's true
for both of them.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.250
So then we can look at the
plastic collapse stress.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.710
Say we had a metal foam.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.800
And we do a calculation
a little bit

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.080
like the one we did for
the honeycombs, too.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.130
So we say the failure occurs
when the applied moment equals

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.210
the plastic moment.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.950
And the applied
moment is proportional

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.736
to the applied stress
times the length cubed.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.940
So I'm going to call that
applied stress-- our strength

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.920
sigma star plastic
times the length cubed.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.760
So if you think of, say, the
little schematic up here,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.230
the force is going to
go with stress times

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.439
the length squared.

00:21:17.439 --> 00:21:19.480
And the moment's going to
force times the length.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:26.100
So it's the stress
times the length cubed.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:33.010
And then the plastic moment
goes as the yield strength

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.300
times the thickness cubed.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.950
And then if I just
combine those,

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.760
I get that the plastic
collapse stress in compression

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.550
is another constant-- I'm going
to call it C5-- times the yield

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:55.921
strength times the relative
density to the 3/2 power.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.610
And if we look at data,
we find that the constant

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:11.080
is about equal to 0.3.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.290
And if I go to the
next slide, here's

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:22.480
a plot of the yield strength or
the plastic collapse strength

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.840
of the foam divided by the
yield strength of the solid,

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.900
plotted against the
relative density.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.410
And that dark, bold line
is this equation here.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.187
And you can see the data lie
pretty well on that line.

00:22:33.187 --> 00:22:35.520
There's one data set that's
a little bit above the line.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.470
But you can see the slope
of that data set is still

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.116
about 3/2.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.240
OK, and the same as
in the honeycombs,

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.640
we could say that we
can get elastic collapse

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.070
before the plastic collapse
if we were at a low density.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.100
You can get the same
thing in the foams.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.510
And you calculate out what the
critical relative density is

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.280
for that the same kind of way.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:42.690
So we can say we can get
elastic collapse precedes

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:51.450
the plastic collapse
if the elastic buckling

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:57.190
stress is less than the
plastic collapse stress.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:02.772
So all we do is make those
two things equal to figure out

00:24:02.772 --> 00:24:04.230
the critical relative
density where

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.104
you get the transition
from one to the other.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:28.000
So the relative density has to
be less than 36 times the yield

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.910
strength of the solid
over the Young's modulus

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:38.070
of the solid squared in order
to get buckling before yielding.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.570
And let's see, where
can I put that?

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.390
So for rigid
polymers, that ratio

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.140
of the strength of the solid
over the modulus of the solid

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.528
is about one over 30.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:00.420
And so the critical relative
density for the transition

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.130
is about 0.04.

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.130
So you'd have to have a
pretty low-density foam,

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.850
but it's possible.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:18.300
And for metals, that
ratio is about 1/1,000.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.960
And then the critical transition
density is less than 10

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.437
to the minus 5.

00:25:25.437 --> 00:25:27.645
So essentially, it never
happens for the metal foams.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.100
And then for the
closed-cell foams,

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.860
we could include the
terms for face stretching

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.080
and for the gas.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.690
But in practice, the faces don't
really contribute very much.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.900
And typically for foams
like say metal foams

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.616
or a rigid polymer that had a
yield point, the faces rupture.

00:26:03.616 --> 00:26:05.240
And then if the faces
rupture, then you

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.986
don't get the gas
compression term, either.

00:26:07.986 --> 00:26:09.610
So I'll just write
the full thing down.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.475
But typically, you
don't need to use it.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.110
So the first term would
be from the edges bending.

00:27:06.439 --> 00:27:08.730
And the second term would be
from the faces stretching.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.160
And this would be from the gas.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.410
But in practice, the first
term is really the only one

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.120
that is significant.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.699
So for closed-cell
foam, this equation

00:27:54.699 --> 00:27:56.240
works pretty well,
too-- the same one

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.537
as for the open-cell foams.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.850
OK, so if we had, say, a
ceramic foam that was brittle,

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.790
there'd be a brittle
crushing strength.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.790
And then we get failure
when the applied moment

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.630
M is equal to the
fracture moment Mf.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.810
And this works very similar
to the plastic yield strength.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.090
So we find the
applied moment goes

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:13.310
as the global stress
times the length cubed.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:18.230
And the fracture moment goes
into the cell wall strength

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.946
times the cell wall
thickness cubed.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.460
So the brittle
crushing strength goes

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.580
as another constant-- let's
call it C6-- times the wall

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.580
strength times the relative
density to the 3/2 again.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:47.330
And C6 is about equal to 0.2.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.620
And typically, ceramic
foams have open cells.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.920
So I'm just going to leave it at
the open-celled formula there.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.850
So there's one last thing
for the compressive behavior,

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.210
and that's the
densification strain.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.080
And we just have an
empirical relationship

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.740
for the densification strain.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.450
So if you compress the foam and
you get to very large strains,

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.770
then the cell walls
start to touch,

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:26.825
and the stress starts
to rise steeply.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:28.700
And there's some strain
at which that occurs.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.970
And we call that the
densification strain.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.970
And in the limit, the
modulus at that point

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.830
would go to the
modulus of the solid.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.150
If you could completely
squeeze all the pores out,

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.269
the stiffness of that would go
to the modulus of the solid.

00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:43.810
And you might expect that that
densification strain is just 1

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.930
minus the relative
density, but it actually

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.680
occurs at a slightly
smaller strain.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.110
So in a large compressive
stress, or strain,

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.205
I guess we could say,
cell walls touch,

00:31:02.205 --> 00:31:03.830
and we start to get
this densification.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.500
So the modulus in
the limit would

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.900
go to the modulus of the solid.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:41.800
And you might expect
that the densification

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:47.570
strain was just equal to 1
minus the relative density.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.100
But it occurs at a little
bit less than that.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:55.780
So empirically, we find that
it's just 1 minus 1.4 times

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.850
the relative density.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.640
And then I have this
plot here, which

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.565
is really just fitting a line
to that data for densification

00:32:03.565 --> 00:32:04.065
strain.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.060
So those equations describe
the compressive stress

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.940
or the compressive
behavior of the foam.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.670
So we've got the moduli, we've
got the three compressive

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.210
strengths, and we've got
the densification strain.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.420
So what we're going to do
later on in the course is

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.010
we'll use those
models to look at how

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.220
we can use foams and
things like sandwich panels

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.102
and looking at
energy absorption.

00:32:32.102 --> 00:32:34.060
And we'll also look at
these equations in terms

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.080
of some biomedical materials--
looking at trabecular bone,

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.979
and looking at tissue
engineering scaffolds.

00:32:39.979 --> 00:32:42.020
So there's one last property
I wanted to go over,

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.610
and that's the
fracture toughness.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.360
So if we were pulling
the foam in tension,

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.894
and we had a crack
in the foam, we'd

00:32:46.894 --> 00:32:48.810
want to know what the
fracture toughness would

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.170
be for a brittle foam.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.550
And this follows the
same sort of argument

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.752
as we had for the honeycomb.

00:32:53.752 --> 00:32:55.460
So all of these
equations really are just

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.411
following the same
kinds of arguments.

00:32:58.411 --> 00:33:00.410
But you can kind of see
how having the honeycomb

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:05.810
calculations makes it
easier to do the foam ones.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.340
So we'll do the fracture
toughness calculation,

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.970
and then I want to talk a little
bit about material selection

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.830
and selection charts for foams.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.210
So that's less equation-y.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.700
OK, and we're just going
to look at open cells here.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.660
So imagine we have a
crack of length 2a.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.890
And we have some
remote stress applied,

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:09.510
so remote tensile stress, so
I'm going to call that sigma

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.830
infinity-- the far-away stress.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:16.090
And then we have a local
stress on the cell walls.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:19.730
I'm going to call
that signal local.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.552
So I have a little
schematic that kind of

00:34:21.552 --> 00:34:22.510
shows what we're doing.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.260
So we're pulling on it.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.139
There's some crack.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.580
The crack length is large
compared to the cell size.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.389
And we want to know what
the fracture toughness is.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:36.110
So we can say from fracture
mechanics the local stress is

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.540
going to be equal to
some constant times

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:43.389
the faraway stress times
the square root of pi a

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:46.380
over the square root of 2 pi r.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.329
And that's at a distance r
from the head of the crack tip.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.190
And if we look at our
little schematic here,

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.580
we could say it's hard to say
exactly where the crack tip is,

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.100
but it would be
somewhere in here.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.160
And we'd say this
next unbroken cell

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.810
wall is a distance r
ahead of the crack tip.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.580
And that r is going
to be related to l.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.560
It's going to be
some function of l.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:34.000
So I can say the next unbroken
wall ahead of the crack tip

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.280
at some distance r is
going to be related to l.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:45.950
And that's subject
to a force, which

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:48.125
is going to be the local
stress times l squared.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.500
So that force is going to go as
local stress times l squared.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.140
And the local stress-- I can
substitute this thing here

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.910
in-- that's going
to be proportional

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.160
to the faraway stress.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.874
And I'm going to
get rid of the pi's.

00:36:05.874 --> 00:36:07.290
And I'm going to
substitute for r.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.690
I'm going to put in l.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.940
So it's going to be proportional
to the faraway stress

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.907
times the root of a over l
and times l squared there.

00:36:20.862 --> 00:36:22.320
And then we're
going to say, again,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.430
the edges are going to fail
when the applied moment equals

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.300
the fracture moment.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.590
And the fracture
moment is going to go

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:53.640
as the modulus of rupture of
the cell walls times t cubed.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.480
And the applied moment is
going to go as f times l.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.900
And I've got f from
up there, so that

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.910
goes as the faraway
stress, sigma infinite,

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.200
times the root of a over l.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.340
And now I've got l
cubed, because there's

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.740
an l squared there and
there's an l down here.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.960
And then if I just
equate those, then this

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:23.110
is going to go as sigma fs
times t cubed, like that.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:26.780
So then I can say
the fracture strength

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.090
is equal to my faraway stress.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.560
That's going to go as my
modulus of rupture times

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:40.396
the root of l for a
times t over l cubed.

00:37:40.396 --> 00:37:41.770
And then my fracture
toughness is

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:45.150
going to be this tensile
stress times the root of pi a.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.610
So there's going to be some
other constant here, which

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.405
I'm going to call that C8.

00:37:59.405 --> 00:38:03.070
We've got the modulus
of rupture of the solid.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.030
I've got the square
root of l, and I'm

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.317
going to multiply it by pi
so it's like other fraction

00:38:07.317 --> 00:38:08.525
mechanics kinds of equations.

00:38:13.054 --> 00:38:15.220
And then we multiply that
times the relative density

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.484
to the 3/2 power.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:23.320
And here, if we look at data,
we find that that constant

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:28.840
is about equal to 0.65.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.760
And here's another
one of these plots.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.240
So here I've normalized the
fracture toughness of the foams

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.920
by the modulus of
rupture of the cell

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.770
walls times the root of pi l.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.334
So I've taken the cell
size into account here,

00:38:40.334 --> 00:38:42.250
and I've plotted against
the relative density.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.720
And that equation
there is the same

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.900
as this equation I've
got down on the board.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.360
And this is the only
one of the properties

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.570
that we've looked at that
depends on the cell size.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.350
There's a cell size
dependence here.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:11.755
All right, so I think that's
all the modeling of the foams.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.910
Are we good?

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:21.240
I gave you a lot of equations.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:21.850
We're good?

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:22.350
All right.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.410
So I want to talk about
how we might design foams

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:17.625
to improve their properties.

00:40:17.625 --> 00:40:19.000
And then I want
to talk about how

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.890
we might select foams
for certain applications

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.100
and look at selection charts.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.350
So when we've been talking
about the foams, especially

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.080
the open-cell foams,
we've been saying

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.990
their deformation is largely
by bending of the cell edges.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.720
And if we could do
something to increase

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.710
the stiffness of the edges
or the strength of the edges,

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:41.180
then that would increase the
overall properties of the foam.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:44.150
And there's a couple of ways
to think about doing that.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.600
So the foam
properties-- if the foam

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.270
is controlled by
bending of the edges,

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.190
and the edges have
some flexural rigidity,

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.790
EI, if we could increase
that EI of the edges,

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:56.730
we would increase the
properties of the foam.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:59.980
And one way to do that is
by making the edges hollow.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:03.540
So if we had hollow
edges, and you had a tube,

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.270
then that would increase the EI.

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.870
And we can work out how much
it's going to increase them.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:16.520
And I have a little example
here of-- a natural example

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.150
of hollow foam struts.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:24.677
So this is a grass.

00:41:24.677 --> 00:41:26.260
I don't know what
kind of grass it is.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.379
I just saw this grass.

00:41:27.379 --> 00:41:28.920
And we picked some
different grasses,

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.440
and we took some SEM pictures.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.270
And it has a really kind of
common structure for grasses.

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.730
It's very common for
grass stems to have

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:42.130
sort of a solid outer part and
then a foam-like inner part.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.310
It's so common that
botanists have a name for it.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.060
They call it the
core-rind structure.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.440
And if you take
one of these grass

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.780
stems, and you look at the sort
of foamy bit in the middle,

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.426
and you do a SEM
picture of that,

00:41:54.426 --> 00:41:56.550
you can see that the little
cell walls are actually

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:57.740
little hollow tubes.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.930
So one of these things--
it's a little hollow tube.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.610
So what I wanted
to do is work out

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.374
how much the modulus
of the foam would

00:42:05.374 --> 00:42:07.040
increase if you could
make all the edges

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.406
into little hollow tubes.

00:42:09.406 --> 00:42:10.780
So we're going to
start by saying

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.825
the foam behavior is
dominated by cell bending,

00:42:13.825 --> 00:42:14.860
so edge bending.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:36.120
And the foam properties can
be increased by increasing

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.620
the EI of the cell wall.

00:42:52.256 --> 00:42:54.130
So there's a couple of
ways we could do that.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.242
So the first one is
looking at hollow walls.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.280
So imagine I have a
thin-walled tube-- just

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.867
a circular, thin-walled tube.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.130
There's my little wall there.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:23.460
It has some radius little
r, and a wall thickness t.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.510
And then imagine I have
the same amount of mass,

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:29.340
but now I have a solid
circular section.

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:35.520
And I'm going to say the
radius of that is big R.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:42.590
So for our thin-walled
tube, the moment of inertia

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:48.540
is pi r cubed times the
thickness, t, if it's thin.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:57.554
And for our solid
circular section,

00:43:57.554 --> 00:44:04.180
I is going to be pi big
R to the 4th over 4.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.600
And if I say I want to set
this up so that the masses are

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.740
equal, then the areas
of the cross-sections

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.541
have to be equal-- say it's
from the same material.

00:44:15.212 --> 00:44:16.670
So the masses are
going to be equal

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:24.280
if pi R squared is
equal to 2 pi r t.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.610
So I'm going to
solve here for R.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.780
So the pi's are
going to cancel out.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.210
So the masses are equal if R is
equal to the square root of 2

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:34.637
times r times t.

00:44:38.284 --> 00:44:39.700
And then what we're
going to do is

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.080
see how the big is
the moment of inertia

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.910
of the tube relative
to the solid.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:50.040
And the tube is pi
little r cubed t.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:56.355
And the solid was pi R
to the 4th, divided by 4.

00:44:56.355 --> 00:44:57.730
And I'm going to
get rid of the R

00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:59.811
here, and get rid
of the pi's there.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:10.270
So R to the 4th is going
to be 4r squared t squared.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:11.860
So the 4s are going to go.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:16.850
And this boils down to r over t.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:21.340
So if I had a thin-walled
tube, the moment of inertia

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:25.830
is going to be r over t bigger
than if I had the same mass

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:27.472
in a solid circular section.

00:45:27.472 --> 00:45:28.930
So you can see for
the little plant

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:30.460
here, by making a
thin-walled tube,

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.310
you're increasing the
stiffness of the foam

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.060
with the same
amount of material.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.120
That's the idea.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.887
And you can do a similar kind of
analysis for other properties.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.440
So that's if we
have hollow tubes.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.840
So another option is we
could have cell walls that

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.390
are sandwich structures.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.440
So imagine if the
cell walls themselves

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.120
were little, tiny
sandwich structures.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.400
So when you have a
sandwich beam, what

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.960
you have is too
stiff, strong faces

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.180
that are separated by
some sort of porous core,

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.330
like a honeycomb or
a foam or balsa wood.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:59.220
And the idea with the
sandwich structure--

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:06.080
if I draw a little sketch of
the sandwich, here's my faces.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.730
So imagine those are solid.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:09.800
So they might be
aluminum sheets,

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.567
or they might be fiber
reinforced composites.

00:47:12.567 --> 00:47:14.400
And then we have some
sort of cellular thing

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.080
here as the core.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.750
And the idea is, that's
analogous to an I-beam.

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:28.690
So in the sandwich
beam, we have two,

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:37.600
stiff, strong faces separated
by a lightweight core.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:48.770
So the core is typically
a honeycomb, or a foam,

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:49.980
or balsa wood.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.320
And the idea is, you
increase the moment

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.337
of inertia of the cross-section
with little increase in weight.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:16.550
And if you think of
an I-beam, an I-beam

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.060
has a large moment of inertia,
because you're separating

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.840
the flanges by the web.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.900
And the sandwich beam
works in the same way.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.359
You're separating the
faces by the core.

00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:26.900
But the core doesn't
weigh very much,

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.410
because it's a cellular thing.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.780
So the faces of the sandwich are
like the flanges in the I-beam.

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:41.810
And then the core
is like the web.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.465
So the idea is to make something
called a micro-sandwich foam.

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:00.660
So what you want to do is make
the cell walls into sandwiches.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:03.760
And one way to do that is
to disperse a large volume

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.680
fraction of thin-walled
spheres into the foam.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:27.130
And you have to get the
geometry right to make it work.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:32.070
So let me draw a little kind
of sketch here of how it works.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:33.818
So here's our
thin-walled spheres.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.880
And then you're going to
distribute those in a foam.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.135
Here's another sphere over here.

00:49:47.135 --> 00:49:48.445
The spheres are not perfect.

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:53.195
Let's say there's
another one in here.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.934
And then the idea is this stuff
in here would be the foam.

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.206
So these guys are
hollow spheres.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:17.100
And say the spheres
have a diameter D.

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:21.570
And say they have a wall
thickness here of t.

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.930
And say that the separation
of the spheres I'm

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:27.290
going to call c.

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.870
You can see that there.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:32.710
And then the cell size of
the foam I'm going to call e.

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:41.060
So there's a bunch of parameters
you have to kind of play with

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.044
to get this to work.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.080
So you have to have thin-walled
spheres so the faces are thin.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.640
The sandwich panels work
best when the faces are thin.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.570
So you need the thickness of the
sphere to be much less than D.

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:59.770
You need the faces to be
stiff relative to the foam.

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:02.800
So you need the modulus
of the sphere material

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.110
to be greater than the
modulus of the foam.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:10.910
And you need the volume
fraction of the spheres

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.550
to be relatively high to
get the spheres close enough

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.777
together for this to work.

00:51:15.777 --> 00:51:17.360
So you want that
volume fraction to be

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.690
something like 50% to 60%.

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:23.850
And for the foam, you
need to have the foam cell

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:27.075
size less than the separation
between the spheres.

00:51:27.075 --> 00:51:28.950
You need to have a number
of-- you can't just

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:30.090
have one pore in here.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.660
That's not really like a foam.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.180
It won't behave like
a foam as a continuum.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.700
So you need to have a number
of different cell sizes

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:40.010
in between each sphere.

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:41.830
And so you need the
cell size of the foam

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:44.670
to be a lot less than the
separation of the spheres

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:45.810
there, c.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:47.950
But if you can
control this geometry,

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:49.750
you can get the sandwich effect.

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:51.992
And you can get improved
properties by doing that.

00:51:51.992 --> 00:51:53.450
So there's ways
you can play around

00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:58.297
with the structure of the foams
to improve their properties.

00:51:58.297 --> 00:51:59.880
So that was one thing
I wanted to say.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.730
Another way to
improve the properties

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:37.570
of a foam-like
material is to use

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:39.420
one of those lattice materials.

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.570
So we've been talking
about ways to improve

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:42.580
the bending stiffness.

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:43.650
But if you could get
rid of the bending

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:46.410
altogether and have axial
deformation in the cell walls,

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:47.950
that would be much stiffer.

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:49.330
And you can get
axial deformation

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:52.520
by having those 3D
truss kind of materials.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.880
So I have a picture of this.

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.430
There we go, so there's one
of those 3D truss materials.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:59.890
So another alternative is to
sort of get rid of the bending

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:02.642
altogether, and to try to
make a truss-type material.

00:53:41.297 --> 00:53:42.880
So there's various
ways to make these.

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.510
I think that we talked about
a few of them earlier on.

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.640
And you can analyze them
as truss-type structures.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.380
And I can just
run through a sort

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.300
of little dimensional
argument to get the modulus.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:59.410
So the modulus is going to go
as the stress over the strain.

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:03.630
The stress is going to go as
a force over a length squared.

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:06.350
The strain's going to go
as a deformation over l.

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:09.370
So this is just like what
we had before for the foams.

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:11.640
But in this case,
the deformation

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.400
is going to go with
the force times

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:18.210
the length over the area of
the cross-section divided

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:22.840
by Es, because we're pulling
it or pushing it axially.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:30.640
So that goes as Fl
over t squared Es.

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.740
And if I just put that
back in the equation

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:37.180
here for the modulus, I get
that we've got F over l.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:43.910
And I've got delta here,
so that's F l t squared Es.

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:45.930
And you just get
the modulus goes

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:51.940
as the modulus of the solid
times t over l squared.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:57.020
And that goes as the
modulus of the solid times

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.770
the relative density.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.920
So for the open-celled
foams, the modulus

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.690
went as the relative
density squared.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:06.330
So if it was 10% solid,
the modulus would be 0.01.

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:09.140
And this is saying if it's
10% solid, the modulus is 0.1.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.480
So it's much bigger.

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.970
So this is all sort
of well and good.

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:18.740
The only difficulty is that
when you look at the modulus,

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.020
you can do reasonably well.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.820
But when you look at the
strength, some of the members

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.570
are going to be
inevitably in compression.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.224
When you have these
truss materials,

00:55:25.224 --> 00:55:26.890
some members are going
to be in tension.

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.723
Some members are going
to be in compression.

00:55:28.723 --> 00:55:30.790
And the compression
members tend to buckle.

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:32.530
And once the compression
members buckle,

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:35.260
then you're back to the same
kind of strength relationship

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:36.690
that you have for the foam.

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.280
So that's one of the
difficulties of this.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:48.450
So let me say that the
strength-- so if the strength

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:50.770
was controlled by
uni-axial yield,

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:52.934
it would go linearly
with relative density.

00:55:52.934 --> 00:55:55.100
But if it goes with buckling,
it goes as the square.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:20.678
So I'll just say the
compression members can buckle.

00:56:35.568 --> 00:56:40.680
And say you had a metal lattice.

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.890
Then there's some interaction
between the plastic behavior

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:44.670
and the buckling.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:47.620
And you use what's called
the tangent modulus instead

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.680
of just the Young's modulus.

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.040
And the tangent
modulus is lower.

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.400
And there's also what's
called knock-down factors that

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.433
can be large, too.

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:01.183
So the knock-down
factor can be like 50%.

00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:09.790
So the measured strength
can be half of what

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:12.820
you thought it was going to be.

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.861
This should be a
squared over here.

00:57:14.861 --> 00:57:15.360
Sorry.

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:21.600
So even though the stiffness
of these 3D trusses

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.150
can be quite good, the strength
often isn't quite as good

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.270
as one might hope.

00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:30.825
So that's one of the
issues with them.

00:57:30.825 --> 00:57:31.325
All right.

00:57:43.474 --> 00:57:45.140
So do you see the
idea, though, with all

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:48.040
these different
micro structures,

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.970
is that you can control
the structure in a way

00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:51.770
to try to increase
the bending stiffness

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:53.228
or get rid of the
bending stiffness

00:57:53.228 --> 00:57:54.620
and increase the
axial stiffness?

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:56.870
So there's things you can
do to play around with that.

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:22.860
And I wanted to talk a bit
today about material selection

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.880
charts for foams.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.460
So when we talked about woods,
we started talking about this.

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.320
Remember, I derived a
little performance index.

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.370
We said if we had
a material and we

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:32.880
wanted to have a
given stiffness,

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.338
and we wanted to
minimize the mass,

00:58:34.338 --> 00:58:37.110
we had that performance index
that was E to the 1/2 over rho.

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:39.910
And we had a chart of
modulus versus density.

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:41.530
And we saw that wood
was really good.

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:44.310
You can do that for other
sorts of properties, not just

00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:44.810
modulus.

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:49.140
So you can make-- depending on
what the mechanical requirement

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:52.050
is, you can work out
different performance indices.

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:54.500
So I want to go into that
in a little bit more detail.

00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.880
So the question is,
how do we select

00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:01.032
the best material for some
mechanical requirement?

00:59:33.522 --> 00:59:35.730
So in the wood section, we
looked at the minimum mass

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:38.216
of a beam of a given stiffness.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.300
And we saw that the performance
index was E to the 1/2

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.094
over rho.

00:59:48.767 --> 00:59:50.850
So let me do another one
of these little examples,

00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:52.558
and then I'll show
you some more of them.

00:59:52.558 --> 00:59:55.620
So another example would
be what material-- minimize

00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.130
the mass of a beam of a given
strength or a given failure

00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:58.630
load.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:26.560
So we'll call the
failure load Pf.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.450
And we can see the
maximum stress in the beam

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:32.370
is going to be the moment in
the beam times the distance

01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:34.600
from the neutral
axis y, and divided

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.170
by the moment of inertia.

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:40.274
So here, M is the maximum
moment in the beam.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.535
And y is the maximum distance
from the neutral axis.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.560
And I is the moment of inertia.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:05.800
And I'm going to say
i goes as t to the 4.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.830
And I'm going to define a
failure stress of the material

01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:09.610
sigma f.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.250
So sigma max is going
to go as my failure

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:25.490
load times the length.

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:27.080
That would be the moment.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.750
The distance from the neutral
axis is going to go as t.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:33.576
And the moment of inertia is
going to go as t to the 4th.

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:39.740
And that's going to be the
failure strength there.

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.626
So I can solve this for t.

01:01:41.626 --> 01:01:43.750
And then I'm going to write
the mass in terms of t,

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.640
and put that in there.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:55.410
So here t goes as Pf
l divided by sigma f.

01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:57.530
And that's going to
be to the 1/3 power.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.107
I guess I can scoot over here.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:32.470
Then we can say that the mass
M goes as the density of times

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:35.520
t squared times l.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:48.950
So the mass M is going to go
as rho times l times t squared.

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:53.240
So that whole thing
goes to the 2/3 power.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.450
So if we look at the
material properties,

01:02:55.450 --> 01:03:01.010
the mass goes as the density
times the failure stress

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.642
raised to the 2/3 power.

01:03:02.642 --> 01:03:04.100
So if we want to
minimize the mass,

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.450
we want to minimize rho
over sigma f to the 2/3,

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:12.020
or we want to maximize
sigma F to the 2/3 over rho.

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:21.456
So that's the performance
index for that case.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.950
So we can obtain these
performance indices

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:29.960
for different loading
configurations

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.330
and different
mechanical requirements.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:34.530
And I don't want to go
through a whole lot of them,

01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:37.840
but I'm going to put
this up with the notes.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.135
So this is from Mike Ashby's
book on Material Selection

01:03:40.135 --> 01:03:41.720
in Mechanical Design.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.680
And this is a whole series
of these performance indices

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.560
for different
situations, for things

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.760
loaded in torsion, for
columns and buckling,

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.640
for panels and bending.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.210
So these ones are
all for stiffness.

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:56.220
And they all involve a modulus
raised to some power divided

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.530
by a density.

01:03:57.530 --> 01:04:01.800
So a tie in tension, c over
rho, the beam in bending

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.580
is E to the 1/2 over rho.

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.370
A plate in bending
is E to 1/3 over rho.

01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:08.420
So you don't need
to memorize those.

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.850
But you can see you can derive
these for different situations.

01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.710
And here's another one for
strength-limited design.

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:19.450
So the shaft is, depending on
what the specifications are,

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.780
it's the strength raised
to the 2/3 power over rho.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.740
The beam loaded in bending--
the top one there-- sigma f

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.790
to the 2/3 over rho.

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:27.940
That's what we just did.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.600
So there's all these different
kind of performance indices.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.670
So depending on what
your situation is,

01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:34.770
you would pick one
of these indices.

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:37.440
And then what you can do is
use these material selection

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.580
charts, which plot one
property against another

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.247
on log-log scales.

01:04:42.247 --> 01:04:44.080
And because all of these
performance indices

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.160
involve a power,
they always end up

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.940
being a straight line
on your log-log plot.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.630
And here this one,
I think, is the same

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:52.850
as what I showed
you for the wood.

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:57.080
This one's the modulus here
plotted against density.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.260
So foams are down here.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.487
And other engineering
materials are over here.

01:05:03.229 --> 01:05:05.520
And these guidelines here
are the different performance

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:05.810
indices.

01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:06.955
So this one's E over rho.

01:05:06.955 --> 01:05:08.670
This one's E to
the 1/2 over rho.

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:10.530
This one's E to
the 1/3 over rho.

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:12.850
And for this case here,
as you move the lines up

01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:15.930
to the top left-hand
corner, E is getting bigger.

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:17.090
Rho is getting smaller.

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:19.100
And so the actual value
of the performance index

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.200
is getting bigger.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.630
So you can use this
to select a material.

01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:24.950
So we've made these
charts for foams as well.

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:30.017
So here's a couple
of charts for foams.

01:05:30.017 --> 01:05:32.350
And I think what I'm going
to do is just go through them

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:32.854
quickly.

01:05:32.854 --> 01:05:34.520
And there aren't
really that many notes,

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.120
so I'll just put the
notes on the website.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.170
And you can come and
write all the notes down.

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:40.330
And then we can
finish this today.

01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:42.980
So this one here is the
Young's modulus versus density.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.380
And these are all sorts
of different foams.

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.970
So the low modulus ones
tend to be flexible.

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.950
The higher modulus ones
tend to be more rigid.

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:55.420
And you could use this to
select foams, if you wanted.

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.730
You can also see what
the range of values is.

01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:59.780
So the values of
the modulus here

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.930
goes from a little
less than a 100--

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:06.030
because this is two
orders of magnitude here,

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:09.266
I think, each one of these--
down to about 10 to the minus 4

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:10.580
or a little less than that.

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.580
So there's a huge range.

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.538
There's almost a range
of a factor of a million

01:06:13.538 --> 01:06:15.339
in those moduli.

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:16.880
And the same with
the strengths here.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.980
The strengths go from
10 to the minus 3

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.880
mega-pascals up to about
maybe 30 mega-pascals,

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.570
something like that.

01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:27.420
And you can see for the
modulus and the strength,

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.050
things like the
metal foams are good.

01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:29.987
The balsa's good.

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:31.910
Here's the balsa up here.

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:33.370
Metal foam's up there.

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:38.940
So you can kind of see
the range of properties

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.040
that you could get.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.740
And then you could also--
need a drink, hang on.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.840
You can also plot the
specific property.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.460
So here's the
compressive strength

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:58.580
divided by the density plotted
against the Young's modulus

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:00.006
divided by the density.

01:07:00.006 --> 01:07:01.630
And here you want to
be up at this end.

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:04.260
So you would have a high
strength and a high stiffness.

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:07.790
So the balsa and the metal
foams are good up here.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.695
This next plot-- this is
the compressive stress

01:07:10.695 --> 01:07:13.100
at 25% strain.

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.530
And this is the
densification strain.

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:21.020
And if you think of having
your stress-strain curve

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.560
looks like this,
something like that,

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.780
so you could say
that's a strain of 0.25

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.920
and that's the stress
that corresponds to that.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.520
So that stress times the
densification strain,

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.730
which is out here
someplace, is an estimate

01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:41.230
of the energy underneath
the stress-strain curve.

01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:45.240
So you can think of this
right-hand plot here--

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.920
those dashed lines-- these lines
like this and this and this--

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.630
each one of those corresponds
to how much energy you

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:54.100
would absorb under the
stress-strain curve.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.840
So points that lie
on here would have

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.500
an energy of 0.001
megajoules per cubic meter.

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.130
And over here, we're at
10 joules per cubic meter.

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:07.600
So again, the balsa and the
metal foams are good over here.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.660
So you can use these plots
to try to identify foams

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.700
for particular applications.

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.890
And I think there's
a couple more.

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.740
It doesn't have to be
mechanical properties.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.699
Here is thermal conductivity
versus compressive strength.

01:08:19.699 --> 01:08:21.740
So you can imagine if you
wanted some insulation,

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:24.130
you wanted to have a certain
thermal conductivity value,

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:26.550
you probably also need at
least some minimal compressive

01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:27.729
strength.

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:30.130
You could also have something
like a maximum service

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:32.074
temperature, that
maybe the foam is going

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:33.240
to melt at some temperature.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.670
You can't go beyond that.

01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:37.850
So there's some property there.

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:40.420
And I think there's
one more here.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.090
You can look at things
like the density

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:43.729
in terms of the
buoyancy of a foam,

01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:45.840
if you have some
buoyancy application.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.560
And you can look at cell
size on this one here.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.510
And cell size can be
important for things

01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:52.250
like filtration and catalysis.

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:55.510
So the amount of surface area
goes as 1 over the cell size--

01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:57.680
the surface area
per unit volume.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.010
And so the cell size can be
important for those sorts

01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:01.132
of applications.

01:09:01.132 --> 01:09:03.340
So the idea is, you can make
these material selection

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.130
charts for foam.

01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:06.287
And you can put data on there.

01:09:06.287 --> 01:09:07.370
And you can compare foams.

01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:09.745
And you can use these
performance indices.

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.120
So I'm going to
leave it at that.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.760
There is a little
bit more notes.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.460
But I'll just put
them on the website,

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:17.050
and you can get them from there.

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:19.409
So I think we're good for today.
