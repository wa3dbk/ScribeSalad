00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:26.874
LORNA GIBSON: So
we're going to start

00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:28.540
talking about trabecular
bone, and we're

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.970
going to do a bone
today and on Wednesday.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.120
And I'm hoping we can more or
less finish it on Wednesday.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.000
So hello.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.137
Hold on a sec.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.960
So these are some images
of trabecular bone,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.350
and you can see that it
has a foam-like structure.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.560
And trabecular bone exists in
certain places in the body.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.860
There's three main
places that it exists.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.830
So it exists at the
end of the long bones.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.830
And over here this is a femur.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.320
This is the very
top of the femur,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.650
and you can see this is all
trabecular bone in here.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.550
This is a tibia, and this is
the top of your knee there.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.790
And you can see how the bone
get more bulbous at the ends,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.770
and it's filled with
a trabecular bone.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.820
This is a vertebrae.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.146
So vertebrae are actually
mostly trabecular bone,

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:19.520
and they have a
really thin shell

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.920
of what's called cortical bone,
the dense bone, on top of it.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.530
So trabecular bone exists at
the ends of the long bones,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.780
it exists in the core
of the vertebrae,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.150
and it also exists in sort
of shell or plate-like bones.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.140
So in your skull,
for example, there's

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.970
a layer of trabecular
bone in between two layers

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.010
of the compact dense bone.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.210
And in your pelvis,
it's the same thing.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.199
So those of you who
took 3032, you remember

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:46.990
when I passed around
the bird skulls, there

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.273
was that very porous
kind of trabecular bone.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.060
So trabecular bone is
of interest medically

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.520
in three main kind of
medical situations.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.531
So the first one
is osteoporosis.

00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:01.780
So I want to talk a little
bit about osteoporosis now,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.020
and then we'll talk about
it in more detail later on.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.670
I guess, we'll
probably start today.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.729
Another medical issue
is osteoarthritis,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.460
and the properties of
the trabecular bone

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.980
are important in arthritis,
and the third issue

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.370
is in joint replacements.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.000
And so we're going to talk a
little bit about osteoporosis,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.670
osteoarthritis, and
then joint replacements.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.170
And then I'll talk
a little bit more

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.310
about modeling bone like
a foam and how it deforms

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.290
and how it fails.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.020
And then we'll talk a little bit
how we can model osteoporosis.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.605
So let me write down
some of these things.

00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:39.450
I guess we'll start here.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.200
So trabecular bone has
a foam-like structure,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.950
and what we're going
to see is that we

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.140
can use the models
for foams to describe

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.634
the mechanical
behavior of the bone.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.104
It exists at the ends
of the long bones.

00:03:13.104 --> 00:03:14.520
And at the ends
of the long bones,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.760
the bones become more bulbous.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.190
And really what that's for
is to increase the surface

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.450
area so that there's cartilage
between the ends of the two

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.950
bones.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.430
So there would be a bone
here and a bone there,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.971
and there's cartilage
in between them

00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:29.150
that sort of
lubricates that joint

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.900
and makes low
friction at the joint.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.760
And the bone gets larger
to decrease the stresses

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.506
on the cartilage.

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:38.880
So if you have the same force
and you have a larger area,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.500
you're going to have
a smaller stress.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.320
So that's why the bone
gets bulbous like that.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.780
And then by having the
trabecular bone, because it's

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.350
so porous and
lightweight, you're

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.140
not having a big,
dense hunk of bone

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.270
at the end of the long bones.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.367
So it exists at the
ends of the long bones.

00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:58.950
And I'll just say the ends have
a larger area than the shafts.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.872
And that's to distribute
the loads on the cartilage

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:12.580
or to reduce the stress
on the cartilage.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.390
And then the trabecular
bone reduces the weight.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.386
So it also exists in the
core of the vertebrae,

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:45.840
and in fact, it makes
up most of the vertebrae

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.460
and then in things like the
skull and the pelvic bones

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.469
in shell and plate-like bones.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.223
And so it's the core of a
sandwich structure there.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.250
So it's of interest
in osteoporosis,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:40.115
in osteoarthritis, and
in joint replacements.

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:57.780
So if we start by thinking
about osteoporosis,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.430
you probably know
that osteoporosis

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.220
is a disease where the
bone mass becomes reduced

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.380
and there's a greater
risk of fracture,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.070
so there's especially a
greater risk of hip fractures

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.774
and vertebral fractures.

00:06:10.774 --> 00:06:12.440
And it turns out in
both of those sites,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.320
if you just look at
these bones here,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.000
typically if you have a hip
fracture, what happens is

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.660
the neck of the femur breaks.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.000
So this is called the neck here.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.360
This is called the head,
this spherical bit there.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.977
So the neck has a
fracture, and you

00:06:24.977 --> 00:06:27.060
can see most of the bone
there is trabecular bone,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.610
so it's really carrying most
of the load and the same

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.080
with the vertebrae.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.140
This sort of cylindrical
part of the vertebrae

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.090
here carries most of the load.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.410
It has a shell of really
thin cortical bone,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.370
but it's mostly trabecular bone.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.064
And when the loads are
vertical like this,

00:06:42.064 --> 00:06:43.730
that's really the
trabecular bone that's

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.210
carrying most of the load.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.240
And people get sometimes what
are called wedge fractures

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.970
where instead of having a sort
of a cylinder with parallel

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.000
faces like this, the
trabecular bone fails,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.343
and the bone ends up like that
so that there's-- yeah, I know.

00:06:57.343 --> 00:06:59.770
You make that
wincing expression.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.492
It's like ouchy.

00:07:00.492 --> 00:07:02.894
And in fact, it's very ouchy
for people who get that.

00:07:02.894 --> 00:07:04.810
And when you see little
old ladies who are all

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.210
hunched over, that's why.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.770
The bone has actually failed.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.840
It's actually been crushed
into these wedge fractures,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.880
and there's no way they
can straighten it out,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.560
and it's quite painful.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.359
So people who look
at osteoporosis

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:19.400
are quite interested in
the mechanical properties

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.340
of trabecular bone for
this sort of reason.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.470
The hip fractures
are particularly

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.071
serious because people become
immobilized and then sometimes

00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:30.070
because they're immobilized,
they get pneumonia,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.430
and in elderly people
they sometimes die.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.820
So something like 40% of
elderly patients who are over 65

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.470
die within a year of
having hip fracture.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.690
So it's not that the
hip fracture kills them,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.980
it's that they become so
immobile, and they can't move,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.930
and they can't walk around, and
they end up getting pneumonia.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.780
So it's quite a serious thing.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.610
And there's something like
300,000 hip fractures a year

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.790
in the US, and the cost of
treating these hip fractures

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.150
is something like $19 billion.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.290
So yeah, it's a huge problem.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.070
And as the population is
aging, as baby boomers like

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.880
me get older and older,
there's going more people

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.240
having hip fractures.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.510
So it's a huge
deal, osteoporosis.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:24.050
So we'll say bone mass
decreases with age,

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.400
and osteoporosis is
extreme bone loss.

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:36.830
And a little later
today I'll show you

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.169
some pictures of what
it looks like when

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.210
people have osteoporosis.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:56.260
So the most common fractures are
of the hip and the vertebrae,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.290
and at both sites,
most of the load

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.020
is carried by the
trabecular bone.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.975
And the hip fractures
you are the most serious.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.080
40% of elderly patients
pass away within a year.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.420
So that's sort of a little
introduction to osteoporosis.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.563
The next issue that
people are interested in

00:10:41.563 --> 00:10:42.313
is osteoarthritis.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.310
And in osteoarthritis,
there's a degradation

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.210
of cartilage at the joints,
and the stress on the cartilage

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.260
is affected by the
modulus of the bone that

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.337
presses against the cartilage.

00:11:00.337 --> 00:11:02.420
You can kind of magic if
you have a fiber compass,

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.753
for instance, most of the
stresses, if you're loading it

00:11:04.753 --> 00:11:07.030
along the fibers, is
carried by the fibers

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.170
because they're stiffer.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.970
So if you have like say
trabecular bone that

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.260
has varying density,
the denser bits

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.340
are going to have
higher moduli, and it's

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.020
there's going more stress
associated with that.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.260
And so the modulus of
the trabecular bone

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.930
can affect how the loads are
distributed in the cartilage,

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.949
and that can affect the
damage in the cartilage.

00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:28.490
And the shell, as
I mentioned before,

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.730
this sort of shell
of cortical bone

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.540
or the dense bone at the
joints can be quite thin.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.420
It can be less
than a millimeter.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.820
So I brought my little
bones along with me again.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.050
So this is the head
of a femur here,

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.579
and this is a piece of a
knee joint here from a tibia.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.120
And you can see just
looking at these

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.150
how thin the cortical shell is.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.147
So you can get an idea
of how thin that is.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.650
So osteoarthritis
involves a degradation

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.130
of the cartilage at the joints.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.780
And the stress on
the cartilage is

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:33.630
affected by the moduli
of the underlying bone,

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:45.760
and the cortical shell,
the totally dense bone,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.792
can be quite thin.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.474
So the mechanical properties
of the trabecular bone

00:13:00.474 --> 00:13:02.640
can affect the stress
distribution on the cartilage.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.570
And if osteoarthritis gets
particularly bad, then

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.810
sometimes people have
joint replacements.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.190
So when it gets really
bad, the cartilage

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.260
is degraded completely, and
the bone is rubbing on bone,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.760
and that's quite painful.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.490
And when it gets to that
point, people generally

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.800
have a joint replacement.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.760
And so the way the joint
replacements are done

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.490
is say somebody who is going
to have a hip replacement, what

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.490
they do is they chop off
the top of the femur.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.580
So they would chop the femur
off somewhere around here,

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.950
and then they have
a metal implant

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.110
that has a spherical ball.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.770
That's like the
head of the femur.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.250
And then it has a sort
of stem and a shaft here

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.140
that goes into the hollow
part of the long part

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.850
of the shaft of the femur.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.950
And so they use a number of
different metals for this,

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.710
titanium and stainless
steel, and there's

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.460
a cobalt-chromium
alloy are also used.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.720
So you need metals
that are biocompatible,

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.261
aren't going to
corrode, aren't going

00:14:40.261 --> 00:14:41.850
to have degradation products.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.930
And then the bone grows
around that implant,

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.240
and the bone grows in
response to mechanical loads.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.750
So the density of
the bone depends

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.329
on the magnitude of the
load, and the orientation

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:55.870
of the trabeculae depends on
the orientation of the principle

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.800
stresses that are applied.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.300
So let me write that down.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:45.530
So they cut off the
end of the bone,

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.760
and they insert the implant
into the hollow shaft

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.090
of the remaining bone.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:18.930
And the metals they use are
titanium, stainless steel,

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.050
and a chromium-cobalt alloy.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.140
And then the bone grows
into that implant.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.553
And the bone grows in
response to mechanical loads.

00:16:52.974 --> 00:16:55.550
So the density of
the bone depends

00:16:55.550 --> 00:17:07.940
on the magnitude
of the stresses,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:13.829
and the orientation
of the bone depends

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.819
on the principle stresses.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.760
So one of the issues that
comes up in joint replacements

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.570
is that there's a
mismatch in the moduli

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.570
between the metal and the bone.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.220
So if you think the metal, like
something like stainless steel,

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.210
has a modulus of around
200, 210 gigapascals.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.890
And the cortical
bone has a modulus

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.330
of about 18 gigapascals,
and the trabecular bone

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.600
has a modulus between about
0.01 and 2 gigapascals,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.080
depending on its density.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.610
So you're taking the bone
out, and you're replacing it

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.710
with something that's much,
much stiffer, and that

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.850
changes the stress distribution
around the remaining bone.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.040
And one of the things
that can happen

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.910
is you can get a
loosening of the implant.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.070
So the bone can
grow in initially,

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.850
but over time, you
get a different stress

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.685
field in the bone.

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.830
And if you have a
different stress field,

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.860
then the bone can resorb away
from the implant and cause

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.270
what's called loosening.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.600
So if the implant
becomes loose, that's

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.880
clearly not a good thing.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.400
It's a bad thing.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.515
And often orthopedic
surgeons don't

00:18:54.515 --> 00:18:56.640
like to do these joint
replacements in young people

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.110
partly because they
don't always loosen,

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.690
but occasionally they do.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.300
And if they loosen they can
go back and do a revision.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.076
But you can kind of
imagine after they've

00:19:05.076 --> 00:19:06.450
chopped the head
of the femur off

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.340
and they put one
implant in, it's

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.117
not that easy to go back in and
replace that with another one.

00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:12.700
You would need one
with a longer stem,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.850
and the whole thing becomes a
little bit more complicated.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.545
So this issue of
stress shielding

00:19:17.545 --> 00:19:18.920
is what it's called
when you have

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.320
something much stiffer
that's shielding

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.502
the stresses in the bone.

00:19:23.502 --> 00:19:24.960
The issue of stress
shielding means

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.680
that they don't like to do
the replacements on younger

00:19:28.680 --> 00:20:01.810
patients unless you can
get stress shielding.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:10.050
And if we just compare-- if we
look at the cobalt and chromium

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:16.650
alloy, the modulus of that
in gigapascals is about 210.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.770
If we look at the titanium
alloys that are used,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.380
the modulus is about 110.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.100
If we look at the
stainless steel--

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:32.400
it's 316 stainless steel-- it
has a modulus of around 210.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:38.080
And then if we look at the
bone, the cortical bone

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:45.870
has a modulus of about 18,
and the trabecular bone

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.160
has a modulus 0.01
to 2 gigapascals

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.480
depending on the density.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.840
So after the joint
replacement happens,

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.176
the remodeling of
the bone is affected.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.450
So the idea is that the stiffer
metal carries more of the load,

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.953
and then the bone carries less
load, and then it resorbs.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.240
And that can lead to this
thing called loosening,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.545
which is not desirable.

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:11.620
Now, this typically doesn't
happen till about 15 years

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.240
after you've had the
implant, so it's not

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.865
something that would
happen right away,

00:22:14.865 --> 00:22:16.056
but it can happen later on.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.760
So these are all sort
of medical reasons

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.926
why people are interested
in trabecular bone because

00:22:40.926 --> 00:22:46.380
of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis,
and joint replacements.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.870
So I wanted to start by
talking about the structure

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.310
of trabecular bone.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:01.240
And then we'll talk about what
the stress-strain curves look

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.330
like in compression
and tension, what

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.490
are the mechanisms of
deformation and failure,

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.580
and how we can apply our models
for foams to the trabecular

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.690
bone.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.140
So the idea is that the
structure of the bone

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:17.400
resembles a foam,
and here's some SCM

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.150
images of trabecular bone.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.950
And you can see that the
bone has a varying structure.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.910
If it's relatively
low density, this

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.609
is a bone that's almost
like an open-cell foam

00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:30.150
if I didn't tell
you that was a bone,

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.370
you might actually think
it was an open-cell foam.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.100
And here's a denser
piece of bone,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.840
and you can see there's still
interconnections between all

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.470
the openings, so
it's not exactly

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.160
like a closed-cell foam,
but it's much denser,

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.190
and it's almost like
there's perforated plates

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.370
in the structure.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.734
And then as I said the bone
can grow in response to loads.

00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:53.900
So if you have loads that
are more or less vertical,

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.970
the trabeculae tend
to line up and be

00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.420
more or less vertical with some
sort of horizontal bracing.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.880
So this is a piece
of bone from a knee,

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.020
the condyle is sort of
towards the top of the knee.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.310
And you can see these are sort
of plate-like pieces of bone.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.370
They're almost parallel, and not
too surprisingly in your knee,

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.416
the loads are
typically vertical,

00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:16.790
and then there's
a little bracing

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.752
bits that go horizontally here.

00:24:18.752 --> 00:24:20.210
So you can get
different structures

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.710
depending on the
loading on the bone,

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.370
and the density of
the bone corresponds

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.520
to the magnitude of the
load, and the orientation

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:34.954
of the trabeculae corresponds
to the orientation of the load.

00:24:34.954 --> 00:24:35.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:40.416 --> 00:24:42.380
LORNA GIBSON: Resorb.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.686
So when the bone density goes
down, when you lose bone mass,

00:24:45.686 --> 00:24:46.727
that's called resorption.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.140
So the idea is that
the trabecular bone

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.253
resembles a foam.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:06.030
And in fact, the word
trabecular comes from Latin,

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.421
and in Latin, it
means little beam.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.179
So the foams to form by bending.

00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:17.220
They act like little beams,
and so the trabeculae

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.140
are like little
beams, even in Latin.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.556
There's a range of
relative densities,

00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:25.180
and you can see in
that image up there,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.664
you can see that
there's a range.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.630
And they range typically
between about a 5% in dense

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.090
and 50% in dense.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.450
So something like 0.1
or 0.2 might be typical.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:48.920
And the low-density bone
resembles an open-cell foam.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.270
And the higher density,
it becomes more

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.510
like perforated plates.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.680
And the structure can
be highly anisotropic

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.140
depending on the stress field.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.610
And then I've got another image
here of the trabecular bone.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.930
These images are
using what's called

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.940
micro computed tomography.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.610
So you've probably heard
of computed tomography.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.710
Say somebody has cancer,
they get put in a CT machine,

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.240
and they do a scan.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.620
The micro CT is more
of a research tool.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.360
It's the same kind
of technology,

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.410
but it's got a much
finer resolution,

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.230
and typically, you put a
small specimen into a machine

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.740
to do this.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.920
So the specimen
might be half an inch

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.910
in diameter and an inch
tall, something like that.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.860
So these are done by a
colleague, Ralph Muller, who's

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.110
in Zurich, and this is one of
his bread and butter things

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.280
that he has these images,
and he looks at osteoporosis.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.310
And you can see here the
difference in the structure

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.680
for the different densities.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.680
So here's a 26% dense piece
of bone in the femoral head.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.980
It looks pretty sturdy
and substantial.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.210
Here's an 11% dense piece
from the lumbar spine,

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.450
and here's a 6% dense piece.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:50.970
And you can kind of see
when you go from 26 to 11,

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.180
the struts get a
little bit thinner.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.954
And when you go from 11 to
6, the struts get very thin,

00:27:56.954 --> 00:27:58.370
and in fact, if
they get too thin,

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.050
the struts resorb altogether,
and some of their struts

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.560
can just disappear.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.210
So when people get
osteoporosis, what happens

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.680
is they first lose bone
mass by thinning the struts,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.270
but then at some point, the
struts just resorb altogether.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.180
And if you think of the struts
as a biological material,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.250
they have bone cells in them.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.760
So there's little osteoclasts
and osteoblasts and osteocytes

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.200
that live in the bone, the
mineral thing, the bony thing.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.220
And those cells have dimensions
of 10s of microns, so maybe 20,

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.840
30 microns, something like that.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.780
So the struts can't get
any thinner than that.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.154
If they get thinner than that,
then the cells can't live,

00:28:34.154 --> 00:28:36.430
and the thing just
disappears altogether.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.310
And you can think of from
a mechanical point of view,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.160
if you lose density by
thinning the struts,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.080
you can use our sort
of foam equations.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.810
And say the density
went from 0.2 to 0.1,

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.160
you could make some
estimate of how the modulus

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.270
and how the strength would vary
depending on our foam models.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.310
But if you lose density
by resorbing the struts,

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.490
the struts just
disappear altogether,

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.990
then it's as if you had a
steel scaffold or a steel

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:04.130
structure of a building.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.420
And now you're starting to
remove columns and remove

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.590
beams.

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.280
Yes, I know.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.810
That's not good, not good.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.270
And so we'll talk
a little bit more

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.820
about that when we talk
more about osteoporosis,

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.700
and you can see the
consequences of that.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.241
But this image here
kind of gives you

00:29:17.241 --> 00:29:20.870
a little bit of a picture of
what the bone structure looks

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.280
like as it gets less dense.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.820
So I want to talk
a little bit more

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.410
about the bone growing
in response to load.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:28.850
Let me rub off the board.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.720
So you're probably already
a little bit familiar

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.400
with this idea.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.670
So when astronauts
go up into space,

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.252
they often do exercises
where they have a treadmill,

00:30:16.252 --> 00:30:18.710
and they've got springs, and
they're pulling on the springs

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.049
to try to exercise themselves.

00:30:20.049 --> 00:30:21.840
And the reason they do
that is when they're

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.450
in microgravity, if they were
doing some kind of exercise,

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.280
they would lose bone mass.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.900
And they will get back to Earth
where we have Earth gravity,

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.160
and they would have a problem.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.650
So you see it in
astronauts, in microgravity.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.660
The other place you see
this just in everyday life

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.020
is in professional
tennis players.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.100
People have done like
x-rays of the bones

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.320
of professional tennis
players, and obviously, they

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.420
have one arm that they hit
the ball with their racquet.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.890
The bones in that
arm actually get

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.500
bigger because they're loading
that bone over and over

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.020
again pretty much every day
when they're playing tennis,

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.700
and they're not
loading the other arm.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.350
So their two arms are
not symmetrical because

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.760
of this loading from hitting
the racquet over and over.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.480
And the people in 3032
have already seen this,

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.210
but I couldn't resist bringing
up the Guinea fowl experiments

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.580
again.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.270
So obviously, you can
only do x-rays on human.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.590
You can't sacrifice the humans
and look at their bones,

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.050
but you can with Guinea fowl.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:20.600
And so people have
done experiments

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.470
where they run Guinea
fowl on treadmills,

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.700
and they have one
set of Guinea fowl

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.950
that they run on the
treadmill that's horizontal.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.450
They have another
set of Guinea fowl

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.949
that they run on a treadmill
that's inclined to 20 degrees,

00:31:31.949 --> 00:31:34.490
so one would think they might
have more stress on their bones

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.550
from that, and then they
have a control group

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.580
that they don't run on
the treadmill at all.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.170
And then what they do
is they have a forced

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.360
plate on the treadmill so as
the Guinea fowl is running,

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.320
they measure the
maximum force in they're

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.820
taking high-speed video.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.850
And then they measure
the angle of the knee

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.490
at that point at which
the force is maximum.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:53.940
And they can see
there's a change

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.160
in the angle of the knee when
they put them on the inclined

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.290
treadmill, not too surprisingly.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.870
And then these are
juvenile Guinea fowl

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.856
that haven't completely
matured their bones.

00:32:03.856 --> 00:32:05.480
And then after about
six weeks of this,

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.070
they sacrifice the Guinea fowl,
and they do scans on the bone,

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.250
and they look at the
orientation of the bone,

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.560
and they measure what's
called the orientation

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.150
of the peak trabecular
density, which

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.600
is a way of characterizing
the orientation of the bone.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.510
And they find that the
angle of the knee when

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.490
the Guinea fowl are running
changes by about 14 degrees.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.130
And it turns out the
angle of the bone,

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:31.520
the orientation of the bone also
changes by about 14 degrees.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.910
So the bone has remodeled
to match that change

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.710
in the forces that are applied
as the Guinea fowl are running

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.780
on a treadmill.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.410
So this is all a
demonstration just

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.410
to show that bone grows
in response to load.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:47.230
So let me write down
some of this stuff.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:51.840
So I will say
astronauts-- did you

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.600
see Michael Collins is going
to come to the talk at MIT?

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.840
When I was a kid in '60s, he was
one of the Apollo astronauts.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.830
He was like one of the
first NASA astronauts.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:11.232
Anyway astronauts,
so in microgravity,

00:33:11.232 --> 00:33:13.065
they would lose bone
if they don't exercise.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:41.330
And tennis players, the
bones get larger in the arm

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.982
that they hold the racket with.

00:33:43.982 --> 00:33:46.109
And then I'll just
write a little bit

00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:47.900
of notes about the
Guinea fowl experiments.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:09.934
So this was done by-- it's in
a paper, Ponzer et al 2006.

00:34:09.934 --> 00:34:11.600
So they have one set
of Guinea fowl that

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.880
run on a level
treadmill, they have

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:22.900
another set that run on
a inclined treadmill,

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.590
and it's inclined at 20 degrees.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.322
And then they have
a control group that

00:34:27.322 --> 00:34:28.530
doesn't run on the treadmill.

00:34:44.129 --> 00:34:52.400
And then they measure the
angle at the knee at the moment

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.238
of peak force on the treadmill.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:16.310
And after six weeks, they
sacrificed the Guinea fowl,

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.580
and they measured
the orientation

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.475
of the peak trabecular density.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.530
And they find that
the knee flexion

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:55.011
angle changed by 13.7 degrees.

00:35:55.011 --> 00:36:08.640
And if you compared the inclined
versus the level treadmill,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.170
and they found the orientation
of the peak trabecular

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:28.690
density, which they called OPDD,
also changed by 13.6 degrees.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.000
So the idea is that the
orientation of the trabeculae

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.870
changed to match the
orientation of the loading.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.420
Then I have a little video here.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:19.490
Do you like video?

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:22.170
So I have a colleague who's
at Harvard who studies animal

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:25.160
locomotion, and they didn't
do this set of experiments,

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.250
but they do do experiments
on Guinea fowl running

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.250
on treadmills, and thought
you might find this amusing.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.220
So let me see if I
can make this work.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.830
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.340
-Sometimes you walk
into a lab and you just

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:46.026
think this is what
science is all about.

00:37:46.026 --> 00:37:47.900
-I just put the Guinea
fowl on the treadmill,

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.090
and this is something
that we commonly do.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.480
-Welcome to the
Concord Field Station,

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:04.650
a defunct Nike missile base
turned scientific menagerie.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.630
It's owned by Harvard, and
biologist Andy Biewener

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.800
is the director here.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.070
So think of it as--

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.270
-A research lab facility for
doing comparative biomechanics

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:16.350
and physiology of
largely animal movement.

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:19.920
-And the birds are just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.751
-So do you want to see
the baby goat and the emu?

00:38:22.751 --> 00:38:23.250
-Obviously.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:23.749
-OK.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.330
We keep it because it's
sort of like a mascot.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.780
There used to be
a lizard colony.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.876
You can hear the African greys.

00:38:46.876 --> 00:38:50.400
Then the jerboas are
housed in this room here.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.580
This is where we originally
did our pigeon flight studies.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.815
So usually the ones with
claws and sharp teeth

00:38:56.815 --> 00:38:59.190
and aggressive behaviors, you
want to watch out for them.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.440
-As you might expect.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.780
But did you know
that Guinea fowl--

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.357
-They're really
lovely to work with.

00:39:04.357 --> 00:39:04.856
-Sometimes.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.410
Or that--

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.210
-Rats are not very
good on treadmills.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:10.830
-Yes.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.690
That's what a rat
treadmill looks like.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:13.330
And this?

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.200
-And this was
historically a treadmill

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.260
of note, the treadmill that
they first taught kangaroos

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.819
on and showed that kangaroos
stored energy in their tendons

00:39:20.819 --> 00:39:23.360
enough that they don't actually
increase their metabolic rate

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.580
when they hop at faster speeds.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.490
-These are the kind of
discoveries made here

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:31.150
with the use of high-speed
video and x-ray machines

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.400
and semi cooperative animals.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.230
But beyond the basic
biology, Biewener

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.310
says engineers are
using this research

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.340
to build better
robots, and it can

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.470
help improve medical
treatment for people

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:45.250
with movement disorders.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.160
Today the big excitement at
the lab is happening here.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.810
Ivo Ros is studying how heart
rate changes when cockatiels

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:53.020
fly at different speeds.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.450
So this is a way to look at how
much energy it takes to fly,

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.640
and that cord is
measuring heart rate.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.228
But instead of the birds flying
faster, the wind changes speed.

00:40:02.228 --> 00:40:03.478
-I'm going to turn it on then.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:14.430
-It's hard to fly fast, and
it's hard to fly slow, Ros says.

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:16.800
So the expectation is
that the heart rate should

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.090
be shaped like a U.
But so far Ros is

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:22.240
finding that it's a flat line.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.520
It's like the bird goes
into a stress reaction

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.090
when it takes off.

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:28.920
Is that just because
of the wind tunnel?

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.045
What Ros wants to know is--

00:40:30.045 --> 00:40:32.670
- --whether or not they need to
be stressed to fly in the first

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.220
place.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.810
-That's something that
Ros is looking into,

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.150
but today is mostly
about training.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.770
-Keep going.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:39.530
Come on.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:40.940
-Imagine you're a cockatiel.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.590
A wind tunnel is kind
of a strange experience.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.720
-A bird in a wind tunnel
has to confront the fact

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.150
that the world is not
moving past, which

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.290
defies its normal sensory cues.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:52.781
-Which pretty well sums up
the Concord Field Station

00:40:52.781 --> 00:40:53.280
generally.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.940
For Science Friday,
I'm Flora Lichtman.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:05.080
[END PLAYBACK]

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.030
And if read The New York
Times, Flora Lichtman

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.920
used to work for NPR and would
make these Science Friday

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.530
videos for them.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.870
But now she has a gig doing
things for The New York Times,

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.900
and she does science
videos still.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.776
I don't know if you
quite call them videos,

00:41:19.776 --> 00:41:22.150
but what they do is they have
these little paper puppets,

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.930
and the paper puppets
are animated and re-enact

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.250
different episodes in science.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:31.200
And it's kind of amazing how
they do these little science

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.030
videos.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:33.710
So if you Google
Flora Lichtman, you'll

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:37.107
see more Science Videos
with all sorts of things.

00:41:37.107 --> 00:41:38.690
I guess the other
interesting anecdote

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.790
is I went to the Concord
Field Station once.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.090
And I had done a study
on quills and animals

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:47.937
that have quills because the
quills have a foamy structure

00:41:47.937 --> 00:41:48.520
in the middle.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.620
So they're carrot,
and they have sort

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.930
of like carrot-like structures.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:52.680
And they have an outer
shell that's dense,

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.730
and then they have a
foamy thing in the middle.

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:56.950
Anyway I did this
paper on quills

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.550
and how they work mechanically.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:00.709
And Technology reviewed a
little article about it,

00:42:00.709 --> 00:42:02.750
and they said they wanted
to take a picture of me

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:03.769
with a hedgehog.

00:42:03.769 --> 00:42:05.560
The hedgehogs are little
European-- they're

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.320
like little small, cute things.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.360
And I said, well, if
you can find a hedgehog,

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.300
I'm happy to have
my photograph taken.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.540
And they had a hedgehog at
the Concord Field Station.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.070
So we went out there, and we
had these big leather gloves

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:18.030
and took a picture.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.280
And I don't if it was Andy
or I don't know who it was,

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.760
but I said one of
the people there,

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.093
what did you do with a hedgehog?

00:42:23.093 --> 00:42:26.570
And he said, well, we tried
to do the treadmill study.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:28.020
But hedgehogs are
like porcupines.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.269
When they get scared, they
curl up into a little ball.

00:42:30.269 --> 00:42:32.172
And so they said they
would put the hedgehog

00:42:32.172 --> 00:42:34.380
down under the treadmill,
and they would start it up,

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.970
and it would make a noise,
and it would get scared it.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.345
And it would just go into a
little ball and kind of slide

00:42:38.345 --> 00:42:41.040
along to the end, and then it
would kind of get flopped off.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.609
So that was the end of
the hedgehog experiments.

00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:45.650
But they did have wallabies
there the day I went.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:47.390
So they have all
sorts of animals

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.610
that they put on to treadmills,
birds that they fly,

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.090
so it's kind of
interesting to go there.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.370
But the main idea
here is that there

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.480
was this set of experiments
with Guinea fowl that

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.970
showed just how precisely
the orientation of the bone

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.810
matches the orientation
of the loads.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:05.310
AUDIENCE: Was there a difference
between the control groups?

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.120
LORNA GIBSON: Ah,
so I have slides.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:07.950
I have slides.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.220
Hang on a sec.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:11.990
I got distracted by my video.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:14.730
Sorry.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:18.220
So here's the sort of schematic
of Guinea fowl on treadmill.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.540
And where's the
little doo-da here?

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.490
So on the level, the
knee flexion angle

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:28.480
was whatever this is, 76.3,
and here was the 62.6,

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.790
so the difference is 13.7.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:34.200
And then this kind of table
here summarizes these results.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.970
So this is the maximum
trabecular density,

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.280
and this is the angle.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.007
And here we have the incline.

00:43:43.007 --> 00:43:44.590
Let's see, the control
was the yellow,

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:47.000
and the level was
the blue, and they've

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.020
got the values for that peak
trabecular density orientation.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.650
So they've got
that for the level.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:54.510
And then they looked
at the difference

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:58.340
between the incline and the
level in the knee angle.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.809
That's what this thing here is.

00:44:00.809 --> 00:44:02.600
And then between the
level and the control,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.860
there wasn't really any
difference in the knee

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:10.040
angle because the control ones,
they were just walking around.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:15.460
So that's the sort of slide
that has the actual data on it.

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.190
All right.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:18.360
And then I showed you the video.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:18.860
All right.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.287
So we need to do a couple
more things before we

00:44:21.287 --> 00:44:22.120
get to the modeling.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.200
Let me get a drink.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.020
So if we want to use
the models for foams

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.920
to try to describe
the trabecular bone,

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.420
we need to know something about
the properties of the solid.

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.550
Remember we used the properties
of the solid in the models.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.360
So we want to get the properties
of the solid in the trabeculae,

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.530
and there's a couple of
ways you can do this.

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:53.480
To get the moduli, you can use
an ultrasonic wave propagation

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.165
method, and you can
measure a modulus that way.

00:44:56.165 --> 00:44:57.540
And if they do
that, they measure

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.680
a modulus between about
15 and 18 gigapascals.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.610
Another way to do it is
to take a piece of bone,

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:07.690
do a compression test on
it, measure the modulus.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.670
Before you do the test, you
put it in the micro CT machine,

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:13.060
and you get a picture
of the structure,

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.650
and then you use
that as the input

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.390
to a finite element analysis.

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:17.830
So the finite
element analysis is

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:22.080
a computer numerical analysis
to do mechanical calculations.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.260
And if you know what the
modulus of the structure is,

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.640
you can back out what
the modulus of the solid

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.020
must have been from
the fine element thing.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.210
And those sorts of
experiments also

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.400
showed that the
modulus was around 18.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.940
And it turns out that moduli
is about the same as cortical

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.820
bone, and the properties
of the solid trabeculae

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.860
are very similar to the
solid cortical bone.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.260
So let me scoot over here.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:47:00.800
So if you use an ultrasonic
wave propagation,

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.200
people have measured a modulus
for the solid in trabecular

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:14.650
bone of 18 gigapascals, or
you can do a finite element

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:22.420
calculation based on micro
CT data for the structure.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.140
And then you measure the overall
modulus for the trabecular

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:48.380
bone, and then you back out
the modulus of the solid.

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.660
And people who've done
that have gotten values

00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:01.700
of around 18 gigapascals too,
and that's very similar to what

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:02.900
the cortical bone is.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:14.650
And so we're going to use
the following properties

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:17.380
for the solid in
the trabecular bone.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.690
We're going to say
the density is 1,800

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.770
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:26.930
The Young's modulus
is 18 gigapascals.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:30.960
The yield strength
has different values

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.780
in tension and compression.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.680
It's about 182 megapascals
in compression.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:45.310
And it's about 115
megapascals in tension.

00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:54.525
So those are the
solid properties.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.440
So then if we look at the
compressive stress-strain

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.760
curves, they have the shape
shown on the screen there.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.090
And you can see how similar
the stress-strain curves

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:58.420
are for those for a foam.

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.400
So there's the
same three regimes

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.930
that we see for the foam.

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:04.060
There is a linear
elastic regime over here,

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.120
there's a stress plateau
here, and there's

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.310
some densification regime here.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:11.000
These are three curves for three
different relative densities.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.280
As the relative density goes
up, the stiffness goes up,

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.380
the plateau stress goes up,
and the densification strain

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:17.880
goes down.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:22.410
So is the same as the foams
that we've looked at before.

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:27.570
And if we look at the mechanisms
of deformation and failure,

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:29.570
people have looked at this.

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.650
These are on a whale vertebrae.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:35.440
So these are tests that are
done in a micron CT machine,

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.590
again, by Ralph Muller's group.

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:39.600
And here the
specimen is unloaded,

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.190
and here's the same
specimen loaded.

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:43.580
So you can see this platen
has come down a little bit.

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:45.800
And if you look at
this column here,

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.780
this trabecular here,
you can see it's bent out

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.240
and bowed out more.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.810
And people have
found that usually

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:54.060
the linear elastic
behavior is controlled

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:57.410
by bending of that
trabeculae, and the plateau

00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:00.570
stress is usually controlled
by some sort of buckling.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:01.880
But it's not elastic buckling.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.670
You don't recover it.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:04.670
If you take a piece of
bone and you compress it,

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.200
it's going to have a
permanent deformation.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.010
So it's inelastic buckling.

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:12.310
And I think we have
some more pictures.

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.120
This is another
example from whale bone

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.510
from Ralph Muller's group.

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:19.670
So here's the bone unloaded.

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:22.390
Here it's loaded to 4%
strain, here it's to 8%.

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:25.250
And you can start seeing
right in this area here

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:29.310
if you compare with up
there, it's starting to form.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.700
And if you go up
here to 12% strain,

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.440
you see that strut right there.

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.900
That was this guy up
here, and you can see

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.210
that it's buckled right over.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.740
So people have made measurements
like this in observations,

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.550
and you can actually
see the buckling.

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:44.810
And people have also done
finite element modeling.

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:48.170
They can take a micro
CT scan and input that

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:49.412
to the fine element model.

00:51:49.412 --> 00:51:50.870
And then if they
do the compression

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.720
and they input the
properties of the solid,

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.590
they can see that they get
a buckling kind of failure.

00:51:55.590 --> 00:52:01.150
If you have trabeculae that are
very aligned-- we have more.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:02.590
Here's one more in the buckling.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.660
So this is one of
Ralph's little movies.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:07.040
So when it unloads, it
looks like it recovers,

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.880
but this is all
just an animation.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.270
He takes several stills
and puts them together,

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:13.627
and it doesn't actually recover.

00:52:13.627 --> 00:52:14.960
It's just the way that it shows.

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.490
But again, these are
two different specimens

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:19.050
of different densities.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:23.390
You can see how
the struts deform.

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:24.772
They bend and then they buckle.

00:52:27.451 --> 00:52:29.784
Let me stop there, and I'll
put some stuff on the board.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.430
So we'll say the compressive
stress-strain curve

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:43.570
has the characteristic
shape of cellular solids.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.060
And the mechanisms of
deformation and failure,

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:15.310
usually there is bending
followed by, usually,

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:16.825
inelastic or plastic buckling.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.860
And sometimes if
the trabeculae are

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.930
aligned like that knee
that I showed you,

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:08.346
or if the trabecular are aligned
or if they're very dense,

00:54:08.346 --> 00:54:11.760
then the actual
deformation is important.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.850
And I'll just say
people have found this

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:23.230
by making observations using
micro computer tomography

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:27.788
or by finite element
calculations.

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:11.540
And this is a stress-strain
curve and tension

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:14.760
here, a tension you get
failure at small strains, then

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.447
you get micro
cracks in the bone.

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:39.320
And these next plots just
show some data for the bone.

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:43.930
So we're plotting the
Young's modulus here.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:46.030
So this is a relative
Young's modulus,

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.400
the modulus of the bone
divided by the solid cell wall

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.430
material.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:50.960
Here's the relative density.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.130
Here's data for lots of
different specimens of bone.

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:56.250
So some of this data
is for human bones,

00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:59.190
some is for bovine bone.

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:01.860
Sometimes the data
is taken where

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.657
the orientation
of the trabeculae

00:56:03.657 --> 00:56:05.740
doesn't line up with the
direction of the loading.

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:08.073
So you might have trabeculae
that are oriented this way,

00:56:08.073 --> 00:56:09.370
but you're loading it this way.

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:13.310
There's sometimes
different strain rates.

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:13.830
Let's see.

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:17.280
There's different groups,
and so there's a huge scatter

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.500
in the range of the data.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.370
But you can see if
you look at it broadly

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:23.780
and you look at that
whole cluster of data,

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:28.040
the data lie close to
a line of a slope of 2.

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.000
And if you think of the
open-celled foam model

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.460
and you had bending
of the cell walls,

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.935
you'd expect that the
modulus would vary

00:56:32.935 --> 00:56:34.260
[? to the ?] density squared.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.107
So that's kind of the limit
of how we do the modeling.

00:56:37.107 --> 00:56:39.690
We're really just interested in
seeing how the properties vary

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:40.947
with density.

00:56:40.947 --> 00:56:42.530
If you had a particular
piece of bone,

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.904
I don't think you could use
the models to exactly predict

00:56:44.904 --> 00:56:46.900
what the modulus of
that bone would be.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.995
And here's the
compressive strength here.

00:56:48.995 --> 00:56:50.870
So this is the relative
compressive strength.

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.980
Here we've normalized
it with the yield

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:57.480
stress of the solid bone, and
here's the relative density.

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.340
And you can see, again,
this line is of slope 2,

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:03.890
so that kind of speaks to the
buckling-type failure mode.

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:05.970
And I think I have
another one here.

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:07.680
This is the tensile strength.

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.200
So if you pull the
bone in tension,

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.699
you wouldn't expect
to get buckling,

00:57:10.699 --> 00:57:13.120
you'd expect to get
plastic yielding.

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.030
And if you got yielding and you
use the open-cell foam model,

00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:19.980
you'd expect a slope of 3/2, so
this line has a slope of 3/2.

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.480
And this line is sort of
towards the upper bound

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.450
of that set of data.

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:26.650
You can imagine a line that went
through it a little bit lower

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:28.080
but the same slope.

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.360
And so these
open-celled foam models,

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.140
they don't predict
the properties

00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:34.130
of a particular piece
of bone because the bone

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:36.900
can have some anisotropy to it.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.950
The orientation of these things
may not be perfectly lined up

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:41.520
with the loading.

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.100
But overall the models
give you a sense

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:49.450
of how the bone is
deforming and failing.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.330
So let me write
some of this down.

00:58:02.455 --> 00:58:04.920
So that's data for the modulus,
the compressive strength,

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.840
and the tensile strength.

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.350
And those have been
on those plots.

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:16.310
Those values are normalized
by data for cortical bone.

00:58:27.229 --> 00:58:28.520
I thought somebody was talking.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.770
It's just the chair squeaking.

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.580
And as I said the spread
in the data is large,

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:50.120
and that's due to anisotropy
in the bone and misalignment

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.640
between the bone orientation
and the loading direction.

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:10.950
So when people first started
doing tests on trabecular bone,

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:13.710
they typically were
orthopedics labs.

00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:16.970
And the orthopedics labs tended
to initially cut the bone

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:19.840
specimens on anatomical axes.

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.180
So they would do you know
the superior-inferior,

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:25.190
or the medial-lateral, or
the posterior-anterior.

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:28.469
But the bone orientation didn't
line up with those directions.

00:59:28.469 --> 00:59:30.010
So the bone might
have been this way,

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:31.440
but they were
loading it this way,

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.856
and so that gave
this misalignment.

00:59:34.856 --> 00:59:36.230
And there could
be some variation

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:37.470
in the solid properties too.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.070
So you could imagine some solid
might have more micro cracks

00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:45.470
than another.

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:49.195
So if you took say human
bone of different ages,

00:59:49.195 --> 00:59:50.820
you might expect the
older bone to have

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:51.960
more micro cracks in it.

00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:01.725
So these plots put a
lot of data together,

01:00:01.725 --> 01:00:05.800
and then the lines are based
on models for open-cell foams.

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.660
So the relative
modulus goes roughly

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:21.565
as a relative density squared,
and the cell walls are bending.

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:29.450
And the compressive
strength goes roughly

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:36.590
as the modulus
squared, and that's

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:39.880
related to this
plastic buckling.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:45.470
And then the tensile
stress or tensile strength

01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:48.620
depends on the formation
of plastic hinges,

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.600
and it goes roughly as the
density to the 3/2 power.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:08.310
And one observation
that people have made

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:13.690
is that in compression, if the
modulus and the strength both

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:16.040
go as a density
squared, then the ratio

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.180
of the strength to the modulus
is just a constant, and that,

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.260
in fact, is just the
strain at failure,

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.950
or the strain for
that say, the plateau.

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:35.190
And that's a strain
of about 0.7%,

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:37.370
and that's pretty consistent
in trabecular bone.

01:01:41.476 --> 01:01:42.155
Let's see.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.815
And we said sometimes the
bone was relatively aligned.

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:00.560
So here's that
picture of the femoral

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.770
condyle again in the knee, and
you can see the bones lined up.

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:06.900
If you have bone that's
lined up like that

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.660
and you load it along the
direction of alignment,

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:13.460
then you can get axial
deformation in the trabeculae.

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.940
And then you would expect
the moduli would go linearly

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.800
with the density.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.980
And here's some data
for the Young's modulus

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.430
and the compressive strength of
bone that was fairly aligned.

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:26.160
So this was selected
to be aligned.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.950
So here's the modulus here.

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:33.630
And the square data points are
the longitudinal direction,

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:37.160
and the little diamond, these
little stars, are transverse.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.800
So here's a line of slope
1, and again, they don't all

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.810
lie perfectly on that line, but
roughly the slope is about 1

01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:44.400
there.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.520
And then similarly here, this
is the compressive strength.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.140
Now the little squares
are the longitudinal data,

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.420
and they're not exactly
on a slope of 1,

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:55.170
but they're more or
less on a slope of 1.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.140
So I'll just say
in some regions,

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.193
the bone may be aligned.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.040
And then axial
deformation is important.

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:22.700
And then you would expect
the modulus to go linearly

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:26.110
with the density
and the strength

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:29.120
to go linearly with the density
in the longitudinal direction.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.190
Then finally I wanted to finish
up the bit on the modeling

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.160
by making one of these
plots a little bit

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.890
like we did for wood.

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:52.470
So here's the Young's
modulus of bone plotted

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:53.920
against the density.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.600
The trabecular
bone is down here.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.710
It's sort the lowest density.

01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:00.040
And then this is
the collagen that's

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.850
in the solid part of
the bone, and this

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:04.200
is hydroxyapatite, the mineral.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.640
So the modulus of hydroxyapatite
is around 120 gigapascals,

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.800
and the modulus of collagen
is somewhere around 5.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.560
And if you make composites of
collagen and hydroxyapatite,

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.380
their moduli are going to
be in this envelope here,

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.910
and compact bone, the
modulus fits in around here.

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:22.694
Remember I said it was
around 18 gigapascals.

01:04:22.694 --> 01:04:24.110
So then if you
take a compact bone

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.920
and you turn it into
trabecular bone,

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.020
you'd expect the modulus would
go down along a slope of 2.

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.840
So here's our little slope
of 2, and more or less that's

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.330
what you see with
the trabecular bone.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:37.260
So the idea is that
the models give you

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:40.241
kind of a general idea of
how the bone is behaving,

01:04:40.241 --> 01:04:41.740
but it's not really
meant to predict

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.980
a particular piece of bone.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.438
Because a particular
piece is going

01:04:44.438 --> 01:04:46.470
to have a particular geometry.

01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:49.830
Typically they're not
equi ax and isotropic.

01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:50.600
All right.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.400
So are we good with
the general overview?

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.440
Are we good with how
fewer equations there

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.790
are now that we got past the
first part of the course?

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.552
So I'm going to talk a bit
more about osteoporosis,

01:05:05.552 --> 01:05:07.260
and I'm going to talk
about some modeling

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.707
that my group did to look at the
consequences of osteoporosis.

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:13.790
And then later on we're
going to talk a little bit

01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:17.030
about using metal foams as a
possible replacement material

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:18.970
for a trabecular bone as well.

01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:20.860
And I have a little
bit of a talk

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:25.280
on using trabecular bone
in evolutionary studies

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.144
to see whether or not a species
was bipedal or quadrupedal.

01:05:29.144 --> 01:05:31.310
So I think I talked about
this a little bit in 3032,

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:35.800
but I have more slides and more
stuff I'm going to talk about.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.555
So let me get myself organized.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.420
So osteoporosis
comes from the Latin,

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.450
and it actually
means porous bones.

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:26.910
So osteo means bone,
and not too surprisingly

01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:31.700
porosis means porous.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.180
So this next slide
gives you some idea what

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:36.510
osteoporotic bone looks like.

01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:39.770
So the top slide is normal
bone in a 55-year-old woman.

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:42.590
These are sections
from the lumbar spine.

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:45.130
And that bone up
here is 17% dense,

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:47.520
so the relative
density is point 0.17.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.550
And this is a section
from the same area

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:55.770
of bone in an 86-year-old
woman, and it's 7% dense.

01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:58.180
So you can see there's a huge
difference in the density,

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.721
and you can start
to see what happens

01:06:59.721 --> 01:07:01.930
when you lose bone mass.

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:06.282
So if you look at this bone up
here, it's all well connected.

01:07:06.282 --> 01:07:07.740
Each little trabeculae
is connected

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:09.470
to its neighboring friends.

01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:11.790
And you can see down here,
I mean, you look at this

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:13.670
and you kind of go ouch
just looking at it.

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:16.970
Because this piece of bone here
is just kind of dangling off,

01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:18.680
not connected to anything.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.840
And you can see the struts
have gotten thinner,

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.290
so they've lost bone
mass by thinning.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.980
And then as I said
when the thickness gets

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.710
less than they are roughly
equal to the size of the cells,

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:31.190
then the cells
can't live anymore,

01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:34.720
and the bone strut just
disappears altogether.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.330
So it's not too surprising
that if you lose this much bone

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:40.980
mass, there's
mechanical consequences,

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:43.110
and there's a greater
risk of fracture.

01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:47.880
And as I said the two most
common types of fractures

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.000
are hip fractures and
vertebral fractures.

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:56.240
So let's see here.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.735
So as people age,
everybody loses bone mass.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.580
And happily for you and
not so happily for me,

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:12.200
the bone mass peaks
at about 25 years old.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.440
So you're probably
either not at the peak

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.819
or just barely at the peak.

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:19.859
And then it decreases
after that every year.

01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:21.260
I'm considerably older than you.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.670
And in women, when you
go through menopause,

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:40.979
the cessation of
estrogen production

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:42.260
increases the bone loss.

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:45.680
And so typically,
osteoporosis is most common

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.200
in post menopausal women.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.290
And osteoporosis is
defined as a bone mass 2.5

01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:30.029
standard deviations
or more below that

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:31.850
of a young, normal mean.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:33.960
So it's not like you
fall and break your hip

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.720
and they say you
have osteoporosis.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.981
It's based on the bone mass.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.910
And as I said, the
trabeculae thin and then

01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:09.870
they resorb completely.

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:25.780
So anybody here take Latin?

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.600
Yes.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.140
I did Latin for one
year in high school.

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:32.270
So trabeculae, with
an E on the end here,

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.130
trabeculae, I suppose,
is the plural.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:36.120
Trabecula with an A is singular.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.890
And that comes from Latin.

01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:40.910
So you don't say trabeculas.

01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:41.650
That's a no-no.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:47.326
All right.

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:50.940
Let me get rid of these.

01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:00.090
So if we saw that the
strength of the bone

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:02.550
varies as the
density squared, you

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:05.600
can begin to see how sensitive
the strength is going

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.590
to be to this bone mass loss.

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:13.580
So say you went from a density
of 0.2 to a density of 0.1,

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.560
then the densities
changed by a factor of 2

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.260
so that the densities
gone down by 1/2,

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:19.660
but the strength is going
to go down by a factor of 4.

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:21.950
You're going to have the
strength to be a 1/4.

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:25.920
And so you're going to have
a big change in the strength.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.780
And you can imagine is
the trabeculae thins,

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.408
this buckling gets
easier to happen.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.570
And then once the
trabeculae begin

01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:56.030
to resorb as they disappear
altogether, it's like I said.

01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:59.100
it's like having a
building's framework.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.851
Now, you're removing
beams and columns,

01:12:00.851 --> 01:12:03.350
and the strength is going to
go down even more dramatically.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.880
And the way we model
the osteoporotic bone

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.060
is we use finite
element analysis.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.660
So before we talked
about using the unit cell

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:39.744
for the honeycomb.

01:12:39.744 --> 01:12:41.160
But to use the
unit cell, you have

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.890
to have repeating unit
cells, and obviously, you

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:45.300
don't have that.

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:49.350
You've got local variations in
what the structure looks like.

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:51.360
And we also used a
dimensional analysis.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.400
And the dimensional
analysis relies

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:57.596
on the geometry being similar
from one specimen to another,

01:12:57.596 --> 01:12:58.970
and you can't
really rely on that

01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:01.760
either for the
osteoporotic bone.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.580
And so what we've
done is-- and this

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:10.380
is what other people do as well,
is use finite element modeling

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:11.420
to represent the bone.

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:21.805
So initially what we did was
we used a 2D Voronoi model.

01:13:21.805 --> 01:13:24.660
So remember we talked about
Voronoi honeycombs and Voronoi

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:27.000
foams.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.770
So I like to start out
with simple things,

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:32.870
so we started out with 2D
Voronoi model for a honeycomb.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.160
Then we did a 2D representation
of vertebral bone.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:55.647
And then we had a 3D Voronoi.

01:13:55.647 --> 01:13:57.480
And I had a couple of
students who did this.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.440
Matt Silver was the one
who did the first two,

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.110
and Sereca Vagilla was the
one who did the last one.

01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:05.040
So let's see.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.120
I think that's probably a good
place to stop there for today.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.450
So next time I'll talk about the
modeling of osteoporotic bone,

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:15.450
and we might talk a little
bit about metal bones

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:19.250
as a substitute for trabecular--
metal foams as a substitute.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:21.210
I don't think we'll get
to the evolution stuff.

01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:23.920
We probably won't
quite finish next time.
