LORNA GIBSON: What I thought I
would do today is two things.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.180
I wanted to give this talk
about osteochondral scaffolds,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.300
and this is just slides.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.410
I'm not going to
write anything down.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.993
So there aren't going
to be any notes.

00:00:35.993 --> 00:00:38.890
And I'll put the slides on the
Stellar site, I don't know,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.960
this afternoon or
tonight or something.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.282
And this isn't going to take
the whole time we have today,

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:45.740
so the other thing
I thought I'd do

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.880
is I wanted to walk you
through this little booklet

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.190
that I handed out about
how to write a paper.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.060
So this is by Mike
Ashby, who you know,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.060
I've written books with.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.610
He was my PhD advisor
and we wrote the books

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.930
on cellular solids together.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.760
He has written many books.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.662
I looked him up on
Amazon this morning,

00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:02.620
and even though I know
he'd written many books,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.828
I was shocked how many books.

00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:08.230
They had 58 listings for just
books with him as a co-author

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.410
and some are second
editions and third editions.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.576
He's written a lot of books.

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:13.660
He's written a lot
of materials, papers.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.310
And he's, in the
materials community,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.310
he's seen as a very
clear and lucid writer.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.199
So he's written this
thing for his students

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:22.990
and I thought we could
just walk through it

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.236
and I can talk to you a
little bit about writing.

00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:27.610
Because I know you're not
quite there with your projects,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.151
but later on in the
term you're going

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:30.670
to want to write
up your project,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.740
and it's not too early to
start thinking about writing.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.460
And there's some really
good advice and it's short

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.100
and it's to the point.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.341
It's really helpful,
that little brochure.

00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:41.840
So we won't read
every single thing,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.040
but I wanted to kind
of walk through some

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.150
of the main points in
it, and that pretty much

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.100
should take the hour.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.980
So last time we talked about
tissue engineering scaffolds,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.740
and today, I wanted
to do a case study,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.159
and this was a
project we had here

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.700
at MIT and in collaboration with
some people in the materials

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.610
department at
Cambridge University.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.290
And we made what we called
an osteochondral scaffold.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.410
So osteo means there was
a part for regenerating

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.150
bone and chondral means there
was a part for regenerating

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.100
cartilage.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.030
And really the point
of the scaffold

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.280
was to try to repair small
defects in cartilage.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.530
And I'll explain why we
did the bone thing as well.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.130
So this is just
a little outline.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.370
I'm going to talk a
little bit about what

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.860
the structure of cartilage is.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.080
We have a little
schematic of that.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.640
Then talk about how small
defects in cartilage

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.670
are currently treated.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.997
So these are things that,
say you're an athlete,

00:02:28.997 --> 00:02:31.080
you might tear some
cartilage, that kind of thing,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.530
not like you have osteoarthritis
and you need a new knee.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.742
It's not going to do that.

00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:36.450
So I'll talk a little
bit about cartilage

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.870
and the current treatments.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.286
I'll talk about
some of the things

00:02:39.286 --> 00:02:42.760
we thought about in making
an osteochondral scaffold,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.900
like what parameters
were important.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.440
And we based it on that
collagen-GAG scaffold

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.040
that I talked about last time.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.920
So the collagen
glycoseaminoglycan

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.694
scaffold that we
talked about last time.

00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:54.110
And what we did
was we had a layer

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.120
that was a collagen based
scaffold for the cartilage

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.610
and we had another
layer that was

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.180
a mineralized version of that.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.221
And one of the main things
we did in this project

00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:04.260
was figure out how to
mineralize that scaffold.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.170
And then we made this two-layer
osteochondral scaffold.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.280
So I'll talk about that, OK?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.030
So are we good?

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.540
So this is a schematic
of articular cartilage.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.990
Articular just means it's
in a joint, so between

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.410
like, say, two of
your long bones,

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.650
and there's several regions.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.030
So this shows both the cartilage
and the bone underneath it.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.930
And so this top layer is
called the superficial layer,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.410
and then there's
a transition zone,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.590
and then there's this
deep cartilage here.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.040
And the little white lines
represent how the collagen

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.540
is oriented in the cartilage.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.380
So the collagen is
oriented, more or less,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.610
vertically here and then it
becomes more kind of woven

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.940
and horizontal towards the top.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.430
And so those three
different zones,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.670
the collagen is
oriented differently.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.080
Then there's a region down
here called the tidemark.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.140
Everything above here is just
cartilage and everything below

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.430
is calcified to some extent.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.780
So this next layer down here
it's more cartilage-like,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.300
but it's got some
calcification in it as well.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.900
And then here's
the compact bone.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.540
They call it subchondral bone.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.290
It's the bone below
the cartilage.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.890
So chondral is cartilage.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.390
And then here's the
trabecular bone.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.019
We talked about trabecular
bone a couple of weeks ago, OK?

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.540
So one of the things is there's
different types of collagen

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.900
and the different types may
have slightly different fiber

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.774
structures or slightly
different compositions.

00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:34.190
They're all related, but they're
slightly different types.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.870
And bone has what's called
type I collagen and cartilage

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.460
has type II collagen. So
when we made the scaffold,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.350
we wanted the bony
layer to be made

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.140
with type I and the cartilage
layer to be made with type II.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.870
So I think with the 3032
people have probably seen it.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.640
I think I did a
version of this for you

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.060
guys, didn't I at the
end of term, something?

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.910
Yeah, but there's other people,
so it's really for them.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.040
So if you think of
articular cartilage,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.289
it has difficulty repairing
itself and one of the reasons

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.830
that it's difficult
for the cartilage

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.340
to repair itself is that
there's no blood supply in it

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.160
and another reason is that
there's not very many cells.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.080
So chondrocytes are
the cells in cartilage

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.450
and if there's a low volume
fraction of the cells,

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.860
then it's not so easy for
that small number of cells

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.760
to actually produce the
extracellular matrix, which

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.740
is kind of what you think
of as the cartilage.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.745
And it can be damaged, either
as I said, from sports injuries,

00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:31.370
typically that's what
young people get,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.930
they tear their cartilage in
some sporting injury accident,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.500
or from osteoarthritis.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.180
So these scaffolds
we're talking about,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.080
they're not really meant
to repair large amounts

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.780
of cartilage that are damaged.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.020
And as I said, the cartilage
has a poor capacity

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.097
for self-repair.

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:49.680
So there's several
treatments, there's

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.190
three treatments that
are given currently

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.225
and the most common one is
called marrow stimulation.

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:56.850
And some of these
orthopedic treatments

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.490
are fairly crude
when you look at it.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.480
So this marrow stimulation,
what's involved

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.390
is they take a drill.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.302
So here's the drill.

00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:06.260
And they basically drill
through the cartilage.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.116
So this would be the
cartilage layer here.

00:06:08.116 --> 00:06:09.490
And they drill
down into the bone

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.615
and they want to get down
into the trabecular bone.

00:06:11.615 --> 00:06:13.250
So they want to go
below the cortical

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.250
or the subchondral bone
and they want to go down

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.674
into the trabecular bone.

00:06:17.674 --> 00:06:20.090
And the reason they want to
do that is the trabecular bone

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.910
has bone marrow in it
and the bone marrow

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.860
has mesenchymal
stem cells, and they

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.100
want those mesenchymal
stem cells to move up

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.670
into the cartilage layer.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.830
So that's what this
red glob is here.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.900
The idea is that
you've made a hole

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.780
and now that hole
is going to fill up

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.350
with a blood clot, which will
have these mesenchymal stem

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.900
cells, and that those
will form cartilage.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.900
So it does work to some
extent, but it's not really

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.430
a great result. There's
something like 75,000

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.390
of these done a year.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.590
As I said, this is the
most common kind of repair.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.580
The next most sophisticated
type of repair, what they do

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.650
is they take plugs of bone and
cartilage from another place.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.080
So say this is
where the defect is

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.660
and they want to repair that.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.240
They take bone and cartilage
from this spot up here.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.040
So they sort of drill out
little cylindrical cores

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.510
and then they plug them
into this bit here.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.380
And that's called an
osteochondral autograft.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.550
Sometimes it's
called mosaicplasty

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.826
because they build up a
little mosaic from all

00:07:19.826 --> 00:07:22.179
those little pieces.

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:23.970
And then they just
leave these donor sites,

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.550
where they took the plugs from,
they just leave those empty.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.650
So they try to take the bone
and cartilage from regions where

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.770
the loads are lower,
but they end up

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.990
leaving holes, which
is not so desirable.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.370
And again, those holes
may fill a little bit

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.600
by the previous mechanism.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.820
Then the most fancy
method that they use now

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.860
is called autologous
chondrocyte implantation.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.020
So what they do is they
harvest cartilage cells

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.670
from the patient.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.040
They then take them to a
lab and they culture them

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.560
for two or three
weeks and they get

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.370
them to multiply and
proliferate and grow

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.890
and then they
re-implant the cells.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.930
So this works fairly
well, but the difficulty

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.090
is it involves two surgeries,
so one to get the cells out

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.190
and one to put them
back in, and there's

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.619
the cost of the cell culture.

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:15.160
So this is a much more expensive
procedure because of the two

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.340
surgeries and the cost of
doing the cell culture,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.010
but I think it's the
method that works the best.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.550
And when I talked about this in
3032, I mentioned Dara Torres.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.670
Dara Torres is an
Olympic swimmer.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.134
She's 47.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.550
She began swimming
in the Olympics

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.370
in 1984, more than 30 years ago.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.039
And she has swum
in the Olympics,

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.750
not every one,
but up until 2008.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.669
And even 2008, she won
three silvers that year.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.299
She was, I think,
the oldest person

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.740
who's ever won a
medal in the Olympics.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.420
And she had this surgery done
at the Brigham a few years ago.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.054
And it used to be,
they've stopped

00:08:51.054 --> 00:08:53.220
running these commercials
but the Brigham for a time

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.070
was running these commercials,
that featured Dara Torres

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.270
and saying basically that she
had this surgery done there.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.180
I'm assuming she
was happy with it.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.526
OK, so that's what
they do currently

00:09:05.526 --> 00:09:08.150
and what we were thinking of and
what other groups have thought

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.480
about is could you repair
damage in the cartilage

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.860
by using a tissue
engineering scaffold?

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.360
So what we were
thinking about when

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.750
we tried to do
this project was we

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.130
wanted to use a healthy
articular cartilage joint

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.740
as a model for our scaffold.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.260
We wanted to have a layer that
would go down into the bone

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.100
so that you would have access
to those mesenchymal stem cells.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.780
And that's why we wanted
an osteochondral scaffold,

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.190
so that we would have a
layer for the cartilage

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.730
but also a layer that would
go down into the bone.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.810
We wanted to be able to control
scaffold parameters, things

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.460
like the mineral content
and the pore size.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.970
Remember, I said these
tissue engineering scaffolds,

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.750
the pore size is one
of the parameters,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.080
that you want to have the
pore size in a certain range.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.700
And we wanted to
use materials that

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.990
would be appropriate
for approval

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.711
from things like the FDA.

00:09:59.711 --> 00:10:02.210
So typically, when people make
tissue engineering scaffolds,

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.660
they don't start with
some material that's

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.650
never been approved before.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.800
They start with
something that already

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.550
has approval for
something else and that's

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.440
what we wanted to do too.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.500
So this was our idea of
what we wanted the scaffold

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.100
to look like.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.380
We wanted an unmineralized type
II collagen scaffold up here

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.880
that would be for the cartilage.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.900
We wanted a mineralized type
I collagen scaffold down there

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.300
for the bone.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.750
And we wanted some
region that had

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.150
some gradient in
mineralization because it

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.309
would be like that
layer of cartilage that

00:10:28.309 --> 00:10:29.350
was slightly mineralized.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.920
So we wanted to duplicate
that whole structure.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.384
So that was our picture
of what we wanted to do

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:37.050
and we had a pretty good idea of
how we were going to make this.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.841
We were just going to
use that same process

00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:41.540
that [INAUDIBLE] developed
for the skin scaffolds.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.000
He was involved
with this project

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.760
but just used type II
collagen instead of type I.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.730
The challenge was
really figuring out

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.820
how to make the mineralized
collagen scaffold

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.410
and then how to get this
gradient in the mineralization

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.442
between the two layers.

00:10:56.442 --> 00:10:58.150
So this, I think, I
showed you last time.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.899
So this is just the
method we used to make

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:01.220
the collagen-GAG scaffold.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.290
So we take type II collagen.
We put it in acetic acid.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.670
Remember, that destroys
the periodic banding

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.880
of the collagen and it improves
the immunological response.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.440
We add the chondroitin
6-sulfate, the GAG,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.640
to crosslink it.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.800
We then just make a
slurry out of that.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.000
So we mix that all together.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.640
We keep it as a slurry.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.490
And then the second
stage is you put

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.200
the slurry or the
suspension into a pan,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.970
and then you do the
freeze drying process.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.469
So you go through
this process where

00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:29.200
you start at this
room temperature

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.660
and atmospheric pressure.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.290
You cool it down to freeze
it, and then you sublimate it,

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:38.560
and you're left with a very
porous collagen-GAG scaffold.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.700
So these are pictures.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.370
I think this was with
a type I collagen,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.120
but it looks the same
with the type II collagen.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.251
So that's what the
structure looks like.

00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:48.750
I think I showed
you this last time.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.120
We can control the pore
size by controlling

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.540
the freezing temperature.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.020
So the way the
freeze dryer works

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.880
is there is shelves that
you put these pans on,

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.909
and these cooling elements
go through the shelves,

00:11:59.909 --> 00:12:01.950
and you can set the
temperature of those shelves.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.300
So we would set the
temperature of those shelves

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.822
to different values and we
got different pore sizes.

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.280
So the colder the
shelf temperature

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.330
was, the faster the
freezing, and the smaller

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.130
the size of the ice
grains, and then

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.010
the smaller the
size of the pores.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.280
And this is just the
mechanical response again.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.350
So we did mechanical
tests on it.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.010
These are some of the
numbers for the properties.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.900
So we tested it
dry and wet, and we

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.391
measured a modulus and a
buckling collapse stress

00:12:30.391 --> 00:12:30.890
for it.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.560
So those are just
some values there.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.440
And then it came to making
the mineralized collagen-GAG

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.250
scaffold, and one of the
students in Cambridge, England

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.937
was really the main person
who did this, Andrew Lynn.

00:12:43.937 --> 00:12:45.520
And he worked with
Brendan Harley, who

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.290
was our student here,
and after they graduated,

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.900
I had another student,
Biraja Kanungo,

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.370
who worked on this too.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.790
So Andrew Lynn really
developed this technique.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.260
And this involved taking
the collagen and the GAG, so

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.185
the same as for
the other scaffold,

00:12:58.185 --> 00:13:00.560
but this time, if we want to
make a mineralized scaffold,

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.850
we somehow have to get
calcium phosphate into it.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.760
So it's got to have sort of
a hydroxyapatite-ish type

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.940
of component to it.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.180
So this time we used phosphoric
acid instead of the acetic acid

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.680
and we put some calcium salts
into the mixture as well.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.820
And Andrew was really the one
who figured out how to do this

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.350
and what salts to use.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.970
And then the process
was very similar.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.330
So we have this slurry.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.830
We mix the slurry up.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.110
We did a freeze drying
process, and then we

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.980
crosslinked it with a chemical
crosslinker called EDAC.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.950
So it's just a chemical
that you put into this

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.560
and it crosslinks it all.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.350
So that was how we made
the mineralized scaffold.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.640
The mineral we got was
something called brushite,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.890
which is a calcium phosphate,
but it's not exactly

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.840
the same as hydroxyapatite.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.590
And we could control
the amount of brushite

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.840
by different weight
fractions or volume fractions

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.190
by controlling how much of
the calcium salts we put in

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.630
and what the molarity of
the phosphoric acid was.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.670
If you take brushite
and you put it in water,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.040
it then converts to
octacalcium phosphate

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.900
and then to apatite by
a hydrolytic conversion.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.360
So the apatite is related to
the hydroxyapatite in bone.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.670
And this was the structure
of the mineralized scaffold

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.610
that we got.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.360
So you can see it looks
a little different

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.440
from the collagen-GAG scaffold.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.380
It's much denser.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.220
Typically, the densities
were like 5% or 10% dense.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.740
And remember, the collagen
scaffold was 0.5% dense.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.529
So it's a lot denser.

00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:23.820
But if you notice, there's
a few things to notice here.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.300
So one is the pore size,
that's a 500 micron bar.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.000
And we could make pores between
about 50 and 1,000 microns,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.980
depending on the
freezing conditions.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.190
And the range of pore
sizes we were shooting for

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.860
was somewhere
between 100 and 500,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.390
so we could get in the
right ballpark with that.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.306
And you can see, just
looking at that picture,

00:14:40.306 --> 00:14:42.200
if that's 500
microns, those pores

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.400
are somewhere of that order.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.480
Another thing to look
at is this image here,

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.000
and this just shows,
the white little dots

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.500
are the calcium
phosphate mineral,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.980
and it just shows
that the mineral

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.240
is uniformly distributed
throughout the thickness

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.430
of the scaffold.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.330
So some people had tried to make
scaffolds for regenerating bone

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.200
where they take, say,
one of those polymers

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.060
for resorbable sutures
or they take collagen

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.460
and they coat it
with hydroxyapatite,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.230
but the shortcoming of that
is that the scaffold is

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.519
going to resorb over time.

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:14.810
The cells are going to secrete
enzymes, which are going

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.420
to eat away at the scaffold.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.350
And if the scaffold
resorbs, you're

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.110
eating away at the
hydroxyapatite first

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.526
and then you're
left with whatever

00:15:21.526 --> 00:15:23.050
polymer is underneath that.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.032
Whereas this gives you a
more uniform composition

00:15:26.032 --> 00:15:27.740
throughout the thickness
of the scaffold,

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.870
and you've got calcium
phosphate everywhere

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.880
throughout the thickness of
the struts in the scaffold.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.470
So that's the structure of that.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.550
We wanted to make sure that
the mineral was uniformly

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.840
distributed throughout
the scaffold,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.390
and we did some micro-CT
imaging, some micro computer

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.700
tomography.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.100
And this is our sample
here, and this red line just

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.300
says that is the plane at
which this image was taken,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.170
and the black is the mineral.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.640
And then here's a lower plane
and here's another image.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.540
And you can see the calcium
phosphate's pretty uniformly

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.020
distributed throughout
that specimen there.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.860
And this was just another way of
looking at the same thing using

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.924
EDX in an SEM to look
at where the calcium was

00:16:08.924 --> 00:16:10.090
and where the phosphate was.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.830
So again, this is uniform
distribution of the mineral.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.530
We did mechanical tests
on these scaffold as well.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.437
So we measured moduli
and collapse stresses.

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.520
We get the same kind of
stress strain curve as all

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.340
these other cellular solids.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.560
This was done by-
Biraja Kanungo was

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.220
the student who did this bit.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.590
One of the things
we found was that

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.510
with these mineralized
scaffolds you

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.290
could manually compress them.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.300
If you pushed them down
and you hydrated them,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.970
they would recover
all the deformation,

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.730
but we were increased
in improving

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.820
the mechanical properties
of the mineralized scaffold

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.250
for improved handling
during surgery.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.610
And there's another reason
that I'll get to as well.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.230
So the second reason
is that, if you

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.140
look at how bone
itself forms, it

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:01.964
forms from a collagen
precursor, so bone in your body.

00:17:01.964 --> 00:17:03.505
And there's something
called osteoid,

00:17:03.505 --> 00:17:07.470
which is this collagen-based
precursor to bone,

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.569
and it has a modulus of
about 25 to 40 kilopascals

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.880
and Angler showed that if you
have mesenchymal stem cells

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.230
and you put them on substrates
of different stiffnesses,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.637
they differentiate into
different kinds of cells,

00:17:19.637 --> 00:17:21.470
depending on the stiffness
of the substrate.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.980
So the substrate stiffness
can affect what kind of cells

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.075
you get.

00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:26.700
And the idea here
was we thought, well,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.960
if we could get a stiffness that
was close to this osteoid, what

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.620
the natural bone
formation has, then

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.670
that might help the
mesenchymal stem

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.490
cells differentiate
into the bony cells

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.510
that we want them to.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.700
So we wanted to try to
reach a stiffness of this

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.020
in the wet state.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.160
And if I back up here,
you can see the stiffness

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.690
we had was around four in the
wet state, four kilopascals

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.040
and we want to get to 30
or 40, something like that.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.100
So these are our
equations for the modeling

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.370
of the mineralized scaffold,
the open celled foam

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.730
models for the modulus and
for the collapse strength.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.490
So we could change
different things.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.054
We could change the
solid properties

00:18:06.054 --> 00:18:07.720
or we could change
the relative density.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.740
The geometry of the
thing is probably not

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.116
going to help us too much.

00:18:11.116 --> 00:18:12.490
So basically,
that's what we did.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.879
We first started off trying to
increase the mineral content.

00:18:15.879 --> 00:18:17.920
We thought if there was
more mineral content that

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.160
would make it stiffer.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.210
So Biraja made these more highly
mineralized scaffolds and these

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.800
are just some SEM
images of those.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.190
But the thing he found was
that the properties actually

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.840
got worse when he had the more
highly mineralized scaffold.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.300
The modulus went down and
the strength went down,

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.595
so that wasn't very helpful.

00:18:37.595 --> 00:18:39.220
And when he looked
into it more detail,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.490
he found that he had more
voids in the cell walls

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.990
and he had more
disconnected walls.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.980
This shows some of
the micrographs,

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.220
so this isn't really
very quantitative,

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.820
but you can see
there's holes here.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.320
There's a few holes
here, but there

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.060
tended to be a bigger volume
fraction of holes in the more

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.280
highly mineralized scaffolds
and more walls that

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.520
were disconnected.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.780
So we realized increasing
the mineral content wasn't

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.204
going to work very well.

00:19:02.204 --> 00:19:03.620
And then the second
thing he tried

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.630
was increasing the
relative density.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.040
So we started off at this
density of 4 1/2% dense and he

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.320
developed a method of increasing
the relative density up

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.110
to about almost 20% here.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.090
He did this by, first
of all, he tried

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.280
to just mix more
of the constituents

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.990
into the slurry, that's kind
of the most obvious thing.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.670
But as you add
more constituents,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.250
it gets harder and harder
to mix the thing up and have

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.490
it homogeneously distributed.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.070
So in the end, that's not
how he made these things.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.240
He started with the
starting mixture

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.970
and then he had a vacuum system
for sucking water out of it.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.670
So he would reduce
the amount of water,

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.780
which essentially increased
the amount of solids

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.940
that was in there.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.010
And you can see in
this last one here,

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.530
the most dense
scaffold, he was sucking

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.940
the water in one
direction, and he sucked it

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.420
so much that he was starting
to get the cells collapsing.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.030
So this one here,
these cells that

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.071
have this sort of elongated
orientation, that's

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:57.820
because the cells are
starting to collapse

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.301
because of the vacuum
that he was applying.

00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:02.050
But he could get a
pretty good difference.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.410
This was almost 5%.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.640
That's almost 20%, so
roughly a factor of four.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.550
There are, yeah, four
difference between them.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.320
So then he did
mechanical tests too,

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.660
and he measured the
relative density.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.240
Here's the moduli wet
and then the strength dry

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.140
and the strength wet.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.350
So you can see here, if
you look at the dry moduli,

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.280
for instance, when you go
from this relative density

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.970
to that relative density,
from about 14% to 19%,

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.910
the modulus actually drops down.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.680
And if you look at the
structure, I think,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.140
it's because you've got this
flattened structure here.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.720
You've collapsed the
cells a bit already.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.810
So there's a maximum
density that you

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:44.510
might want to go to, probably
somewhere around 14% or 15%.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.510
But the wet modulus
we've got here

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.110
is around 35 kilopascals, so
that's close to the target

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.610
that we had.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.390
It's close to what
we wanted to have.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.940
So one way you
could get the right

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.610
or the appropriate modulus
is by increasing the density

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.020
to that value.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.630
Another way is by playing
around with the crosslinking.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:06.020
So those values were for
non-crosslinked scaffolds.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.720
So here, this is the 14% dense
scaffold wet, non-crosslinked

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.020
it was around 35 kilopascals.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.370
This is a dehydrothermal
treatment,

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.560
just basically heating it up.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.650
It gives you a higher modulus.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.780
And then this is a chemical
crosslinking technique that

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.560
increases the modulus again.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.090
So if you put all
of this together,

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.930
you can show these results
for the modulus on one table.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.597
So these are all
the wet modulus.

00:21:32.597 --> 00:21:34.180
So it's pretty clear
by playing around

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.950
with the relative density
and the crosslinking,

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.430
that you can get a
scaffold in that range.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.580
And the idea is that that would
help get the mesenchymal stem

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.630
cells to differentiate into
these osteoblast-like cells.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.510
So then we wanted to
also see if our models

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:54.030
for the cellular solids could
be applied to this scaffold,

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.500
and we needed the
solid properties.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.910
So Kristyn Van Vliet
helped us with this,

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:04.932
and we isolated a single strut,
bonded it to a glass slide,

00:22:04.932 --> 00:22:06.640
and, I think, I
mentioned this last time,

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.017
we used an AFM tip to then
do a little bending test.

00:22:10.017 --> 00:22:11.850
So I think the one I
mentioned last time was

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.330
for the collagen-GAG scaffold.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.340
Then we also did the same thing
for the mineralized scaffold.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.390
And here we measured a modulus
of about seven gigapascals,

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.010
so that's a dry modulus.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.650
And just for
comparison, the modulus

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.190
of the solid and trabecular
bone is something around 18.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.000
So it's lower, but it's
in the same ballpark.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.890
And by nanoindentation,
we measured a strength

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.800
of about 200, and that's
similar to what you

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.160
would get in trabecular bone.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.410
So the solid in the
struts themselves

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.230
is not exactly like trabecular
bone in mechanical properties,

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.550
but not too far off.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.520
And then here's a plot of
the scaffold modulus divided

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.940
by the solid modulus against
the relative density.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.250
And this line here, the curve,
is a squared relationship.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.540
So that's what we'd expect
for the foam models.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.590
And this is the strength.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.730
These things fail by a
plastic or a brittle failure,

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:09.741
and this curve is a three halves
power with relative density.

00:23:09.741 --> 00:23:12.240
And again, that's what you'd
expect from the cellular solids

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.740
model.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.530
So that gives you a
reasonable description

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:20.040
of the behavior of the
mineralized scaffold.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.840
So again, these were
the considerations

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.740
in trying to make the
osteochondral scaffold.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.080
So now we have a
collagen scaffold

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.065
and we have a
mineralized scaffolding,

00:23:26.065 --> 00:23:28.470
and we want to put the
two of them together.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.970
So we wanted to use
the joint as a model,

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.880
and we wanted to have some
intermediate layer that

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.770
had some gradation in
the mineralization.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.840
So that was the next step.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.940
And the way we did
that was we used

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.900
what we fancily called
liquid-phase co-synthesis.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.490
This just meant that we took
the mineralized collagen-GAG

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.770
slurry, we poured
that into a mold,

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.030
and then we poured the
non-mineralized slurry

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.306
into the same mold.

00:23:54.306 --> 00:23:56.680
And then we just allowed the
two slurries to interdiffuse

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.315
for some time period.

00:23:58.315 --> 00:23:59.940
And then we did the
freeze drying step.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.450
So the idea was, that if
you poured the one on top

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.899
of the other, the
mineralized one is denser

00:24:04.899 --> 00:24:06.690
and then you put the
less dense one on top,

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.481
but over some period
of time, there will be

00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.410
some diffusion between the two.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.630
And then we just did
the freeze drying step.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.390
So this is the scaffold
we ended up with.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.810
This is a micro computer
tomography image.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.490
So here's the
collagen-GAG scaffold

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.830
for the cartilage
on top, and here's

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.870
the mineralized collagen-GAG
calcium phosphate scaffold

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.060
on the bottom for the bone.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.920
And that just kind of
shows what it looked like.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.860
The porosities
and the pore sizes

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.140
we got, the collagen-GAG
was about 98% porous

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.030
and had a pore size
of around 650 microns.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.250
The mineralized scaffold
was 95.5% porous

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.192
and had a pore size of
400, roughly, microns.

00:24:48.192 --> 00:24:49.650
And then this is
what the structure

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.840
looked like in the EDX.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.050
You can see, this is
the collagen-GAG layer,

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.800
this is the mineralized
layer, and there's

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.770
some zone in between that's
a little bit mineralized, not

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.330
as much as the bony layer
but more than the cartilage

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:07.230
layer, and the same
with the phosphorus.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:12.390
So we have this collagen-GAG
slightly mineralized layer,

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.550
and then a more
mineralized layer

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.520
And then finally, there was
a student, Scott Vickers,

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.680
who worked with Myron
Spector at the Brigham.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.000
And oops, oops.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.460
No, I don't want the
weekly updates, thank you.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.890
Sorry.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:30.390
Well, let me just
get rid of this.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.680
Oop, where's my
little mousy mouse?

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.250
There we go.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.810
OK, so Scott Vickers
worked with Myron Spector,

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.360
and Myron had a surgeon who
could do animal studies.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.310
So we did some animal
studies on goats.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.070
I think there were six
goats at the Brigham.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.040
And they took a plug out
of the knee of the goats,

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.710
and they put our scaffold in.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.750
So this is one of the
surgeries as they're

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.980
about to poke the scaffold in.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.260
And then, Scott waited, I
think it was four months,

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.680
and then sacrificed the goats,
and then did the histology.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.460
And this is one of the
images from his PhD.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.110
So this staining shows that
you've got tissue growing in.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.840
The scaffold was where these
little black dotted lines are.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.420
So you had bony tissue
in here, and there

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.840
was a cartilage-like
tissue formed at the top.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.940
It wasn't perfect
articular cartilage,

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.240
but it was something
similar to that.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.680
And really was as far as we took
the project with the funding

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.290
that we had.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.180
We had a-- I don't know if
you remember that-- well, it's

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.190
beyond before your time.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.310
But Cambridge and MIT had a
big research collaboration

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.120
and the student exchange
was part of that.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.560
And this was done through
that research collaboration

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.890
between Cambridge and MIT.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.650
So this was as far as we took
it with that research funding.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.000
Andrew Lynn, who was the
student in Cambridge,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.990
who developed the
mineralized scaffold,

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:52.940
he then started up a company
called Orthomimetics,

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.040
and he had longer term
animal studies done,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.730
and he took it a little further.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.860
In Europe, there's something
called CE Mark approval,

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.610
and CE Mark approval
means you can

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.300
start doing clinical trials.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.060
So he never got FDA
approval for it,

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.250
but he got approval to have
clinical trials in Europe.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.450
And the first clinical use
was in February of 2009.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.470
And they started off
using it for the donor

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.260
sites for the mosaicplasties.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.060
Remember the second
method I talked about?

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.210
They take plugs
out of one region

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.750
and put them into the
region with the damage.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.730
So what they were doing
was using our scaffold

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.327
to fill up these
donor sites here

00:27:30.327 --> 00:27:31.910
and they found that
worked quite well.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:33.660
And then eventually,
they started using it

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.530
for the primary sites as well.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:40.190
And as of about April a
few years ago, April 2012,

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.250
they had treated about
200 people with this.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.913
AUDIENCE: Wait, so why not
just directly start putting it

00:27:45.913 --> 00:27:47.769
in the-- why start with the--

00:27:47.769 --> 00:27:49.810
LORNA GIBSON: I think
because these were supposed

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:53.270
to be sites that were less
loaded, weren't as highly

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.740
stressed, and they thought that
was a more, not as critical

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.826
a place to put them in.

00:27:57.826 --> 00:27:58.325
Yeah?

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.510
AUDIENCE: So what is
different about this scaffold?

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.250
Is it the lack of
the dense bone that

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:12.734
allows all of the marrow cells
to migrate up to the cartilage?

00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:14.400
LORNA GIBSON: Well,
I think, there's not

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.733
that many people that have
made osteochondral scaffolds,

00:28:16.733 --> 00:28:19.670
so it's good that we've
got these two layers.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:23.040
And the idea that you try
to get the stem cells up

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.520
into the cartilage.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.310
The stem cells
will differentiate

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.720
into the bone or
the cartilage, I

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.178
think, partly depending on the
stiffness of the surrounding

00:28:30.178 --> 00:28:30.828
tissue.

00:28:30.828 --> 00:28:33.352
AUDIENCE: But they don't do
that in normal bone because

00:28:33.352 --> 00:28:34.590
of the dense layer?

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.726
LORNA GIBSON: No,
I think they would.

00:28:36.726 --> 00:28:38.350
But the thing is, I
mean, in some ways,

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.620
that very first
technique where you just

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.440
drill holes in, I mean, in some
ways, that's what it's counting

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.342
on, right, is that the
marrow mesenchymal stem

00:28:46.342 --> 00:28:48.550
cells are going to differentiate
either into the bone

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:49.830
or into the cartilage.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:53.010
But it's just got a hole
to differentiate into.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.190
So this gives the cell
something to attach

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.580
to and I think, gives
a better result. Yeah?

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.340
AUDIENCE: So is part of
the scaffold and this bone,

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.640
are they removing
the original bone?

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.630
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah,
they remove-- yeah.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:06.600
Let me back up a step.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.850
So when they do this thing
here, so this is in a goat,

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.724
but they would do the
same thing in a person.

00:29:10.724 --> 00:29:13.050
So when they drill the
hole to put that in, they

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.620
go through the cartilage, they
go through the compact bone,

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.010
the dense bone, and they go
into the trabecular bone,

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.843
because you don't really
get into the marrow

00:29:19.843 --> 00:29:23.030
until you're in the pores
of the trabecular bone.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:23.660
OK?

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.890
Are we good?

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.361
AUDIENCE: How do they attach it?

00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:27.860
LORNA GIBSON: How
do they attach it?

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.270
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.103
LORNA GIBSON: I think
it's just a press fit.

00:29:30.103 --> 00:29:32.590
I think they just drill
a hole and stick it in.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.340
And these are all
in joints, right?

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.710
So there's always another
bone pressing against it.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.530
I mean, in the surgery,
they kind of peel things

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.380
apart so they can do the
surgery but there's another bone

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.320
pressing down on it.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.930
So I don't think there
was any glue or anything.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.480
So there's that.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.320
So this is just a summary.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.580
So we were able to make
this two-layer scaffold

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.691
with a gradient
interface, and we

00:29:54.691 --> 00:29:56.190
tried to make it
so that it mimicked

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.130
the osteochondral tissues.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.040
And this freeze
drawing process allowed

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.270
us to control things
like the mineral content,

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.161
the porosity, the pore sizes.

00:30:04.161 --> 00:30:06.160
And then we used materials
that had already been

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.470
approved for medical devices.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.002
And this was funded
by a number of places.

00:30:11.002 --> 00:30:13.210
So the Cambridge MIT Institute
was that collaboration

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:13.710
I mentioned.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.632
I have a chair and I
used some money for that.

00:30:15.632 --> 00:30:17.590
Brendan Harley was one
of the students involved

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.550
and he got a
fellowship from MIT.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:23.470
And Andrew Lynn got a
fellowship through the Cambridge

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.580
Commonwealth Trust and
through St. John's College

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.220
in Cambridge, that's
his college there.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.420
So he had had
funding through that.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.300
So I think that's
the end of that talk.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.700
So are we good with scaffolds?

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.909
Yeah, you're good?

00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:38.575
So obviously, this
probably whole course

00:30:38.575 --> 00:30:40.120
is on tissue engineering.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.670
This is just
scratching the surface

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.392
and giving you an
introduction to it,

00:30:43.392 --> 00:30:45.600
but I wanted to show you
how a lot of these scaffolds

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.600
look a lot like the foamy
materials that I work on,

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.930
and that you can use the
same models for trying

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.470
to understand the mechanical
properties of the scaffold.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.690
And even though the scaffolds
are acting in a biological way,

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.270
there's actually a connection
between the mechanical behavior

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.410
of the scaffolds and
the biological response.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:09.320
So I'm going to talk on
Monday about cell/scaffold

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:13.930
interactions, so
how the environment

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.140
biological cells are in
can affect how they behave.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.390
So we're going to talk about
things like cell adhesion

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.260
and cell migration
and cell contraction,

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.690
contractile behavior.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.302
So I've got another talk
a little bit like this

00:31:26.302 --> 00:31:28.010
and that means I'll
have a few notes I'll

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.090
put on the board
on Monday about how

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.460
the environment that the cells
are in affects how they behave,

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.080
OK?

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.530
So this is leading up to that.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.269
It's sort of a similar thing.

00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:39.810
So I thought for
the rest of the time

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:43.130
today, because I knew this
was going to end early,

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.840
I thought what I would
do is just switch gears

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.020
and talk about writing.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.956
So normally when
I give a class, I

00:31:50.956 --> 00:31:52.580
don't talk about
writing all that much.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.940
I talk about the
technical stuff.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.230
But it turns out writing is
actually a huge part of what

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.250
scientists do and engineers do
and whether or not you end up

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.475
with an academic job
or a job in industry

00:32:04.475 --> 00:32:06.600
or working for government,
no matter where you are,

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.300
you are going to
have to write things.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.800
And the better you write, the
better off you're going to be.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.720
So I made copies
of this brochure

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.809
and I have a few little slides.

00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:18.850
And you're going to have
to write up your project

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:25.240
report for me, and I thought
it might be helpful to just go

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.936
through this little brochure.

00:32:26.936 --> 00:32:28.810
So I'm not going to
write stuff on the board.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.040
Everything is pretty
much in this brochure,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.930
but I thought I'd just
walk you through some

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:33.930
of the main parts of it.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:34.780
Oh, did you get one?

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.830
Here, have one.

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:42.470
So you might want to think about
this when you're writing up

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.180
your project report
for this class,

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.860
but this really
is, it's general.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.068
It's really for any time
you have to write something.

00:32:49.068 --> 00:32:50.870
This is helpful.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.576
So Mike Ashby put this together.

00:32:52.576 --> 00:32:54.950
And as I mentioned, he's done
a lot of scientific writing

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.830
and especially in material
science and engineering.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.267
He also makes paintings.

00:32:59.267 --> 00:33:00.850
This is one of Mike's
little paintings

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.950
of him writing a paper.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:07.920
And what I was going to do
is just walk through it.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.010
So there's just a few
figures, and mostly it's text,

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.960
but let me go through
some of the figures.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:18.110
So I'm going to just turn
to what's page three, OK?

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.890
So one of the things
that he says to start,

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:22.870
and I think this
makes a lot of sense,

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:26.236
is that you can think of
writing a paper the same way you

00:33:26.236 --> 00:33:28.360
can think about designing
something in engineering.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.290
So when you think
about design, there's

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:31.750
different stages
of design, right?

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:36.282
There's a conceptual design,
where you just decide roughly

00:33:36.282 --> 00:33:37.490
what the thing's going to be.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.480
There's embodiment,
where you work out

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.310
a lot of the more details.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.380
You design one version of it.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.340
And then there's the
detailed design, where

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.770
you do all the fine-tuning.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.310
You do all the
final design things.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.030
And before you really
start your design,

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.071
if you were going to design
an engineering thing,

00:33:57.071 --> 00:33:59.540
you would first of all think
about what's the market.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.349
And if you're writing, the
market is your readers.

00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:04.640
And so when you think about
what you're going to write,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.598
you have to think about
who's going to read it.

00:34:06.598 --> 00:34:08.820
And it's the same thing
when I give a talk.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.560
When I give a talk, before I
make a single PowerPoint slide,

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.940
the first thing I think
about is who am I talking to

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.690
and what do they already know?

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.530
What's the audience?

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:20.760
What are they looking
to get out of the talk?

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.174
What am I trying to
convey in the talk?

00:34:23.174 --> 00:34:24.590
And the writing
is the same thing.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.469
You have to think
about your audience.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:30.590
So for instance, I
have technical talks.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.440
Obviously, I go give
technical talks at meetings,

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.010
but I do other
sorts of talks too.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.218
I've got the woodpecker talk.

00:34:36.218 --> 00:34:38.760
I go give the woodpecker
talk at the Mass Audubon.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.989
And people come to
listen to that talk who

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:43.290
are interested in birds
but they're not engineers.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.040
So when I do that
talk, I have to make it

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.120
so somebody could understand
it who's intelligent

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.889
but they're not
necessarily an engineer.

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.530
So I give a different
kind of talk

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.590
when I do that than when I
give an engineering talk.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:57.440
And I got invited
to a student dinner.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.960
I'm going out to somewhere
with some students on Friday.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.260
I'm going to give that how
I became a professor talk,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.020
and when I do the how I
became a professor talk,

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:10.290
it's more general, and so it's
a different audience that I'm

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:11.650
thinking about.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.152
And in some ways,
when I do these talks,

00:35:14.152 --> 00:35:15.610
it can be the same
group of people,

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.600
but depending on what
I'm talking about,

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.250
the way they look at
it is different, OK?

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.600
So the market thing is
something to think about.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.530
So if you're writing
a thesis, your market

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:28.560
is your PhD committee, who's
going to read the thesis

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.020
and examine you on the thesis.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.827
If you're writing
a paper, you've

00:35:31.827 --> 00:35:33.410
got to think about
the market as being

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.537
other people in your
research field, some of who

00:35:35.537 --> 00:35:37.620
are going to be the
reviewers, who are going to be

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.890
reading it and criticizing it.

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:44.020
If you're writing a general
popular science book,

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.440
it's a different
kind of audience.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.600
If you're writing a
research proposal,

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.964
the audience is going to
be the funding agency.

00:35:51.964 --> 00:35:54.380
Are they interested in what
you're talking about, but also

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.700
reviewers, who are
going to be deciding

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.800
whether or not to
give you the money

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.836
and what the criticisms are.

00:36:00.836 --> 00:36:02.710
So you have to think
about who the market is.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.670
So that's one thing.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:08.164
And one thing that think about
in doing the writing-- you

00:36:08.164 --> 00:36:10.330
know Mike and I have written
several books together,

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.329
and when I tell my neighbors
I've written books,

00:36:12.329 --> 00:36:14.350
they somehow think--
their first idea is

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.265
that we start on
page one and we start

00:36:16.265 --> 00:36:17.890
writing the book from
page one and then

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.176
we work our way
through to page 500.

00:36:20.176 --> 00:36:22.140
And that's not how
we do it at all

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.134
and that's not how
I write papers.

00:36:24.134 --> 00:36:25.800
That's not how most
people write papers.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.060
You've got to think
about the big picture

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.080
and think about,
roughly, what goes where.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.890
And then maybe
think about a draft

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:37.190
that gets the
scientific facts right.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.690
You put the information
down, and then you

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:44.180
try to figure out about how do
you make the style really nice?

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.230
How to make it read well?

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.444
How do you make it
easy to understand?

00:36:47.444 --> 00:36:49.610
How does one paragraph lead
into the next paragraph?

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.070
So it's an iterative thing.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.660
It's not like you start
at page one or line one

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.210
and you just start writing.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:58.710
So it's an iterative process,
the same as engineering design

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.150
is an iterative process.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:04.340
If you were going to
design, I don't know,

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.960
a skateboard or something,
you wouldn't just

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.290
think you were going to make
one and that would be it.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.920
That's how writing is, and
often, students don't see it

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.020
as this iterative thing.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.970
OK, so that's that page there.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.700
Let's see, I already
talked about market.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.590
I think I have another
little slide about-- here's

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.880
another slide here
about markets.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.390
So this is what I just said.

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:27.280
Who are the readers?

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.535
How are they going to use it?

00:37:28.535 --> 00:37:30.660
So you've got to think
about who you're writing for

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:36.240
or if you're giving a talk,
who's going to look at that.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.570
OK, now the next
phase is to make what

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.370
Mike calls a concept sheet.

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:45.230
I would just think of
this as an outline.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.620
And I always make
some sort of outline

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.430
before I try to write anything.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.410
And there's different
ways you can do that.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.160
The thing that Mike's
got here and there's

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.570
a nice little figure
on page six, which

00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:00.260
is what I've got up here, is
he takes a big piece of paper.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.930
In Europe, it would
be known as the A3.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:05.960
Here it would be known as
the eight and a half by 17.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.450
You take a big piece of paper.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:10.390
This stationery company
actually makes paper

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.814
with big blank space in
the middle and little note

00:38:12.814 --> 00:38:15.230
space on the outside or you
could just use the back of it.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.150
So you take a big
piece of paper and you

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.780
may think this is douffy,
but it actually helps.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.370
So you take your
big piece of paper,

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:23.739
and you just make
boxes about each topic.

00:38:23.739 --> 00:38:25.280
You're going to have
an introduction,

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.071
you're going to have
methods and materials,

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:28.730
you're going to have
a result section.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.680
And you think about what should
go into each of those boxes.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.350
And what you're
trying to do here

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.812
is think about the whole paper
and how it all fits together

00:38:36.812 --> 00:38:39.020
and what goes where and what
are you going to include

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.890
and what are you not
going to include.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.380
So people think about writing
as sitting at the keyboard

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:47.035
and typing, but
that's just the--

00:38:47.035 --> 00:38:48.660
how when you get a
problem on a problem

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.610
set, you turn and crank, that's
the turning and cranking part.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.900
The thoughtful part is
figuring out what to put in,

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.040
what to leave out,
what figures you want,

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.490
how you organize
the whole thing,

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.410
how you put it all together,
and this helps you do that.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.130
And you can make this--
it's just for you.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.950
It doesn't have to look great.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.450
You can make this
messy if you want.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:10.520
It doesn't really matter.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:14.079
But it's good to have some sort
of an overview of how you want

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:15.620
to put the thing
together, and that's

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.670
what this stage helps you do.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.630
So Mike's put other
little things here.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.910
So see papers by
so-and-so and so-and-so.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.216
So you've got an introduction.

00:39:26.216 --> 00:39:27.590
You want to talk
about something.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.780
You know there should be
some references go here.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.655
Maybe you think there's
some extra references

00:39:31.655 --> 00:39:33.237
you haven't got.

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:34.820
Maybe something in
the method, there's

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.686
some analogy you can use here.

00:39:36.686 --> 00:39:38.560
Maybe you need a figure,
needs a good figure.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.270
You don't have to
actually have the figure.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.728
You just say I need a figure
and you have a vague idea what

00:39:42.728 --> 00:39:44.500
the figure looks like.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.490
Here there's some
discussion point.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:50.230
Discuss this with collaborators,
Ed, all this stuff.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.890
So you just put down roughly
what needs to go where

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.420
and you think about
the whole thing

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.500
and how it's all
going to fit together.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.870
And then as you work through
it, it looks more like this.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.255
So this would be on page seven.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.940
And this is filled
in, and if fact,

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.730
this particular one, what
he's written down here

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:17.550
is the overview he made for
making this booklet, OK?

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.700
So the things
refer to this book.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.454
So here's the introduction.

00:40:21.454 --> 00:40:23.620
Here's the little chart we
went through and through,

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.470
the concept design, embodiment,
and detail, blah, blah, blah.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.900
Here's the need,
the market need.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.407
We just talked about that.

00:40:29.407 --> 00:40:31.990
Here's the concept thing that
we we're just talking about now.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:35.240
Then we're going to talk about
each of these different phases.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.550
And his initials are
MFA, Michael F. Ashby.

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.580
Think out, that means
think about this more.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.040
I haven't figured this out yet.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.680
I need an example here,
all these kinds of things.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.330
So this is the way he does it.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.230
There's a couple of
other ways you can do it.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.200
One way is to just make
a bullet outline, that's

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.294
typically what I do.

00:40:54.294 --> 00:40:56.210
You know you're going
to have an introduction,

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.480
these different headings.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.460
And you might put in
the bullet outline

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.180
these same sorts of things,
like I need this figure

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.560
or we need to get
one more set of data

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.800
or I need to look
up this reference.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.990
So it doesn't have
to be finished,

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:11.510
but it's a thing that tells
you what have you got,

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.540
what do you need to do to
make it all come together.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.570
So that's one way to do it.

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:18.680
Another way to do it is
by thinking about what

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.540
figures you want in the paper.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.860
So some people, before
they write any words,

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.520
they say, well, I know I
want to have these figures,

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.060
and then they build the
words around the figures.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.560
And they can even sketch
out what the figures are.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.769
Some people even start before
they start the project,

00:41:34.769 --> 00:41:36.185
they say what kind
of figures do I

00:41:36.185 --> 00:41:37.480
want at the end of the project?

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.390
And they don't know if the data
is going to do this or that.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.970
They don't know which way
the data is going to go,

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.920
but they say I want
to have a plot of one

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.525
thing versus another thing.

00:41:44.525 --> 00:41:47.619
Oh, you're looking
like this is not OK?

00:41:47.619 --> 00:41:48.160
AUDIENCE: No.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:48.868
LORNA GIBSON: No?

00:41:48.868 --> 00:41:51.550
OK, yeah, some people do this.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.320
So even when you're
ready to write,

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.130
you could say to yourself,
well, in the methods,

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:00.380
do I need a figure that's a
schematic of some apparatus?

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.530
In the results, how am I
going to present the results

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.280
in the discussion?

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.920
Do we need some
other kind of figure?

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.890
So if you have a
set of figures, you

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:10.535
can work the text
around those figures.

00:42:10.535 --> 00:42:12.960
So that's another
way to do this.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.690
So those are just three
options, but all of them

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:19.140
have in common that you
think about the whole paper

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.690
and how it all fits
together and what

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.520
goes where and what
do you have already

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.400
and what else do
you need to get, OK?

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.230
So that's that.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.170
And then what I
was going to do--

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.815
I think that's probably the
last figure that's-- yeah, OK.

00:42:31.815 --> 00:42:33.440
So there's just this
little thing here.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.481
So what I was going to do
is just talk about some

00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:37.780
of the other things in
this little booklet that

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.780
work through each of these
stages of the writing.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.437
So that's the concept,
and then the next phase

00:42:45.437 --> 00:42:47.020
would be what's
called the embodiment,

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.350
if you think of the
design language,

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.090
and that would be
the first draft.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.970
And I think most people find
the most difficult thing is

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:55.120
to write the first draft.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.460
I mean, I find that the hardest.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.300
Once you've got
something, editing it

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.270
is relatively straightforward.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.230
You go, oh, this piece
should go over there

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.240
or there's something missing.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.350
But getting the first draft
down is the hardest thing.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:12.200
And one of the
things-- it's like when

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.590
I talked about
writing the book, you

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:16.730
don't write the draft
sequentially either.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.020
I typically tell students
to start with the materials

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.145
and methods because that's
the most straightforward

00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:22.874
and it's the easiest to write.

00:43:22.874 --> 00:43:25.290
There's not a whole lot of
mystery to how you actually did

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:26.770
something you've already done.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.310
So I tell people don't write
the introduction first.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.300
That's a bad idea because
it's actually often not

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.930
so easy to write
the introduction.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.970
So I tell people to write the
materials and methods first.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:40.230
Write the result section
because you've got your results

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:42.390
and you know what the
results are going to be.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.960
So those are the
two easiest things.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.570
And often, I think,
what people find

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:49.755
is if they find it hard to write
it's because they don't know

00:43:49.755 --> 00:43:52.380
what they want to write or they
haven't thought things through.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.270
They haven't got their
thoughts together.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.350
And if you've got
your thoughts, if you

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:01.490
know what you want to say, then
the writing becomes easier.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.740
So one of the pieces
of advice Mike

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.890
gave me, and it's
in this booklet too,

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.580
is in the first draft
what you should try to do

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.240
is just get the facts down.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.180
Just get the information
down and don't

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.994
worry about if it
doesn't sound quite right

00:44:14.994 --> 00:44:17.160
or if this sentence doesn't
lead into that sentence.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.230
Don't worry about the
style of it at all.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:20.710
Just try to get the facts down.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.430
Just try to get the
information down.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:24.290
And once you've
got the information

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:27.120
and you've got some kind
of framework-- I'm not

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.000
saying that you don't want
to make the style good,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.940
you do, but you don't need
to do that the first thing.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.190
The first thing is just
to get the facts down,

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.080
and then you can
edit it later on.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.830
It's more of this
iterative process.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.000
OK, so the first draft,
the most important thing

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.482
is just to get the facts down.

00:44:44.482 --> 00:44:46.440
Then, I'm not going to
read all of these things

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.400
because you can just
read them yourself,

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.219
but I'll just comment
on a few things.

00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:53.135
So one thing he's got--
I'm on page eight now,

00:44:53.135 --> 00:44:55.930
is the abstract.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.790
So the abstract
should be concise.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:01.521
It should be fairly
short and you

00:45:01.521 --> 00:45:03.520
want to tell people why
you're doing what you're

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.400
doing, what you did,
what the key result is,

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.710
and what the conclusions are.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.950
So it can be pretty short.

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:12.760
There's a section
on the introduction.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.316
You can just read that.

00:45:14.316 --> 00:45:15.810
Let's see here.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.450
Yeah, I think, you can read
yourself these other things.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:20.241
I don't want to go
through the whole thing.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.980
All right, so that's that.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.610
OK, so you get to the
end of the first draft,

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:30.710
there's a little
section on figures here.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:32.835
Let me just make some
comments on that.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.530
People who are busy
and may not want

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:39.610
to read every word
that you've written

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.160
will look at the figures, and
they'll look at the figures

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.244
to make some judgment about
does this look useful?

00:45:44.244 --> 00:45:45.910
Does this look like
you've got something

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:47.260
I want to spend more time on?

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.040
So it's important to make the
figures easily understandable

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.130
and to be fairly self-contained.

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.989
So you want to make
the figures clear.

00:45:57.989 --> 00:46:00.030
You don't want to have
too much information on it

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.211
so that people can't
follow what's going on,

00:46:02.211 --> 00:46:03.960
and you want them to
illustrate the points

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.680
that you're trying to make.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.120
So the figures are
very important.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.140
And then when you've got
the first draft finished,

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.000
the next step, which I
find tremendously useful

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.210
and students often don't
get that this is a step.

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.760
The next step is
you put it somewhere

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.099
and you don't do anything
with it for a while.

00:46:22.099 --> 00:46:24.140
And this is why it's
important not to write it up

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.640
at the last second.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:29.250
Because there's something
about, you work on something,

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.300
you put it to one
side, you don't do it.

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.285
You just leave it and
you go do something else.

00:46:33.285 --> 00:46:35.410
And then when you come back
to it, all of a sudden,

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:38.830
you see things that you didn't
see the first time through.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.940
So the next step is you
just put it to one side

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.100
for a couple days.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.070
But you can only do
that step for a class

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:47.534
if you started before the
night before it's due, OK?

00:46:47.534 --> 00:46:49.200
So that's why you
have to start earlier.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.530
That's why I'm telling
you this now, OK?

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.960
So you put it aside and then
you go have a cup of coffee.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.543
You see there's
several cups of coffee

00:46:56.543 --> 00:46:59.180
that Mike has happily
drawn for us here.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.270
OK, then the next
part of this is

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.300
all about grammar and
sentence structure.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.550
I'm not going to go over that.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:05.999
You can read all that yourself.

00:47:05.999 --> 00:47:08.040
But there is one amusing
thing I want to tell you

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.690
because there's a cute story.

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:10.940
I'm on page 16 now.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.750
There's a thing about spelling.

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.610
Mike is a terrible speller.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:16.470
When I was his student,
he used to-- there

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.030
were no word processors.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:21.159
And we used to write things
and he would write things

00:47:21.159 --> 00:47:22.950
and I would say, I
can't read your writing.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:25.116
And he says, ah, well, I
make up for my bad spelling

00:47:25.116 --> 00:47:27.120
with my bad writing.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.400
So I couldn't tell if he
had spelled something right.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.500
The other thing we
found was that, we

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.600
wrote the cellular solid
book, the first edition

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.700
was in the 1980s.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.320
And I grew up in Canada,
then I lived in England,

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.450
then I moved here.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.610
He grew up in Australia,
then he moved to England,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:46.030
then he moved to the States
then he moved back to England.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:49.050
And words that end, that
we spell I-Z-E, like

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:51.720
normalized, like
normalized variables.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:55.730
They're I-Z-E here.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:58.050
In England, they're all I-S-E.

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.710
OK, and then some of
the words, it turns out,

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:04.580
Canadians spell with an
I-Z-E and some with I-S-E.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.990
So anyway, we wrote the
entire fricking book.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:09.120
We were almost ready
to send it off,

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.850
and we have all those graphs
where the axes are normalized,

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:16.710
and we must have used the word
normalized like 100 times,

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:19.140
and we realized half the
time we had spelled it I-S-E

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.091
and half the time we
had spelled it I-Z-E.

00:48:21.091 --> 00:48:23.590
And then we had to go back and
find them all and fix it all.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:28.230
So anyway, that's just our
little story about spelling.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:29.890
OK, there's a thing
about punctuation.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:30.639
You can read that.

00:48:30.639 --> 00:48:32.040
That's kind of boring.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.350
I wanted to move on to
the bit about style,

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:37.480
because style is important too.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.060
And people remember papers
that are well written.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:45.450
Obviously, papers that have
valuable scientific information

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:48.150
are memorable too, but
if it's well-written,

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:52.020
it's more memorable, and the
style really is important.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.330
And it's the same
with giving a talk.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.670
You can convey the
same information,

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:01.160
but if you don't have it
presented in a clear way,

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.180
people aren't going
to remember it.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.960
So the first rule--
so I'm on page 20.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.360
The first rule,
now, is to be clear.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.790
And being clear, it doesn't mean
having long-winded sentences

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.050
with lots of jargon.

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.710
It really just means make
it short, make it concise,

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.790
make it clear what
you want to say.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.360
So Mike has several
examples here

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.680
of headlines from
the newspapers, which

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.840
were not clear.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.310
So I'll just read these out
because I find them amusing.

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:29.580
"Red Tape Holds Up New Bridge."

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.630
So, OK, maybe the red tape
temporally held it up, but not

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.000
spatially held it up.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
OK, and then here's another
one. "Something Went

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.950
Wrong in Jet Crash,
Expert Says."

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:41.420
In fact, you hear this all
the time on the news now.

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:42.900
Obviously, something went wrong.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.233
You don't have to be an
engineer to figure out something

00:49:45.233 --> 00:49:46.570
went wrong in a jet crash.

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:49.930
Then, "Chef Throws Heart In
To Help Feed the Hungry."

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.560
OK, well, maybe that's
a little too much.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.480
This is my favorite one,
"Prostitutes Appeal to Pope."

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.385
OK, there's different
ways you can appeal.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.420
You don't have to appeal
to the Pope in that way.

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.859
And then, "Panda Mating
Fails, Vet Takes Over."

00:50:06.859 --> 00:50:09.150
I don't think the vet really
took over with the mating,

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:11.250
but you know what they mean.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:15.480
OK, so one thing is clarity.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.510
Another point is don't waffle.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:20.640
You want things to be
concise and get to the point.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.780
So he's got this
example here from what

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.490
he cites as a well-known but
anonymous materials text.

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:29.140
"The selection of
the proper material

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.960
is a key step in
the design process,

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.830
because it is the
crucial decision that

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:35.270
links computer
calculations and the lines

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.890
on an engineering drawing with
a real or working design."

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:39.414
But what does it say?

00:50:39.414 --> 00:50:41.080
It says material
selection is important.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.170
So don't say something
in some long-winded way

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:46.830
that you could say
in a short way.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:48.290
OK, let's see.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:53.450
So let me move on
to the next page.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.900
The next step that I-- let
me emphasize one more time,

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.620
is 8.5, revise and rewrite.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.934
So writing really is iterative.

00:51:02.934 --> 00:51:05.350
Those books that you've seen
that Mike and I have written,

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:07.930
I cannot tell you how many
drafts of each chapter we went

00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:09.800
through over and
over and over again.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:16.080
So to make it good, you have
to do it over and over again.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.850
OK, there's that.

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:18.350
Let me see.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:20.650
Is there anything
else I have here?

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.020
Ah, here's a couple things
that are not so obvious.

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.850
So one is, for each
paragraph you should

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:27.870
have a good first sentence.

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:29.400
You should tell the
reader something

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.609
they don't already know.

00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:34.150
So there's some examples here,
and you can read through them.

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:36.730
But it is really helpful
for each paragraph

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:39.580
to have a good opening sentence.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.417
Another thing is at the
end of the paragraph

00:51:41.417 --> 00:51:44.000
it's good if there's a sentence
that links it to the next one.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.580
So it hints at what the next
paragraph's going to be about,

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.310
so it leads the
reader through it,

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:51.530
and it is a logical progression.

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.320
So an opening sentence
for the paragraph

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.500
and the final
sentence, you might

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.947
want to look at in a
bit more gory detail.

00:51:57.947 --> 00:52:00.280
OK, and then there are some
references at the very back,

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.430
at page 25.

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:05.830
And I brought a couple of books
in that I have found helpful.

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:07.310
So you may have seen these.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.260
One is called The
Elements of Style

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.540
and this is by Strunk and
White, so William Strunk, Jr.

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.760
and EB White.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.630
You guys know EB White,
Charlotte's Web, same guy.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:23.360
He's written this small, small,
not too long to have a look at

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.010
book about style.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:30.610
So there's some rules of
usage, which is grammar stuff,

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:33.090
but there's principles
of composition

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:36.020
and there's a chapter called
"An Approach to Style."

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.820
And so here's some
of the headings.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.630
Place yourself in
the background.

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:41.320
Write in a way that
comes naturally.

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.809
Work from a suitable design.

00:52:42.809 --> 00:52:45.100
These people are not engineers,
but they're saying work

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.058
from a suitable design.

00:52:46.058 --> 00:52:47.980
It's like that concept thing.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:49.960
Revise and rewrite,
did I mention that,

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.130
revise and rewrite?

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.380
Do not overwrite.

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.950
Don't make it too complicated.

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.750
Avoid the use of qualifiers.

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:59.204
If you say something's very
stiff, what does that mean?

00:52:59.204 --> 00:53:00.370
You can just say it's stiff.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:02.670
You don't have to
say it's very stiff.

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:05.240
Very compared to what?

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.120
Let's see.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.840
Use orthodox spelling, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.130
Avoid fancy words.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.630
OK, be clear, all
this kind of stuff.

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:18.170
So Strunk and White
is old but good.

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.450
And then, there's this
book here by Bill Bryson.

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:24.160
Bryson's Dictionary
of Troublesome Words.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:26.490
So this is, it is
like a dictionary.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:30.250
It goes by letter and
has different words,

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:32.430
but it talks about
how people sometimes

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:35.000
use a word thinking it means
one thing when it doesn't, it

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.590
actually means something else.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:40.880
And so it's just words
that people use commonly

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:45.470
that they sometimes confuse
with what they really mean.

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:47.820
So it's a very handy thing too.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.210
Do you know Bill Bryson?

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:50.821
Very funny travel writer.

00:53:50.821 --> 00:53:53.070
If you ever go somewhere
that Bill Bryson has been you

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:55.420
should get the book he's
written about it because he's

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.830
very funny.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:58.145
OK, so I think that's it.

00:53:58.145 --> 00:54:00.270
Oh, and then, I think, the
very end of this booklet

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:04.330
has some examples of good
writing and bad writing.

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:07.510
So you can have a
look at that too.

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:11.757
All right, so are we good
on how to write a paper?

00:54:11.757 --> 00:54:13.340
Do you have questions
on how to write?

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.670
Writing is important.

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:17.480
So I have one more
writing story.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.530
So when I first got this job at
MIT, I was living in Arlington,

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:22.980
and my mom comes to
visit me from Toronto.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.900
And I'm work, work, work,
work, working, working,

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.371
and my mom says to
me, she says, my, you

00:54:28.371 --> 00:54:29.745
spend a lot of
your life writing.

00:54:29.745 --> 00:54:32.040
I'm like, Mom, that's
what I get paid to do.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.640
I get paid to write.

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.140
Like she always
thought I was should

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.600
be spending maybe
30 hours a week

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.980
lecturing or
something like that.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:40.355
Like she, well,
you're a teacher.

00:54:40.355 --> 00:54:42.810
You only teach three hours
a week, what is this?

00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:43.930
I'm like, I write, Mom.

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:45.500
That's what I do.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:48.700
So anyways, so
writing is important

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:51.110
and giving presentations
is important.

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:52.610
And no matter what
you end up doing,

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:54.490
you're going to end up having
to do those two things.

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:57.050
And if you do it well, it's
going to make your life better,

00:54:57.050 --> 00:54:59.910
and if you do it badly, you're
not going to be so good.

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:01.860
So that's my message.

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.650
So I'm going to
stop there because I

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:05.470
haven't got the
next lecture ready,

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:07.710
and I can start that on Monday.

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.425
So Monday we'll do the
cell mechanic stuff.

00:55:10.425 --> 00:55:12.800
And then let me just-- because
we're getting ridiculously

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:13.841
close to the end of term.

00:55:13.841 --> 00:55:16.700
Like four weeks from
today is the last test.

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.320
I know, it's shocking.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.795
So there's one lecture
on cell mechanics,

00:55:21.795 --> 00:55:23.920
and then there's some more
engineering applications

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.480
of foam.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.150
I'm going to talk about energy
absorption in foams and foams

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.000
in sandwich panels,
that kind of stuff.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.990
And then, we're going to talk
about some natural materials

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.489
again.

00:55:31.489 --> 00:55:33.880
We're going to talk about
natural structures, so

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:39.080
like natural sandwich panels
and natural cylindrical shells

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.465
with foamy cores.

00:55:40.465 --> 00:55:41.840
So I've got lots
of nature things

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.490
at the last part of the
course, and you know

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:44.781
how I like those nature things.

00:55:44.781 --> 00:55:46.970
So there you have it.

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:50.504
Bob's your uncle, as
my mother would say.

00:55:50.504 --> 00:55:51.920
You know what Bob's
your uncle is?

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.669
Bob's your uncle is
an English expression.

00:55:53.669 --> 00:55:56.020
It just means there you have it.

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.870
There you have it.
