00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:28.970
PROFESSOR: All right, then,
I guess we may as well start.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.820
So what I wanted
to talk about today

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.660
was natural sandwich
panels and sandwich beams.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.850
So there's lots of examples of
sandwich structures in nature,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.050
and we've been looking at
the engineering sandwich

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.929
structures.

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:44.220
And we've seen that you can
get a lightweight structure

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.136
by having this
sandwich construction.

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:48.510
And so there are
several examples

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.290
I was going to talk about today.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.310
And I think because this
isn't really on the test,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.060
I'm not going to write
a lot on the board.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.050
So there's some notes.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.930
I'll just put them
on the website,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.471
and you can look at
that if you want.

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.920
Because we have kind of
a shorter time today.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.461
I'll just try and talk
and explain what's what.

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:05.960
Hey, Bruno.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.310
How are you?

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.880
So this is the first example.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.090
So many leaves of
Monocotyledon plants

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.550
have a sandwich structure.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.840
And this is an iris
plant and iris leaves.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.020
And for those of
you in 3032, I think

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.180
you know that these
are glass flowers.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.510
So the Harvard Museum
of Natural History

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.907
has a glass flower collection
that was made in the 1800s.

00:01:27.907 --> 00:01:29.490
And there was a
botany professor there

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.041
who made these as sort of a
lecture demonstration vehicle.

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:36.540
And so he would
bring then to class,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.750
and he would show
different things

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.520
about the plants with
the glass flowers.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.140
But now they're
just in the museum,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.490
and they're very realistic.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.880
So I just wanted
to show you those.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.860
So let's see, it's not working.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.840
Turn it on.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.770
There we go.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.220
So if we look at a
cross-section of an iris leaf,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.439
it looks like the
diagram on the left.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.230
So here's the iris.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.470
And you can see there's
these kind of solid fibers,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.220
and those solid fibers
are called schlerchyma.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.290
And they only exist at the top
and the bottom of the leaf.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.680
So I went out this morning.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.050
And if you look outside
of the Stata building,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.940
there's that little
kind of river-y thing,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.160
and there's some iris
leaves growing there.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.995
So I went and got
some iris leaves.

00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:17.370
And you can tell we had a
horrible winter because usually

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.995
when I give this
lecture in the spring,

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:21.530
the leaves are
like twice as big.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.970
But this year, they're just
little, short, wimpy ones.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.330
But I'm going to pass it around.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.700
And if you just like move
your thumb over the top,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.180
you can feel little
ridges, little bumps.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.800
And those little ridges
that you can feel

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.940
are these little
schlerchyma fibers.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.120
So you kind of see they
kind of stick up a little.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.650
And so when you move your thumb
over it, you can feel that.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.010
And then you can see that
the middle of the iris leaf

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.160
has this kind of
foamy-type structure here,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.180
and that's called
parenchyma cells.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.910
So you can think of the
leaf as very much like one

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.670
of the sandwiches.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.580
This is like a fiber-reinforced
composite at the top

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.630
and at the bottom.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.320
And then this is kind of
like a foam core in between,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.070
separating the
fiber-reinforced faces.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.970
And so the iris leaf
behaves mechanically

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.845
like a sandwich beam.

00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:07.303
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about how we can actually

00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:09.860
demonstrate that using the
equations that we developed

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.040
in class.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.150
This is another example.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.660
This is, I guess, what
Americans call the cat tail,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.687
but Canadians and English
people call it a bull rush.

00:03:17.687 --> 00:03:19.520
And you can see this
is a slightly different

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.060
construction, but there's
the same sort of idea.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.190
So instead of having a foamy
core as in the iris leaf,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.100
you've got these
kind of webs here

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.120
that go in between the
top and the bottom,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.664
and that forms like a
series of I-beams almost.

00:03:31.664 --> 00:03:33.580
And you can think of
that also like a sandwich

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.100
panel or a sandwich beam.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.834
So you've got two stiff
top and bottom pieces,

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:40.250
and then you've got these kind
of webs that separate them,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.340
kind of like a
honeycomb core would be.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.100
So that's another example
of a leaf that has

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.580
the sandwich-type structure.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.970
And this is very common in
these Monocotyledon leaves.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.480
So if you think of a cat
tail or you think of an iris,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.440
they tend to be kind
of narrow at the base,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.023
maybe an inch or two
wide at the base,

00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:56.330
and they can be quite tall.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.570
The iris leaves can get
two or three feet tall.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.560
The cat tails can get
five or six feet tall.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.789
And they stand up
more or less straight.

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.080
They bend over a little, but
they stand up more or less

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.910
straight.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.509
And this sandwich
structure is one

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.425
of the things that lets
them stand up straight

00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:12.730
at a fairly low weight.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.930
And from the plant's
point of view,

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.950
there's a sort of
metabolic cost associated

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.190
with making more material.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.399
So it we can minimize
the amount of material,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.080
it's a better thing
for the plant.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.650
These are some other
examples of grasses that are

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.940
sandwich-type constructions.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.320
This is from some papers
by Julian Vincent.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.700
And the black little circles
here are the schlerchyma,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.570
are those sort of dense fibers.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.690
Then you can see in
both of these cases,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.470
the dense fibers
are on the outside,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.410
and the parenchyma cells,
which is the white,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.290
are on the inside.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.411
And so this is sort of another
set of micrographs of the iris.

00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:51.910
So this is just
showing the outside,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.590
and these are the ribs
viewed from the outside.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.680
And this is the core,
just sort of viewed

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.460
along the length of it.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.660
And so you can
idealize the structure

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.760
as being like a sandwich that's
got sort of fibers on the top

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.580
and on the bottom.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.788
So the top and the bottom
are like a fiber composite.

00:05:06.788 --> 00:05:08.990
And the middle part, with
the parenchyma cells,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.430
is kind of like a foam.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.585
And so we did a little
project on iris leaves,

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:15.960
and we wanted to
see if you could

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.560
show that they
behave mechanically,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.210
like a sandwich beam.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.030
So you remember that we had
that equation for the deflection

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.570
of the sandwich beam.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.990
There were two terms.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:32.800
There was a bending term, and
then there was a shearing term.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.530
And so we took some
little sandwich beams.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.222
We cut little kind
of rectangular beams.

00:05:43.222 --> 00:05:44.180
We hung little weights.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.707
We measured how
much they deflected,

00:05:45.707 --> 00:05:47.790
and we wanted to see if
we could use this equation

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.445
to predict their stiffness
and how much they deflected.

00:05:50.445 --> 00:05:52.570
So to do that, we needed
to know a bunch of things.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.160
We needed to know some of
the geometrical parameters.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.820
So we needed to know what
volume fraction of the face

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.630
is those solid ribs, how thick's
the core, how thick's the face?

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.780
And so we measured a bunch of
these geometrical parameters.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.030
We tested it like a cantilever
so we knew what B1 and B2 were

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.800
for the cantilever.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.220
We knew how long the beam
was, so we know what l is.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.920
We knew what loads we applied,
so we knew what P was.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.610
But we needed to
make some estimate

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.350
of what the face modulus
was and what the core shear

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.850
modulus was, too.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.950
And so we made some
estimates of that.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.710
So this table here
just shows some

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.570
of the dimensions of the leaf.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.270
The leaf tapers, and
this is at the thin end,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.760
so here's the face thickness.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.845
Here's the sort
of length of this.

00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:40.610
Some square cells in the face.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.912
This is the core thickness here.

00:06:42.912 --> 00:06:44.620
This is the dimensions
of the core cells.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.120
This is the diameter of the
ribs, the spacing of the ribs,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.041
the volume fraction
of solids in the ribs.

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.540
And we did that at
different lengths

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.700
along the different positions
along the length of the rib,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.710
or length of the leaf.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.260
So we had the
geometrical parameters,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.010
but we needed to get this E
of the face and G of the core.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.590
And to do that, we
looked at the literature.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.775
And people had done tests on
the fiber parts of leaves.

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:09.150
They'd done little
tensile tests,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.500
and they'd measured
modulii between about two

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.330
and 20 gigapascals.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.960
And then we did some tension
tests on the iris leaf.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.460
And in tension,
those ribs are going

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.340
to take most of the stress.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.340
And if you know the volume
fraction of the ribs,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.520
you can back out what
the stiffness of the ribs

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.187
must have been.

00:07:25.187 --> 00:07:26.770
If you know the
stiffness of the ribs,

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.644
you can figure out the
stiffness of the face.

00:07:28.644 --> 00:07:31.940
So we calculated that, and then
we looked at the literature.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.510
And people have done
tests on parenchyma cells

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.320
and different types of tissue on
things like apples and potatoes

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.420
and carrots.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.010
And these are the values for
the Young's modulus they get.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:47.850
They're between about 1, and the
highest one was 14 megapascals.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.970
But most of these values
for the Young's modulus

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.570
are around about four.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.540
And the shear modulus
is roughly about half

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.710
of the Young's modulus.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.820
So we said the shear
modulus was around two.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.500
So we have these values we could
plug it in and then calculate

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.300
what the stiffness would
be for the iris leaf.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.030
And so this was a
little analysis we did.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.030
So this was the measured
beam stiffness up here.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.130
We had four beams, and they
were different stiffnesses.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.630
They all had the same length.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.910
They all the same
face thickness.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.484
The core thickness varied.

00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:17.650
They all had the same width.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.090
We cut them to have the
same width so we could

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.700
calculate a flexural rigidity.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.130
That's the EI equivalent.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.050
We could calculate the bending
deflection term, the shear

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.290
deflection term.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.690
And this is the
calculated beam stiffness.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.539
And then this is the
ratio of the calculated

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.590
over the measured.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.450
So it's not exactly right.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.120
Obviously, there's
some difference here.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.929
But it's in the same
order of magnitude.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.357
It's in the same ballpark.

00:08:41.357 --> 00:08:43.440
And one of the complications
that we didn't really

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.240
try to take into account
was that the leaf isn't

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.630
a nice rectangular structure.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.630
The leaf has this kind of
curved cross-section to it.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.920
And we made a bit of an
approximation to that,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.389
but it wasn't that
close, really.

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:56.180
We could have probably
done better on that.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.790
But I think the idea that the
iris behaves like a sandwich is

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.330
a reasonable one.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.570
So that was the iris leaf.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.220
And then I wanted to show you
some other structures in nature

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.760
that are sandwiches.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.800
So this is a seakelp,
help like a seaweed thing,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.760
in New Zealand.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.150
This is the largest
intertidal seaweed.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.930
The fronds, the sort
of long pieces of it,

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.330
are up to 12 meters long.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.960
So that's almost 40 feet.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.340
So 40 feet is probably like
from one side of this room

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.590
to the other side of the room.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.720
It's quite long.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.700
And you can see, if you
look at this section here,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.910
this is all like a
honeycomb-type section here.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.430
And the honeycomb is like
a honeycomb in a sandwich,

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.190
and the top and the
bottom faces are

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.471
like the face of the sandwich.

00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:46.970
So this would be
like the face here.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.345
That would be the
honeycomb core.

00:09:48.345 --> 00:09:51.570
And that would be the other face
on the other side over there.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.880
And those honeycomb-like
cores, apparently,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.390
have some gas-filled pockets
that then provide buoyancy

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.790
to keep the whole
thing floating.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.630
So it photosynthesizes.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.270
So one of the things
about these leaves

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.392
is that they have
multiple functions.

00:10:04.392 --> 00:10:06.725
It's not just that they have
to have a certain stiffness

00:10:06.725 --> 00:10:08.930
so they don't fall over.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.630
The plant wants to
photosynthesize,

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.760
so you want to maximize
the surface area as well,

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.790
and you want to have
exposure to the sunlight.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.998
So there's a number of things
that the plant's trying

00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:19.770
to do in having this structure.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.820
So that seakelp is one example.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.410
These are skulls from birds.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.160
And so this is a pigeon here.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.680
This is a magpie.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.950
If you come from the West
you see magpies out West.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.490
You see them in Europe as well.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.190
And this is a long-eared owl.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.420
This long-eared
owl's around here.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.540
And I brought in a couple
of bird skulls as well.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.880
And you can see that all
of those birds skulls

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.450
are sandwich structures.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.690
The one for the pigeon has
sort of a foam-like core here.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.960
And you can see
that the two faces

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.470
aren't sort of concentric
for the pigeon skull.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.820
They sort of not
following each other.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.440
But here, this would be,
say, on the top shell

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.680
of the magpie, where the two,
the inner and outer face,

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.080
are sort of concentric.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.800
Then you get these kind of
little ribs of trabecular bone

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.410
in between them, and then the
same with a long-eared owl.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.390
You get these little
ribs in between them.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.887
And so you can see that there's
a sandwich structure there.

00:11:15.887 --> 00:11:17.470
And obviously, birds
want to be light.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.290
They have to be light
to fly, to take off,

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.300
and so they want to be light.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.857
So I've got two skulls here.

00:11:24.857 --> 00:11:25.940
And I'll pass them around.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.064
Please be careful because
they're kind of delicate.

00:11:28.064 --> 00:11:31.170
This one is from a screech
owl, and you see screech owls

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:31.710
around here.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.350
This was a screech owl that
had an intersection with a car.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.780
Yeah, so the skull fractured,
but you can see the sandwich

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.280
right there.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.030
You see the two little bits?

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.610
So you can see the inner
plate and the outer plate

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.206
and the foam, the
trabecular bone.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:49.580
So that's the screech owl.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.110
And this is a red tail hawk.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.385
So you can't really see
the shell and the sandwich

00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:55.010
structure here.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.077
But I want to pass
it around just

00:11:56.077 --> 00:11:57.368
so you can see how light it is.

00:11:57.368 --> 00:11:58.580
So it's amazingly light.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.470
So a red tail hawk is
probably about this big,

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.700
something like that.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:09.490
And this is one of the things
that makes them very light.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.929
So those are the bird skulls.

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:12.970
Oh, yes, so now I have to
tell you about the owl.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.178
So I think the people in
3032 have heard this before.

00:12:15.178 --> 00:12:16.960
But the other people haven't.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.064
So one of the
things about the owl

00:12:19.064 --> 00:12:20.480
is if you look at
the whole skull,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.970
if you look at this picture
here, one of the things

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.210
is that this bone here is not
symmetrical with that bone

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.810
there.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.290
Normally, when you
think of a body,

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.250
you think of the bones
being symmetrical.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.770
But those bones are
not symmetrical,

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.660
and those bones are
near where the ear is.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.140
And it turns out on owls,
at least on some owls,

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.490
the ears are at different
heights on their heads.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.060
And people think that
one of the things that

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.660
allows the owls to do is
it allows their hearing

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.090
to sort of pinpoint
where something is.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.440
And owls can catch little
creatures at night,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.100
but they can also catch little
creatures underneath the snow.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.420
So they can catch things
that they can't even see.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.400
And they have a
number of adaptations

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.660
to improve their hearing,
but this is one of them.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.100
So here's a little owl Allison
Curtis is a Canadian friend who

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.460
lives in northern Ontario,
and this is looking out

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.900
of her living room window.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.994
And that's a barred owl.

00:13:12.994 --> 00:13:14.410
And you can see
the barred owl has

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.156
caught this little vole here.

00:13:16.156 --> 00:13:17.530
And you can see
in the background

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.910
it's winter in Canada.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.860
and there's snow
all over the place.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.980
So this owl has probably
caught that little vole

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.520
underneath the snow.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.840
And then it's come to eat it.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.490
And this is another
picture of-- you

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.960
can see this is where an
owl landed in the snow.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.290
It's wings hit the snow, trying
to catch something underneath.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.280
And this is another
kind of beautiful print

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.150
of the owl's wings hitting
the snow in the winter time.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.427
So did I show you the fox video?

00:13:46.427 --> 00:13:47.760
Should I show you the fox video?

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.600
You saw it, right?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.472
I think I showed it
last time in 3032.

00:13:53.472 --> 00:13:54.680
But you guys haven't seen it.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.697
Let me show you the
fox video because foxes

00:13:56.697 --> 00:13:57.780
do the same kind of thing.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.420
Their ears are the same as ours.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.190
They're in the same position.

00:14:04.537 --> 00:14:05.870
But they have this-- let me see.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.870
Where's the sound thing?

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.590
We don't really need
the sound for this,

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.210
but there's BBC sound.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.445
So we get this music,
even though the fox

00:14:14.445 --> 00:14:16.680
can't hear the music.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.610
Here we go, fox no drive.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.340
Check this out.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.436
Is it going to come up?

00:14:26.635 --> 00:14:27.810
Is that going to play?

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.310
OK

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.684
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:29.684 --> 00:14:32.890
-It listens for the tiny sounds
of its prey moving about below.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.723
PROFESSOR: So you see
how it cocks its head,

00:14:34.723 --> 00:14:36.496
and it does this with its head?

00:14:36.496 --> 00:14:38.245
It's putting its ears
at different heights

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:39.200
when it does that.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.140
So check this out.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.380
And look carefully, you
can see the little animal

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.557
it's got in its mouth
when it comes out.

00:15:03.557 --> 00:15:04.473
There's a little tail.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.690
So part of the reason
dogs and foxes and coyotes

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.510
do that thing, I
think, is because they

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.010
put their ears at
different heights,

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.230
and it helps them pinpoint
where something is.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.989
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:17.989 --> 00:15:19.780
You know I love these
Nature videos, right?

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.779
So that's the fox video.

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:23.115
Let me see if I can stop that.

00:15:26.256 --> 00:15:28.380
So that's one of the
interesting things about owls.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.965
Let me go back to my
little PowerPoints.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.570
So here's another example
of a creature that

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.430
has a sandwich-type structures.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.810
So here's the sandwich here.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.100
Here is the ever so
charming looking cuttlefish.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.040
And the cuttlefish is
not actually a fish.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.570
It's a mollusk.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.090
So it's related to things like
octopus, things like that,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.480
and squids.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.870
It's a cephalopod.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.040
And you can't see it so
well in this picture,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.400
but I'm going to show you
something else and you see it.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.691
It's got like little tentacles.

00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:08.140
These things here are actually
separate little tentacles.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.220
And because it's not a fish,
it doesn't have like fins

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.780
that can kind of swim with.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.370
And it's got this thing
called the cuttlefish bone.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.670
And this is a
cuttlefish bone here.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.262
And that bone has the
sandwich structure here.

00:16:20.262 --> 00:16:21.470
And it's not actually a bone.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.790
It's really a shell.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.160
It's a calcium carbonate thing,
not a calcium phosphate thing.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.600
But the cuttlefish can
control how much air

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.010
goes into those little pockets.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.120
And it can control its buoyancy
by controlling how much air

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.650
goes into those little pockets.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.680
And I brought with
me a cuttlefish bone.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.970
Have you ever owned
like, I don't know,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.880
like a parrot or a pet bird?

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.150
Apparently, pet birds love
to sharpen their beaks

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.700
on this cuttlefish bone.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.700
So if you go to a pet store,
you can buy this stuff.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.370
So you won't be able to
see the little sandwich

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.695
structure because it's a
very small length scale.

00:16:56.695 --> 00:16:59.490
But you can kind of
see there's a sort

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.390
of different material
on the inside

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.410
than there is on
the outside of that.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.530
So do people know
the other thing

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.950
that cuttlefish are famous
for, besides the bone?

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:10.923
Change colors.

00:17:10.923 --> 00:17:13.089
Can I show you a video of
cuttlefish changing color?

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:14.837
Yeah, of course.

00:17:14.837 --> 00:17:16.170
So let me get rid of this again.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.869
Go back to this.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:21.589
Let's see, somewhere--
where's the cuttlefish?

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:22.099
Here we go.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:27.719
Did I do it?

00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:29.760
Is it thinking?

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.260
Here we go.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.190
Where's the cuttlefish?

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.106
So this is another one
of these Science Friday

00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:37.944
videos from National Public
Radio with Flora Lichtman.

00:17:37.944 --> 00:17:38.610
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:39.650
-OK, let's play a game.

[GAME SHOW MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:42.608 --> 00:17:44.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.420
PROFESSOR: See it?

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.290
-Biologist Sarah Zielinski
took these shots.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.860
And if you needed a helping
hand to find the cuttlefish,

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:55.559
don't feel bad.

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:57.850
-I've certainly taken photos
in the past then come back

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.420
to look at them and gone, I'm
sure there was a cuttlefish

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.762
in there somewhere!

00:18:02.762 --> 00:18:06.160
-These cephalopods are
master camouflagers.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.690
But while they're
hiding their body,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.590
they're revealing
something about their mind,

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.236
or at least their visual system.

00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:13.860
-In very simple terms,
they can tell us

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.944
what they can see by
the body patterns they

00:18:15.944 --> 00:18:16.860
produce on their skin.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.330
-They produce
these body patterns

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.010
by expanding or
contracting chromatophores,

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.820
these little ink
sacks on their skin.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.070
And they use different
displays for different reasons,

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.130
like for male-to-male combat.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.920
-Two males will
turn into each other

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.950
and pass these kind of
waves of dark chromatophores

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.840
over a really bright sort of
iridescent stripey body pattern

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.140
and somehow solve these combats.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.110
Eventually, one male
gives up and goes away.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.971
-And then there's
this unsolved mystery.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.170
It changes color when
it grabs a snack.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.240
-That doesn't make perfect
sense because it seems

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.440
to make it very conspicuous.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.240
So one theory is that
it's just a happy signal

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.920
of how excited it
is to have caught

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.980
something, some response that it
doesn't have any control over.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.810
-But most of the
time they seem to be

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.320
using their chromatophores
more intentionally,

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.796
primarily to blend in.

00:19:08.796 --> 00:19:10.920
-Because otherwise they're
more likely to be eaten,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.050
so it's very important
they don't make mistakes

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.240
about ambiguous
visual information.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.970
-And ambiguous
visual information

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.360
is specifically what
Zielinski's interested in.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.980
So here's the
experimental setup.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.910
Print out laminated patterns,
like this checkerboard,

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.310
and stick them in a tank.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.000
-And we place the
animals in the tank.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.140
And we record the body
patterns that they produce.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.690
-You're seeing them on squares,
but they do the same thing

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.330
on top of circles.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.030
They produce--

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.610
- --the disruptive pattern,
where you get these blocky

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.700
components of
high-contrast components.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.765
-But when you put a cuttlefish
over squiggles, it produces--

00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:46.140
- --a sort of mottley pattern,
where you get these little

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.870
groups of dark spots
showing across the body.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.690
-So what happens when you
put a cuttlefish on something

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:57.240
in between, when you put
them on incomplete circles?

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.930
When we see something like
this, our visual system

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.660
likes to fill in the blanks,
something we do constantly,

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.570
Zielinski says.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.350
-The reason why cartoons
and sketches work

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.270
is because we can
recognize objects

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.630
based on their edges alone.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.310
-And we can identify objects
even if they're broken up or--

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.679
- --have an object that is
occluded by another object.

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:16.720
That's no problem for us.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.430
We can still work out what the
object is most of the time.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.460
And I was interested to
know whether cuttlefish

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.690
can solve similar problems.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.380
-And Zielinski and colleagues
report this week that

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.230
cuttlefish do seem to--

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.920
- --fill in those gaps and
interpret those little segments

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.440
as a whole circle.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.500
-Or anyway, the broken circles
prompted the same camo pattern

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.690
as full circles.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.140
So if you're wondering, uh,
I see these as circles, too.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.020
What's the big deal?

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.360
The weird thing here is
that there's no reason why

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.763
cuttlefish, which are--

00:20:48.763 --> 00:20:51.820
- --invertebrates, and they're
in the same group as slugs

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.450
and snails.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.080
- --should see the
world the way we do.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.162
-Yes, it's like they're
alien, but we also

00:20:57.162 --> 00:20:58.870
seem to have so much
in common with them.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.120
-So the next step?

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.410
-Because we can't share
the perceptive experience

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.190
of a cuttlefish,
it's hard to know

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.660
exactly what it is that they're
doing to fill in that missing

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.340
information.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.298
And I want to try to get
a better grasp on that

00:21:12.298 --> 00:21:14.070
and also see whether
they actually respond

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.760
to true illusory contours.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.630
-So you're going to show
optical illusions to cuttlefish?

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.676
-(LAUGHING) That's what
I'm hoping to do, yes.

00:21:22.676 --> 00:21:27.010
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.400
PROFESSOR: So let's
go back to sandwiches.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.160
I think I have--
do I have one more?

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.870
There we go.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.930
So horseshoe crab shells,
so different sorts

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.390
of arthropods, the shells
are sandwiched too.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.649
This is from Mark Myers' work.

00:21:44.649 --> 00:21:46.190
So we're looking at
the cross-section

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.692
of a horseshoe crab shell.

00:21:47.692 --> 00:21:49.650
So again, it's the same
idea-- the animal wants

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.066
to minimize the
amount of material

00:21:51.066 --> 00:21:54.160
or minimize the weight, and
this is a way of doing that.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.540
And I went to the
Galapagos about a year ago.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.530
And there was a place where
they had these giant Galapagos

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:02.632
tortoise shells.

00:22:02.632 --> 00:22:04.090
And one of them
was broken, and you

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.465
could see there was a sandwich
structure in the Galapagos

00:22:06.465 --> 00:22:07.260
tortoise shells.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.377
These Galapagos tortoises,
their shell is like this big.

00:22:10.377 --> 00:22:11.085
They're gigantic.

00:22:11.085 --> 00:22:12.560
They're huge.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.920
So those are my examples of
sandwich panels and beams

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.710
and shells and
whatnot in nature.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.800
So the idea is that
nature too wants

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.140
to minimize weight and minimize
the amount of material,

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.181
and the sandwich structure
is a way of doing that.

00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:29.430
So I have one more thing I
wanted to talk about today.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.490
So this isn't quite
sandwich structures,

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.780
but it's looking at another
kind of natural structure

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.340
that is designed to reduce
the weight of plant stems,

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.160
in this case, palm stems.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.590
And there's a couple of
interesting things about this.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.910
So when you look at
palms, like let's pretend

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:45.840
we're not in Boston.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.120
We're in California,
where they have palms.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.370
And we're in LA, and
they don't have winter.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.860
And if you look at the palms
growing, when the palm's short,

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.590
it's about this big in diameter.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:56.966
And as it gets
taller and taller,

00:22:56.966 --> 00:22:58.423
the diameter doesn't
really change.

00:22:58.423 --> 00:23:00.020
It gets taller and
taller and taller,

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.970
but the diameter doesn't change,
at least in some species.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.554
Whereas if you think
of a tree, a tree

00:23:04.554 --> 00:23:06.261
starts out with a
little skinny diameter.

00:23:06.261 --> 00:23:08.560
And as the tree gets taller,
the diameter gets bigger.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.630
And it sort of tapers and
does that whole thing.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:11.700
So palms don't do that.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.040
And palms are not trees.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.510
They're a botanically
different thing from trees.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.450
So here's a coconut palm.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.090
And so the question is, as the
stem gets taller and taller,

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.934
how does it resist
the bending loads that

00:23:23.934 --> 00:23:24.850
get bigger and bigger?

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.790
So probably, the main load
on these sorts of things

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.330
is from the wind.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.735
And often these
plants are in areas

00:23:31.735 --> 00:23:32.860
where they have hurricanes.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.318
And you see them
in hurricanes, you

00:23:34.318 --> 00:23:37.930
see the pictures of the
palm stem blowing way over.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.110
And so how do they resist
the larger internal stresses

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.740
as they get taller and taller,
if the diameter doesn't

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.990
get bigger and bigger?

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.760
And the way they do that is that
they deposit additional layers

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.650
of cell wall as the plant ages.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.040
So if you think of a
tree, when a tree grows,

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.884
it just deposits
more and more cells.

00:23:55.884 --> 00:23:57.800
And the cells have roughly
the same thickness.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.880
So there's ones that are
deposited in the spring have

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.410
thinner walls.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.409
Then the summer and the
fall have thicker walls.

00:24:02.409 --> 00:24:04.620
But more or less, it's similar.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.710
Whereas the palm,
it deposit cells,

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.780
and then as the
trunk of the palm

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.540
gets taller, as the
stem gets taller,

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.550
it deposits more layers
on the cell wall.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.300
So this is an example in an SCM.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.340
You can see here
this is a young cell,

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.760
and it's got-- this one that's
not marked is a primary cell

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.420
wall, and then this is the first
layer of the secondary cell

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.450
wall.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.360
And then this is an older palm.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.250
And you can see here
it's got more layers,

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.800
and so the cell wall
itself has gotten thicker.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.800
So that means that the
density of the tissue

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.310
changes as the palm ages.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.120
And it does so in a
very kind of clever way.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.550
If you think of the palm as
being like a cantilever that's

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.510
vertical and it's bending in the
wind, when we have a cantilever

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.094
beam or any kind of
beam, the stresses

00:24:47.094 --> 00:24:49.093
are going to be biggest
on the periphery, right?

00:24:49.093 --> 00:24:51.040
They're going to be
biggest on the outside.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.920
And if you think of
the palm as having

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.299
a circular cross-section,
that outer periphery

00:24:56.299 --> 00:24:57.840
is going to see the
biggest stresses.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.570
So it would make the most sense
if that was the densest tissue.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.659
And that's exactly
what the palm does.

00:25:02.659 --> 00:25:04.700
So there was a nice study
done by Paul Rich quite

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.010
a number of years ago.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.920
And he studied palms
in Central America

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.787
and looked at the
density and measured

00:25:09.787 --> 00:25:10.870
the mechanical properties.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.190
And I'm going to talk
about his stuff today.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.830
So the white is the low density.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.060
The gray's the medium,
and the black's the high.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.976
So you can see the low
density's on the middle

00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:21.320
of the young stem, and
just at the very base

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.870
and then the periphery
is the dense tissue.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.450
But as the stem gets
taller and gets older,

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.110
then stuff that was low
density is now high density.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.584
And only the very middle
here is the low density.

00:25:33.584 --> 00:25:35.250
And that some stuff
that was low density

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.459
has turned to middle density.

00:25:36.459 --> 00:25:37.916
And some stuff that
was low density

00:25:37.916 --> 00:25:39.140
has turned to high density.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.670
So it's done this by adding
more and more layers to the cell

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.400
wall, making the
cell wall thicker

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.410
and making the cells
themselves denser.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.060
So this is looking
just at a single palm.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.370
So each one of these
lines is a single palm.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.810
And this is looking at
how the density changes

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.540
from the periphery to
the center of the palm.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.140
So if you cut the
palm down and, say,

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.480
we take a little sample radially
from the middle to the outside

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.910
or from the outside
to the middle,

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.570
he then measured the density.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.911
And it's probably easiest
to think about the dry ones

00:26:11.911 --> 00:26:14.160
because that's kind of what
you would compare wood to.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.240
So the dry densities varied
from about one gram per CC,

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.080
that's about 1,000
kilograms per cubic meter,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.020
down to almost zero in
this particular species

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.222
here, probably like 50
or something like that.

00:26:25.222 --> 00:26:26.680
And if you compare
this with woods,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.520
this little arrow here is the
density of most common woods.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.840
So if you looked at pine
and spruce an oak and maple

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.930
and ash and hickory, they would
all be in that little range

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.580
there.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.680
So a single palm stem
can have a bigger range

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.400
of densities than many
different species of wood.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.825
So it has this kind of
profile of the density.

00:26:47.825 --> 00:26:49.200
And the thing I
was interested in

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.030
is seeing how
mechanically efficient

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.010
that was to put the denser
material at the outside.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.310
So I looked at the
stiffness of the palm,

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.120
and I also looked
at the strength.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.880
So I just replotted that data
on this slightly different axes

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.560
here.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.020
So this is the radial position
relative to the outer radius,

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.290
and this is the density.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:12.700
And I subtracted off the
minimum and then took the range.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.830
And for this species
here, the minimum density

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.600
was almost zero.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.420
So this expression simplifies
to something like that.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.332
And just because it's
mathematically simpler,

00:27:20.332 --> 00:27:21.790
that's what we're
going to look at.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:26.720
So the density goes roughly
as the radius squared.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.030
And Paul Rich also did a lot of
mechanical tests on the palm,

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.530
and he took out little beams
of different densities.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.420
And he measured the stiffness
and the strength of the beams.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.100
So he measured the modulus of
elasticity here versus density.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.550
And he measured the
modulus of rupture here.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.410
And these are all
along the grain.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.450
And he found that the Young's
modulus varied with the density

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.390
to the 2.5 power,
and the strength

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.020
varied as the density squared.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:53.810
And if the--

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:54.560
[BUZZING SOUND]

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.110
Oh, hello.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.194
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:57.194 --> 00:27:59.110
So these were just sorts
of empirical findings

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.540
that he made.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.180
If you have prismatic cells
and you deform them axially,

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.110
and the cell wall was the same
in the different specimens,

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.260
then the solid modulus
would be a constant.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.530
And you would expect that
the modulus of the beam

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.720
would go just linearly
with the density, sort

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.600
of like a honeycomb
loaded [? at a ?] plane.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.000
But what he measured was that
the modulus and the strength

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.024
varied with some
power of the density.

00:28:22.024 --> 00:28:23.440
And the reason for
that really was

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.760
that the cell walls
of the denser material

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.090
had more layers.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.214
And in the additional layers,
the cellulose microfibular

00:28:32.214 --> 00:28:34.630
angle was probably different,
so that the different layers

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.230
had different stiffnesses.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.370
And if you have
layers of differences,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.090
then you're going to get
this power relationship.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.990
So what I then did
was I took his data,

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:48.190
and I tried to see how efficient
that would be in bending.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.600
So he had found that the density
varied with the radius raised

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.300
to some power.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.550
This power n was 2, but
I wanted to do it just

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.760
for a general case, so
I said I was just n.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.000
And he said that he found
that the modulus varied

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.392
with the density raised
to some other power m.

00:29:02.392 --> 00:29:05.131
And for him, m was 2 and 1/2.

00:29:05.131 --> 00:29:06.880
And so I could write
just another equation

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.800
saying that the modulus goes
as the radius to the mn power.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.550
And then you could do
a little calculation

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.884
where you work out with the
equivalent flexural rigidity

00:29:14.884 --> 00:29:15.383
is.

00:29:15.383 --> 00:29:16.620
So you have to integrate up.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.370
You kind of say you
have a little band

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:19.400
at a certain radius.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.480
That radius has a
certain modulus.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.360
And you can figure out
the moment of inertia

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.943
that goes with that
particular radius.

00:29:25.943 --> 00:29:28.230
And then if you integrate
it up over the whole thing,

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.950
you can say that the
flexural rigidity

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.370
for the gradient density
is some constant times

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.640
pi times the outer radius
to the fourth power divided

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.370
by those two powers mn plus 4.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.310
So m was the power
here for the modulus.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.826
And n was the power
there for the density.

00:29:43.826 --> 00:29:46.200
And then you could compare
that with having the same mass

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.560
just uniformly distributed
over the whole cross-section.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.060
And then if you take the
ratio of the flexural rigidity

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.630
for the density gradient
versus the flexural rigidity

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:59.390
for the uniform
density, you can show

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.240
that it's this equation here.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.510
And then if you plug in
these measured values

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.720
for those exponents
for n and m, you

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.270
find that the flexural rigidity
with the gradient density

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.400
relative to the uniform density
is a factor of 2 and 1/2.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.560
So the stem is 2 and
1/2 times stiffer

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.450
by having that density profile.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.670
So there's a huge sort
of mechanical advantage

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:19.580
to doing that.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.100
And just sort of
physically, if you

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.330
know the stresses our
biggest on the outside,

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.211
it would make sense to put the
denser material on the outside.

00:30:27.211 --> 00:30:28.710
And then the other
thing I looked at

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.250
was the strength of the palm.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.640
So imagine this is our
very schematic palm here,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.800
and then there's a
circular cross section.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.270
So I wanted to compare the
bending stress distribution

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.650
with the bending
strength distribution.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:45.625
So the stress goes as the
modulus times the strain,

00:30:45.625 --> 00:30:47.100
just Hooke's law.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.650
And here we're assuming that
plane sections remain plane,

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.450
like that's the standard
assumption of bending.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.730
So if you assume plane
sections remain plane,

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.140
then the strain goes with the
curvature times the distance y

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.460
from the neutral axis, the
distance from the middle.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.585
So this distance here would
be the dis-- [? same ?]

00:31:03.585 --> 00:31:05.390
at loaded with a loaded p here.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.404
That distance would be y there.

00:31:07.404 --> 00:31:09.070
And then I can plug
in some things here.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.340
So instead of E, I'm going
to plug-in my relationship

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.060
with the radius
to that mn power.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.920
And here's my curvature,
and instead of y,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.420
if I say that some
radius, I'm going

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.840
to say y is our r cos theta.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.930
And so I'm going to say
that the stress goes--

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:22.430
[SNEEZE]

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.450
Bless you.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:27.430
Goes as radius raised
to some power mn plus 1.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.380
And again, for the species
I know what n and m are,

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.280
so the stress goes as the
radius to the sixth power.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.090
And then I can also compare
with what Paul Rich had

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.270
found for the strength.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.380
He found that the strength--
so sigma star is the strength--

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.320
was proportional to the
density raised to some power q,

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.600
and that power was 2 in the
measurements that he made.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.550
And so I can say
that the strength

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:55.150
goes as the radius to this power
nq, so to the fourth power.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:59.170
And then if I plot the stress
distribution and the strength

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.230
distribution-- so imagine, this
is through the cross-section

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.730
here.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.950
So this is the
diameter of the stem.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.400
And this is the neutral
axis here in the middle.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:15.280
The strength goes as
that solid line there.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.380
It goes as the fourth power.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.490
And the stress goes as
that dashed line there,

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.160
as the sixth power.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.190
So they're not exactly
on top of each other,

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.430
but they're very close to
being on top of each other.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.260
So basically what
the palm has done

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.850
is it's arranged the
material in such a way

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.040
that the strength
matches the stresses that

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.140
are applied to it.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.090
So if I just had a
constant density,

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.880
my stress profile
would look like that.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.290
And if I had a constant
density, the strength profile

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.460
would kind of like that.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.220
So the strength here
would be a constant,

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.554
and this would be
the stress here.

00:32:48.554 --> 00:32:50.470
So the stuff in the
middle, it's much stronger

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.460
than it needs to be.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.930
Whereas the palm has arranged
things so that it's got

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:57.890
just the right amount of
strength for the stress,

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.490
as a function of
the radial position.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.130
So it's kind of a clever thing.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.180
So that's kind of
a beautiful thing.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.850
And I think that is it.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.380
I think that's-- yeah,
that's the end of it.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.260
So all these images came from
this other book that we wrote.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.930
And if you wanted
to get the sources,

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.330
you could get them from there.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.470
So that all I wanted
to talk about today

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:20.130
was some examples of sort of
efficient mechanical design

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.940
in nature and the sandwich
panel structures as one,

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.230
and these radial density
gradients is another.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.620
We have a project
on bamboo right now,

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.120
and the bamboo also has a
radial density gradient,

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.120
and it's the same thing.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.703
The densest material's
on the outside,

00:33:33.703 --> 00:33:36.280
and the least dense
is on the inside.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.750
So I think I'm going to
stop there for today.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.790
So what I was going
to do on Monday

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:45.690
is talk a little bit
about bio-mimicking.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.960
And that won't take
the whole class at all.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.043
And I thought we could
spend the rest of the class

00:33:50.043 --> 00:33:51.380
on Monday just doing a review.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.410
So the test's on Wednesday.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.050
So if you want to
bring questions,

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.020
that would be a beautiful thing.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.510
I can't really can I review
the whole last six weeks

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:03.390
or something in an hour
and a half or something.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.430
So if you want to bring
questions, I'll be here

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.280
and we can just
go over questions.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.310
Does that sound good?
