00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.860
PROFESSOR: So what
I wanted to do today

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.540
was talk about thermal
properties of foams.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.530
And foams are often used
for thermal insulation.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.150
And that's always
closed cell foams

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.691
that are used for
thermal insulation.

00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:38.780
And we'll see why.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.290
And the foams tend to have
a low thermal conductivity.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.620
And that's largely because
gases have lower conductivity

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.684
than solids.

00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:49.100
And if you have
mostly gas, you're

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.559
going to have a
lower conductivity.

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.183
So they have a low conductivity
because they have a high volume

00:00:53.183 --> 00:00:54.230
fraction of gas.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.640
And they've got a low volume
fraction of the solid.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.490
They also have cells.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.480
And the heat is
transferred partly

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.450
by radiation and convection.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.070
And if you have small
cells, you reduce the amount

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.070
of convection and radiation.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.360
And we'll see that.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.270
So that, by having a
cellular structure,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.230
and in particular, by
having small cells,

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.740
you can decrease
the heat transfer.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010
OK, so let me write
some of the stuff down.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.355
So closed cell foams are widely
used for thermal insulation.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.190
And the only materials with
lower thermal conductivity

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.040
than closed cell foams
are aerogels gels.

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:08.729
And I'll I talk
a little bit more

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.230
about aerogels later on today.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.780
But the difficulty
with aerogels is

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.600
that they tend to be very weak
and brittle, like ridiculously

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.580
weak and brittle.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.030
So we had a project on
aerogels a couple of years ago.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.530
And the students who I
was collaborating with

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.410
would make aerogels.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.210
And they'd bring
it up to my office.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.390
And I would pick it up and
like-- I would pick it up

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.640
like this, and it would break.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.010
So they have very low
thermal conductivity,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.770
but they're very brittle.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.060
And I brought a few of
our samples of aerogels,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.060
just so you can see
what they look like.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.000
And I'll pass them around
in that little tube,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.980
so you can kind
of play with them.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.720
OK, so we're going
to focus on foams.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.830
And whoops-- And we can say
the low thermal conductivity

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.620
of foam arises mostly from the
high volume fraction of gas

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.200
and that the gas
has a low lambda,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.325
a low thermal conductivity.

00:03:32.384 --> 00:03:33.800
So lambda is thermal
conductivity,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.383
so I'm just going
to put lambda there.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.120
Then it has a small
volume fraction

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.494
of solid, which has a
higher thermal conductivity.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.679
And then the foams have a
relatively small cell size.

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.470
So one of the things
we're going to look at

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.829
is how does the cell size
effect the thermal transfer,

00:03:58.829 --> 00:03:59.870
the thermal conductivity.

00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:30.980
OK, so there's lots of
applications for foams.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.940
And I guess one of the
main ones is in buildings,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.690
insulating buildings--
also insulating

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.340
refrigerated vehicles,
things like LNG tankers.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.577
So there's lots of the
applications for using foams

00:04:42.577 --> 00:04:43.535
for thermal insulation.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.330
Foams, in addition to having
a low thermal conductivity,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.210
they also have good
thermal shock resistance.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.250
So thermal shock is if you have
a material, you heat it up,

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.750
and then you suddenly cool the
surface of it, for example.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.958
So say you takes something
and you quench it in water

00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.880
or quench it in some
fluid, then the surface,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.922
it wants to shrink because
its temperature drops,

00:05:24.922 --> 00:05:26.838
but it's connected to
everything underneath it

00:05:26.838 --> 00:05:28.120
and it can't really shrink.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.230
And so it's constrained and you
can get cracking and spalling.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.060
And so, it turns out foams
have a good resistance

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.600
to that thermal shock
kind of loading.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.925
And we'll see why that is, too.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.710
Roughly, you can see if
the thermal expansion

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.030
strain is the thermal expansion
coefficient times the change

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.307
in temperature.

00:06:06.307 --> 00:06:07.890
And the stress that
you might generate

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.580
is just going to be related to
the modulus times alpha times

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.561
delta-t.

00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.810
And because we're going to
see that alpha for the foam

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.770
is the same as alpha
for the solid, but the E

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.670
foam is going to be a lot less
that E of a solid would be.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.710
So because the
modulus is smaller,

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.230
you would get a better
thermal shock resistance.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.010
OK, so I wanted to go
over a couple of sort

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.980
of laws of heat
conduction, so we

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.860
can talk about what
thermal conductivity is

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.750
and how we define it.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.526
So the first one here--

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.080
--first one here is for
steady state conduction.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.990
So when we say steady state
conduction, what we mean

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.597
is that the temperature
is constant with time,

00:07:03.597 --> 00:07:05.305
the temperature doesn't
change with time.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.530
So time's not going to come
into the equation here.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.570
And heat transfer for
steady state conduction,

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.480
where there is no change in
the temperature with time,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.962
described by Fourier's Law.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.970
And that says that
the heat flux q

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:37.720
is equal to minus lambda times
the gradient in temperature.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.450
And if you want to think about
just a one diversion of that,

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.280
it's equal to minus
lambda times dt by dx.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.710
So here, q is our heat flux.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.920
So that would have
units of joules

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.120
per meter squared per second.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.622
So how much heat transfer
per unit area per unit time.

00:08:03.622 --> 00:08:05.080
Lambda is the
thermal conductivity.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.880
And it has units of watts per
meter k, so degrees kelvin.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.054
And then delta
or-- and then this

00:08:22.054 --> 00:08:23.220
is our temperature gradient.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.919
OK, so that's Fourier's
Law, and we're

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:37.340
going to use that later on
when we talk about the foams.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.940
And then, just so that we have
things a little more complete,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.770
if you have a non-steady heat
conduction, if the temperature

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.987
varies with time, then
there's a difference equation

00:08:44.987 --> 00:08:46.570
that involves the
thermal diffusivity.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:09:00.190
So if we have non-steady
heat conduction-- so t

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.170
varies with time.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.610
I'm going to call a time tau.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.810
Then a partial differentiation,
the partial derivative

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.290
of temperature with
respect to time

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.970
is equal to the
diffusivity, that's

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.220
given the symbol a, times
the second derivative

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.020
of temperature with
respect of distance,

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.870
so with respect x squared.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.836
So here a is the
thermal diffusivity.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.420
And it is equal to the
thermal conductivity

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.740
divided by the density and
divided by the specific heat.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:50.600
So here, rho is the density
and cp is the specific heat.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.250
The specific heat
is the heat required

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.570
to raise the temperature
of a unit mass

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.220
by the unit temperature.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.700
And so, the density times cp is
the volumetric heat capacity.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.570
It's how much energy
you would need

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.410
to raise a certain
volume by, say, 1 degree

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.750
k instead of a certain mass.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:38.110
OK, so on the table
here, on the screen,

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.810
we have different materials.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.350
And we have the thermal
conductivity lambda.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.820
And we have the
thermal diffusivity, a.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.320
And I guess I should
also say a has units

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.510
of meters squared per second.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.230
So this table is arranged
in order of decreasing

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.280
thermal conductivity.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:08.010
So here's copper at the
top, 384, watts per meter k.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.880
Here's, you know,
different metals.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.020
You've got aluminum.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.420
Here's a couple of ceramics.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.230
They're about a factor of
10 less than the metals.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.580
Here's the polymers, another
factor of 10 less than that.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.540
And here's some gases.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.030
Air is about 0.025.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.220
Carbon dioxide is
less than that.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.410
Triclorofluoromethane,
which used

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.390
to be used as a gas
in foams because it's

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.470
got such low thermal
conductivity, is 0.008.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.830
But it's no longer used because
it's a-- what you call it?

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.210
A fluorocarbon.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.590
Anyway, it decreases
our ozone layer.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.100
So they don't use that anymore.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.220
Now here's some wood.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.040
So that's one sort
of cellular solid.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.430
And they're around 0.04--
something like that.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.150
And here's a group
of polymer foams.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.940
And they're a little over 0.025.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.030
So if you think of--
if you had the gas,

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.680
air-- if the air was
the gas inside the foam,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.905
0.025 is lambda for the gas.

00:12:00.905 --> 00:12:02.850
So you're not going to
get lower than that.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.440
And you have to use a low
conductivity gas to get these

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.690
values, like 0.025
here, 0.020, 0.017.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.360
And then, hear some other sorts
of sort of mineral fibers,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.140
glass foams, glass wools.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.280
OK, so that's just a table so
that you have some data there.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:19.780
All right?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.720
Yes?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:30.310
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] --foams,
if they are closed cell,

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.540
with a different gas rate.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.480
Because if they're open cell--

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:32.530
PROFESSOR: --Right.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:32.660
The gas is going to--

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.680
STUDENT: --it would
just always be air.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.846
PROFESSOR: It's going to go.

00:12:34.846 --> 00:12:37.420
And in fact, one
of the difficulties

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.950
with using the lower
conductivity of any gases

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.500
is there's a phenomenon called
aging, that if, you know,

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.720
you've got your gas
inside your foam,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.480
it's going to diffuse
out into the air.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.900
And air's going to diffuse in.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.980
So over time, the
thermal conductivity

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.850
tends to increase
because you're getting

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:56.440
air coming and the local--
conductivity gas going out.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.410
But I think,
typically, that process

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.104
takes a number of years.

00:13:00.104 --> 00:13:01.270
It doesn't happen in a week.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.530
But if you're
designing a building

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.488
and want the building to
be there for 50 years,

00:13:04.488 --> 00:13:05.990
it occurs faster than that.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.385
So it's not ideal from
that point of view.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.820
All right.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.600
So let me talk a little bit
more about thermal diffusivity.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.991
Let me scoot over here.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:54.260
So materials with a high value
of that thermal diffusivity, a.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.180
They rapidly adjust
their temperature

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.680
to their surroundings.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.190
So if they have a high
value of a, what it really

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.220
means they've got
a, say, a high value

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.570
of lamda-- so high
thermal conductivity.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.480
And, say, a low value of this
volumetric heat capacity.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.160
So it doesn't take much energy
to change their temperature.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.570
And they also conduct heat well.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.940
So they tend to adjust
their temperature

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.288
to their surroundings quickly.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.110
OK, so then, let's talk about
the thermal conductivity

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.730
of a foam.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.630
So I'm going to call
that lambda star.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.870
So the star is the foam.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.700
And then we'll
talk about-- lambda

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.410
s will be the lambda for the
solid that it's made from.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.730
So if you think of the thermal
conductivity of the foam,

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.720
there's contributions
from different types

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.370
of heat transfer.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.610
So you could have conduction
through the solid.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.380
I'm going to call that lambda s.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.440
You could have conduction
through the gas.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.420
You could have convection
within the cell.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.550
So convection has to do with
having, say, within the cell,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.390
it might be a different
temperature on one

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.390
side of the cell to the
other side of the cell.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.100
And the warmer side
of the cell, the gas

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.060
is going to tend to
rise to the warmer side

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.160
and fall to the cooler side.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.536
And you get a convection
current set up.

00:15:56.536 --> 00:15:58.160
So you can get heat
transfer from that.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.530
And you can also get heat
transfer by radiation.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.750
So radiation can cause
heat transfer, as well.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:11.570
So we're going to have
contributions from conduction

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.342
through the solid.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.780
So the amount of conduction in
the foam from the solid-- I'm

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.510
going to call lambda star s.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.670
So lambda s would be the
conductivity of the solid.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.530
And lambda star s is the thermal
conductivity contribution

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.490
from the solid in the foam.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.830
So we get kind of--
through the solid.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.490
We have conductivity
through the gas.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.230
So it's lambda star g for gas.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.372
And then we could have
convection within the cells.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.450
We'll call that lambda star c.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:04.590
And then we could get radiation
through the cell walls

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.465
and across the voids.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.890
We'll call that lambda star r.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.069
And so, the thermal
conductivity of the foam

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.908
is just the sum of those
four contributions.

00:17:40.447 --> 00:17:42.030
So we're just going
to go through each

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.880
of those contributions,
in turn, and work out

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.759
how much thermal conductivity
you get from each of them.

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:50.800
And it turns out most of
the thermal conductivity

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.280
comes through the gas.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:04.740
So if we first look at just
conduction through the solid,

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:10.250
we've got that contribution to
the conductivity of the foam

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.730
from the solid, it's just
equal to some efficiency factor

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.650
times the thermal conductivity
of the solid times

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:21.710
the volume fraction of the
solid or the relative density.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.323
And here, eta is an
efficiency factor.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.320
And it accounts for that
tortuosity in the foam.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.704
So if you think of
the solid in the foam,

00:18:35.704 --> 00:18:37.370
it's not like we have
little fibers that

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.203
just go from one side
to the other like this

00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:41.460
and the heat just moves
along those fibers.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.320
You know, the foam cells have
some complicated geometry

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.020
and the heat has to
kind of run along

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.390
that complicated geometry.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.040
And people have made
estimates of what this is.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.540
And it's roughly
a factor of 2/3.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.610
So I guess it would depend on
exactly the foam cell geometry.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.408
But typically it's around 2/3.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.590
So that's conduction
through a solid.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.600
That's straight forward.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.900
Conduction through gas is
similarly straightforward.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.460
It's just the
conductivity of the gas

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.220
times the amount of the gas.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.550
And the volume fraction
of the gas is just 1

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.440
minus the volume
fraction of the solid.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.805
So it's just 1 minus
the relative density.

00:19:27.805 --> 00:19:29.180
So the conduction
through the gas

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.760
is just lambda g times 1
minus the relative density.

00:20:07.822 --> 00:20:09.280
So we can do a
little example here.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.030
And you can see how
much of the conduction

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.517
comes from the solid in the gas.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:24.230
So for example, if we look at a
foam that's 2.5% dense and say

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.670
it's a closed cell poly-- what
are we doing-- polystyrene.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.380
So the total thermal
conductivity of the foam

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:50.410
is about 0.04 watts per meter k.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.640
And the thermal
conductivity of polystyrene

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:59.010
is 0.15 watts per meter k.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:07.500
And the thermal conductivity
of air is 0.025.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.900
So let's assume it's
just blown with air.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.510
And then if I just
add up, what's

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.315
the contribution of
conduction through the solid

00:21:16.315 --> 00:21:18.999
and conduction through
the gas-- so I just

00:21:18.999 --> 00:21:20.790
use those two little
equations-- conduction

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.720
through the solid--
it's going to be 2/3

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.300
of this value of lambda s times
the amount of the solids--

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:34.077
that's 0.025 and then
plus lambda g, which

00:21:34.077 --> 00:21:41.850
is 0.025 times the amount
of the gas, which is 0.975.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.360
And if I work those two
things out, this is 0.003

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:52.160
and this is 0.024.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.730
So that total is 0.027
watts per meter k.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.010
So you can see if the
total is 0.04, most of it's

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:02.800
come from the gas.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.330
A little bit's come
from the solid.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.900
And the rest is going to be
from convection and radiation.

00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:10.310
And that's typical.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.810
And that's the reason
that they sometimes

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.940
use low thermal conductivity
gases to blow foams

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.020
for thermal insulation
because the gas makes up

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.034
such a big fraction of
the total conductivity.

00:22:39.034 --> 00:22:40.450
If you can reduce
that, you reduce

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.491
the overall conductivity.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.220
So, we'll say foams for
insulation are blown

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.247
with low conductivity gases.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.350
But as I mentioned, you
have this problem with aging

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.750
that, over time, that gas
is going to diffuse out

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.090
and air is going to diffuse in.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:26.135
Then the overall thermal
conductivity of the foam

00:23:26.135 --> 00:23:27.010
is going to increase.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.190
So that's the conduction.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.580
And then the next contribution
is from convection.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:59.150
So imagine we have one
of our little cells here.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.260
And it's hotter on that side
than it is on that side.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.050
And hot air is going to rise.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.430
Cold air is going to fall.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.380
So you get a convection
current set up.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.160
And because of the
density changes,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.320
you get a buoyancy
force in the air.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.600
So that's kind of
driving the convection.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.520
But you also have
a viscous drag.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.580
So the air is moving past
the wall of the foam.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.580
And there's going to be some
viscous drag associated.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.320
And how much
convection you can get

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.740
depends on the balance
between this buoyancy force

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.815
and the viscous drag.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:44.300
So we'll say the
gas rises and falls

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.080
due to density changes
with temperature.

00:24:54.871 --> 00:24:57.850
And the density changes give
rise to buoyancy forces.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:18.490
But we also have
these viscous forces

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.590
from the drag of the air
against the walls of the cell.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.700
So air moving past
the walls-- this

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.220
is kind of a fluid mechanics
thing-- so that air is a fluid.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.340
And in fluid
mechanics, they often

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.894
use dimensionless numbers.

00:25:42.894 --> 00:25:44.310
And there's a
dimensionless number

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.524
called the Rayleigh number.

00:25:45.524 --> 00:25:47.440
And the Rayleigh number,
you can think of it--

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.570
it's not quite the balance
of the buoyancy force

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.370
against the viscous forces.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.310
But it involves those forces.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.530
And convection is important
if this Raleigh number's

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:57.215
over 1,000.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.211
And here's what the
Rayleigh number is.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.120
It's the density of the
fluid times the acceleration

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.810
of gravity times beta.

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.880
Beta's the volume
expansion coefficient

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.284
for the gas-- times
the temperature change.

00:26:34.284 --> 00:26:35.950
And we're going to
look at a temperature

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.200
change across a cell.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.480
And then, times the length.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.790
That's going to
be the cell size.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:46.730
And we divide that by
the fluid viscosity

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.380
and the thermal diffusivity.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.910
So let me write down what
all these things are.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.608
So rho is the
density of the gas.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.820
So the g's gravitational
acceleration.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.945
Beta is the volume
expansion of the gas.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.682
And for a constant
pressure that's

00:27:24.682 --> 00:27:26.015
equal to 1 over the temperature.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.460
Then delta tc is the temperature
difference across a cell.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.410
And l is the cell size.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:51.815
Mu is the dynamics
viscosity the fluid.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.270
And a is our
thermal diffusivity.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.300
So what I'm going to
do is just work out,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:16.450
for a typical example,
how big of a cell size

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.420
do you need to get this
Rayleigh number to be 1,000.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.060
And we're going to
see that, typically,

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.830
that cell size is big.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.970
It's like 20 millimeters.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.660
So in most foams,
the convection really

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.970
isn't very important at all.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.510
So it's typically-- people
don't worry about convection.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.500
And let me just show
you how that works.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.165
So for our Rayleigh
number, which

00:28:56.165 --> 00:28:59.030
is ra-- for the Rayleigh
number to be 1,000--

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.760
say we had air in the cells.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.095
And say the temperature
was room temperature.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:13.170
Then the volume coefficient
of expansion is just 1 over t.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.150
So it's 1 over 300, say.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.670
degrees k to the minus 1.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.700
Let's say our change in
temperature across one cell

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.480
was 1 degree k.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.980
Bless you.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:32.400
The viscosity of air is 2
times 10 to the minus 5,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.280
pascal seconds.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:41.850
The density of air is 1.2
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.960
And the thermal
diffusivity for air

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.840
is 2 times 10 to the minus
5 meters squared per second.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.220
And if you plug all of
these into that equation

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.470
for the Rayleigh number and
you solve for the cell size,

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:04.280
you find that the cell
size, l, is 20 millimeters.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.740
So that says convection is
only important if the cell

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.010
size is bigger than that.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.752
And so most foams have cells
much smaller than that.

00:30:23.752 --> 00:30:24.960
And convection is negligible.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.420
So I have enclosed
cells and the heat's

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.770
not transferred so easily
from one cell to another

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.230
by the gas moving.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:55.280
And by having small cells
the convection drops out.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.930
So you don't have
to worry about that.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:00.705
So the last contribution to
heat transfer is from radiation.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.830
And there's something
called Stefan's law

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:16.490
that describes the heat
flux for radiated heat

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:18.920
transfer from a surface
at one temperature

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.110
to another surface at
a different temperature

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.990
across a vacuum.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:29.350
So we can say we
have a heat flux

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:34.484
qr not from a surface
of one temperature.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:41.180
So I'm going to call that t1--
to one at a lower temperature.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:51.730
I'm going to call tnot-- with
a vacuum in between them.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:08.060
So this is [? Stefan's ?] law
so this is the radiative heat

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:13.850
flux is equal to the emissivity
of the surfaces, which

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.130
is beta 1 times
a constant called

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:21.460
Stefan's constant-- sigma
times the fourth power

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.800
of temperatures.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:32.830
I'm taking the difference
of the temperatures

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:37.874
so here are the Stefan's
Constant-- is sigma.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:48.760
And that's equal to 5.67
times the 10 to the minus 8.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:54.740
And that's in watts per meter
squared per k to the fourth.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.770
And beta is a
constant describing

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.260
the emissivity of the surfaces.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.480
So it gives the
radiant heat flux

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.244
per unit area of the sample
relative to a black body.

00:33:24.244 --> 00:33:26.160
And that's a characteristic
of the emissivity.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:33.599
All right, so then,
so if we-- yes?

00:33:33.599 --> 00:33:34.432
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:37.932 --> 00:33:39.890
PROFESSOR: Now-- so right
now, forget the foam.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:40.540
We have no foam.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.748
We just have two surfaces
with a vacuum between them.

00:33:42.748 --> 00:33:45.140
And now I'm going to stick
a foam between the surfaces.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.320
And we're going to see how
that changes the heat flux, OK?

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.680
So the next step is we put
the foam between those two

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.604
surfaces.

00:33:51.604 --> 00:33:53.270
And the heat flux is
going to be reduced

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.686
because the radiation is going
to be absorbed by the solid

00:33:55.686 --> 00:33:57.560
and reflected by the cell walls.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.040
And so we're going
to characterize

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.090
how much it's reduced.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.440
So there's another law called
Beer's Law, which characterizes

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.736
the reduction in the heat flux.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:41.480
Piece of chalk's
getting to small

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.810
OK, so Beer's Law gives us
the attenuation, so the sort

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:42.510
of reduction in the heat flow.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.990
So qr is equal to qr not.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.100
That would be the heat flux,
if we just had the vacuum.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.530
And then there's
an exponential law.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:56.630
And it's the exponential
of minus k star t star.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.050
And here, k stars in an
extinction coefficient

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.254
for the foam.

00:36:00.254 --> 00:36:02.170
Talk a little bit more
about that in a minute.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.200
and t star is just the
thickness of the foam.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.758
And then this thing
is called Beer's Law.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.120
So we have very thin
walls and struts.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.890
And we're just going to consider
optically thin walls and struts

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.070
to make life easy.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.070
Then we can say that, if
they're optically thin,

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.906
they're transparent
to radiation.

00:36:38.906 --> 00:36:40.280
They're optically
thin if they're

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.170
less than about 10 microns.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.950
Then this extinction
coefficient is just the amount

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:47.420
of solid times the extension
coefficient for the solids.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.670
So it's just the relative
density times the extinction

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:50.936
coefficient for the solid.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:25.390
OK, and then I can say,
the heat flux by radiation.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.148
I can use two equations
to write that down now.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.060
And then I'm going to
let them be equal to get

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.870
the thermal conductivity.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:44.920
I can say qr is going equal
to lambda r times dt by dx.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.800
So that's the Fourier's Law
that we started out with.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.160
And then I've also
got the qr that I'm

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.780
going to get by combining the
Stefan's Law with the Beer's

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.440
Law up there.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.130
So if I do that, I
get that qr is beta

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:09.630
1 times sigma times t1 to the
fourth minus t not the fourth.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:14.730
So that's the qr not up
there from down there.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:18.370
And then I've got an
exponential for the attenuation.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.500
And instead of k star, I'm going
to put the relative density

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.268
of times ks.

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:32.330
and then I've got the thickness
of the foam, t star, as well.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:39.900
OK, so that's qr, but that has
to equal lambda times dt by dx.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.402
So I'm going to use
some approximations.

00:38:46.402 --> 00:38:48.360
Here and I'm going to
end up with an expression

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.162
for the contribution
from radiation

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.370
to heat transfer in the foam.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:53.134
Yeah?

00:38:53.134 --> 00:38:55.300
STUDENT: So when you say
optically thin walls, where

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.050
t is less than 10
microns, you mean

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.585
like the walls of the foam?

00:38:59.585 --> 00:39:00.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yea.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.774
STUDENT: So it's
different t than the--

00:39:02.774 --> 00:39:04.190
PROFESSOR: t star
is the thickness

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.850
of the whole thing, yeah.

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.800
So imagine we had
our two surfaces.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.320
And they might be like
100 millimeters apart

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.650
or something. t star is
the sort of thickness

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:15.170
of the foam in between
the two surfaces.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:18.250
And the optically thin
is the cell walls, which

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.687
are microns kind of thickness.

00:39:21.687 --> 00:39:22.186
OK.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.840
So I'm going to make
some approximations here.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.140
And that's going to allow
me to solve for t star.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:43.060
So I'm going to
say that dt by dx

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:47.100
x is approximately
equal to just t1 minus t

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:51.570
not over the
thickness of the foam

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:58.220
or I'll call that
delta t over t star.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.440
And then, the other
approximation I'm going to use

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.420
is that t1 to the 4th
minus t not to the fourth

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:10.860
is equal to 4
times delta t times

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.240
the average temperature cubed.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:18.350
So here t bar is the average
temperature, t1 plus t

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:19.090
not over 2.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.220
So then, if I use those
two approximations,

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:52.470
I can write that qr, our heat
flux from radiative transfer.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:53.500
I got the beta 1.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.710
I've got the sigma.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:59.280
And instead of the difference
of the fourth power,

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:05.250
I'm going to write 4
delta t t bar cubed.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.675
And then I've got
my exponential.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.130
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:17.990
So then, here's the relative
density times ks times

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.780
t star, the overall thickness.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.720
That's going to equal the
radiative contribution

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.300
to the thermal
conductivity of the foam.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.230
And instead of dt
by dx, I'm going

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:34.160
to have delta t
over t star here.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.940
So part of the reason
for doing these

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:40.490
approximations I end up with
a delta t term on both sides.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.150
Now I can cancel that out.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.540
And if I just take this mess
here and multiply it by t star,

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.670
then I've got lambda r star.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:08.790
That's our thermal conductivity
contribution from radiation.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.840
So one of the things
to notice here

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:15.820
is that, as the relative
density goes down,

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.690
then the contribution
from radiation

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.802
to the thermal conductivity
of the foam goes up.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.900
OK, so this chart here
shows thermal conductivity

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.330
as a function of
relative density.

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:56.830
And it breaks down
the contributions

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:00.770
from the gas, g, the solid,
s, and the radiation, r.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.070
And you kind of see
the gas contribution

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.230
doesn't change that much.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.790
These are relative densities
between a little over 2

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.330
and a little less than 5%.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:10.570
So the amount of
gas-- it's mostly

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:14.050
gas in all of these things.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:18.670
The solid contribution increases
as the relative density

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:19.260
increases.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.670
So you'd expect that.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:26.030
And then, as I just said, as
the relative density goes down,

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:30.030
the amount of radiation
contribution goes up.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.800
And so you can kind of see
how that all fits together.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.654
Another plot that shows
the thermal conductivity

00:43:35.654 --> 00:43:36.820
versus the relative density.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.590
These are for a few
different types of foams.

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.450
You can see for
this plot here, you

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:45.067
reach a minimum in the
thermal conductivity.

00:43:45.067 --> 00:43:46.900
And that's because
you've got this trade off

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.399
between the contribution from
the solid and the contribution

00:43:49.399 --> 00:43:50.760
from the radiation.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.750
And those two kind of trade
off and you get to a minimum.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.545
So let me write
some of this down.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:03.968
So I'll just say that-- hang on.

00:44:03.968 --> 00:44:05.610
Write this over again.

00:44:13.897 --> 00:44:16.063
This is looking at the
overall thermal conductivity.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.650
And we can see the
relative contributions

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:30.180
of lambda, solid, lambda,
gas, lambda, radiation.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.942
I'll just say this
shown in the figure.

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:49.389
I'm going to say the next
figure shows a minimum

00:44:49.389 --> 00:44:50.555
in the thermal conductivity.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:45:00.630
Then I'll just say
there's a trade off

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.300
between the conduction
through the solid

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.593
and I can direction
from the radiation.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:12.640
And then we also
have a plot here

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.637
that shows the conductivity
versus the cell size.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.710
And you can see that the
conductivity increases

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:31.775
with cell size.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.960
And the reason for that is
the bigger the cells get,

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.040
the radiation is
reflected less often.

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:04.800
And one thing I wanted to
mention with the cell size

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.920
is that if you look at aerogels,
the way aerogels shells work

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.790
is that they have a very small
cell size, a very small pore

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:12.610
size.

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:15.200
So typically, it's less
than 100 nanometers.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.230
And the mean free path
of air is 68 nanometers.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:22.140
So the mean free path
is the average distance

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.400
the molecules move before they
collide with another molecule.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.130
And if your pore size is
less than the mean free path,

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.360
then that reduces the
thermal conductivity.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.200
It reduces the
ability of the atoms

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.810
to pass the heat along
between one another.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:39.310
So the way the
aerogels work is they

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:40.830
have a very small pore size.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.120
And what's important
is how big the pores

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.900
are relative to the
mean free path of air.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.790
OK, so that's the
thermal conductivity.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:09.820
I wanted to talk about a
few other thermal properties

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.205
of foams, as well, today.

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.100
So one is the specific heat.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.760
And since the specific
heat is the energy required

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.990
to raise the temperature
by a unit mass,

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:57.794
then the mass is
the same-- you know,

00:48:57.794 --> 00:48:59.210
if you have a
certain mass of foam

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:01.440
or a certain mass of solid--
the specific heat from the foam

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.481
is the same as the solid.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:36.030
So the specific
heat for the foam

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:40.080
is the same as the specific
heat for the solid.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.680
So that would have
units of joules

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.610
per kilogram per degree k.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.490
And the next property is the
thermal expansion coefficient.

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.460
And it's a similar thing.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.150
The thermal expansion
coefficient for the foam

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:07.850
is equal to the
thermal coefficient

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.840
of expansion for the solid.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.250
So imagine you have-- say you
had something like a honeycomb.

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:15.910
If you heat it up
a certain amount,

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.879
every member is going
to expand by alpha.

00:50:17.879 --> 00:50:19.420
And if every member
expands by alpha,

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.794
the whole thing
expands by alpha.

00:50:20.794 --> 00:50:22.460
And this is the same.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.090
And it's the same
idea with the foam.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:26.590
So if every member just
gets longer by alpha,

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:28.340
then the whole thing
gets bigger by alpha.

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.730
OK, so the last topic
I wanted to talk about

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.612
was the thermal
shock resistance.

00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:51.070
And thermal shock is the idea
is that if you have something

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:54.140
that's hot, and say you
quench it in a liquid--

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.220
so you put it
suddenly in a liquid--

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.630
the surface is
going to cool down

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.560
faster than the bulk of it.

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.970
And because the
surface is trying

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:02.785
to contract because
it's cooling down,

00:51:02.785 --> 00:51:05.160
but it's attached to the bulk
of it and it's constrained,

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.692
it can't really cool down,
then you generate stresses.

00:51:08.692 --> 00:51:10.150
And if the stresses
are big enough,

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.566
you can cause fracture and
have the thing crack and spall.

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:20.340
So we'll say if the
materials is subjected

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:34.880
to a sudden change in the
surface temperature, that

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.060
induces thermal
stresses at the surface

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.080
and can induce
spalling and cracking.

00:52:00.642 --> 00:52:03.100
So we're going to think about
a material at one temperature

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.570
that's dropped
into, say, a liquid

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:05.695
at a different temperature.

00:52:27.912 --> 00:52:29.370
So the surface
temperature is going

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:31.564
to drop to the cooler
liquid temperature

00:52:31.564 --> 00:52:33.480
and it's going to contract
the surface layers.

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.510
And the fact that they're bound
to the layers underneath that

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.710
are not contracting
as quickly, it

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:00.860
means that you generate
a thermal strain.

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.320
So the thermal
strain is going to be

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.904
the coefficient of thermal
expansion times the change

00:53:15.904 --> 00:53:16.528
in temperature.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.560
So you're going to
constrain the surface

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.300
to the original dimensions.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.105
And then you're going
to induce the stress.

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:23.310
So if it's a plane or
thing, it's e alpha delta t.

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.970
And then, there's a
factor of 1 minus nu,

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:29.850
just because it's a
plane, in a plane.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:31.590
And then you'll get
cracking or spalling

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.210
when that stress equals
some failure, stress.

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:47.490
So I can rearrange this and
solve for the critical delta t

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:50.580
that you can withstand
without getting cracking.

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:54.106
So I just rearranged this and
say sigma's equal to sigma f.

00:54:54.106 --> 00:55:00.600
That would be sigma f times 1
minus nu over e and over alpha.

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.450
So that's the critical
change in temperature

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:03.660
to just cause cracking.

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:15.864
So now what I can do is I can
substitute in there for what

00:55:15.864 --> 00:55:17.030
you would have for the foam.

00:55:20.294 --> 00:55:22.210
And I'm going to do it
just for the open cells

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:24.210
just because it's easier
to write the equations.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:32.230
So for the foam, I would have
some sort of fracture strength.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:34.180
So when we did the
modeling of the foams,

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:37.140
we said that was equal to
about 0.2 times the modulus

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:42.980
of rupture times the relative
density to the 3/2's power

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:46.730
and 1 minus nu.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.460
And if I divide by the
modulus of the foam,

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:54.460
that's es times the
relative density squared.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.150
And then we just had
alpha for the foam

00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:58.575
was the same as alpha s.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:03.760
So then, I can
rearrange this slightly

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:07.640
and say it's equal to 0.2
over the relative density

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.240
to the 1/2 power.

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.950
So I'm canceling out these
relative densities here.

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:17.431
And then I can combine all
the solid properties together.

00:56:17.431 --> 00:56:19.180
And I'm going to say
that nu for the solid

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.263
is about equal to the
same as nu for the foam.

00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:37.951
So what I can do here is I can
group all the solid properties

00:56:37.951 --> 00:56:38.450
together.

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:41.880
And this just is delta t
critical for the solid, right?

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:45.930
So this is saying that the
critical temperature range

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:48.890
before you get
cracking in the foam

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:52.050
is equal to the
range for the solid,

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:54.879
but multiplied by
this factor of 0.2

00:56:54.879 --> 00:56:57.170
and divided by the square
root of the relative density.

00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:58.919
So if the square of--
the relative density

00:56:58.919 --> 00:56:59.959
is going to less than 1.

00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:02.000
So this number here is
going to be bigger than 1.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.830
So it's saying that the
temperature range that

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:06.700
will give you
spalling in the foam

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.780
is going to be bigger than the
temperature range in the solid.

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:14.440
So the foam's going to be
better than the solid, OK?

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.420
And that uses our little
models from before.

00:57:21.217 --> 00:57:23.050
So I think I'm going
to stop there, probably

00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:27.030
cause my throat is
starting to get too sore.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:29.370
There's a little case
study in the notes.

00:57:29.370 --> 00:57:31.770
And I'll just put that on the
notes on the Stellar site.

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:34.130
It's like one page and it's
really straightforward.

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:36.171
You can just read that, OK?

00:57:36.171 --> 00:57:38.420
So this is the end of the
bit on thermal conductivity.

00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.530
That's just this one lecture.

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:43.200
And this is really the
end of the whole section

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.300
on modeling of the honey
combs and the foams.

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.633
So that's kind of the first
half of the term is modeling

00:57:47.633 --> 00:57:49.317
the honey combs and the foams.

00:57:49.317 --> 00:57:50.900
And the second half
of the term, we're

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.850
kind of applying those models
to different situations.

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:56.720
So next week, we'll have
the review on Monday,

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.730
have a test on Wednesday, week
after that is Spring break.

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:02.339
I can't believe we're
at Spring break already.

00:58:02.339 --> 00:58:04.630
And then after that we'll
start we'll do the trabecular

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:05.850
bone for a week.

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:08.670
We'll do tissue engineering
scaffolds and cell mechanics

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:10.490
for two or three lectures.

00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:12.830
We'll look at some
other applications

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:15.910
to engineering design, look at
energy absorption and sandwich

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:16.880
panels.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.088
And then, I'm going to talk
about plants a little bit

00:58:19.088 --> 00:58:19.970
at the very end, OK?

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:23.200
So we've already covered a
lot of the kind of deriving

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.910
equations part of the course.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.340
The rest of the course is
more applying the equations

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:29.894
to lots of different
situations, OK?

00:58:29.894 --> 00:58:32.060
So I'm going to stop there
just because my throat is

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.860
giving out.
