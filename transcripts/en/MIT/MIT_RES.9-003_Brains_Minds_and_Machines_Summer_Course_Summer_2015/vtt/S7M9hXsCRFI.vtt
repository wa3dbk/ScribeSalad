00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.600
NANCY KANWISHER: Auditory
cortex is fun to study,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.250
because very few people do it.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.930
So you study vision, you have
to read hundreds of papers

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.010
before you get off the ground.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.700
You study audition, you
can read three papers,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.574
then you get to play.

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:31.820
It's great.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.650
So there's consensus
about tonotopy,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.070
I mentioned this before.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.700
This is an inflated brain,
oriented like this top

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.840
of the temporal lobe.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.200
High, low, high frequencies.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.700
OK.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.950
That's like retinotopy, but
for primary auditory cortex.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.590
So this has been known forever.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.110
Many people have reported
it in animals and humans.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.347
Oops, we'll skip the high
and low sounds, right.

00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:52.430
So there are lots of claims
about the organization

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.790
of the rest of auditory
cortex outside that.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.070
But basically,
there's no consensus.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.670
You know, nobody knows
how it's organized.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.990
So what we set out to do, was to
take a very different approach

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.790
from everything I've
talked about so far.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.081
We said, let's kind of try
to figure out how high level

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:12.050
auditory cortex is organized.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.020
Not by coming up with one
fancy little hypothesis,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.200
and a beautifully designed
pair of contrast conditions

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.850
to test each little hypothesis.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.260
What we usually do.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.930
Let's just scan people
listening to lots of stuff,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.420
and use some data driven method
to kind of shake the data.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.610
And see what falls out.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.250
OK.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.781
To be really technical about it.

00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:31.280
OK.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.890
So when I say we, this is
really Sam Norman-Haignere

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.640
did all of this.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.890
And as this project got
more and more mathematically

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.930
sophisticated, I
got more and more

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.330
taken over by Josh McDermott,
who knows about audition.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.060
And knows a lot of fancy
math, much more than I do.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.480
They're fabulous collaborators.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.980
OK.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.146
So basically, what do we do?

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:49.700
The first thing you want to
do, especially when you're

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.270
using these data driven
methods to broadly characterize

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.530
a region of the brain,
is a major source of bias

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.050
in the structure you discover,
is the stimuli you use.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.717
So with vision, you
have a real problem.

00:02:02.717 --> 00:02:04.758
You can't just scan people
looking at everything,

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:05.840
because there's too much.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.339
Right?

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:11.142
You know, can't keep people
in the scanner for 20 hours.

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:13.100
And so, you have a problem
of how to choose it.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.010
And as your selection of
stimuli shape what you find,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.420
and it's kind of a mess.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.540
With audition, it
turns out that there's

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.120
a relatively small number
of basic level sounds

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.020
that people can recognize.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.780
So if you guys all write down--

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.940
you don't have to do this,
but just to illustrate.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.510
If you all write
down three frequently

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.640
heard sounds that are
easily recognizable,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.100
that you encounter
regularly in your life.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.030
The three sounds that you wrote
down are on our list of 165.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.120
Because, in fact, there are
not that many different sounds.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.070
And so we did this on the web.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.210
We played people sounds.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.770
And obviously depends
on the grain, right.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.103
If it's this person's voice,
versus that person's voice,

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:52.580
there are hundreds of thousands.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.600
Right.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.370
But at the grain
of person speaking,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.220
dog barking, toilet
flushing, ambulance siren.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.380
At that grain,
there's only a couple

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.580
hundred sounds that everyone
can pretty much recognize

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.190
in a two second clip, and
that they hear frequently.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.690
And that's really
lovely, because it

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.450
means we can scan subjects
listening to all of them.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.350
And we don't have
this selection bias.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.770
So we basically
tile the space of

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.730
recognizable, frequently-heard,
natural sounds.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.470
And we scan subjects
listening to all of it.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.134
OK so here are
some of our sounds.

00:03:24.134 --> 00:03:24.800

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.670
Second most common,
toilet flushing.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.635
So we pop subjects
in the scanner,

00:03:39.635 --> 00:03:41.760
and we scan them while they
listen to these sounds.

00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:50.810
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.710
OK.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.260
So we scan them while they
listen to these sounds.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.090
And then what we get is
a 165 dimensional vector

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.651
describing the response
profile for each voxel.

00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:02.150
OK.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.920
So each voxel in
the brain, we say

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.100
how strong was the response
to each of those sounds?

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.511
And we get something like this.

00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:08.260
Everybody with me?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.759
Sort of?

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.130
OK.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.670
So now what we do
is, we take all

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.300
of those voxels that are in
greater suburban auditory

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.029
cortex, which is just like
a whole big region around,

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.720
including but far beyond
primary auditory cortex.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.550
Anything in that zone
that responds to any

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.130
of these sounds, is in the net.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.530
And we take all of those, and
we put them into a huge matrix.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.030
OK.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.870
So this is now all of the
voxels from auditory cortex,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.510
in 10 different subjects.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.030
OK, 11,000 voxels.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.710
And so we've got 11,000
voxels by 165 sounds.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.450
OK.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.280
So now the cool
thing is, what we

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.730
do is, we throw away the
labels on the matrix.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.870
And just apply math.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.490
And say, what is the
dominant structure in here?

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.780
OK.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.230
And what I love about that
is, this is a way to say,

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.470
in a very,
theory-neutral way, what

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.840
are the basic dimensions
of representation

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.250
that we have in auditory cortex?

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.520
Not, can I find evidence
for my hypothesis.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.680
But, let's look broadly
and let the data

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.842
tell us what the major
structure is in there.

00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:19.090
OK.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.057
So basically what we do
is, factorise this matrix.

00:05:22.057 --> 00:05:24.640
And probably half of you would
understand this better than me.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.790
But just to describe
it, basically, we

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.400
do a-- it's not exactly
independent component analysis,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.034
but it's a version of that.

00:05:32.034 --> 00:05:33.700
Actually, multiple
versions of this that

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.230
have slightly
different constraints.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.813
Because of course,
there are many ways

00:05:36.813 --> 00:05:38.000
to factorise this matrix.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.541
It's an unconstrained
problem, so you

00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:40.860
need to bring some constraints.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.290
We'd try to bring in minimalist
ones in several different ways.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.740
It turns out, the results really
don't depend strongly on this.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.800
And so, the cool thing is that
the structure that emerges

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.740
is not based on any hypothesis
about functional profiles.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.290
Because the labels are not
even used in the analysis.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.200
And it's not based on any
assumption about the anatomy

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.850
of auditory cortex.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.440
Because the locations
of these voxels

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.400
are not known by the analysis.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.900
OK.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.150
OK so basically, the
assumption of this analysis

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.230
goes like this.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.480
Each voxel, as I
lamented earlier,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.320
is hundreds of
thousands of neurons.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.860
So the hope here is that there's
a relatively small number

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.620
of kinds of neural populations.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.680
And that, each one has a
distinctive response profile

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.320
over those 165 sounds.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.510
And that voxels have
different ratios

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.480
of the different neural
population types.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.760
OK.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.620
And so, further, we
assume that there's

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.180
this smallish number of sort
of canonical response profiles.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.770
Such that we can model
the response of each voxel

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.160
as a linear weighted sum of
some small number of components.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.280
OK.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.490
And so, the goal
then is to discover

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.700
what those components are.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.540
And the idea is that each
component is basically

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.510
the response profile and
the anatomical distribution

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.630
of some neural population.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.720
OK.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.500
So let me just do that
one other way here.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.180
So we're going to
take this matrix,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.135
and we're going to factorise
it into some set of end

00:07:20.135 --> 00:07:20.890
components.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.610
And each of those
components is going

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.350
to have 165 dimensional vector
of its response profile.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.080
OK.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.740
Each component will also
have a weight matrix

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.380
across the relevant
voxels there.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.880
OK.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.800
Telling us how
much that component

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.610
contributes to each voxel.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.110
OK.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.880
And then we use, sort of,
ICA to find these components.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.380
OK.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.796
The first thing
you do, of course,

00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:52.910
in any of these problems
is, OK, how many?

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.430
And so, actually Sam did
a beautiful analysis,

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.742
the details of which I'll skip.

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.700
Because they're complicated,
because I actually

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.020
don't remember all of them.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.360
But essentially, you can
split the data in half.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.480
Model one whole half, and
measure how much variance is

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.280
accounted for in left-out data.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.250
And what you find is that,
variance accounted for goes up

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.690
'til six components.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.990
And then goes down, because
you start over fitting, right.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.529
So we know that there are
six components in there.

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:19.070
Now, that doesn't
mean there are only

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.424
six kinds of neural populations.

00:08:20.424 --> 00:08:22.340
That's, in part, a
statement about what we can

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.474
resolve with functional MRI.

00:08:24.474 --> 00:08:25.890
But we know that
with this method,

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.070
we're looking for
six components.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.500
That's what it finds.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.169
And so, to remind
you, the cool thing

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.210
about the components that
we're going to get out,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.070
which I'll tell you
about in a second,

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.110
is that nothing
about this analysis

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.520
constrain those components.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.645
There are no assumptions
that went in there, right.

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:45.960
So if you think about
it, if all we can resolve

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.800
for the response of each
voxel to each sound is,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.887
say, high versus low.

00:08:49.887 --> 00:08:50.720
That's conservative.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.250
I think we can
resolve, you know,

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.620
a finer grain of
magnitude of response.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.570
But even if it's
just high or low,

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.241
there are 2 to the 165 possible
response profiles in here.

00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:00.740
Right.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.050
We're searching a massive space.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.580
Anything is possible.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.080
Right.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.370
And similarly, the anatomical
weight distributions

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.190
are completely
unconstrained, with respect

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.100
to whether they're
clustered, overlapping,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.590
a speckly mess, any
of those things.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.700
OK.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.806
So what did we find?

00:09:17.806 --> 00:09:18.680
I just said all this.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.670
OK, so we're looking for
the response profiles

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.880
and their distribution.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.170
OK speckly mess, right.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.430
Just said that.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.840
OK.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.280
So what we get with the response
profiles is, four of them

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.920
are things we already knew
about auditory cortex.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.870
One is high frequency
selectivity,

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.850
and one is low
frequency selectivity.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.935
That's tonotopic cortex.

00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:42.950
That's the one thing
we knew really solidly.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.600
A third thing we
find is a response

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.520
to pitch, which is
different than frequency.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.450
I'll skip the details.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.283
But we'd actually
published a paper the year

00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:51.470
before, showing that there's
a patch of cortex that

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.760
likes pitch in particular.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.551
And that, that's not
the same as frequency.

00:09:54.551 --> 00:09:57.500
And it popped out as
one of the components.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.110
A fourth one is a somewhat
controversial claim

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.589
about spectral temporal
modulation, which many people

00:10:02.589 --> 00:10:03.380
have written about.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.230
The idea that this is
somehow a useful basis

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.010
set in auditory representations.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.560
And we found what seems to
be a response that fits that.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.060
OK.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.890
So all of those are
either totally expected,

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.540
or kind of in line with
a number of prior papers.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.740
It's the last two that
are the cool ones.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.680
OK.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.521
And the numbers-- actually,
the numbers refer to--

00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:27.020
never mind.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.180
The numbers are
largely arbitrary.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.290
The numbers are for
dramatic effect, really.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.020
Component four.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:35.100
OK.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.500
So here's what one of these
last two components is.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.850
So now what we have
is, this is a magnitude

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.100
of response of that component.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.516
Remember, component
is two things.

00:10:45.516 --> 00:10:47.270
It's got this profile
here, and it's

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.440
got the distribution
over the cortex.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.460
So this is the profile
to the 165 sounds.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.340
The colors refer to different
categories of sound.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.930
We put them on
Mechanical Turk and had

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.190
people stick 1 of 10
different familiar labels.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.340
And so dark green is
English speech and light

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.120
green is foreign speech, not
understood to the subjects.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.830
This just pops right out.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.700
We didn't twiddle.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.840
We didn't fuss.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.870
We didn't look for this,
it just popped out.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.180
And light blue is singing.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.490
So this is a response to speech,
a really selective response

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.750
to speech.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.046
It's not language,
because it doesn't care

00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:27.170
if it's English or foreign.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.711
So this is not something about
representing language meaning,

00:11:29.711 --> 00:11:32.420
it's about representing
the sounds of speech that

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:37.530
are present here, and to
some extent in vocal music.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.730
Pretty amazing.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.150
Now there have been a number
of reports from functional MRI

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.850
and from intracranial
recordings,

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.850
suggesting cortical regions
selected for speech.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.359
This wasn't completely
unprecedented,

00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:51.900
although it's
certainly the strongest

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.190
evidence for specificity.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.830
You can see that in
this profile here.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.570
Right.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.550
Dark purple is the
next thing you get to

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.055
after the language
and the singing.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:05.430
So you get all the way down
before you're at dark purple.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.480
And dark purple is non-speech
human vocalizations,

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.860
stuff like laughing,
and crying, and singing.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.360
Right.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.920
Which are similar in some ways.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.430
Not exactly speech,
but it's similar.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.120
So that's damn selective.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.270
Pretty cool.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.030
Yeah?

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.095
OK.

00:12:23.095 --> 00:12:23.970
I just said all that.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.180
OK the other component is
even cooler, and here it is.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:28.770
OK.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.660
Here's the code.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:36.030
Non-vocal music and
vocal music, or singing.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.700
This is a music
selective response.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.300
This has never been
reported before.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.300
Many people have looked.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.770
We have looked, it
hasn't been found.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.680
We think that we were
able to find this music

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.170
selective response.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.130
In fact, we have
evidence that we

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.820
were able to find this
music selective response.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.710
In large part, because of the
use of this linear weighting

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.355
model.

00:13:00.355 --> 00:13:01.420
If you then--

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.990
I got to show you where these
things are in the brain.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.520
OK.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.700
Running out of time, so
I'm accelerating here.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.230
We did a bunch of
low level acoustic

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.720
controls to show that these
things really are selective.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.160
You can't account for them.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.590
They don't get the same
response if you scramble them.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.173
They really have to do with the
structure of speech and music.

00:13:16.173 --> 00:13:18.910
I'll skip all that.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:19.410
Right.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.450
So now we can take those
things, those components,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.500
and project them
back of the brain.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.880
And say, where are they?

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.660
OK.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.350
So first, let's do
the reality check.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.970
Here's tonotopic cortex mapped
in the usual hypothesis-driven

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.567
way.

00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:33.900
And now, we're going to put
outlines, just as landmarks,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.040
on the high and low frequency
parts of tonotopic cortex.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.460
And so, I mentioned before
that, one of the components

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.570
was low frequencies.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:43.440
Here it is.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.020
Perfectly aligning
with frequency mapping,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.750
that this one pops out of
the natural sound experiment,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.000
the ICA on the natural sounds.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.790
And this one is based on
hypothesis-driven mapping.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.430
So that's a nice reality check.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.650
But what about speech cortex?

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.450
Well, here it is.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:00.949
OK.

00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:05.610
So the white and black outlines
are primary auditory cortex.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.710
And you see this band of speech
selectivity right below it.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.580
Situated strategically between
auditory cortex and language

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.190
cortex, which is right
below it, actually.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.140
Not shown here, but we
know from other studies.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.470
So that's pretty cool.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.660
Here's where the music stuff is.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.760
It's anterior of
primary auditory cortex.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.920
And there's a little
bit behind it as well.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.960
OK.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.340
So we think we were able to
find the music selectivity,

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.800
when it wasn't found
before with functional MRI.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.740
Because this method
enables us to discover

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.140
selective components, even
if they overlap within

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.910
voxels with other components.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.130
Because our linear
weighting model

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.370
takes it apart and discovers
the underlying latent component,

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.140
which may be very selective.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.240
Even if, in all of
the voxels, it's

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.867
mixed in with something else.

00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:01.200
So actually, if you go in and
you look at the same data.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.560
And you say, let's
look for voxels

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.530
that are individually very music
selective, you can't really

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.296
find them.

00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:11.670
Because they overlap a little
bit with the pitch response

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.600
and with some of
the other stuff.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.770
So the standard methods
can't find the selectivity

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.540
in the way that we
can with this kind

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.000
of mathematical decomposition,
which is really thrilling.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.660
I can say one more thing,
and I'll take a question.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.530
And the final thing is, we have
recently had the opportunity

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:33.180
to reality check this stuff,
by using intracranial recording

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.040
from patients who
have electrodes right

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.400
on the surface of their brain.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.460
And we've done this
in three subjects now.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.840
And in each subject, we see--

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.000
sorry, this is hard to see.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.830
These are responses of two
different electrodes over time.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.340
So the stimulus
last two seconds.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.420
So that's 0 to 2 seconds.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.670
This is time.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.500
And this is a speech
selective electrode

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.060
responding to native speech,
foreign speech, and singing.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.650
And here is another
electrode that

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:03.100
responds to instrumental music
in purple, and singing in blue.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.320
And so what this shows is, we
can validate the selectivity.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.960
With intracranial recording,
we can see that selectivity

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.000
in individual
electrodes, that you

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.190
can't see in individual voxels.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.290
So that sort of
validates having to go

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.184
through the tunnel of math
to infer the latent selective

00:16:19.184 --> 00:16:20.100
components underneath.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.050
Because we can see
them in the raw data

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.100
in the intracranial recording.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.820
So this is cool,
because nobody even

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.920
knows why people have
music in the first place.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.220
And so the very idea that
there are, apparently,

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.170
bits of brain that
are selectively

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:39.150
engaged in processing music,
is radical, and fascinating,

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.130
and deeply puzzling.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.590
So, you know, one
of the speculations

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.200
about why we have music--

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.990
Steve Pinker famously
wrote in one of his books

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.690
that music is
auditory cheesecake.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.470
By which he meant that, music
is not like some special purpose

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.980
thing, it just pings a bunch
of preexisting mechanisms.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.620
Like, you know, fat, and
sweet, and all that stuff.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.220
Right.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.170
And so that idea is that music
kind of makes use of mechanisms

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.040
that exist for other reasons.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.109
And I think this
argues otherwise.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.084
If you have selective
brain regions,

00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:14.500
we don't know that
they're innate.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.230
They're quite possibly learned.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.829
But they sure
aren't piggybacking

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:20.760
on other mechanisms.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.190
Those regions are pretty
selective for music,

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.310
as far as we can tell.
