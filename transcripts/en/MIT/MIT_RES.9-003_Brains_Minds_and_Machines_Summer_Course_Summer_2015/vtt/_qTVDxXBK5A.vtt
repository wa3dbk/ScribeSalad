NICK CHENEY: I'm Nick Cheney.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.110
I'm finishing my PhD in
Computational Biology

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.460
at Cornell University.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.050
Gabriel Kreiman and I
are interested in seeing

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.580
how deep networks respond
to neuroplasticity.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.320
So in the brain, we know
that the brain is constantly

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.070
in flux.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.280
And neurons are
growing and dying.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.397
Weights are changing
in response to stimuli.

00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:34.480
But most of the time,
machine learning, what we do

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.150
is pre-train a network
on some training set.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.350
But then we want to use it for
real-- we freeze it and keep it

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.910
in some static form.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.150
There's been a lot more emphasis
lately on more online learning

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.970
so that you learn as you're
working on a data set.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.280
And in those kind
of environments,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.960
we think that the network
will be changing quite a bit.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.010
So we're looking at
how that network could

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.380
be robust to those
kind of changes

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.025
much like the brain is
to every day stimuli

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:03.640
and actions it sees.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.350
To start out just doing a
very simple test looking

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.460
at perturbations of the network.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.770
So just throwing random changes
at the weights that make up

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.590
this network and seeing how
that affects its ability

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.690
to classify images.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.740
After that, we're looking at how
different parts of the network

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.920
respond differently to
these kind of changes.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.340
And then, ideally, we'd like
to have some kind of rule that

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.900
doesn't affect the performance
of the network that much

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.440
and it's able to
maintain its ability

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.480
to classify throughout
seeing a number of stimuli.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.720
So we know that the brain
has certain learning

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.977
rules like Hebb's rule,
in which neurons that fire

00:01:45.977 --> 00:01:48.310
one after another end up
strengthening their connections

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.030
or conversely weakening
their reactions.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.480
Then we're soon going to see
if rules like that end up

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.900
providing stable perturbations
where the network can easily

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.810
recover and maintain
what it's doing

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.340
or unstable ones where we're
going to go down on track.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.720
Or we know that
deep networks act

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.770
similar to how the brain works.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.200
Jim De Carlo gave a
great talk about how

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.060
the features we see
in deep networks

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.860
are similar to the
features of the brain.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.214
And we know that the brain
is constantly undergoing

00:02:20.214 --> 00:02:21.130
these kind of changes.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.510
So we're curious scientifically
to see how these computer

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.010
models respond in understanding
how these two systems are

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.570
the same or different.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.050
But also from an
engineering context online

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.240
learning where the network is
changing while it's learning

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.150
is going to be, I think,
a much larger part

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.040
of the use of machine
learning going forward.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.720
So understanding how
stable these things are

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.170
to constantly changing
parameters, I think,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.870
will be quite informative
for those kind of studies.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.430
Being able to explore
new types of materials

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.490
and learn a lot about
both computer vision

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.180
and neuroscience has
been a lot of fun.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.900
And, certainly,
informative deep learning

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.820
is a very hot topic right now.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.860
So being able to dive
hands in a little bit

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.390
and get some experience working
with these models and some

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.810
of the latest software
packages, I think,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.610
will be useful
going forwards too.
