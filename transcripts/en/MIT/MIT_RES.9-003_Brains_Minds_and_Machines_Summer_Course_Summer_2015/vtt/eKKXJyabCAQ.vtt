00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.830
EERO SIMONCELLI: I'm going
to talk about a bunch of work

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.625
that we've been
doing over the last--

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:32.030
it's about four years, on
trying to understand basically,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.910
that terra incognita that
Gabrielle just mentioned

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.296
that lies between V1 and IT.

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:39.500
I brought this back with
me from the Dolomites,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.520
where I was last
week with my family.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610
And when you sit
and you look at it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.080
and that image
comes into your eyes

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.382
and gets processed
by your brain,

00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:48.840
there's a lot of
information there.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.880
It's a lot of pixels.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.770
And the question that
I'm going to start with

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.340
is, where does it go?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.590
You have all this information.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.540
It's flooding into your
eyes all day every day

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.100
for your entire lifetime.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.920
Obviously, you don't
store it all there.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.000
Your head doesn't
inflate until it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.790
gets to the point of explosion.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.930
So where does it go?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.640
And as a theorist's
diagram of the brain--

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.450
a square with rounded corners.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.520
In comes the information,
and there are really

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.760
only three options.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.640
You either act on
the information,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.000
do something with it,
sensory motor loops,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.630
or for complex organisms
especially, a fair amount of it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.280
you might actually
try to remember.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.880
You might hold on to, and we
heard about that earlier today.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.410
But this really
only accounts for, I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.720
think, a fairly
small portion of what

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.420
goes on, because a lot
of it you throw away.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.560
You have to.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.691
You really don't have a choice.

00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:40.190
You have to summarize
it, squeeze it

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.564
down to the relevant bits that
you're going to hold on to

00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:45.050
or act on, and the rest
of it you just toss.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.000
So the question is, how can
we exploit that basic fact?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.440
It's an obvious fact.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.704
It has to be true.

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:54.620
How do we exploit that
to understand something

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.912
about what the system does
and what it doesn't do?

00:01:56.912 --> 00:01:58.370
And there's a long
history to this,

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.000
and in fact, since I come from
vision and most of my work

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.450
is centered on vision and
auditory system to some extent,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.919
the vision scientists were
the first to recognize

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.000
the importance of this.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.540
And it really is a
foundational chunk

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.260
of work in the beginning
of the field that

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.330
set in motion a lot of
things that we currently

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.210
know about vision.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.210
And so I'm going to just--
for those of you that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.876
don't know that story,
I'm going to give

00:02:24.876 --> 00:02:26.450
a very, very brief
reminder of what

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.940
that is, because I
think it's an absolutely

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.430
fantastic scientific story.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.570
And then from there,
I'll talk about texture.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.500
So two examples-- I'm
going to quickly say

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.330
something about
trichomatic color vision,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.038
and then I'm going to
talk about texture,

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:44.730
and then we'll go into V2 and
metamers and other things.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.730
So trichromacy--
Newton figured out

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.300
that light comes in wavelengths.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.960
He split light with a prism.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.421
There's the picture drawing
of him splitting light coming

00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:58.670
in through a hole in the wall.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.120
He split it with a prism into
wavelengths, saw a rainbow,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.727
did a lot of
experiments to recognize

00:03:03.727 --> 00:03:05.810
that you could take that
rainbow and reassemble it

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.170
into white light, but you
couldn't further subdivide it,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.410
and basically gave
us the foundations

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.340
for thinking about light
and spectral distributions.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.740
In the 1800s, a
group of people that

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.560
were combined physicists,
mathematicians,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.852
and psychologists
all rolled into one--

00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:25.310
and there were
quite a few of them.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.006
Helmholtz was one of them.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.880
Grassmann was one of
the most important ones.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.070
I'll mention him
again in a moment--

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.800
figured out something
peculiar about human vision--

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.070
that even though there was
this huge array of colors

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.860
in the wavelengths
in the spectrum,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.350
that humans actually had these
deficits that we were not

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.490
able to actually sense
or discriminate things

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.870
that it seemed like
we should be able to.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.850
And it boiled down in
the end, after a lot

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.050
of study and discussion
and theorizing,

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.030
to this experiment, which is
known as a bipartite color

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.170
matching experiment.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.750
So on the left side of
this little display,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.860
here's a gray annulus.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.330
In the middle is a circle.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.750
On the left side of this is
light coming from some source.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.979
It has some spectral
distribution illustrated here.

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.770
This is all a cartoon,
but just to give you

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.390
the idea of how this works.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.110
On the right side are
three primary lights.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.620
And the job of the observer in
this experiment is to adjust,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.900
let's say, sliders
or knobs in order

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.030
to change the intensity
of these three lights

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.350
to make the light on the right
side of this split circle

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.230
look the same as the
light on the left side.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.300
And it turns out that--

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.340
so just to be clear,
so these three things

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.110
have their own
spectral distributions.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.540
They might look like
that, for example.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.294
And when the observer comes
up with the knob settings,

00:04:44.294 --> 00:04:45.710
they're going to
produce something

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.793
that might look like that.

00:04:46.793 --> 00:04:50.150
This is just a sum of the
three copies of these spectra

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.010
weighted by the knob settings.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.380
So this is a linear
combination of three

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.180
spectral distributions.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.956
And intentionally,
I've drawn this

00:04:57.956 --> 00:04:59.330
so that they don't
look the same,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.430
because that's the whole
point of the experiment.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.020
It turns out that humans--

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.580
you can do this experiment,
and that any human

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.130
with normal color vision
can make these settings so

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.490
that these two things are
absolutely indistinguishable.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.400
They look identical, and yet
they knew even in the mid-1800s

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.312
that these two things have
very different spectra,

00:05:19.312 --> 00:05:21.020
and I've drawn it that
way intentionally.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.860
So the point is that
humans are obviously--

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.140
even though we can see all
the bands of the spectrum,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.570
we can see all the colors--

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.400
we actually have this
deficiency in terms

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.620
of noticing the difference
between these two things.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.830
So how can that be?

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.006
And I think and hope
that most of you

00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:36.380
know the answer
to that question,

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.963
because you're using
devices every day

00:05:37.963 --> 00:05:40.490
that are exploiting this fact.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.750
But the bottom line is that in
the 1850s Grassmann laid down

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.500
a set of rules.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.552
Grassmann was a mathematician.

00:05:47.552 --> 00:05:49.760
He actually developed a
large chunk of linear algebra

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.130
in order to explain and
understand and manipulate

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.480
these ideas.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.580
And he pointed out that--

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.722
he actually had a set of
laws that he laid out,

00:05:57.722 --> 00:05:59.430
and I won't drag you
through all of that.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.730
But in the end, what
all of those laws

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.820
amounted to, taking into account
all of the evidence that he

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.770
had, he laid down these laws.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.990
And what it amounted to
is that the human being,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.890
when setting these knobs, was
acting like a linear system.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.560
The human was taking an input,
which is a wavelength spectrum,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.030
and adjusting the knobs.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.270
And the settings of the
knobs were a linear function

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.840
of the wavelength spectrum
that was coming into the eye.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.650
And it's a remarkable
and amazing fact,

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.160
if you know that the brain is
a highly non-linear device, how

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.380
is it that a human can
act like a linear device?

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.670
And the answer is that basically
the human, taking this thing in

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.440
and making the knob settings,
has a front end that's linear

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.000
and is doing a projection
of the wavelength spectrum

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.070
onto basically three axes.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.140
And those three measurements--

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.610
that process is linear.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.380
Everything that
happens after that,

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.172
which is complicated and
non-linear and involves noise

00:06:54.172 --> 00:06:56.630
and decisions and all kinds of
motor control and everything

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.410
else--

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.510
as long as the information
in those original three

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.842
measurements is not
lost, then the human

00:07:01.842 --> 00:07:03.800
is going to basically
act like a linear system,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.050
in terms of doing this matching.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.470
So Grassmann realized this.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.800
The theory that he set out and
that others then elaborated on

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.480
perfectly explained all the
data for normal human subjects,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.800
that lights that appear
identical but had physically

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.260
distinct wavelength
spectra could be created,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.130
and they called these metamers--

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.120
two things that are physically
different but look the same.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.400
This was codified.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.780
It took many, many decades.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.370
Things moved slower back then.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.240
We don't have these rapid,
Google-style overturns

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.270
of scientific establishment
within a year or two.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.120
It took until the 1930s
to actually build this

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.610
into a set of standards that
were used in the engineering

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.760
community to generate and
create color film, color

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.090
devices, eventually color
video, color monitors, color

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.820
projectors, color printers--
everything else that we use.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.440
And these specifications were
to allow the reproduction

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.190
of colors so that they
looked the way they

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.520
were supposed to look.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.554
So you record color
with a camera.

00:08:01.554 --> 00:08:04.220
It turns out that your camera is
also only recording three color

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.320
channels, just like
your eye, and then you

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.140
have to be able to re-render
that on another device.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.766
And these standards
specify how to do that.

00:08:12.766 --> 00:08:14.390
The surprising thing
in the whole story

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.920
is-- so this is 1850s.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.120
Well, we go back to Newton.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.150
It was a 1600s.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.260
Then in the 1850s, when we're
getting this beautiful theory

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.750
that's very, very
precise, this gets built

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.010
into engineering standards.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.410
And it's not until
1987 that it actually

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.644
gets verified in a
mechanistic sense.

00:08:29.644 --> 00:08:31.310
And I like to tell
this story, because I

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.100
think it's a reminder
that aiming always

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.850
for the reductionist solution is
not necessarily the right thing

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.610
to do.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.600
This is a very beautiful
piece of science

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.250
that was done at
Stanford, actually,

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.550
by Baylor, Nunn, and Schnapf.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.967
They took cones from a macaque--

00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:52.550
I think originally they worked
with turtles, but then macaque,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.862
sucked them up into a
glass micro-pipette,

00:08:54.862 --> 00:08:56.570
shined monochromatic
lights through them,

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.730
and measured their
absorption properties.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.230
And they found these
three functions

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.840
for three different types
of cones and verified,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.830
basically, that these three
absorption spectra perfectly

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.212
explained the data
from the 1800s.

00:09:09.212 --> 00:09:10.670
So this is an
amazing thing, if you

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.580
can have a theory and a set
of behavioral experiments

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.330
that make very precise and
clear predictions that then get

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.500
verified and tested
in a mechanistic sense

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.160
more than 100 years later,
and they come out basically

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.010
perfect.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.700
So it's an astounding,
astounding sequence,

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.590
in my view.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.860
So what we wanted
to do is to set out

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.740
trying to do the same kind
of thing for pattern vision.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.100
And we're going to do that
by thinking about texture.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.090
So what's a texture?

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.640
A texture is an image
that's homogeneous

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.770
with repeated structures.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.478
So each of these are
examples of texture.

00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:45.690
That's a piece of woven basket.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.609
This is tree bark.

00:09:46.609 --> 00:09:48.400
That's a herringbone
pattern, and these are

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.780
some sort of nuts or stones.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.889
And each of these
has the property

00:09:52.889 --> 00:09:55.430
that there's lots of repeated
elements with some variability.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.810
Sometimes there's
more variability,

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.268
sometimes there's
less variability,

00:09:58.268 --> 00:10:00.726
but there's usually
at least some.

00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:03.290
And of course, these
things are ubiquitous.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.320
When I started working on this,
which is about 15 years ago--

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.970
maybe a little bit
more, 16 years ago--

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.240
I started photographing things
that I saw as I walked around,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.900
and textures are everywhere.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.090
Most things are textured.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.180
The world is not
made up of plain--

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.120
of Mondrians.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.160
It's not made up of
things that are plain,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.100
blank colors separated
by sharp edges.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.730
It's made up of
textures, and often

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.190
the boundaries between things
are boundaries between things

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.890
that are textured objects, like
the seats in the auditorium,

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.410
for example.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.140
So how is it that we can go
about thinking about this

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.840
in terms of metamers and
representation in, let's say,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.990
the visual system?

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.960
And the idea really
comes from Julesz,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.210
who proposed in 1962 a famous
theory that he later abandoned.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.940
The theory goes like this.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.690
First of all, he said
the thing that we're

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.951
going to do to try to
describe textures is

00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:55.200
we're going to use statistics.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.179
And why statistics?

00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:57.970
Because these are
supposed to be variables,

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.385
so I need some stochasticity.

00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:01.260
But I also want something
that's homogeneous,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.930
so I'm going to average
or measure things averaged

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.340
across the entire image.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.760
That's the statistical
side of it.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.580
And he proposed that, well, if
I start by measuring just pixel

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.390
statistics-- say single
pixel statistics,

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.230
pairwise pixels statistics,
maybe triples of pixels,

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.740
eventually I should reach a
point where I've made enough

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.410
measurements to actually
sufficiently constrain

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.910
the texture such that any two
textures that have the same

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.470
statistics up to that--

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.370
whatever that order is, should
look the same to a human being.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.240
And he didn't talk about
this in physiological terms,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.320
but I think in the background
is the notion that humans

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.400
are actually measuring
those statistics,

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.580
and if you can get them right--
if you can make two images have

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.996
the same statistics, and that's
the only thing that humans

00:11:49.996 --> 00:11:54.190
are measuring, then those two
images will look the same.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:12:00.270
So Julesz goes ahead with
this, and eventually constructs

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.870
by hand, because
he did everything

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.980
with binary patterns
constructed by hand--

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.920
he constructs these two
examples that are identical.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.680
He first falsifies the
theory at n equals 2,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.720
and then he tries to do
third-order statistics.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.136
And he comes up with these two
examples-- counter-examples

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:15.752
to the theory.

00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:18.210
These are matched in terms of
their third-order statistics.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.067
It's not easy to see that or
realize that, but it's true.

00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:22.650
If you take triples
of pixels, and you

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.270
take the product of those
three, and you average

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.720
that over the image, these
two things are identical,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.950
but they look very different.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.260
And if you draw samples
of each of these,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.250
it's very easy to label
them as, let's say, A or B

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.110
into these two categories.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.610
Here's another
example that came out

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.110
a bit later by Jack Yellott.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.540
These two things also are
matched up to third-order.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.570
So Julesz decides that
the theory is a failure,

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.250
and he abandons it.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.700
And he begins a new theory,
which is the theory of textons,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.680
which is a much less
precisely-specified theory that

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.510
has to do with laying down--

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.180
basically, it's a generative
model, if you like.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.800
Everybody's fond of
generative models

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.260
these days, except for me.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.195
And he comes up with
a generative model--

00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:07.757
ah, and maybe Tommy.

00:13:07.757 --> 00:13:09.340
He comes up with the
generative model,

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:15.870
which is to lay down many copies
of a small, repeating unit,

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.270
which he called the texton.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.880
And so he came up with this
method of generating texture

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.160
images, which he
went to town on,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.450
and he made lots of examples.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.820
The problem is that that
wasn't a description of how

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.390
to analyze texture images or how
a human would analyze texture

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.950
images, and so it became very
difficult to bridge that gap.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.520
And I think, in my view,
that the theory really never

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.730
succeeded, and he should have
stuck with the initial theory.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.170
Anyway, but that gave
us an opportunity.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.620
So we went back
many years later--

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.070
this is around 1999.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.670
I had a fantastic
post-doc, Javier Portilla,

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.330
who came from Spain, and we
started thinking about texture

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.250
and started putting
together a model that

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.047
was Juleszian in spirit,
but a little bit different,

00:13:57.047 --> 00:13:59.130
because we wanted to build
in a little bit of what

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.510
we knew about physiology.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.035
Now, Julesz knew
about physiology,

00:14:02.035 --> 00:14:04.410
because Hubel and Wiesel were
doing all those experiments

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.930
in V1 in the late '50S
and the early '60s,

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.700
but he really didn't incorporate
that into his thinking.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.450
So what we did is build
a very simple model.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:19.200
It's just dumb, stupid,
simple, in which we took

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.200
this description of V1 neurons.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.120
So these are oriented
receptive fields.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.150
The idea is that this is a
description of a neuron that

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.670
takes a weighted
sum of the pixels

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.530
with positive and
negative lobes.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.960
And it has a
preferred orientation,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.360
because the positive
and negative lobes

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.400
have a particular
oriented structure.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.010
And then it takes the
output of that weighted sum

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.950
and runs it through some
rectifying, nonlinear function.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.360
And here's another, and
this is a classic thing

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.030
that Hubel and Wiesel
described for a simple cell.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.760
And here's another one,
which is a complex cell.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.570
And this one basically does
two of these and combines them.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.314
I'm trying to avoid
the details here,

00:14:59.314 --> 00:15:01.230
because they're not
critical for understanding

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.188
what going to show you.

00:15:04.242 --> 00:15:06.200
So then we took those
things and we said, well,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.875
what if we measure joint
statistics of those things

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:09.500
over the image?

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.652
So we're going to take
not just these filters,

00:15:11.652 --> 00:15:13.610
but of course, we're
going to do a convolution.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.443
That is, we're going
to compute the response

00:15:15.443 --> 00:15:17.600
of this weighted sum
at different positions

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.632
throughout the image.

00:15:18.632 --> 00:15:20.090
We're going to
rectify all of them.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.530
Now we're going to
take joint statistics.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.488
What do I mean by that?

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:25.820
Just correlations, basically--
second-order statistics

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.280
of the simple cells,
of the complex cells,

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.860
of the cross statistics
between them.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.620
And these statistics are
between different orientations

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.040
and different positions
and also different sizes.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.150
And given that large
set of numbers--

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.720
and typically for the images
that we worked with back then,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.720
these were typically on
the order of 700 numbers.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.500
So we have an image over here,
which is say, tens of thousands

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.160
or hundreds of thousands of
pixels, being transformed

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.360
through this box into a set
of, let's say, 700 numbers.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.980
So 700 summary statistics
to describe this pattern.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.000
And then the question is,
how do we test the model?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.900
And for testing the model--

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.210
most people, when they
test models like this,

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.530
they do classification.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.390
This should sound very
familiar these days,

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.180
with the deep network world.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.104
They take a model, and then
they run it on lots of examples.

00:16:17.104 --> 00:16:18.770
And they ask, well,
do the examples that

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.520
are supposed to be the
same kind of thing,

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.280
like the same tree bark--

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.520
do they come out with
statistics that are similar

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.470
or almost the same
as each other?

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.470
And can I classify or
group them or cluster them

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.660
and get the right answer
when trying to identify

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.710
the different examples?

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.400
We decided that that was a
very-- at least at the time,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.460
a very weak test of
this model, because this

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.470
is a high-dimensional
space, and we had only,

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.340
let's say, on the order of
hundreds of example textures.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.890
And hundreds of-- that sounds
like a lot of textures--

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.040
a couple hundred textures,
but if the outputs

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.900
live in a 700 dimensional space,
then it's basically nothing.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.850
We're not filling that space.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.059
And for those of you that
are statistically-oriented,

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:02.683
you know that there's
this thing called

00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:03.950
the curse of dimensionality.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.890
The number of data samples that
you need to fill up a space

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.540
goes up exponentially with
the number of dimensions.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.050
So this was really
bad news, and we

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.800
decided that it was
going to be a disaster

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.170
to just do classification--
that pretty

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.119
much any set of measurements
would work for classification.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:22.650
So we were looking for a more
demanding test of the model.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.630
And for that, we
turned to synthesis.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.200
So the idea is like this.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.392
So you take this image.

00:17:28.392 --> 00:17:29.600
You run it through the model.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.620
You get your responses.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.996
Now we're going to take
a patch of white noise.

00:17:33.996 --> 00:17:35.870
We're going to run it
through the same model,

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.680
and then we're going to lean
on the noise, push on it--

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.350
push on all the pixels
in that noise image

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.040
until we get the same outputs.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.330
So this is sometimes called
synthesis by analysis.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.590
This is not a generative
model, but we're using it

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.590
like a generative model.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.540
We're going to draw
samples of images

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.510
that have the same
statistics by starting

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.310
with white noise and
just pounding on it

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.480
until it looks right.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.250
And pounding on it
means, for those of you

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:09.960
that want to know, measuring
the gradients of the deviation

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.710
away from the desired
output and just moving

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.720
in the direction
of the gradient.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.800
I'm giving you the
quick version of this.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.670
A little bit more abstractly,
we can think of it this way.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.377
There's a space of
all possible images.

00:18:24.377 --> 00:18:25.460
Here's the original image.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.500
It's a point in this space.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.210
We compute the
responses of the model,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.900
which is a lower dimensional
space-- a smaller space.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.490
That's this.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.560
Because this is a many to one
mapping and it's continuous,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.980
there's actually a manifold--

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.620
a continuous a collection of
images over here, all of which

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.320
have the same exact
model responses.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.140
And what we're trying to
do is grab one of these.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.460
We want to draw a sample
from that manifold.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.930
If the theory is right-- if this
model is a good representation

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.530
of what humans see and capture
when they look at textures,

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.840
then all of these things
should look the same.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.120
That's the hypothesis.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.620
And the way we do it, again,
is to start with a noise seed--

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.060
just an image filled with noise.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.540
We project it onto the manifold.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.354
We push it onto this point.

00:19:08.354 --> 00:19:10.520
We can test that, because
we can, of course, measure

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.830
the same things on this
image and make sure

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.840
that they're the
same as this image,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.800
and that's our
synthesized image.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.240
So that's a abstract
picture of what I told you

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.810
on the previous slide.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.010
And then finally, the
scientific or experimental logic

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.890
is to test this by showing
it to a human observer.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.900
So we have the original
image, and then

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.340
we compute the model responses.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.950
We generate a new image,
and we ask the human,

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.225
do these look the same?

00:19:35.225 --> 00:19:37.100
And if the model captures
the same properties

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.869
as the visual system,
then two images

00:19:40.869 --> 00:19:42.410
with identical model
responses should

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.700
appear identical to a human.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.240
So that's the logic.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.850
And any strong failure
of this indicates

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.250
that the model is insufficient
to capture what is

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.500
important about these images.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.800
So it works, or I wouldn't
be telling you about it.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.400
Here is just a few examples.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.230
There are hundreds
more on the web page

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.520
that describes this work.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.260
On the top are
original photographs--

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.430
lizard skin, plaster
of some sort, beans.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.960
On the bottom are synthesized
versions of these.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.380
The lizard skin
works really well.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.850
The plaster works quite well.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.490
The beans a little less so.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.169
And it depends-- whether it
works well or not depends

00:20:20.169 --> 00:20:21.210
on the viewing condition.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.814
So if you flash
these up quickly,

00:20:22.814 --> 00:20:25.230
people might be convinced that
they all look really great.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.063
If you allow them to
inspect them carefully,

00:20:27.063 --> 00:20:30.450
they can start to see deviations
or funny little artifacts.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.410
So it's a partial success.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.600
And I should point
out that it also

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.320
provides a pretty convincing
success on Julesz'

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.730
counter-examples.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:42.900
So these are examples.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.820
This is synthesized
from that, and this

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.680
is synthesized from that, and
they're easily classifiable.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.040
And there's fun things
you can do with this.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.130
You can fill in
regions around images.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.019
So if you take this
little chunk of text here

00:20:58.019 --> 00:21:00.060
and you measure the
statistics, and you say, fill

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.460
in the stuff around
it with something

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.170
with has the same
statistics, but try

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.810
to do a careful job of
matching up at the boundaries,

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.280
you can create things like this.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.946
So you can read the
words in the center,

00:21:09.946 --> 00:21:12.104
but the outside
looks like gibberish.

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.020
Each one of these was
created in the same way.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.228
So the center of each of
these is the original image,

00:21:16.228 --> 00:21:17.970
and what's around
it is synthesized.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.070
So it works reasonably well.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.630
You can also do fun
things like this.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.846
So these are examples where--

00:21:23.846 --> 00:21:25.470
I told you we started
from white noise,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.011
and then pushed it
onto the manifold,

00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:29.170
but we can actually
start from any image.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.780
So if we start
from these images--

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.030
these are three of
my collaborators--

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.000
two of my students and my
collaborator Tony Movshon.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.529
If we start with those
as starting point images,

00:21:38.529 --> 00:21:40.320
and we use these textures
for each of them,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.236
we arrive at these images,
where you can still

00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:44.280
see some of the global
structure of the face.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.710
Because the model is
a homogeneous model,

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.800
it doesn't impose anything
on global structure.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.300
And so if you seed
it with something

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.760
that has particular global
structure or arrangement,

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.320
it will inherit some of that.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.260
It'll hold onto it.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.260
Anyway, this is just for fun.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.230
Let's get back to science.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.860
So now, here's an example
of Richard Feynman.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.870
This is Richard Feynman after
he's gone through the blender.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:12.190
You can see pieces of skin-like
things and folds and flaps,

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.070
but it's all disorganized.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.600
Again it's a homogeneous model.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.849
It doesn't know anything
about the global organization

00:22:17.849 --> 00:22:18.780
of this photograph.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.520
But what we want to know is--

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.410
so do we have a
model that's just

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.896
a model for the perception
of homogeneous textures,

00:22:24.896 --> 00:22:26.520
or can we actually
push it a little bit

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.950
and make it, first of all,
a little more physiological,

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.280
and second of all, maybe
a little bit more relevant

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.390
for everyday vision?

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.830
For me, standing here and
looking at this scene,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.390
how do I go about
describing something

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.850
like this that's going on when
I'm looking at a normal scene?

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.480
So let's go through thinking
about how to do this.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.020
So I'm going to jump right
to this diagram of the brain

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:50.520
again.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.180
So V1 is in the
back of the brain.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.230
The information that
comes into your eyes

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.840
goes through the retina,
the LGN, back to V1.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.240
And then it splits into these
two branches, the dorsal

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.270
and the ventral stream.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.800
The ventral stream is usually
associated with spatial form

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.102
and recognition and memory.

00:23:06.102 --> 00:23:08.060
So I'm going to think
about the ventral stream,

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.560
and we're going to
try to understand

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.260
what this model might have
to say about processing

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.265
in the ventral stream.

00:23:13.265 --> 00:23:15.390
I'm going to rely on just
a few simple assumptions.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.690
First, that each of
these areas has neurons,

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.490
and that they respond
to small contents

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.614
or regions of the visual input.

00:23:22.614 --> 00:23:24.030
They're known as
receptive fields.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.560
Most of you know that.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.600
In each visual area,
I'm going to assume

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.310
that those receptive
fields are covering,

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.320
blanketing the
entire visual field.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.600
So there's no dead spots.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.160
There's no spots
that are left out.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.430
Everything is covered nicely.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.052
And in fact, we know that
this is true, for example,

00:23:40.052 --> 00:23:41.010
starting in the retina.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:46.890
So this is a cartoon diagram
to illustrate the inhomogeneity

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.210
that's found in the retina.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.540
So the receptive field
sizes in the retina

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.030
grow with eccentricity.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.030
And it turns out that
that starts in the retina,

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.160
but that's true,
actually, all the way

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.659
through the visual system and
throughout the ventral stream,

00:23:58.659 --> 00:23:59.820
in particular.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.630
And this diagram is showing
these little circles are

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:08.130
about 10 times the size of
your midget ganglion cell

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.170
receptive fields in your retina.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.110
So you looking-- if
you fixate right here

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.730
in the center of
this, these things

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.190
are about 10 times the size
of your receptive fields.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.920
And that's been
long thought to be

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.260
the primary driver of
your limits on acuity,

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.460
in terms of peripheral vision.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.520
So in particular,
if you take this eye

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.610
chart, which is modified by--

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.190
this was done by Richard
Anstis back in the '70s,

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.320
and you lay it out
in this fashion,

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.690
these things are about
10 times the threshold

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.067
for visibility and
recognition of these letters.

00:24:42.067 --> 00:24:44.400
And so you can say that the
stroke widths of the letters

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.790
are about matched to the
size of these ganglion cells,

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.060
and it works, at least
qualitatively-- that things

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.320
are scaling in the right
way, in terms of acuity,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.270
and in terms of the size
that the letters need to be

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.020
for you to recognize them.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.230
And you can make
pictures like this.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:09.950
This is after Bill Geisler, who
showed that if you foveate--

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.602
if you fixate here,
in fact, you can't

00:25:12.602 --> 00:25:14.060
see the details of
the stuff that's

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.790
far from your fixation
point, and if you blur it,

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.830
people don't notice.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.296
You can actually add high
frequency noise to it,

00:25:21.296 --> 00:25:23.420
alternatively, and people
won't notice that either.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.090
Because those receptive fields
are getting larger and larger,

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.230
and you're basically
blurring out

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.396
the information that would
allow you to distinguish,

00:25:29.396 --> 00:25:30.862
let's say, these two things.

00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.570
When you look right
at it you can see it,

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:37.580
but if you keep your eye fixated
here, you won't notice it.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.644
So let's work off
of those ideas--

00:25:39.644 --> 00:25:41.060
the idea of these
receptive fields

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.570
that are getting larger with
eccentricity, that are covering

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:45.590
the entire visual field.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.170
And let's notice the following--
so this is data taken--

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.730
physiological data
from several papers

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.480
that were assembled
by Jeremy Freeman, who

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.160
was a grad student in my lab.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.370
And here you can see the
center of the receptor fields

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.741
versus the size of
the receptive fields.

00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:02.240
And you can see
that in the retina--

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.990
I already showed you
on the previous slide

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.250
that it grows with eccentricity,
but it's actually very slow

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.110
compared to what
happens in the cortex.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.140
V1, the receptor fields
grow at a pretty good clip.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.380
V2, they grow about twice as
fast as that, and V4 twice

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.610
as fast again.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.460
Another way of saying this--
at any given receptive field

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.030
location relative to the fovea--

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:25.010
let's say 15 degrees, the
receptive fields in V1

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.355
are of a given size.

00:26:28.355 --> 00:26:33.020
It's on the order of
0.2 to 0.25 times.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.410
The diameter is 0.2 to 0.25
times the eccentricity.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.140
The receptive fields
in V2 are twice

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:44.090
that size, so about 0.45
times the eccentricity,

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.260
and the receptive fields
in V4 are twice that again.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.250
In cartoon form, it looks
something like this.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.440
So here's V1.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.190
Lots of cells and
small-ish receptive

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.810
fields growing
with eccentricity.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.070
Here's V2.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.820
They're bigger.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.000
They grow faster.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.590
Here's V4.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.180
And by the time you get to IT--

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.960
Jim DiCarlo was here
a bunch of days ago,

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.543
and he probably told
you this-- almost

00:27:05.543 --> 00:27:09.380
every IT cell includes the fovea
as part of its receptive field.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.850
They're very large,
and they often

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.396
cover half the visual field.

00:27:14.396 --> 00:27:15.770
So now we have to
figure out what

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.390
to put inside of
these little circles

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:18.950
in order to make
a model, and I'm

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.170
going to basically combine--

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.690
smash together the texture
model that I told you about,

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:29.570
which was a global homogeneous
model, with this receptive

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.260
field model.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.450
I'm going to basically stick
a little texture model in each

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.500
of these little circles.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.030
That's the concept.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:35.920
So how do we do that?

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.450
Well, we're going to go
back to Hubel and Wiesel.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:38.908
Hubel and Wiesel
were the ones that

00:27:38.908 --> 00:27:43.460
said you make V1 receptive field
simple cells out of LGN cells

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.920
by just taking a bunch of
LGN cells that line up.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.700
Here they are-- center surround
receptive fields from the LGN,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.490
which are coming
off of the center

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:53.690
surround architecture
of the retina.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.430
You line them up, you
add them together,

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.971
and that gives you an oriented
receptive field, like the ones

00:27:57.971 --> 00:27:59.240
that I showed you earlier.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.884
And in more of a
computational diagram,

00:28:01.884 --> 00:28:03.050
you might draw it like this.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.837
So here's an array of
LGN inputs coming in.

00:28:05.837 --> 00:28:07.670
We're going to take a
weighted sum of those.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.010
Black is negative.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:09.890
White is positive.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.170
So we add up these three
guys, we subtract the two

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.530
guys on either side,
and then we run that

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.920
through a rectifying
nonlinearity

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.185
that's a simple cell.

00:28:17.185 --> 00:28:19.310
Hubel and Wiesel
also pointed out

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.780
that you could maybe create--

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.940
or suggested that you
create complex cells

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.500
by combining simple cells.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.920
This is the diagram from
their paper in 1962.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.406
And so we can diagram
that like this.

00:28:30.406 --> 00:28:32.280
Here's basically three
of these simple cells.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.160
They're displaced in
position, but they

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.520
have the same orientation.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.820
We halfway rectify all of
them, add them together,

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.580
and that gives us
a complex cell.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.700
So it's interesting to
note that the hook here

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.150
is going to be that this
is an average of these.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.080
An average is a statistic.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.490
It's a local average.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.460
So we're going to
compute local averages,

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.070
and we're going to call those
statistics-- i.e. statistics,

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:58.130
as in used in the texture model.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.000
So let's do that.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.070
So here's the V2
receptive field.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.060
Open that up.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.150
Inside of that is a bunch
of V1 cells, here all shown

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:06.270
at the same orientation.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.510
In reality, they would be
all different orientations

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:09.412
and different sizes.

00:29:09.412 --> 00:29:11.870
And now we're going to compute
those joint statistics, just

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.120
like I did in the
texture model, and that's

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.770
going to give us our responses.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.990
We're going to have to do that
for each one of these receptive

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.489
fields.

00:29:18.489 --> 00:29:19.910
So there's a lot of these.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.710
It's not 700 numbers anymore.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.760
It's reduced, because it's--

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.310
so there's details here.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.380
It's reduced, but there's
a lot of these, so it's

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.200
quite a lot of parameters.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.240
And these local
correlations that I told you

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.090
we were going to compute here
can be re-expressed, actually,

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:38.540
in a form that looks just like
the simple and complex cell

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.180
calculations that I
showed you for V1.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.070
So in fact, if you
take these V1 cells,

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.380
and you take weighted
sums of these guys,

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.570
and you half-wave rectify
them and add them,

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.070
you get something
that's essentially

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.610
equivalent to the texture
model that I told you about.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.170
So that's pretty
cool, because it

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:58.430
means that the calculations
that are taking us from the LGN

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:05.310
input to V1 outputs have a
form, a structure which is then

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.500
repeated when we get to V2.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.320
We do the same kind of
calculations-- linear filters,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.780
rectification,
pooling or averaging.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.430
And so that, of
course, has become

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.940
ubiquitous with the advent of
all the deep network stuff.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.030
But the idea here is
that we can actually

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.790
do this kind of canonical
computation again and again

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.620
and again and produce
something that

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.260
replicates the
loss of information

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.470
and the extraction of
features or parameters

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.760
that the human visual
system is performing.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.240
So this canonical idea,
I think, is important,

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.850
and it's something that
we've been thinking

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.300
about for a long time--

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.350
linear filtering that
determines pattern selectivity,

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:44.936
some sort of rectifying
non-linearity,

00:30:44.936 --> 00:30:45.810
some sort of pooling.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.835
And we usually also include
some sort of local gain control,

00:30:48.835 --> 00:30:51.210
which seems to be ubiquitous
throughout the visual system

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:55.770
and the auditory system in
every stage, and noise, as well.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.590
And we're currently, in my lab,
working on lots of models that

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.410
are trying to incorporate all
of these things in stacked

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.840
networks-- small numbers of
layers, not deep-- shallow,

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.150
shallow networks for us--

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.150
in order to try to
understand their implications

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.400
for perception and physiology.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.060
This was just a description
of a single stage,

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.922
and then, of course,
you have to stack them.

00:31:16.922 --> 00:31:19.380
And there are many people that
have talked about that idea.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:24.300
This is a figure from Tommy's
paper with Christof, I think--

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.620
1999.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.010
And Fukushima had proposed
a basic architecture

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.530
like this earlier.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.810
And so I think this
has now become--

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.510
you barely even need to say
it, because of the deep network

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.820
literature.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.260
So how do we do this?

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.610
Same thing I told you before.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.460
Take an image, plop down all
these V2 receptive fields.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.620
By the way, I should have
said this at the outset--

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.010
this is drawn as a cartoon.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.480
The actual receptive
fields that we

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.230
use are smooth and overlapping,
so that there are no holes.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.630
And in fact, the
details of that are

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.130
that since we're
computing averages,

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.921
you can think of this
as a low pass filter,

00:32:00.921 --> 00:32:03.330
and we try to at least
approximately obey the Nyquist

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.640
theorem, so that
there's no aliasing--

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.530
that is, there's no
evidence of the sampling

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:13.170
lattice, for those of you that
are thinking down those lines.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.019
If you were not thinking
down those lines,

00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:16.560
I'll just say the
simple thing, which

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.260
is that they're not little
disks that are non-overlapping,

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.510
because then we would be
screwing everything up in

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.700
between them.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.270
They're smooth
and overlapping so

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.853
that we cover the whole image,
and all the pixels in the image

00:32:26.853 --> 00:32:28.944
are going to be affected
by this process.

00:32:28.944 --> 00:32:30.360
So we make all
those measurements.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.070
It's a very large
set of measurements.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:36.160
And now we start with white
noise, and we push the button.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.910
And again, push simultaneously
on the gradients

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.370
from all those little regions
until we achieve something

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.200
that matches all the
measurements in all

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.864
of those receptive fields.

00:32:44.864 --> 00:32:46.530
The measurements in
the receptive fields

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.280
are averaged over
different regions.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.910
So the ones that are
in the far periphery

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:57.360
are averaged over large
regions, and so those averages

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.730
are throwing away a
lot more information.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.980
The ones that are
averaged near the fovea

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.020
are throwing away a small
amount of information.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.370
When you get close
enough to the fovea,

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:06.840
they're throwing away nothing.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.284
So the original image is
preserved in the center,

00:33:09.284 --> 00:33:10.950
and then it gets more
and more distorted

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.720
as you go away from the fovea.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.980
So the question is, does
that work for a human?

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.240
Is it metameric?

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.864
The display here
is not very good,

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:21.780
but I'll try to give you
a demonstration of it

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.310
to convince you
that it does work.

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.020
You have to keep your
eyes planted here,

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.520
and I'm going to
flip back and forth

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.230
between this original
picture, which

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:32.250
was taken in Washington Square
Park, near the department.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.400
And I'm going to flip between
this and a synthesized version.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.540
You have to keep your eyes here,
at least for a bunch of flips.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.710
Hello.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.100
Here we go.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.627
Keep your eyes fixated.

00:33:43.627 --> 00:33:45.210
Those two images
should look the same.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.600
It's going back and forth,
A, B, A, B, and they

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.570
should look the same.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.820
I think for most of you, and
for most of these viewing

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.029
distances, it should work.

00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:54.570
And now if you look
over here, you'll

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.340
see that they actually
are not the same.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.020
That's about the size
of a V2 receptive field,

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.980
and it is the same two images.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.690
I'm not cheating here, in
case anybody's worried.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.510
I'm just flipping back and forth
between the same two images.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.739
And you can see that
the original image has

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:12.480
a couple of faces
in that circle,

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.110
but the synthesized one,
they're all distorted,

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:20.130
the same way Feynman was when
I showed you his photograph.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:24.570
But again, the point here is
that these two are not metamers

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.969
when you look right at
this peripheral region,

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:29.531
but when you keep your
eyes fixated here,

00:34:29.531 --> 00:34:30.989
they're pretty hard
to distinguish.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:33.330
This is right at about the
threshold for the subjects

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:37.320
that we ran in this
experiment, so it should be

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.690
basically imperceptible to you.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.580
That was a demo,
just to convince you

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.480
that it seems to work.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.360
We did an experiment,
because we wanted

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.594
to do more than just show
that it sort of works.

00:34:48.594 --> 00:34:51.300
We wanted to figure out whether
we could actually tie it

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.650
to the physiology in
a more direct way,

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.000
so what we did is
we generated stimuli

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.160
where we used different
receptive field size scaling.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:01.960
So this is a plot.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.820
Along this axis is going to be--

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.710
just to get you
situated, along this axis

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.590
is going to be
models that are used

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:11.371
to generate stimuli with
different receptive field size

00:35:11.371 --> 00:35:11.870
scaling.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.295
That's the ratio of diameter
to eccentricity-- diameter

00:35:14.295 --> 00:35:16.420
of the receptive field to
the eccentricity distance

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.560
from the fovea.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.200
And along here is going
to be the percent correct

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:26.020
that a human is able
to correctly identify--

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.809
the way we did this, it's
called an ABX experiment.

00:35:28.809 --> 00:35:30.850
So we show one image, then
we show another image,

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:31.974
then we show a third image.

00:35:31.974 --> 00:35:36.760
And we say, which image does
the third one look like?

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.060
So we're going to plot
percent correct here.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:44.790
And if we use a model with
very small receptive fields,

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.540
then we get syntheses
that look like this.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.030
This one has very
little distortion.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.330
There's a little bit
of distortion around

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.580
near the edges, but it's
pretty close to the original.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.200
If we use really
big receptor fields,

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.550
then we get a lot of distortion.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.590
Things really start
to fall apart.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.550
And somewhere in between--

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:00.250
so far to the
right on this plot,

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:05.530
we expect people to be at
100% noticing the distortions,

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.940
and far to the
left on this plot,

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.632
we expect them to be at chance.

00:36:09.632 --> 00:36:11.840
We expect them to not be
able to tell the difference.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.173
And that's exactly what happens.

00:36:13.173 --> 00:36:15.640
This is an average
over four observers.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.830
And you can see that the
performance, the percent

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:20.380
correct starts at
around 50%, and then

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.420
climbs up and asymptotes.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.360
So what's more, we
can now do something--

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.820
this is a little bit complicated
to get your head around.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.390
We're using this model
to generate the stimuli,

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.120
and this is the model parameter
plotted along this axis.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.610
Now we're going to
use the model again,

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:38.110
but now we're going
to use the model

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.820
as a model for the observer.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.320
So there's two models here.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.670
One is generating the stimuli.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:45.100
The other one, we're
going to try to fit--

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.920
we're going to ask, if we used
a second copy of the model

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.930
to actually look at
these images and tell

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.670
the difference
between them, what

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:55.180
would its receptive
fields have to be in order

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.780
to match the human data?

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.040
And I'm not going to drag
you through the details,

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.370
but the basic idea is
that allows us to produce

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:06.220
a prediction-- this black line--

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.170
for how this model
would behave if it

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.330
were acting as an observer.

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:13.630
And by adjusting the parameter
of the observer model,

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:17.120
we can estimate the size of
the human receptive fields.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.726
So the end result
of all of this is

00:37:18.726 --> 00:37:20.350
we're going to fit
a curve to the data,

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.060
and it's going to
give us an estimate

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.650
of the size of the
receptive fields

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:26.350
that the human is
using to do this task.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.150
And that is right here.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.800
In fact, it's right
at the place where

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.644
the curve hits the 50% line.

00:37:32.644 --> 00:37:35.060
That's the point where the
human can't tell the difference

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.120
anymore, and that's
the point where

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.610
we think an observer would be--

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:42.970
where the receptive
fields of the stimulus

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.770
would be the same
size as the receptive

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:45.970
fields of the observer.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.449
So that's what
we're looking for.

00:37:47.449 --> 00:37:49.240
And when we do that
for our four observers,

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.860
they come out very consistent.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.490
So here's a plot of the
estimated receptive field

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.680
sizes of these observers.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.430
All four of them--

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:00.040
1, 2, 3, 4, and the
average over the four.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.070
And nicely enough-- remember, I
told you that we know something

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.230
about the receptive
field sizes in--

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.790
these are macaque monkey.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.770
And if we plot those
on the same plot,

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:11.480
these color bands are the
size of the receptive fields

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.456
in a macaque, now combined
over this large set of data

00:38:15.456 --> 00:38:17.080
from a whole bunch
of different papers.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.319
Jeremy went through
incredibly painstaking work

00:38:19.319 --> 00:38:21.610
to try to put these all into
the same coordinate system

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.620
and unify the data sets.

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.770
And so the height of each
of these bars tells you--

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:30.010
they're error bars on how much
variability there is, where

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.210
we think the estimates are.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.168
And you can see that the
answers for the humans

00:38:33.168 --> 00:38:35.980
are coming right
down on top of V2.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.160
So we really do think
that the information that

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.550
is being lost in these
stimuli is being lost in V2,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.190
and it seems to match the
receptive field sizes at least

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.350
of macaque monkey.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.980
We were worried that this might
depend a lot on the details

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.540
of the experiment.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.999
So for example,
we thought, well,

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:57.040
what if we give people a
little more information?

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.800
For example, what if we let them
look at the stimulus longer?

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.410
So the original experiment
was pretty brief--

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.400
200 milliseconds.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.630
What if we give them
400 milliseconds?

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:09.430
And so up here are plots
for the same four subjects.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:13.024
The original task
is in the dark gray,

00:39:13.024 --> 00:39:15.190
and you can see the curves
for each of the subjects.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.010
When we give them more
time, what you notice

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.080
is that, in general,
they do better.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.900
So generally, the
light gray curves--

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.410
1, 2, 3-- are above
the dark gray curves.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.490
They get higher percent correct.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.730
But the important thing is
that each of these curves

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:34.400
dives down and hits the 50%
point at the same place.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.060
In other words, what we
interpret this to mean

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:41.230
is that the estimate of
the receptive field sizes

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:45.070
is an architectural
constraint, and we

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.070
can estimate the same
architectural constraint

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.920
under both of these conditions,
even though performance

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.560
is noticeably different, at
least for these three subjects.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.350
This one, it's really quite
a big, big improvement.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.120
This subject is doing
much, much better

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.260
on the task when we
give them more time.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.290
And yet, this estimate
of receptive field sizes

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.060
is pretty stable,
so we thought this

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.220
was a pretty important control.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.180
And down below is
another control.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.400
That was a bottom-up control.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.770
This is a top-down control.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:14.270
People have talked
about attention

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.580
being very important
in peripheral tasks,

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.300
so we now gave the subjects
an attentional cue--

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.790
a little arrow at the
center of the display that

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.190
pointed toward the
region of the periphery

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:28.350
where the distortion was largest
in a mean-squared error sense.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.190
So we measure little chunks
of the peripheral image

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:34.070
and look for the place where
there's the biggest difference,

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.380
and we tell them
to pay attention

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.670
to that part of the stimulus.

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:38.720
They're not allowed
to move their eyes.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.530
We have an eye tracker
on them the whole time,

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:41.960
so they're not
allowed to look at it.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.270
But we're telling them, try
to pay attention to what's,

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.500
let's say, in the upper left.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.500
And again, the result
is quite similar.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.179
Their performance improves
noticeably, at least

00:40:51.179 --> 00:40:52.220
for these three subjects.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.070
This one, again, is the
most dramatic performance

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:55.610
improvement.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:56.690
Nobody gets worse.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.600
This subject basically
stayed about the same.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.820
But again, the estimates
of receptive field size

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:02.790
are quite stable.

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.960
So our interpretation
is attention

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.920
is boosting the signal,
if there is a signal, that

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.670
allows them to do the task.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:14.720
But if they're at chance
and there's no signal,

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.380
attention does nothing, which
is why that when you get to 50%,

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.870
all these points coalesce.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:24.260
All the curves are hitting
50% at the same place.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.750
One last control-- we
wanted to convince ourselves

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.970
that really it was V2,
and it wasn't just luck

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:32.060
that we happened to get that
receptive field size that

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.630
matched the macaque data.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:35.540
So we did a control
experiment where we tried

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.610
to get the same result for V1.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.570
So this time, we just measure
local oriented receptive fields

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:45.860
like Hubel and Wiesel
described, and we average them

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.950
as in a complex cell over
different sized regions.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:50.630
And we generate
stimuli that are just

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:54.067
matched for the average
responses of the V1 cells.

00:41:54.067 --> 00:41:56.150
We don't do all the
statistics on top of that that

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.920
represents the V2 calculation.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.310
We're just doing
average V1 responses.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.450
When we do that--

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.760
we generate the stimuli,
we do the same experiment,

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.280
we get a very different
result in light gray here.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.202
So you can see that
these curves are always

00:42:09.202 --> 00:42:10.910
higher than the other
ones, but they also

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:15.350
hit the axis at a much,
much smaller value,

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:18.590
usually by about a factor
of two, which is just right,

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.100
given what I told you before
about receptive field sizes.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.020
So if we go back and we combine
all the data on one plot--

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.910
down here are the V1 controls.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.160
They're about the
right size for V1.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.759
And up here is the original
experiment and the two controls

00:42:31.759 --> 00:42:33.800
that I told you about--
the extended presentation

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.650
and the directed attention,
and those are all pretty much

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.510
lying in the range of V2.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.090
We think this has a pretty
strong implication for reading

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:42.140
speed.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.180
When you read, your eyes
hop across the page.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.890
You do not scan continuously.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:46.970
You hop.

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:48.500
And when you hop,
here's an example

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.458
of the kind of hops you
do when you're reading.

00:42:50.458 --> 00:42:53.300
There's an eye position,
and the typical hop distance

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.710
would be about that--

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:55.730
from here to there.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.320
This is the same piece of text.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.980
We've synthesized it as a
metamer using this model, just

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.770
to illustrate the idea
that the chunk of stuff

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.290
that you can read around
that fixation point,

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.520
it's about right.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.630
It matches what you
would expect for the kind

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:12.980
of hopping that you could do.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:17.450
Your reading speed is limited
by the distance of those hops,

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.220
and the distance of
those hops is limited

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.700
by this loss of information.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.192
So you can't read anything
beyond maybe this I and this N.

00:43:26.192 --> 00:43:28.400
And in order to read it,
you hop your eyes over here,

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.960
and now you get
most of this word.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.420
You can make out the rest
of an "involuntarily."

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.060
So there's an interesting
implication here,

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.190
which is that you
can potentially

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:43.160
increase reading speed by
using this model to optimize

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.726
the presentation of text.

00:43:44.726 --> 00:43:46.850
And now that we can do
these things electronically,

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.590
you can imagine all
kinds of devices

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:51.754
where the word spacing
and the line spacing

00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:53.420
and the letter sizes
and everything else

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.244
could change with time and
position on the display.

00:43:57.244 --> 00:43:58.910
So you don't have to
just put things out

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.010
as static arrays of characters.

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:04.321
You could now imagine jumping
things around and rescaling

00:44:04.321 --> 00:44:04.820
things.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.700
You could imagine
designing new fonts that

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.640
caused less distortion or loss
of information, et cetera.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.510
So this is just going back
to the trichromacy story

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:15.470
that I told you.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.884
I told you that once they
figured out the theory,

00:44:17.884 --> 00:44:19.550
and they had all the
psychophysics down,

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.950
the next thing that happened
is all that engineering.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.616
They came up with
engineering standards,

00:44:23.616 --> 00:44:27.690
and they used it to design
devices and specify protocols

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:30.110
for transmitting images,
for communicating them,

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.520
for rendering them.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.340
I think that this has
that kind of potential.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.620
And this theory is
too crude right now,

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:39.800
but if you had a really solid
theory for what information

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.190
survived in the
periphery, you can really

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:48.050
start to push hard on
designing devices and designing

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:52.659
specifications for devices
for improved whatever.

00:44:52.659 --> 00:44:54.200
Sometimes you want
to improve things.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.866
Sometimes you want
to make things harder

00:44:55.866 --> 00:44:57.920
to see, like in this example.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.257
So you want to build camouflage.

00:44:59.257 --> 00:45:01.840
You go in, you take a bunch of
photographs of the environment,

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.730
and then you say, let's
design a camouflage

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:08.200
that best hides itself
when it's not seen directly

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.260
within this environment.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.390
So you could use these
kinds of loss of information

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:15.820
to exploit things
or to aid things

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:19.450
in terms of human perception.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.460
So let me say just a
few things about V2,

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.470
and then maybe I should stop.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:28.270
So this work that
Jeremy and I did

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:30.220
in building this model
for metamers, which

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.350
is a global version
of the texture model

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:35.260
that operates in
local regions, led

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:39.040
us to start asking
questions about what

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.160
we could learn by actually
measuring cells in V2.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.260
And we joined forces
with Tony Movshon,

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.240
who is the chair
of my department

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.400
and a longtime
collaborator and friend.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.830
And we started a
series of experiments

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:55.894
to try to explore presentations
of texture to V2 neurons

00:45:55.894 --> 00:45:57.310
to try to understand
what we could

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:01.030
learn about the actual
representations of V2.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.840
And these are all done
in macaque monkey.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.565
And I should also
mention that V2 is--

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.500
it's been studied
for a long time.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.740
Hubel and Wiesel wrote a
very important paper about V2

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:21.400
in 1965, which was quite
beautiful, documenting

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.080
the properties that
they could find.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.180
But the thing that's
interesting about this

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:30.460
is that V1 didn't really crack
until Hubel and Wiesel figured

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.020
out what the magic
ingredient was.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.210
And the magic ingredient
was orientation.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:36.070
Before Hubel and
Wiesel, people have

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:38.200
been poking at
primary visual cortex,

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.725
showing little spots of
light and little annuli--

00:46:40.725 --> 00:46:42.100
all the things
that worked really

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.830
well in the retina and the
LGN, and they were not getting

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:45.910
very interesting results.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:48.340
They were saying, well, the
receptive fields are bigger

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.670
and there are hot spots,
positive and negative regions,

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:56.650
but the cells are not
responding that well.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:58.360
And when Hubel and
Wiesel figured out

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.280
that orientation was
the magic ingredient--

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.160
and the apocryphal story is that
they did that late at night,

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.076
and they figured it out
when they were putting

00:47:05.076 --> 00:47:07.180
a slide into the projector,
and they had forgotten

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.860
to cover the cat's eyes.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.940
And they put the slide
into the projector,

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.572
and the line at the edge of the
slide went past on the screen--

00:47:15.572 --> 00:47:16.560
TOMMY: it was broken.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.851
EERO SIMONCELLI: It was broken.

00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:21.290
Ah, I always thought it
was the edge of the slide.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.780
I've fibbed, and
Tommy has corrected me

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.990
that it was something
broken in the slide.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:29.770
But in any case, the point
is that a boundary went by,

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.600
and they heard--

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.940
so they played the spikes
through a loudspeaker.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.550
This is what most physiologists
did in those days,

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.422
and even still a lot do.

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:40.630
Certainly, in Tony's lab
you can always walk in there

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.630
and hear the spikes coming
over the loudspeaker.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.710
Anyway, they heard this
huge barrage of spikes,

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:46.690
more than they had ever
heard from any cell

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:48.580
that they had recorded
from, and that

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.500
was the beginning of a whole
sequence of just fabulous work.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.390
And using that tool--

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:58.280
very simple and very
obvious in retrospect,

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.230
but absolutely critical
for the progress.

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:05.860
The stimuli matter is the
point, and making the jump

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.660
to the right stimuli
changes everything.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.800
So V2 for the last
40 years has been

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.740
sitting in this difficult
state where people

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.420
keep throwing stimuli at it.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.410
They try angles.

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:18.340
They try curves.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.600
They try swirly things.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.830
They try corners.

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:25.840
They try contours of various
kinds, illusory contours.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.830
And throughout all of
this, the end story

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:35.200
is V2 cells have bigger
receptive fields, many of them

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.230
respond to orientation,
some of them

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:40.690
respond to particular
combinations of orientation,

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:44.969
but it's usually a small subset,
and the responses are weak.

00:48:44.969 --> 00:48:46.510
And that's really
what the literature

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:49.160
has looked like for 40 years.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:53.560
So what we were after is, can we
drive these cells convincingly

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.540
and in a way that
we can document

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.840
is significantly different
than what we see in V1?

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.250
That was the goal--

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:04.870
find a way to drive
most of the cells

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.600
and to drive them
differently than what

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.000
one would expect in V1.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.940
As a starting point, we
succeeded with textures.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.290
So basically, we took
a bunch of textures.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.710
Here are some example
textures drawn from the model.

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:20.101
Down below are
spectrally-matched equivalents.

00:49:20.101 --> 00:49:22.600
So these things have the same
power spectra, the same amount

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.850
of energy and different
orientation and frequency

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:28.330
bands, but they lack all the
higher-order statistics that

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:31.390
are coming in this texture
model that give you nice,

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:35.480
clean edges and contours
and object-y things,

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.150
or lumps of objects.

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:39.370
And sure enough-- so
here's some example cells.

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:40.460
Here's three V1 cells.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.000
Here's three V2 cells.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.060
And in each of these
plots, there's two curves.

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.460
These are shown over time.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.280
The stimulus is presented
here for 100 milliseconds.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.200
You see a little
bump in the response.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.300
And there's a light
curve and a dark curve.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.630
The light curve is the response
to the spectrally-matched

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:58.930
noise, and the dark curve is
the response to the texture,

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.830
with the higher-order
statistics.

00:50:00.830 --> 00:50:04.200
V1 doesn't seem to care
is the short answer here,

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.860
and V2 cares quite
significantly.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.230
So when you put those
higher-order statistics in,

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.740
almost all V2 cells
respond significantly more,

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.660
and you can see that in
these three examples.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.720
These are not unusual.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.910
That's what most of
the cells look like.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:22.560
So here's a plot, just showing
you 63% of the V2 neurons

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.600
significantly and
positively modulated.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.360
And by the way, this is
averaged over all the textures

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.740
that we showed them.

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.630
And if you pick any
individual cell,

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:32.130
there's usually a
couple of textures

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.780
that drive it really
well, and then

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.613
a bunch of textures
that drive it less well.

00:50:35.613 --> 00:50:37.260
So this effect could
be made stronger

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.500
if you chose only the textures
that drove the cell well.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.290
And up here is V1, where you
can see that very few of them

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:46.290
are modulated by the existence
of these higher-order

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:47.680
statistics.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.070
Oh, here it is across
texture category.

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:54.000
So now on the horizontal axis
is the texture category--

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.310
15 different textures,
and you can see, again,

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:59.640
that V1 is pretty much very
close to the same responses--

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.220
dark and light, again,
for the spectrally-matched

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.480
and the higher-order.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:08.100
And for these three
V1 cells, they're

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.640
basically the same responses
for each of these pairs.

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.460
And for the V2 cells,
there are always

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:18.696
at least some textures where
there's an extreme difference.

00:51:18.696 --> 00:51:20.070
So this is a really
good example.

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.020
There's a huge
difference in response

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.360
here for these two textures,
but for actually many

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:28.130
of the other textures, there's
not much of a difference.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:31.470
So sort of a success.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.480
And the last thing I was
going to tell you about

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.120
is that we think--

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.630
so this is really fitting,
given what Jim DiCarlo told you

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.900
about, or what I assume
he told you about--

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:47.220
this idea of tolerance or
invariance versus selectivity.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.176
We wanted to know,
how can we take

00:51:49.176 --> 00:51:50.550
what we know about
these V2 cells

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:53.280
and pull it back into
the perceptual domain?

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.930
How can we ask,
what is it that you

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:57.270
could do with a
population of V2 cells

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:00.900
that you couldn't do with
a population of V1 cells?

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:04.050
And the thought was if the
V2 cells are responding

00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:06.750
to these texture
statistics, then

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:10.080
if I made a whole bunch of
samples of the same texture,

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.660
the V2 cells should be
really good at identifying

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.860
which texture that is--

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:17.130
which family it came from.

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:19.770
And the V1 cells will be
all confused by the fact

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.680
that those samples each
have different details that

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.820
are shifting around.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.610
So the V1 cells will
respond to those details,

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.310
and they'll give a huge
variety of responses

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:33.090
invariant to re-sampling
from that family,

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:36.270
and the V2 cells will be
more invariant or more

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:38.310
tolerant to re-sampling
from that family.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:39.419
That was the concept.

00:52:39.419 --> 00:52:40.960
And that turns out
to be the case, so

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.450
let me show you the evidence.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:45.720
So here's four
different textures,

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.990
four different-- what we
call different families.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:51.360
Here's images of three different
examples drawn from each.

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.550
So these are just
three samples drawn,

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.334
starting with different
white noise seeds.

00:52:55.334 --> 00:52:57.750
And you can see that they're
actually physically different

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.820
images, but they look the same.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:01.530
Three again.

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:03.090
Three again.

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:08.915
And so we got 100 cells from
V1 and about 100 cells from V2.

00:53:08.915 --> 00:53:11.880
The stimuli are presented
for 100 milliseconds.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.380
We do 20 repetitions each.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.580
We need a lot of data.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:18.330
And what's shown here are
just these this 4 by 3 array,

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:20.280
but we actually had
15 different families

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.640
and 15 examples of each.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.360
20 repetitions of each of those.

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.910
225 stimuli times
20 repetitions.

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.400
That's the experiment.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.529
So what we wanted to know
is, does the hypothesis hold?

00:53:31.529 --> 00:53:32.570
And so here's an example.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:36.390
These are responses laid
out for these 12 stimuli.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:38.760
And what you can see is
that this is a V1 neuron--

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.260
a typical V1 neuron.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:41.970
You can see that
the neuron actually

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:45.390
responds with a fair amount
of variety in these columns.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.380
That is, for different
exemplars from the same family,

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.460
there's some variety.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.350
High response here,
medium response here,

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.820
very low response here.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.160
And this is for these
three images, which

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.380
to us look basically the same.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:02.680
So this cell would not be
very good at separating out

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:07.140
or recognizing or helping in
the process of recognizing

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.720
which kind of texture you
were looking at, because it's

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.800
flopping all over the place
when we draw different samples.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.780
That, as compared to
having to V2 cell--

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.880
this is a typical V2
cell, which you can see

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.920
is much more stable
across these columns.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.470
This is roughly the same
response here, roughly the same

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.840
here, little bit of
variety in this one,

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.580
roughly the same in this one.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.220
And sure enough, if you
actually go and plot this,

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.450
V2 has much higher
variance across families.

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:34.890
That's vertically.

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:36.160
These are the V1 cells.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.142
These are the V2 cells.

00:54:37.142 --> 00:54:38.850
And this is the variance
across families.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:40.940
This is the variance
across exemplars.

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.070
V2 has higher variance
typically across families,

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:47.070
and V1 has higher
variance across exemplars.

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:50.380
And now if you take the
populations of equal size--

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.190
100 of each, and you
ask well, how good

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:55.050
would I be at taking
that population

00:54:55.050 --> 00:55:02.430
and identifying which
family, which kind of texture

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:03.380
I'm looking at?

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.915
And we do this with
cross-validation

00:55:04.915 --> 00:55:05.540
and everything.

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.790
I can give you the details
later, if you want to know.

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:12.680
We find V2 is always better
than V1 in doing this task.

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.460
So we can do a better job
in performing this task--

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.460
identifying which
of these families

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:23.540
a given example was drawn from
if we look at V2 than if we

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:24.560
look at V1.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.270
And if we flip
that around and we

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:27.830
try to do exemplar
identification,

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:31.400
with 15 different examples
of a given family--

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.430
if we say, which one was it?

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.800
It turns out that V1 is
better than V2 for that.

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.610
So we think of this
as evidence that V2

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:44.260
has some invariance
across these samples,

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.150
whereas V1 is much
more specialized

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:48.640
for the particular samples.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.970
This work started with
this fantastic post-doc

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:54.700
that I had mentioned
earlier, Javier Portilla.

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.800
Jeremy Freeman came
into my lab, and we just

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.950
jumped all over this
in making the metamers.

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:01.810
Josh McDermott is on
here because I usually

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:05.454
also play the auditory
examples and walk

00:56:05.454 --> 00:56:06.870
through a little
bit of that work,

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.160
but I'm going to
leave that for him.

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:11.740
And Corey Ziemba, who's a
student who's in the lab

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:14.560
right now and is doing a
lot of the physiology and

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.280
did a lot of the physiology
that I showed you in Tony's lab.

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.310
And we were funded by
HHMI and also the NIH.

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:23.940
So thanks.
