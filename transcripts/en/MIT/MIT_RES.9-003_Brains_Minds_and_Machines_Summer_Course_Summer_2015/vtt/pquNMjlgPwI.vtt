00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:23.090
LORENZO ROSASCO:
If you remember,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.420
we did the local
method bias-variance.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.290
Then we passed to global
regularization methods-- least

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.790
squares, linear least
squares, kernel least squares,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.420
computations modeling.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.762
And that's where we were at.

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:36.470
And then we moved on
and started to think

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.070
about more intractable
model, and we

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.910
were starting to think of the
problem of variable selection,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.110
OK?

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.370
And the way we posed it is
that, yeah, that you are going

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.180
to consider a linear model.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.510
And I use the weights
associated to each variable

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.260
as the strength of the
corresponding variable

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.060
that you can view
as measurements.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.590
And your game is
not only to build

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.360
good predictional
measurements, but also

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.170
to tell which measurements
are interesting, OK?

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.330
And so here, the term
"relevant variable"

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.870
is going to be related to the
productivity, the contribution

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.320
to the productivity of the
corresponding function, OK?

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.600
So that's how we measure
relevance of a variable.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.460
So we looked at the funny name.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.610
And then we kind of
agreed that somewhat it

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.340
seems that there is a
default approach, which

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.970
is basically based on trying
all possible subsets, OK?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.869
So this is also called
best subset selection.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.660
Variable selection is
also sometimes called

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.577
best subset selection.

00:01:45.577 --> 00:01:47.743
And this gives you a feeling
that what you should do

00:01:47.743 --> 00:01:50.420
is try all possible subsets
and check the one which

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.030
is best with respect to your
data, which, again, would

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.540
be like a trade-off between
how well you fit the data

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.190
and how many variables
you have, OK?

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.820
And what I told you last
was you could actually

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.730
see that this trying
all possible subsets

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.780
is related to a form
of regularization,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.490
where it looks very
similar to the one

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.530
we saw until a minute ago.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.220
The main difference
here, I put fw,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.796
but fw is just the
usual linear function.

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:21.170
The only difference
is that here,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.380
rather than the square
norm, we put this functional

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.640
that is called the
0 norm, which if,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.030
as a functional,
that given a vector

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.880
returns the number of
entries in the vector which

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.670
are different from 0, OK?

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.550
It turns out that if you
were to minimize this,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.350
you are solving the best
subset selection problem.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.080
Issue here is that--
another manifestation

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.240
of the complexity of
the problem is the fact

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.800
that this functional
here is non-convex.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.500
So there is no
polynomial algorithm

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.760
to actually find a solution.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.910
Come to my mind that
somebody made the comment

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.360
during the break.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.100
Notice that here I'm
a bit passing quickly

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.610
over a refinement of the
question of best subset

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.020
selection, which is
related to, is there

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.600
a unique subset which is good?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.710
Is there more than one?

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.160
And if there's more than one,
which one should I pick, OK?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.260
In practice, these
questions arise immediately

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.968
because if you have
two measurements that

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:23.580
are very correlated,
or even more,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.950
if they're perfectly
correlated, if you just

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.792
build the measurements,
you might build out

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.750
of two measurements, a
third measurement, which

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.187
is completely just a linear
combination of the first two.

00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:36.020
So at that point, what
would you want to do?

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.603
Do you want to keep
the minimum number

00:03:37.603 --> 00:03:40.560
of variables, the biggest
possible number of variables?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.410
And you have to decide,
because all these variables

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.430
are, to some extent,
completely dependent, OK?

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.290
So for now, we just
keep to the case

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.120
where we don't really
worry about this, OK?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.470
We just say, among the good
ones, we want to pick one.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.900
A harder question would
be pick all of them

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.990
or pick one of them.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.406
And if you wanted to pick one
of them, you have to tell me

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:03.650
which one you want, according
to which criterion, OK?

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.250
So the problem we're concerned
with now is one of, OK, now

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.390
that we know that we
might want to do this,

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.829
how can you do it in
an approximate way that

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.850
will be good enough, and what
does it mean, good enough?

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.660
So the simplest
way, again, we can

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.410
try to think about
it together, is

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.480
kind of a greedy version of
the brute force approach.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.520
So the brute force
approach was start

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.070
from all single variables,
then all couples,

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.380
then all triplets, and
blah, blah, blah, blah, OK?

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.140
And this doesn't
work computationally.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.620
So just to wake
up, I don't know,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.470
how could you
twist this approach

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.010
to make it approximate, but
computationally feasible?

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.440
Let's keep the same spirit.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.480
So let's start from few, and
then let's try to add more.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.420
So the general
idea is I pick one.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.030
And once I pick one, I
pick another one, just

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.466
keeping the one
I already picked.

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:12.840
And then I pick another one,
and then I pick another one,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.006
and then I pick another one.

00:05:14.006 --> 00:05:18.060
So this, of course, will
not be the exhaustive search

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.440
I've done before.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.100
It's probably doable.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.550
There is a bunch of
different ways you can do it.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.990
And you can hopefully--

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.100
you can hope that
under some condition

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.100
you might be able to prove
that it's not too far

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.570
away from the brute
force approach, at least

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.590
under some condition.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.740
And this is kind of what
we would want to do, OK?

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.360
So we will have a
notion of residual.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.560
At the first
iteration, the residual

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.060
will be just the output.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.300
So just think of
the first iteration.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.420
You get the output vectors,
and you want to explain it.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.090
You want to predict it well, OK?

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.880
So what you do is that you first
check the one variable that

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.670
gives you the best
prediction of this guy,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.839
and then you compute
the prediction.

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.630
Then what you want to
do at the next round,

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.019
you want to discount what
you have already explained.

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:10.560
And what you do is
that basically you

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.870
take the actual output
minus your prediction,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.695
and you find the residual.

00:06:15.695 --> 00:06:17.070
And then you try
to explain that.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.930
That's what's left
to explain, OK?

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.820
So now you check
for the variables

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.840
that best explain
this remaining bit.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.570
Then you add this variable
to the one you already have,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.700
and you have a new
notion of residual,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.160
which is what you explained
in the first round, what

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.410
you added in explanation
of the second round.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.980
And then there's still something
left, and you keep on going.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.080
If you let this thing
go for enough time,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.810
you will have the
least squares solution.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.500
At the end of the day, you
will have explained everything.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.840
And each round, notice
that you might or not

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.742
decide to put the
variables back in, OK?

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:55.200
So you might have
that at each step

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.430
you have just one
variable, or you

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.096
might have that you
take multiple steps,

00:06:58.096 --> 00:07:00.840
but you have fewer variables
than number of steps.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.610
No matter what,
the number of steps

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.030
would be related to the
number of variables that

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.812
are active in your model, OK?

00:07:08.812 --> 00:07:10.350
Does it makes sense?

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.606
This is the wordy version,
but now we go in details, OK?

00:07:13.606 --> 00:07:14.980
But this is roughly
the speaking.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.701
So first round, you try
to explain something,

00:07:17.701 --> 00:07:19.200
then you see what's
left to explain.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.449
And you keep the variables
that will explain the rest,

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:22.890
and then you need to write.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.160
I'm not sure I used the
word, but it's important.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.410
The key word here
is "sparsity," OK?

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.450
The fact that I'm
assuming my model

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.040
to depend on just
a few vectors--

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.110
sorry a few entries.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.930
So it's a vector with
many zero entries.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.327
Sparsity is the key word to
explain this property, which

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:41.535
is a property of the problem.

00:07:41.535 --> 00:07:44.460
And so I build
algorithm that will

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.710
try to find sparse solution
explaining my data,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.370
and this is one way.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.330
So let's look at this list.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.294
So you define the notion
of residual as this thing

00:07:56.294 --> 00:07:58.460
that you want to try to
explain, and the first round

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.300
will be the output.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.258
The second round will be
what's left to explain

00:08:01.258 --> 00:08:02.900
after your prediction.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.060
You have a coefficient
vector, OK,

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.080
because we're building
a linear function.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.560
And then you have
an index set, which

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.950
is the set of variables which
are important at that stage.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.505
So these are the three objects
that you have to initialize.

00:08:15.505 --> 00:08:18.062
So at the first round,
the coefficient vector

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:18.770
is going to be 0.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.450
The index set is
going to be empty.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.010
And the residual
at the first round

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:27.880
is just going to be the
output, the output vector.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.679
Then you find the
best single variable,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.150
and then you update
the index set.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.570
So you add that variable
to the index set.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.559
To include such variables, you
compute the coefficient vector.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.970
And then you update
the residual,

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.700
and then you start again, OK?

00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:52.020
If you want, here I show
you the first exam--

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.180
just to give you an idea.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.750
Suppose that this is--

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.976
so first of all,
notice this, OK?

00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:00.368
Oh, it's so boring.

00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:04.680
Forget about anything
that's written here.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.150
Just look at this matrix.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.080
The output vector is of the
same length of the column

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.330
of the matrix, right?

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.060
So each column of
the matrix will

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.372
be related to one variable.

00:09:18.372 --> 00:09:20.080
So what you're going
to do is that you're

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.860
going to try to see
which of these best

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.400
explain my output
vector, and then

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.380
you're going to try to define
the residual and keep on going,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:30.880
OK?

00:09:34.896 --> 00:09:36.270
So in this case,
for example, you

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.620
can ask, which of the two
directions, X1 and X2,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.010
best explain the vector Y, OK?

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.770
So this is the case
where it's simple.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.080
I basically have
this one direction.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.940
One variable is this one.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.170
Another variable is this one.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.010
And then I have that vector.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.634
I want to know which
direction I should

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:57.182
pick to best explain my Y. Which
one do you think I should pick?

00:09:57.182 --> 00:09:58.066
AUDIENCE: X1.

00:09:58.066 --> 00:10:00.060
LORENZO ROSASCO:
I should pick X1?

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.240
OK.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.330
This projection here will be
the weight I have to put to X1

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.750
to get a good prediction.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.230
And then what's the residual?

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.130
Well, I have to take this X1.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.650
I have to-- I have to take Yn.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.020
I have to subtract that, and
this is what I have left.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.390
So this is the simple terms, OK?

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.460
So that's what we want to do.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.540
So we said it with hands.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.890
We say it with words.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.870
Here is, more or less,
the pseudocode, OK?

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.380
It's a bit boring to read.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.670
You can see that it's
four lines of code anyway.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.586
Now that we've said it
15 times, probably it

00:10:35.586 --> 00:10:37.210
won't be that hard
to read because what

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.460
you see is that you have
a notion of residual.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.750
You have the coefficient vector,
and you have the index set.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.820
This is empty.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.564
This is all 0's.

00:10:44.564 --> 00:10:45.730
And this is the first round.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.662
It's just the output.

00:10:47.662 --> 00:10:49.120
Then what you do
is that you start.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.930
And the free parameter here is
T, the number of iterations,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.530
OK?

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.230
It's going to be
lambda, so to say.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.810
What you do is--

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.340
OK, you have for each j--

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.600
so just notation.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.190
j runs over the
variables, and capital Xj

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.360
will be the column of the
data matrix, the one that

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.400
corresponds to j's variable, OK?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.190
And then what you
do in this line,

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.130
here I expand it, is to
find the coefficient--

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.320
sorry, find the error
that corresponds

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.410
to the best variable, OK?

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.010
If you look, it turns
out that it is--

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.460
if you assume-- oh, it
is equivalent to find

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.490
the column best
correlated with the output

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.910
is equivalent to find the
column that best explains

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.290
the output, or the residual.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.800
These two things are the same.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.470
So here, I write equivalence.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.950
So pick the one
that you prefer, OK?

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.750
Either you say I find the
column that is best correlated

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.300
with the output or the
residual, or you find the column

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.871
that best explains the residual
in the sense of least squares,

00:11:53.871 --> 00:11:54.370
OK?

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.320
These two things are equivalent.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.620
Pick the one that you like.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.690
And that's the
content of this one.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.760
And then you select the
index of that column.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.920
So you solve this
problem for each column.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.090
It's an easy problem.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.412
It's a one-dimensional problem.

00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:07.120
And then you pick the
one column that you

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.400
like the most, which is
the one that gives you

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.440
the best correlation, a.k.a.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.240
least square error.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.230
Then you add this
k to the index set.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.430
And then, in this
case, it's very simple.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.360
I'm just going to--

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.240
I'm not going to
recompute anything.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.241
So what I do is that
suppose that at--

00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:29.740
you remember the
coefficient vector,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.774
where it was all 0's, OK?

00:12:31.774 --> 00:12:33.690
Then at the first round,
I compute one number,

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.850
the solution with, say, the
first coordinate, for example.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.540
And then I add a number
in that entry, OK?

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.450
So this is the
orthonormal basis, OK?

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.390
So it has just all 0's,
but 1 in the position k.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.210
So here I put this number.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.489
This is just a typo.

00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:53.530
And then what you do is
that you sum them up, OK?

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.367
So you have all 0's.

00:12:54.367 --> 00:12:56.950
Just one number here, the first
iteration, then the other one.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.880
And then you add this one there,
and you keep on going, OK?

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.150
This is the simplest
possible version.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.790
And once you have this,
now you have this vector.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.310
This is a long vector.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.560
You multiply this--
sorry, this should be Xn.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.340
Maybe we should take
note of the typos

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.789
because I'm never going
to remember all of them.

00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:16.330
And then what you
do is that you just

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.390
discount what you explained
so far to the solution.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.816
So you already explained
some part of the residual.

00:13:21.816 --> 00:13:23.440
Now you discount this
new part, and you

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.070
define the new residual,
and then you go back.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.520
This method is-- so
greedy approaches

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.730
is one name, as it often
happens in machine learning

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.450
and statistics and
other fields, things

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.954
get reinvented constantly, a
bit because people just come

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:42.495
to them from a
different perspective,

00:13:42.495 --> 00:13:45.790
a bit because people just
decide studying and reading

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.590
is not priority sometimes.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:54.680
And so this one algorithm
is often called greedy.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.280
It's one example of
greedy approaches.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.290
It's sometimes called
matching pursuit.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.630
It's very much related to
so-called forward stagewise

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.680
regression.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.480
That's how it's
called in statistics.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.360
And well, it has a
bunch of other names.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.380
Now, this one version is
just the basic version.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.110
It's the simplex-- it's
the simplest version.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.440
This step typically remains.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.980
These two steps can be
changed slightly, OK?

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.554
For example, can you think
of another way of doing this?

00:14:24.554 --> 00:14:25.720
Let me just give you a hint.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.053
In this case, what you do is
that you select a variable.

00:14:28.053 --> 00:14:29.260
You compute the coefficient.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.430
Then you select
another variable.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.110
You compute the coefficient
for the second variable,

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.151
but you keep the coefficient
you already computed

00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:35.490
for the first variable.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.770
They never knew that
you took another one

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.990
because you didn't take it yet.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.720
So from this comment,
do you see how

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.620
you could change this method
to somewhat fix this aspect?

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.450
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.210
I would like to change
this one line where

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.340
I compute the coefficient
and this one line

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.350
even, perhaps, where I compute
the residual to account

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.660
for the fact that this method
basically never updated

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.430
the weights that
it computed before.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.150
You only add a new one.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.920
And this seems potentially
not a good idea,

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.160
because when you
have two variables,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.435
it's better to compute the
solution with both of them.

00:15:18.435 --> 00:15:19.310
So what could you do?

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.262
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:24.052 --> 00:15:25.010
LORENZO ROSASCO: Right.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.440
So what you could
do is essentially

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.360
what is called orthogonal
matching pursuit.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.280
So you would take
this set, and now you

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.800
would solve a least
square problem

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.500
with the variables that
are in the index set up

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.240
to that point, all of them.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.577
You recompute everything.

00:15:41.577 --> 00:15:43.910
And now you have to solve not
a one-dimensional problem,

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.220
but n times k-dimensional
problem, where the k is the--

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.460
I don't know, k is a bad
name-- with the dimension

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.780
of the set that could
be T or more than T, OK?

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.290
And then at that point, you
also want to redefine this,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.851
because you're not
discounting anymore

00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:02.850
what you already explained,
but each time you're

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.070
recomputing everything.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.216
So you just want to do Yn
minus the prediction, OK?

00:16:08.216 --> 00:16:09.590
So this algorithm
is the one that

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.881
actually has better properties.

00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:12.200
It works better.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.240
You pay the price,
because each time

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.620
you have to recompute the
least squares solution.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.659
And when you have more
than one variable inside,

00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:21.200
then the problems
become big and big.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.120
So if you stop after a few
iterations, it's great.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.040
But if you start to have
many iterations each time,

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.456
you have to solve
a linear system.

00:16:26.456 --> 00:16:28.100
So the complexity
is much higher.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.710
This one here, as you can
imagine, is super fast.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.380
So that's it.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.639
So it turns out that this
method is, as I told you,

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:38.930
is called matching pursuit,
or if not matching pursuit,

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.130
forward stagewise regression,
is one way to approximate a zero

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:43.910
solution.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.490
And one can prove
exactly in which sense

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.020
you can approximate it, OK?

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.200
So I think this is the
one that we might give you

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.300
this afternoon, right?

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.430
AUDIENCE: Orthogonal.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.513
LORENZO ROSASCO: Oh, yeah,
the orthogonal version,

00:16:57.513 --> 00:16:59.660
the nicer version.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.410
The other way of doing this is
the one that basically says,

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.369
look, here what you're doing
is that you're just counting

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:11.180
the number of entries
different from 0's.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.849
If you now were to replace
this with something that

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:17.089
does a bit more-- what it
does is it not only counts,

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:21.857
but it actually
sums up the weights.

00:17:21.857 --> 00:17:23.690
So if you want, in one
case, you just check.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.000
If a weight is bigger
than 0, you count it 1.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.349
Otherwise, you count it 0.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:29.340
Here you actually take
the absolute value.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.400
So instead of summing
up binary values,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.380
you sum up real numbers, OK?

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.810
This is what is
called the L1 norm.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.945
So each weight doesn't
count for its sign,

00:17:38.945 --> 00:17:42.630
but it actually counts
for each absolute value.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.350
So it turns out that this one
term, which you can imagine--

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.500
the absolute value
looks like this, right,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.000
and now you're just
summing them up.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.320
So that thing is
actually convex.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.020
So it turns out that you're
summing up two convex terms,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.670
and the overall
functional is convex.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.070
And if you want, you
can think of this a bit

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.253
as a relaxation
of the zero norm.

00:18:04.253 --> 00:18:05.960
As we say, relaxation
in this sense

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.749
is the strict requirement.

00:18:07.749 --> 00:18:10.040
So I talked about relaxation
before when I said instead

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.650
of binary values, it
takes real values,

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.649
and you optimize over the reals
instead of the binary values.

00:18:15.649 --> 00:18:16.940
Here is kind of the same thing.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.314
Instead of restricting yourself
to this functional, which

00:18:19.314 --> 00:18:21.740
is binary-valued, now you
allow yourself to relax and get

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.830
real numbers.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.690
And what you gain is
that this algorithm,

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:29.784
the corresponding optimization
problem is convex,

00:18:29.784 --> 00:18:30.950
and you can try to solve it.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.500
It is not still something
that we can do--

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.910
we cannot do what we did before.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.480
We cannot just take derivatives
and set them equal to 0

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.030
because this term is not smooth.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.960
The absolute value
looks like this,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.320
which means that
here, around the kink,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.560
is not differentiable.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.410
But we can still
use convex analysis

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.900
to try to get the solution,
and actually the solution

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.310
doesn't look too complicated.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.240
Getting there requires a
bit of convex analysis,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.855
but there are techniques.

00:18:57.855 --> 00:18:59.480
And the ones that
are trendy these days

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.150
are called forward-backward
splitting or proximal method

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.334
to solve this problem.

00:19:04.334 --> 00:19:05.750
And apparently,
I'm not even going

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.610
to show them to you because
you don't even see them.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.360
But essentially, it's
not too complicated.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.480
Just to tell you in
one word what they do

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.310
is that they do the gradient
descent of the first term,

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.920
and then at each step of
the gradient they threshold.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.380
So they take a step of the
gradient, get a vector,

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.480
look inside the vector.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.840
If something is smaller than
a threshold that depends

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.150
on lambda, I set it equal to 0.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.410
Otherwise, I let it go, OK?

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.140
So I didn't put it,
I don't know why,

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.810
because it's really
a one-line algorithm.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.717
It's a bit harder to derive,
but it's very simple to check.

00:19:38.717 --> 00:19:40.550
So let's talk one second
about this picture,

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:45.170
and then let me tell you about
what I'm not telling you.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.280
So hiding behind
everything I said so far,

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.320
there is a linear system, right?

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.810
There is a linear system
that is n by p or d

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.810
or whatever you want to
call it, with the number

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.190
of p of variables.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.020
And our game so far
has always been,

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.220
look, we have a linear system
that can be not invertible,

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.680
or even if it is, it might
have bad condition number,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.980
and I want to try to find a
way to stabilize the problem.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.174
The first round, we
basically replace the inverse

00:20:12.174 --> 00:20:13.340
with an approximate inverse.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.320
That's the classical
way of doing it.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.420
Here, we're making
another assumption.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.000
We're basically saying,
look, this vector,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.610
it does look very long, so that
this problem seems ill-posed.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:28.390
But in fact, if only a few
entries were different from 0

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.730
and if you were able to
tell me which one they are,

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.710
you can go in, delete
all these entries,

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.597
delete all the
corresponding columns,

00:20:34.597 --> 00:20:35.930
and then you will have a matrix.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.300
Now he looks short and large.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.599
He will look skinny
and tall, OK?

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:43.390
And that probably would
be easier to solve.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.320
It would be the case
where the problem is

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.170
one of the linear systema
that we know how to solve.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.890
So what we described
so far is a way

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:55.167
to find solution of
linear systems that are--

00:20:55.167 --> 00:20:57.250
with the number of equations
which is smaller than

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.610
the number of unknowns, and, by
definition, cannot be solved,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.100
under the extra
assumption that, in fact,

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.460
there are fewer unknowns
than what it looks like.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.750
It's just that I'm not telling
you which one they are, OK?

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.839
You see, if I
could tell you, you

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:13.880
would just get back to a
very easy problem, where

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.340
the number of unknowns
is much smaller, OK?

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.900
So this is a
mathematical effect, OK?

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.372
And the odds are open, because--

00:21:26.372 --> 00:21:27.830
now they're not
because people have

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:31.070
been talking about this stuff
for 10 years constantly.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:35.120
But one question is, how much
does this assumption buy you?

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.970
For example, could you prove
that in certain situations,

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.030
even if you don't know
the entry of this,

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:44.690
you could actually solve
this problem exactly?

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.400
So if I give them to you,
you can do it, right?

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.180
But is there a way to try
to guess them in some way

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.810
so that you can do almost as
good or with high probability

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.810
as well as if I tell
them in advance?

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.870
And it turned out that
the answer is yes, OK?

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.980
And the answer is basically that
if the number of entries that

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.410
are different from
0 is small enough

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.190
and the columns corresponding
to those variables

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.300
are not too correlated,
are not too collinear,

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.935
so they're
distinguishable enough

00:22:14.935 --> 00:22:16.310
that when you
perturb the problem

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.800
a little bit nothing
changes, then

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.480
you can solve the
problem exactly, OK?

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.280
So this, on the one hand, is
exactly the kind of theory

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.580
that tells you why using greedy
methods and convex relaxation

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.830
will give you a good
approximation to L0,

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.860
because that's basically
what this story tells you.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.680
People have been using this--
and so this is interesting

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.670
for us-- people have been using
this observation in a slightly

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:47.920
different context, which
is the context where--

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.710
you see, for us, Y and
X, we don't choose.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.500
We get.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.200
And whatever they are, they are.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.660
And if it's correlate-- if
the columns are nice, nice.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.071
But if they're not nice, sorry,
you have to live with it, OK?

00:23:00.071 --> 00:23:02.570
But there are settings where
you can think of the following.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.790
Suppose that you have
a signal, and you want

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.190
to be able to reconstruct it.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.227
So the classical Shannon
sampling theorem results

00:23:12.227 --> 00:23:13.810
basically tell you
that, I don't know,

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.730
if you have something
which has been limited,

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.929
you have to sample twice
the maximum frequency.

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:19.720
But this is kind of
worst case because it's

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.050
assuming that all the bands,
all the frequencies, are full.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.430
Suppose that now we play--

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.360
it's an analogy, OK?

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.860
But I tell you, oh,
look, it's true,

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.370
the maximum frequency of this.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:30.910
But there's only another
frequency, this one.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.980
Do you really need to
sample that much, or you

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.890
can do much less?

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.234
And so it turns out that
basically the story here,

00:23:37.234 --> 00:23:38.650
as you're answering
this question,

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.950
it turns out that, yes,
you can do much less.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.700
Ideally, what you would
like to say, well,

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.610
instead of being twice
the maximum frequency,

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.730
if I have just four
frequencies different from 0,

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.916
I'd have to do
eight samples, OK?

00:23:50.916 --> 00:23:52.540
That would be ideal,
but you would have

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.070
to know which one they are.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.850
You don't, so you pay a price,
but it's just logarithmic.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.740
So you basically say
that you can almost--

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.930
you have a new sampling
theorem that tells you

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:05.530
that you don't need
to sample that much.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.720
You don't need to sample
that low either, which

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.520
would be, say, the
maximum frequency is d.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.610
The number of non-zero
frequencies is s.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.340
So with classical, you
would have to say 2d.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.260
Ideally, we would
like to say 2s.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.890
Actually, what you can say
is something like 2s log d.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.010
So you have a log d price
that you pay because you

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.390
didn't know where they are.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.170
But still, it's much less than
being linear in the dimension.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.150
So essentially, the field
of compressed sensing

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.000
has been built around
this observation,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.710
and the focus is
slightly different.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.620
Instead of saying I want to do
a statistical estimation where

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.990
I can just build this, what
you do is say I have a signal.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.230
And now I view this
as a sensing matrix

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.690
that I design with
the property that I

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.320
know will allow me to
do this estimation well.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.960
And so you basically assume that
you can choose those vectors

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.490
in certain ways,
and then you can

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.810
prove that you can reconstruct
with much fewer samples, OK?

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.550
And this has been
used, for example--

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.532
I never remember for, as
you call in MEG-- in what?

00:25:07.532 --> 00:25:09.202
No, MRI, MRI.

00:25:09.202 --> 00:25:10.660
Two things I didn't
tell you about,

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.390
but it's worth
mentioning are, suppose

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.530
that what I tell
you is actually it's

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.170
not individual entries that are
0, but group of entries that

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:24.740
are 0, for example, because each
entry is a biological process.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.980
So I have genes, but
genes are actually

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.850
involved in biological process.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.420
So there is a group of genes
that is doing something.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.461
I have a group of genes
that are doing something,

00:25:32.461 --> 00:25:35.680
and I want to select is not
individual genes, but groups.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.740
Can you twist this stuff in such
a way that you select groups?

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.327
Yes.

00:25:39.327 --> 00:25:41.160
What if the groups are
actually overlapping?

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.160
How do you want to
deal with the overlaps?

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.889
Do you want to keep the overlap?

00:25:43.889 --> 00:25:45.180
Do you want to cut the overlap?

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.590
What if you have a
tree structure, OK?

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.160
What do you do with this?

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.407
So first of all, who
gives it information, OK?

00:25:51.407 --> 00:25:53.740
And then if you have the
information, how do you use it,

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.073
and how are you going to use it?

00:25:55.073 --> 00:25:57.250
See, this is the whole
field of structure sparsity.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.910
It's the whole industry
of building penalties

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.559
other than L1 that would
allow you to incorporate

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:05.850
this kind of prior information.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.800
And if you want as the
place, as in kernel methods,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.230
the kernel was the
place where you could

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.910
incorporate prior information.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.620
This is the case
where, in this field,

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:19.789
you can do that by designing
a suitable regularizer.

00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:21.330
And then a lot of
the reason is this.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:25.720
So here we'll translate
with these new regularizers.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.500
The last bit is that, with
a bit of a twist, some

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.810
of the idea that I show
you now that are basically

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:35.620
related to vectors
and sparsity translate

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.050
to more general context, in
particular that of matrices

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.200
that have low rank, OK?

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.460
The classical example is
suppose that I give you--

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.500
it's matrix completion, OK?

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.410
I give you a matrix,
but I actually

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.080
delete most of the
entries of the matrix.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.164
And I tell you, OK, estimate
the original matrix.

00:26:54.164 --> 00:26:56.600
Well, how can I do that, right?

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.450
Well, it turns out that
if the matrix itself

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:03.760
had very low rank, so that many
of the columns and rows you saw

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.397
were actually related
to each other,

00:27:05.397 --> 00:27:06.980
you might actually
be able to do that.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.540
And the way you chose the
entries to delete or select

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.660
was not malicious,
then you would

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.360
be able to fill in the
missing entries, OK?

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.040
And the theory
behind this is very

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.414
similar to the
theory that allows

00:27:19.414 --> 00:27:23.840
to fill in the right
entries of the vector, OK?

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.986
Last bit-- PCA in 15 minutes.

00:27:27.986 --> 00:27:33.790
So what we've seen so far
was a very hard problem

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.780
of variable selection.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.400
It is still a
supervised problem,

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.224
where I give you labels, OK?

00:27:38.224 --> 00:27:39.640
The last bit I
want to show you is

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.180
PCA, which is the case where
I don't give you labels.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.199
And what you try to answer
is actually-- perhaps

00:27:44.199 --> 00:27:45.490
it's like the simpler question.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.232
Because you don't want to
select one of the directions,

00:27:48.232 --> 00:27:49.690
but you would like
to know if there

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:50.950
are directions that matter.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.408
So you allow
yourself, for example,

00:27:52.408 --> 00:27:57.040
to combine the different
directions in your data, OK?

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.460
So this question is interesting
for many, many reasons.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.107
One is data visualization,
for example.

00:28:03.107 --> 00:28:05.440
You have stuff that you cannot
look at because you have,

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.273
for example, digits in
very high dimensions.

00:28:07.273 --> 00:28:09.220
You would like to look at them.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.940
How do you do it?

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.320
Well, you like to
find directions.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.880
The first direction
to project everything,

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.171
the second direction, three
direction, because then you

00:28:15.171 --> 00:28:18.430
can plot and look at them, OK?

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.952
And this is one visualization
of these images here.

00:28:21.952 --> 00:28:23.410
And I'll remember
now the code now.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.430
It's written here.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.669
You have different
colors, and what you see

00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:28.210
is that this actually
did a good job.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.835
Because what you expect is that
if you do a nice visualization,

00:28:30.835 --> 00:28:33.460
what you would like to have
is that similar numbers

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.410
or same numbers are
in the same regions,

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.920
and perhaps similar
numbers are close, OK?

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.564
So this is one reason
why you want to do this.

00:28:42.564 --> 00:28:44.230
One reason why you
might want to do this

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.910
is also because you
might want to reduce

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.427
the dimensionality of your
data just to compress them

00:28:48.427 --> 00:28:51.010
or because you might hope that
certain dimensions don't matter

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.870
or are simply noise.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.150
And so you just want
to get rid of that

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.720
because this could be good
for statistical reasons.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.170
OK, so the game is going
to be the following.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.230
X is the data space,
which is going to be RD.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:10.240
And we want to define a map M
that sends vectors of length D

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.200
into vectors of length k.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:20.094
So k is going to be my
reduced dimensionality.

00:29:20.094 --> 00:29:21.760
And what we're going
to do is that we're

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.940
going to build a basic method
to do this, which is PCA,

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.290
and we're going to give a purely
geometric view of PCA, OK?

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.060
And this is going
to be done by taking

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.485
first the case where k is equal
to 1 and then iterate to go up.

00:29:34.485 --> 00:29:35.860
So at the first
case, we're going

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.410
to ask, if I give you vectors
which are D dimensional,

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.230
how can I project them in
one dimension with respect

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:46.540
to some criterion
of optimality, OK?

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.620
And here what we ask is, we want
to project the data in the one

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:57.170
dimension that would give
me the best possible error.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:01.320
So I think I had it before.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.279
Do I have it-- no, no.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.130
This was done for another
reason, but it's useful now.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.440
If you have this
vector and you want

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.370
to project in this direction,
and this is a unit vector,

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.130
what do you do?

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:26.910
I want to know how to write this
vector here, the projection.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:31.850
What you do is that you take the
inner product between Yn and X.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.430
You get the number, and that
number is the length you

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.576
want to assign to X1, OK?

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.440
So suppose that w
is the direction.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.215
And I have a vector
x, and I want

00:30:45.215 --> 00:30:46.970
to give the projection, OK?

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:47.840
What do I do?

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.685
I take the inner
product of x and w,

00:30:51.685 --> 00:30:54.770
and this is the length I have
to assign to the vector w, which

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.140
is unit norm, OK?

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.930
So this is the
best approximation

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:03.480
of xi in the direction of w.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.540
Does it make sense?

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:12.135
I fix a w, and I want to know
how well I can describe x.

00:31:12.135 --> 00:31:15.090
I project x in that
direction, and then I

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:20.070
take the difference between
x and the projection, OK?

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.620
And then what I do is that
I sum over all points.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.891
And then I check, among
all possible directions,

00:31:24.891 --> 00:31:26.390
the one that give
me the best error.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.484
So suppose that
is your data set.

00:31:32.484 --> 00:31:33.900
Which direction
you think is going

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.983
to give me the best error?

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.850
AUDIENCE: Keep going.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.180
LORENZO ROSASCO: Well, if
you go in this direction,

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.210
you can explain most
of the stuff, OK?

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.030
You can reconstruct it best.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.850
So this is going
to be the solution.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:57.140
So the question here is really,
how do you solve this problem?

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.457
You could try to minimize
with respect to w.

00:32:01.457 --> 00:32:04.040
But in fact, it's not clear what
kind of computation you have.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.580
And if we massage
this a little bit,

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.744
it turns out that it is actually
exactly an eigenvalue problem.

00:32:08.744 --> 00:32:10.160
So that's what we
want to do next.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.590
So conceptually, what we want
to do is what I said here

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:13.580
and nothing more.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.160
I want to find the single
individual direction that

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:20.160
allows me to reconstruct best,
on average, all the training

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.999
set points.

00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:22.790
And now what we want
to do is just to check

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:26.210
what kind of computation
these entail and learn

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.050
a bit more about this, OK?

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.640
So this notation is just to
say that the vector is norm 1

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:40.800
so that I don't have to fumble
with the size of the vector.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.050
OK, so let's do a
couple of computations.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:45.210
This is ideal after lunch.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:49.100
So you just take this
square and develop it, OK?

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.200
And remember that
w is unit norm.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.690
So when you do w
transpose w, you get 1.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.000
And then if you--

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.270
and if you don't forget
to put your square

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.770
and if you just
develop this, you'll

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.450
see that this is
an equality, OK?

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.830
There is a square missing here.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.530
So you have xi square.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.870
Then you would have
the product of xi

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:13.710
and this, which will be
w transpose xi square.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.340
And then you would
also have this square,

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.570
but this square is w transpose
xi and then w transpose w,

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:21.675
which is 1.

00:33:21.675 --> 00:33:24.154
And so what you see is
that this would create--

00:33:24.154 --> 00:33:26.070
instead of three terms
we have two because two

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.810
cancel out-- not cancel out.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.720
They balance each other.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.220
OK.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:38.250
So then I'd argue that if
instead of minimizing this,

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.724
because this is equal to this,
instead of minimizing this,

00:33:40.724 --> 00:33:41.640
you can maximize this.

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:46.550
Why?

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:49.160
Well, because this
is just a constant.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.290
It doesn't depend
on w at all, so I

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.040
can drop it from my functional.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.000
The solution, the minimum,
the minimum will be different,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.520
but the minimizer, the w
that solves the problem,

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.010
will be the same, OK?

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.630
And then here is
minimizing something

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.810
with a minus, which is the same
as maximizing the same thing

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.391
without the minus, OK?

00:34:09.391 --> 00:34:13.190
I don't ask, so far, so
good, because I'm scared.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.000
So what you see now
is that basically

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.929
if the data were centered,
basically this would just

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.110
be a variance.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.739
If the data are centered,
so there is a minus 0 here,

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:29.360
maybe you can interpret this
as measuring the variance

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.069
in one direction.

00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:31.651
And so you have
another interpretation

00:34:31.651 --> 00:34:33.960
of PCA, which is the one
where instead of picking

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.370
the single direction with the
best possible reconstruction,

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.889
you're picking the direction
where the variance of the data

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:42.569
is bigger, OK?

00:34:42.569 --> 00:34:44.860
And these two points of view
are completely equivalent.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.886
Essentially, whenever
you have a square norm,

00:34:46.886 --> 00:34:48.469
thinking about
maximizing the variance

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:51.080
or minimizing the
reconstruction are two

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.540
complementary dual ideas, OK?

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.090
So that's what you
will be doing here.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.090
One more bit.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.080
What about computation?

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.640
So this is-- so we can
think about reconstruction.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.920
You can think about
variance, if you like.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.100
What about this computation?

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.180
What kind of
computation is this, OK?

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.600
If we massage it
a little bit, we

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.550
see that is just an
eigenvalue problem.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.540
So this is how you do it.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.670
This actually look-- so it's
annoying, but it's very simple.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.110
So I wrote all the passages.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.200
This is a square, so it's
something times itself.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.030
This whole thing is
symmetric, so you

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:26.420
can swap the order of
this multiplication.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:30.980
So you get w transpose
xi, xi transpose w.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.740
But then this is
just the sum that was

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.240
going to involve these terms.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.310
So I can let the sum enter,
and this is what you get.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:47.270
So you get w transpose
1/n xi xi transpose w.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:53.247
So this is just a number. w
transpose xi is just a number.

00:35:53.247 --> 00:35:55.580
But the moment you look at
something that looks like xi,

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.750
xi transpose, what is that?

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.310
Well, just look at
dimensionality, OK?

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:05.137
1 times d times d times 1 gives
you a number, which is 1 by 1.

00:36:05.137 --> 00:36:06.720
Now you're doing the
other way around.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.610
So what is this?

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.771
AUDIENCE: It's a matrix.

00:36:08.771 --> 00:36:09.812
LORENZO ROSASCO: It's a--

00:36:09.812 --> 00:36:10.286
AUDIENCE: Matrix.

00:36:10.286 --> 00:36:11.577
LORENZO ROSASCO: It's a matrix.

00:36:11.577 --> 00:36:15.590
And it's a matrix which is d
by d, and it's of rank 1, OK?

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.347
And what you do now is
that you sum them all up,

00:36:18.347 --> 00:36:20.180
and what you have is
that this quantity here

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.180
becomes what is called
the quadratic form.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:26.300
It is a matrix C, which
just looks like this.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.810
And it's squeezed in between
two vectors, w transpose and w.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.350
So now what you want
to do is that you

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:38.840
can rewrite this just this
way as maximizing the w--

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.320
sorry, finding the
unit norm vector w that

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.475
maximizes this quadratic form.

00:36:44.475 --> 00:36:46.100
And at this point,
you can still ask me

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.740
who cares, because
it's just keeping

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.530
on rewriting the same problem.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:54.230
But it turns out that
essentially using

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.390
Lagrange theorem, it is
relatively simple to do,

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.660
you can check that--

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:03.740
oh, so boring-- that the
solution of this problem

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:08.060
is the maximum eigenvector
of this matrix, OK?

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.490
So this you can
leave as an exercise.

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:13.340
Essentially, you take the
Lagrangian of this and use

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.610
a little bit of duality, and
you show that the [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.370
of this problem is just
the maximum eigen--

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:23.930
so the eigenvalues-- ugh,
the eigenvector corresponding

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:28.610
to the maximum eigenvalue
of the matrix C.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.800
So finding this
direction is just

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.810
solving an eigenvalue problem.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:33.310
OK.

00:37:36.274 --> 00:37:39.850
I think just do last few of
those slide, kind of cute.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.860
It's pretty simple, OK?

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.280
So the one part,
this line after lunch

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.689
is a bit there for
because I'm nice.

00:37:48.689 --> 00:37:51.230
But really, the only one part
which is a bit more complicated

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.950
is this one here.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:56.630
The rest is really just
very simple algebra.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.500
So what about k equal 2?

00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.660
I run out of time.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.350
But it turns out that
what you want to do

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:07.382
is basically if you say that
you want to look for a second--

00:38:07.382 --> 00:38:08.840
so you look at the
first direction.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.340
You solve it, and you know that
it's the first eigenvector--

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.290
the first eigenvector.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.206
And then let's say that
you add the constraint

00:38:14.206 --> 00:38:15.710
that the second
direction you find

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:19.124
has to be orthogonal
to the first direction.

00:38:19.124 --> 00:38:20.540
You might not want
to do this, OK?

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.545
But if you do, if
you say you add

00:38:22.545 --> 00:38:25.670
the orthogonality constraint,
then what you can check

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.170
is that you can repeat--

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.534
sorry, I didn't do it.

00:38:29.534 --> 00:38:31.700
It's on my note, the one
that I have on the website,

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.500
and the computation
is kind of cute.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.530
And what you see is that
the solution of this problem

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.660
looks exactly like
the one before,

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.970
only with this
additional constraint,

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.060
is exactly the
eigenvector corresponding

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.980
to the second largest
eigenvalue, OK?

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.439
And so you can keep on going.

00:38:49.439 --> 00:38:50.980
And so now this
gives you a way to go

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.040
from k equal to 1
to k bigger than 1,

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.530
and you can keep on going, OK?

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.690
So if you're looking
for the direction that

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.565
maximizes the variance
or the reconstruction,

00:39:00.565 --> 00:39:04.339
they turn out to be
the biggest eigen--

00:39:04.339 --> 00:39:06.380
the vectors-- ugh, the
eigenvectors corresponding

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.430
to the biggest eigenvalues of
this matrix C, which what you

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.470
can call it as a second
moment or covariance

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:14.380
matrix of the data.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.350
OK, so this is more
or less the end.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:20.380
This is the basic, basic,
basic version of this.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:24.970
You can mix this with pretty
much all the other stuff

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:25.900
we said today.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.620
So one is, how about trying to
use kernels to do a nonlinear

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.784
extension of this?

00:39:30.784 --> 00:39:32.950
So here we just looked at
the linear reconstruction.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.417
How about nonlinear
reconstruction?

00:39:34.417 --> 00:39:36.250
So what you would do
is that you would first

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.140
map the data in
some way and then

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.820
try to find some kind of
nonlinear dimensionality

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.390
reduction.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:44.980
You see that what I'm
doing here is that I'm just

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.840
using this linear--

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.496
it's just a linear
dimensionality reduction, just

00:39:49.496 --> 00:39:51.100
a linear operator.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.620
But what about
something nonlinear?

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.790
What if my data lie on
some kind of structure

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.240
that looked like that--

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.210
our beloved machine
learning Swiss roll.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:03.470
Well, if you do
PCA, well, you're

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:07.950
just going to find a plane that
cuts that thing somewhere, OK?

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.270
But if you try to embed the
data in some nonlinear way,

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.920
you could try to resolve this.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.830
And this has been
much of the research

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:17.650
done in the direction
of manifold learning.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:21.790
Here there are just
a few keywords--

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:25.270
kernel PCA is the easiest
version, Laplacian map,

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:28.870
eigenmaps, diffusion
maps, and so on, OK?

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:32.410
I only touch quickly
upon random projection.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.310
There is a whole
literature about those.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:38.290
The idea is, again, that
by multiplying the data

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.570
by random vectors, you can keep
the information in the data

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:43.120
and might be able
to reconstruct them

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.100
as well as to
preserve distances.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:52.780
Also, you can combine ideas from
sparsity with ideas from PCA.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.126
For example, you can say, what
if I want to know not only--

00:40:56.126 --> 00:40:58.000
I want to find something
like an eigenvector,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.210
but I would like the entries
of the eigenvector to be 0.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.520
So can I add here a
constraint which basically

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.470
says, among all
the unit vectors,

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.750
find the one whose
entries are most--

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:10.810
so I want to add an
L0 norm or L1 norm.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:12.580
So how can you do that, OK?

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.930
And this leads to sparse PCA
and other structured matrix

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.239
estimation problems, OK?

00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:19.780
So this is, again, something
I'm not going to tell you about,

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.640
but that's kind
of the beginning.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.650
And this, more or less, brings
us to the desert island,

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:28.500
and I'm done.
