00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.090
AMNON SHASHUA: So
unlike most of the talks

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.470
that you have been
given, I'm not

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.720
going to teach you
anything today.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.440
So it's not kind going to
be teaching type of talk.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.600
It will be more towards let's
look at the crystal ball

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.380
and try to see how
the future will unfold

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.240
and future where computer
vision is a major agent

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.160
in this transformative future.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.630
So I'll start with
transportation.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.270
This is the field where
Mobileye is active.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.090
And then I'll move towards
wearable computing, the field

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.230
where OrCam is active.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.830
These are two companies
that I co-founded.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.610
One, Mobileye in 1999
and OrCam in 2010.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.250
So before I just-- a few words
about the computer vision.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.940
I'm assuming that you all
know about computer vision.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.630
It's the science
of making computers

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.640
see and extract meaning out
of images, out of video.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.320
This is a field that
in the past 20 years,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.230
through machine learning,
has made a big jump.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.710
And in the past four years,
through deep learning,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.490
has made another jump where
there are certain narrow areas

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.350
in computer vision
and perception

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.380
where computers reach
human level perception

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.550
and even surpass it.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.240
Like facial recognition
is one of those areas.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.420
And the belief is that in many
narrow areas in computer vision

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.340
within the next five years we'll
be able to reach human level

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.600
perception.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.490
So it's a major branch of AI.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.760
It goes together
with machine learning

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.250
and as said, a major progress.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.420
And one very
important thing, which

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.330
is relevant to the industrial
impact of computer vision

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.340
is that cameras
are the lowest cost

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.810
sensor that you can imagine.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.050
A camera sensor
costs a few dollars.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.310
A lens costs a few dollars.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.540
All the rest is computing.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.340
And every sensor
needs computing.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.700
So if you can reach human
level perception with a camera

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.000
you have a sensor that
the cost is so low

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.240
that it can be everywhere.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.560
And that this is very--
this is very important.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.070
So I'll show you where
things are standing in terms

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.240
of avoiding a collision.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.430
So avoiding collision,
you have a camera.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.300
Behind the windscreen
looking, facing forward,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.290
analyzing the video
coming from the camera.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.230
And the purpose of this
analysis is to avoid collisions.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.230
So what does it mean
to avoid collisions?

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.000
The software needs
to detect vehicles,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.290
it need to detect pedestrians,
need to detect traffic lines,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.620
traffic signs, need to
detect traffic lights,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.160
detect lanes, to know where
the car is positioned relative

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.510
to the lanes.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.150
And then send a signal to
the car control systems

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.840
to avoid an accident.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.680
So let's look under the
hood what this means.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.280
So I'll let this run a bit until
all the information appears.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.380
So if we stop here,
what do we see?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.090
So the bounding
boxes around cars

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.130
means that the system
has detect cars.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.550
Red means that this
vehicle is in our path.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.140
The green line here is
the detection of the lane.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.640
This is a traffic--

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.260
this is a no entry traffic sign.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.165
This is a traffic light
being detected here.

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:41.790
These are the
pedestrians and cyclists.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.100
Even a pedestrian standing
here is being detected.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.101
Let's no-- let this
run a bit further.

00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:51.600
All right.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.480
So these pedestrians
crossing the street.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.330
So this is running at
about 36 frames per second.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.900
So now imagine also the
amount of computations

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.135
that are being running here.

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:07.350
Again, this is the traffic sign,
traffic light, pedestrians,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.090
pedestrians here.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.690
So this is-- this is what
the system does today,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.840
detect objects,
detect lane marks,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.160
measure distances
to the objects.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.880
And in case you are
about to hit an object,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.020
the car would engage.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.110
Engage, at first it
will give warnings.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.920
Then later it will apply
automatic autonomous braking

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.670
in order to avoid the accident.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.800
And here is a list of
many, many functions

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.020
that the camera does
in terms of detecting

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.990
objects and detecting--
trying to interpret

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:46.800
the visual field at details that
are increasing over the years.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.910
Now computer vision is
also creating a disruption.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.870
So if you would ask an
engineer say, 15 years ago,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.720
what is a camera good
for in this space?

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.100
The engineer would
say the camera

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.872
is good for detecting lanes.

00:05:00.872 --> 00:05:02.580
Because there's no
other sensor that can,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.410
you know, find the lane marks,
not a radar, not a laser

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.280
scanner.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.270
And it may be good for helping
the radar infusion-- radar

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.080
camera fusion to compensate
for shortcomings of the radar.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.990
Traffic signs, OK it, will
be good for traffic signs.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.170
But that's it.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.800
But what happened
over the years is

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.400
that the camera slowly
started taking territory

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.200
from the radar.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.260
Until today, the camera is
really the primary sensor

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.550
for active safety.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.630
Active safety is all this
area for avoiding accidents.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.230
And you can see this
through this chart.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.790
So in 2007, now we launched
the first camera radar fusion.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.170
So there's no disruption there.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.660
This is what normally people
would think a camera is good

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.000
for, combining with a radar.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.200
2008, camera is also doing
traffic sign recognition.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.910
No disruption there.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.500
2010, camera's doing
pedestrian detection.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.210
No disruption there
because there's

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.880
no other sensor that can
reliably detect pedestrians.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.270
Because they emit radar
very, very weakly.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.210
And pedestrians mostly
stationary object.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.770
And radars are not good at
detecting stationary objects.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.390
But then in 2011,
there's the first camera

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.769
only forward collision warning.

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:27.560
And that was the
beginning of a disruption.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.270
So forward collision warning
is detect a vehicle in front

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.796
and provide a warning if
you are about to collide

00:06:32.796 --> 00:06:33.420
with a vehicle.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.300
And this was a
function that typically

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.130
was in the territory of radars.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.100
So a radar sensor is very
good at detecting vehicles,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.990
very good at ranging,
very, very accurately can

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.520
get the range of a vehicle,
say 100 meters away up

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.510
to an accuracy of
a few centimeters.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.210
No camera can reach
those accuracies.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.710
So nobody believed that one
day a camera will take over

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.120
the radar and do this function.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.820
And this is what
happened in 2011.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.350
And why did this happen?

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.790
This happened because of
a commercial constraint.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.700
The regulator, the
American regulator,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.220
it's National Highway Safety
Transportation Agency,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:18.390
NHSTA, decided that by 2011 all
cars need to have as an option

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.600
two functions, forward collision
warning and lane departure

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.980
warning.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.590
Now this creates a problem
because forward collision

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.062
warning requires a radar.

00:07:27.062 --> 00:07:28.770
Lane departure warning
requires a camera.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.280
So now put two sensors in
the car, it's expensive.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.560
If you can do it with one
sensor, like with a camera,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.430
then you save a lot of money.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.560
So this pushed the car
industry to adopt the idea

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.020
that the camera can do
forward collision warning.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.520
And like all disruptions,
once you start small

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.950
you kind of grow
very, very fast.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.270
So in 2013 the
camera is not only

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.800
providing warning,
but also safe distance

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.220
keeping to the car in front.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.400
It's called adaptive
cruise control.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.410
Then 2013 also provides
emergency braking.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.755
So the camera not only
decides that you're

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:06.630
about to collide with
a vehicle, it will also

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.460
apply the brakes for you.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.350
So 2013 was only
partial braking.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.340
So to avoid the accident up
to 30 kilometers per hour.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.810
And then in 2015, this
was few months ago,

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.300
the camera is now
involved in full braking.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.420
It's one G-Force of braking
avoiding an accident of about

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.790
70 - 80 kilometers per hour.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.460
And mitigating an
accident up to 220

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.920
kilometers per hour,
just the camera.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.039
So the camera is taking over
and becoming the primary sensor

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:41.580
in this area of active safety.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.589
Now, why is that?

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.630
As I said, these are the
milestones of the camera

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.830
disruption, is first the
camera has the highest density

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.110
of information as a sensor.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.970
You know, laser
scanner or radar,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.680
the amount of pixels
per angle, per degree

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.700
is much, much smaller.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.847
It's orders of magnitude
smaller than a camera.

00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:06.180
So you have a lot, a lot of
information from the camera.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.730
It's the lowest cost sensor.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.940
And also the cameras are getting
better in terms of performance

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.510
under low light.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.510
So with a camera today
you can do much more,

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.940
not only because computing
has progressed, not only

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.550
because algorithms
are now better,

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.040
but also because the
physics of the camera

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.010
are progressing over
time, especially

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.780
the light sensitivity
of the camera.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.930
So we also came
to the conclusion

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.200
that we need to build our own
hardware and our own chip.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.250
And these are very, very
advanced microprocessors

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.930
that they can per silicon
area are about 10 times more

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.550
efficient than any
general purpose chip.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.990
And I'll not spend
more time on this.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:55.530
And so this field
has two major trends.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.880
One, on the left hand
side, is the active safety,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.430
which is driven by regulators.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.690
So the regulators see that
there is a sensor that is

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.060
very low cost and saves lives.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.250
So what does the regular do?

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.160
They incentivize this kind of
function to the car industry

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.470
by coupling it to star ratings.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.460
So if you want to get your four
star or five stars the NCAP

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.580
stars on the car, you have to
have this kind of technology

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.050
as a standard fit in the car.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.880
So this pushes the
industry by mandates.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.080
It pushes the industry to
have active safety installed

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.710
in every car.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:40.320
So by 2018 every new car
would have such a system.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.080
The left hand side is
the trend to the future,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.410
which is autonomous driving.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.600
Now autonomous driving
has two facets.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.670
One is bringing the
probability of an accident

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.610
to infinitesimally
small probability.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.460
So zero-- zero accidents.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.740
Because the more you
delegate the driving

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.420
experience to a robotic
system, the less

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.910
the chance of an accident.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.440
So it brings us to an era where
there will be no accidents.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.160
But not less importantly,
it has the potential

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.180
to transform the entire
transportation business.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.456
How we own cars,
how we build cars,

00:11:21.456 --> 00:11:23.670
the number of cars
that would be produced.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.140
And I'll spend a bit more time
about that as I go forward.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.279
Now, in terms of the left
hand side, the regulation,

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.070
this is an example.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:38.300
So you see here a Nissan
Qashquai 2014 has five stars.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.690
And to know how to get the
five stars what you see here,

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:41.690
these are all the tests.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.800
These are autonomous
emergency braking tests.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.850
The car needs to detect the
car in front, the target car,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.340
and apply the brakes
before the collision.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.080
And the car is being tested.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.520
And without that they'll
not get the five stars.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.860
You can see this also
in the number of chips

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.190
that have been shipped.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.830
So every car has a chip.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.050
So this chip, the
microprocessor,

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.820
is getting the information
from the camera

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.150
and all the algorithms are
on this microprocessor.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.700
So we started
launching this in 2007.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.650
So in the first five years
there were one million chips,

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.080
so one million cars
with the technology.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.530
And then in 2013
alone, 1.3 million.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.440
Then you see here, 2014, 2.7.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.780
This year is going to
be about five million.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.640
So you see this doubling.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.800
And this is really the
effect of the regulation.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.270
So in many industries
regulation is an impediment.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.630
In this industry, regulation
is something good.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:46.160
It pushes the industry to
install these kinds of systems,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.310
you know, standard.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.920
OK.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.130
So another example of how
this is moving, there's

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.000
also an increasing awareness.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.170
So this is a commercial from
2014 Super Bowl by Hyundai.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.172
So Hyundai is showcasing their
new vehicle called Genesis.

00:13:05.172 --> 00:13:06.630
Now, there are many
things that you

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.256
can show when you want to
showcase a new vehicle.

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.130
You can talk about the
design of the vehicle.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.060
You could talk about the
engine, the infotainment.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.350
But they chose to talk
about the active safety.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.682
So I'll show you.

00:13:18.682 --> 00:13:24.090
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.500
- Remember when only
Dad could save the day?

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.007
Auto emergency braking on the
all new Genesis from Hyundai.

00:13:33.007 --> 00:13:33.590
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.860
AMNON SHASHUA: OK.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.140
So this is the camera
behind the windscreen,

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.370
detecting the car in
front, or a pedestrian,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.490
and will break
before the collision.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.316
Now to show you
what this is about--

00:13:44.316 --> 00:13:45.440
so that was the commercial.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.790
So in a commercial you can
show anything you like.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.820
So now I'll show you something
really from the field.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.890
So in 2010 Volvo introduced
the first pedestrian detection.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.945
So the same thing,
detect a pedestrian

00:13:59.945 --> 00:14:02.570
and if you are about to collide
with a pedestrian the car would

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.120
brake, apply the
brakes automatically.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.110
So in 2010 they had about
5,000 journalistic events,

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.350
where they put a reporter
behind the steering wheel,

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.350
tell the reporter to
drive towards a mannequin,

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.940
toward a doll, and
low and behold the car

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.470
would brake just before--

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:22.770
a fraction of a second
before you hit the doll.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.460
But then when you buy the car
you can do your own testing.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.120
So I downloaded
from the internet,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.900
its a bunch of Polish guys.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.780
And it's a bit funny
but you'll actually

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.270
get a good feeling of
what this system does

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.860
by looking at this clip.

00:14:50.164 --> 00:14:50.915
OK?

00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:55.217
So this is automatic
emergency braking.

00:14:55.217 --> 00:14:58.140
Today it works, it
avoids accidents

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.610
about 70 kilometers per hour.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.170
OK?

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.770
So now you have a better idea
of what I'm talking about.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.900
So now let's go into the future.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.550
So this was just
setting the baseline.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.050
OK.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.890
What is active safety?

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.040
Where's computer
vision inside this?

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.340
So now let's look in
the next four years.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:27.850
And the idea is to evolve
this kind of technology

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.670
to a point where you
can delegate the driving

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.620
experience to a robotic system.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.410
And then the question is,
what needs to be done.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.110
And this slide shows that
there are two paradigms.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.230
And the reality is somewhere
in between these two paradigms.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.840
The right hand side
is where we are today.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.830
You are based only on sensing.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:47.560
You have camera.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.400
Maybe you have also a radar, or
laser scanner for redundancy.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.110
You get the information
from the sensors.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.800
You have algorithms that try
to interpret the visual field

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.430
and take action in
case of an accident,

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.840
or control the vehicle.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.950
On the left hand side
is the extreme case,

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.630
is the Google approach,
where there is little

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.560
sensing involved.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.380
It's a lot of recording.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.660
So you prerecord your drive.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.420
Once you have prerecorded the
drive all what you need to do

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.630
is to match your sensing
to the prerecorded drive.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.250
Once you've found the match,
you know your position exactly.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.707
So you don't need to
know to detect lanes.

00:16:25.707 --> 00:16:27.040
You know all the moving objects.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.580
Because the recording contains
only stationary objects.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.790
So all the moving
objects pop out.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.309
So that the load on the
sensing is much, much smaller

00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:38.350
than in the case where
you didn't do it pre-drive

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.902
and you didn't record.

00:16:39.902 --> 00:16:41.860
This recording, the
problem with the recording,

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.650
is that we are talking
about tons of data.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:49.330
It's a 360 degree, 3D recording,
at several frames per second.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.160
So the amount of data is huge.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.060
So there's issues of how you
manage this, how you record it,

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.860
and how you update
this over time.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.520
Because you have to continuously
update this kind of data.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.359
And reality is going to
be somewhere in between.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:12.160
So the first leap that is
undergoing and happening

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.560
in the next five years is to
reach human level perception.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.790
Now it sounds very,
very ambitious.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.930
But there's lots of indications
that it is not science fiction.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.530
It is really-- there is
a very high probability

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.880
that one can reach this.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.400
So in certain areas,
like face recognition,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.600
certain categorization tasks--

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.230
now if you look at the
academic achievements,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.160
they have surpassed
human level perception.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.510
I'll spend a few
slides on this later.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.010
So going from adaptive--

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.890
going from driver assist
to human level perception,

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.530
first, we need to extend
the list of objects.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.080
Not only vehicles
and pedestrians,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:59.320
but vehicles at any angles, know
about 1,000 different object

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.950
categories in the
scene, know about how

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:07.150
to predict a path using context,
which today is not being used.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.860
Detailed road
interpretation, knowing

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.600
about curbs and
barriers and guards,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.690
it's all the stuff that when we
look at the road we naturally

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.220
interpret it very, very easily.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.730
These are the things that needs
to be done in order to reach

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.530
human level perception.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:25.420
And the tool to do this is
the deep layered networks,

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.840
which I'll spend a few slides
about this in a moment.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.430
And the need for
context, so these

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.725
are examples, for
example, path planning.

00:18:32.725 --> 00:18:34.240
You want to fuse
all the information

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.850
available from the image, not
only to look for the lanes,

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.974
because in many situations
you look at an image you

00:18:38.974 --> 00:18:40.010
don't see lanes.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.130
But a human observer
would very easily

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.240
know where the path is just
from looking at the context.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.720
In modeling data environment,
ultimately every pixel

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.574
give you a category.

00:18:50.574 --> 00:18:52.240
Tell me where this
pixel is coming from,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.948
a pedestrian, from a
vehicle, from inside

00:18:53.948 --> 00:18:58.210
of a vehicle, barrier,
curb, guardrail, lamp post,

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.580
so forth and so forth.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.060
3D modeling of a vehicle.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.300
So put a 3D bounding
box around the vehicle

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.510
so that we can know which side
of a vehicle I'm looking at,

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.550
whether it's the front,
or rear, left side,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.510
right side, what is the angle.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.040
Know everything about
vehicles as moving objects

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.840
and do a lot of
scene recognition.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.120
I'll give some examples
about that later.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.290
So just deep networks,
I know that you have--

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.325
you all know about
deep networks.

00:19:25.325 --> 00:19:27.550
I'll just spend
a few slides just

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.370
to state what is
the impact there,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.620
not the impact from the
point of view of a scientist,

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.900
but the impact from the point
of view of a technologist.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.630
Because there isn't much
science behind this.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:46.780
So the real turning
point was 2012.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:51.000
2012, you know,
the AlexNet, they

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.340
show they built a
convolutional net that

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.940
was able to work on
the ImageNet data set

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.280
and reach a performance
level, which

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.380
was more or less
double the performance

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.030
level of what was done before.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.990
This is another
network by Fergus.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.480
Very, very similar concept
of convolution pooling.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.870
Convolution pooling
two-three dense layers

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.060
and you get the output.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.950
This is the ImageNet data set.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.150
You have about 1,000 categories
over one million images.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.390
And these categories
are very challenging.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.150
You know, you look at the
images of a sailing vessel

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.050
or images of a husky,
the variation is huge.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.650
It's a really very
difficult task.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.950
2011 the top five--

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:42.520
so the task is that you need
to give a short list of five

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.280
categories.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.180
And if the correct categories
is among the top five

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.710
then you succeeded.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:52.220
And the performance
was about 26% error.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.750
And this AlexNet reached 16%.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.970
So it's almost double
the performance.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.200
So this caught the
attention of the community.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.910
It's a big leap from 26% to 16%.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.280
Now if you look what happened
since then, so 2012 for this

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.050
ImageNet competition there
was one out of six competitors

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.580
use deep networks.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.860
A year later 17 out of 24
competitors used deep networks.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.580
A year later 31 out of
32 using deep networks.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.354
So deep networks
took over basically.

00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:29.020
If you look in terms
of the performance,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.030
of the human
performance is about 5%.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:43.090
And right now we are at 6%, 5%,
by the latest 2015 competitors.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.380
People start cheating.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.630
So I think this is
more or less Baidu was

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.970
caught cheating on this test.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.390
So I think 5% is more or
less where things are going.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.390
And this is human
level perception.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:59.030
Another-- another big success
was the face recognition.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.180
So this is a data set
called face recognition

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.470
in the wild, which contains
pictures of celebrities

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.850
where every celebrity you
have pictures, you know,

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.920
along a spectrum of
many, many years.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.330
You can see the actor
when he was 20 years old

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.930
and then when he's
70-80 years old.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.230
Even for humans, this
task is quite challenging,

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.910
knowing whether two pictures
are from the same person or not.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:28.380
And the human level
performance is 97.5% correct.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:33.180
Now if you look at techniques
not using deep networks,

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.390
they reached 91.4%.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.620
And in 2014 a group by
Facebook and Lior Wolf

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:45.600
from Tel Aviv University,
they built a deep network

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.400
to do face recognition
and reached

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.780
97.3%, which is very, very
close to human perception.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.980
And since then people have
reach 99% on this database.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.770
And again, human level
perception is 97.5.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.060
So this is another area where
these deep networks, also

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.050
in speech.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:08.720
This is a recent paper by
Baidu headed by Andrew Ng.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.440
They surpassed,
just doing an end

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:16.890
to end network which learns
also the structured prediction,

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.062
better performance than
Siri, Cortana, Google Now.

00:23:20.062 --> 00:23:21.480
OK?

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.660
So the impact for
automotive is that networks

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:30.430
are very good at multi-class So
the more categories you have,

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.630
the better the performance
of the network would be.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.050
Very good at using context,
imagining or planning a path.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.740
So taking an image as an input
and output would be the path.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.840
And you're cutting short
of all the processes

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:48.160
of looking for lanes and
this kind of algorithms.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.090
Network will be ideal
for pixel level labeling.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.850
For every pixel
give me a category.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.320
And you can use the networks
for sensor integration,

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.370
for determining the control of
the vehicle by fusing a lot,

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.210
a lot of information coming
from various cameras.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.210
So the challenge of
using deep networks

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.350
is that deep networks
are very, very large.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.290
They're not designed
for real time.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.320
The networks that you find in
academic papers and the success

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.860
are for easy problems.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.860
The problems that
I've shown right now,

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.330
the ImageNet, the
face recognition,

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.420
are relatively
considered easy problems

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:29.310
in the context of interpreting
the image for autonomous

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.960
driving.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.820
So let me show you what are
the things that one can do.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.380
Let's start with
the path planning.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:41.910
So this clip that I'll show you
here the purpose of the network

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.020
is to determine the path.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.310
So this is the green line.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.990
Now these clips are from
scenes where it will

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.520
be impossible to detect lanes.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.440
Because there's simply
no-- simply no lanes.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.010
If you look at this, any
lane detection system

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:00.210
would find nothing in
this kind of scene.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.700
Yet when you look
at this image, you

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.400
have no problem in
determining where the path is.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.807
Because you're looking at
the entire image context.

00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:09.390
And this is what the
network is doing.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.840
It's being fed the input
layer is the image,

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.810
the output layer
is this green line.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.050
Or for example, if you
at this urban setting.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.880
There are no lanes
in an urban setting.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.980
Yet the system can
predict where the path

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.310
is by fusing information
from the entire context.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.280
These are roads in
California where

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.190
they have these reflectors
called Botts dots.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.610
It's almost impossible
to reliably, you know,

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:42.630
fit lanes to these
kinds of information.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.180
Yet if you look at this
holistic path planning

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.900
it reliably can tell
you where it is.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.600
Let's look at free space.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.256
So free space, the
idea of when you

00:25:53.256 --> 00:25:54.630
want to do autonomous
driving you

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:55.920
need to know where not to drive.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.420
Right?

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.250
You don't want to
drive towards the curb.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.625
It's not only that
you don't want

00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:01.350
to hit other moving objects.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:02.640
That's the easy part.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.250
You don't want to hit a
barrier or a guardrail.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.950
So you want to know
where the free space is.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.590
So you can think of a
network that for every pixel

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.450
will give you a label.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:16.290
And let's now focus only on the
label of road versus not road.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.450
So all the pixel green are road.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.980
Everything else is not road.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.930
So you can see that
the green is not

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.450
going over the curb,
which is-- which is nice.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:30.234
But let's have it
run a bit more.

00:26:30.234 --> 00:26:31.650
And then I'll stop
it at the place

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.420
where you'll see where
the power of context.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.380
Says let's assume
I stop it here.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.975
Now look at the sidewalk there.

00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:44.100
The color of the sidewalk
and the color of the road

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.930
is identical.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.330
The height of the curb
is about one centimeter.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.990
So it's not that the
height here, the geometry--

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.300
it's basically the context.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.180
The network figured out because
there is a parked car there.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.300
That part is not
part of the road.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.390
So in order to make
this judgment correctly,

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.640
one needs to not just look at
a small area around the pixel

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.429
and decide whether
it's road or not road.

00:27:08.429 --> 00:27:10.720
One needs to collect information
from the entire image.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.490
This is the power of context.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.130
And this is something
that the network can do.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.640
You can see here, where
the blue and red lines.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.590
Red means it's on a vehicle.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:25.040
Blue that it's on
a physical barrier.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.860
So if I run this back here--

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.390
and this is done frame by frame.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.040
So it's a single frame thing.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.600
Same thing here, this height
is one or two centimeters.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.870
The color of the sidewalk and
the color of the road it's

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:38.882
identical.

00:27:38.882 --> 00:27:40.840
So being able to make
the correct judgment here

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.560
is very, very challenging.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.320
And this is where a
network can succeed.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.480
Here the network also
predicts that this

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.490
is a code for being a curb.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:57.470
The red is the side of a
vehicle or front of the vehicle.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.730
And the next one it
predicts that this

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:06.670
is part of a guardrail,
the coding of this

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:07.640
is part of a guardrail.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.730
So the system has
about 15 categories,

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.070
guardrail, curb,
barrier, and so forth.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:16.030
Let's keep the
questions for later.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:16.840
And so forth.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.950
So this is one area we
call semantic free space.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.840
So for every pixel in the
scene tell me what it is.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.340
Of course, I'm
interested-- first

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.590
and foremost I'm interested
to know where the road is.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.990
And then at the edges of where
the road ends to know what

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.680
is the label.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.690
Is it a side of a vehicle,
front of a vehicle,

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.050
rear of a vehicle.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:40.530
Is it a curb barrier
guardrail and so forth.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.570
And this, again, is
done by deep network.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.750
I'll skip this one.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:51.470
And then you can apply this
from cameras from any angle.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.770
So this is a camera
looking at a corner,

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.410
looking at the 45
degrees on the right.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.350
So the system can know
where the free space is.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.390
This is a camera from the
side, with a fish eye.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.720
Again, using the same kind
of technology the system

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.355
can know where
the free space is.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.880
Same thing here.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.440
Here as well, day night.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.240
3D modeling, 3D
modeling is to be

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.430
able to put a bounding
box, a 3D bounding box,

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.450
around the vehicle.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.380
And the color here is that the
green is front, red is rear,

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.250
blue is right hand side, and
yellow is left hand side.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.670
If you let this run--

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.670
all right.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:32.950
Now the importance of
putting a 3D bounding

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.800
box around the vehicle
is that now you can

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.850
place a camera at any angle.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.560
So it's not only
camera looking forward,

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.490
but the camera at any
angle, because the way

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.680
a vehicle is defined is
invariant to the camera

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.310
position, so this is kind of a
preparation for putting cameras

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.620
all around the
vehicle at the 360--

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.520
360 degree.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.860
Scene recognition,
for example, being--

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.770
to know that this
is a bump, is also

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.280
being done by a network
that takes an image

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.010
and outputs where the bumps are.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.190
The same thing--
same thing here.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:13.600
More complicated than that is
knowing where this top line is.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.410
So when you go and detect
traffic lights-- so

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.366
detecting traffic lights
is the easy problem.

00:30:20.366 --> 00:30:22.480
A more complicated
problem is to know

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.840
the relevancy of the traffic
lights, which traffic light is

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.340
relevant to what direction.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.620
The third one, the
most difficult problem,

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.110
is to detect the stop line.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:35.470
The problem with stop line is
that when you see the stop line

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.500
it's a bit too late.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.980
You see this stop line
20-30 meters away.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.990
So it's too late
to start stopping

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.820
and have a smooth stopping.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.790
You want to predict where the
stop line is 60-70 meters away.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:50.319
So here, you want your
algorithm, or your network,

00:30:50.319 --> 00:30:52.360
to understand that you
are approaching a junction

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.000
and start estimating where the
stop line should be so they can

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.530
start slowly reducing your
speed, such that by the time

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.330
you see where the
stop line is you

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.110
already reduced your
speed considerably.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.760
I'll skip this.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.470
Knowing lane assignment.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.810
Knowing how many lanes
are and which lane you are

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.940
is also done by a network.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.780
So the network will
give a probability

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.690
whether that this is a
lane, this is a lane.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.685
For example, it knows
that this is not a lane.

00:31:18.685 --> 00:31:23.380
It has here red,
zero probability.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.400
So as you can see here--

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.450
I'll skip this one.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:30.560
So these networks, so for
every task there is a network.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.240
And these networks are quite
sophisticated in accessing,

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.200
integrating a context
at traffic light.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.780
I'll skip this
with traffic light.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.850
So multiple cameras,
this is how it is--

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:44.620
it looks like.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:49.690
You have the red ones are three
cameras behind the windscreen.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.500
One is about 180 degrees.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.900
The other one is about 50.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.000
The third one is
about 25 degrees.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.800
And then there are
another five cameras

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:02.290
around the car that give
you all 360 degrees.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:07.210
And this kind of configuration,
first launch of it,

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.820
in a series produced
car, is going to be 2016.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.470
So I'm not talking
about science fiction.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:20.650
These are how images look
from some of these cameras.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:25.630
So let me show you a first
clip of automated driving.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:26.770
This is kind of a funny--

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.970
funny clip.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:33.109
This is an actor who played
a major role in Star Trek.

00:32:33.109 --> 00:32:34.150
So I'll not say his name.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:37.420
Let's see whether you can
identify him yourself.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.250
And he has a program
called-- program

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.290
for kids called Reading Rainbow.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.920
So this program is 20 years old.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.520
And he came to
Israel and he wanted

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:50.560
to drive the autonomous vehicle
that we have for his kids

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.900
program.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.700
So he was driving my car.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.870
So my car is autonomous.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.550
I can drive from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.485
without touching
the steering wheel.

00:32:59.485 --> 00:33:02.270
It's-- I do that all the time.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.850
So he was driving it.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.110
And it's a bit funny.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.480
So let's-- but you'll get
a feeling of what this is.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.500
So let's run this.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.727
It's two minutes.

00:33:12.727 --> 00:33:16.720
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.350
- Yes.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.490
They can.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:20.050
That's because
technology companies,

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.120
like Mobileye here
in Israel, are

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.024
about to introduce self-driving
technologies to the world.

00:33:25.024 --> 00:33:26.440
AMNON SHASHUA: You
know who he is?

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.981
- In the not too
distant future, just

00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:29.530
like in a science fiction movie.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.420
A driver will be
able to hop in a car,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.700
tell it where you want
it to go, and voila,

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.440
the car will do the rest.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.640
So right now I'm driving
like everybody does.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.290
My hands are on
the steering wheel

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:45.230
and my foot is on the brake,
or the pedal, as required.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.548
And I'm in control of the car.

00:33:47.548 --> 00:34:01.332
But when I take my foot
off the pedal and do this,

00:34:01.332 --> 00:34:04.260
now the car is driving itself.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.830
Wow.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.110
This really is amazing.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:19.350
I feel really safe with the
car doing all of the driving.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:20.110
OK.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:20.820
Now watch this.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.010
And this is something
that no one should ever

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.909
do in a regular car, ever.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:32.760
Wow.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.587
That was freaky.

00:34:34.587 --> 00:34:35.170
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:36.010
AMNON SHASHUA: OK?

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:40.290
So anyone from the young
people know who he is?

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.370
So this is Jordy,
from Star Trek.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:43.480
He had this visor.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.560
He was blind.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.170
He had a visor.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:48.670
OK.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.400
So let's spend a
few minutes to talk

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.040
about what is the impact
of autonomous driving

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.090
and how it's going to unfold.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.900
So this is far from
science fiction.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.960
It's actually
unfolding as we speak.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.850
The first hands free driving
on highways is coming out now.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.530
The first one is Tesla.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:12.010
They have already launched--
they made this public

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.670
a week or two ago.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.110
Their first beta drivers
are driving with the system.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.920
And I presume within a month
it will be also installed

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.410
to all other drivers.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:25.470
And this is-- you
can do hands free

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.060
when driving on a
highway, unlimited speed.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.520
So you can drive
at highway speeds,

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:35.140
let go of the steering wheel,
and the car will drive.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.500
GM already announced
that middle of 2016

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.690
they have the super
cruise, more or less

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.570
the same kind of functionality.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.070
Audi also announced 2016.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.720
And these are just
the first comers.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.470
We are working with about
13 car manufacturers that

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.530
within the next three
years, three to four years,

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.594
having this kind of capability.

00:35:58.594 --> 00:36:00.010
So this will be
in the mainstream.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.770
Now what I put there in
red is that the driver

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.084
still has primary responsibility
and has to be alert.

00:36:05.084 --> 00:36:07.000
That means that the
technology is not perfect.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.230
It could make mistakes.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.090
Therefore, the
driver has to be--

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.520
is still the primary--

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.350
has the primary responsibility.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.410
So at this stage there's
no disruption here.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.780
It's just a nice
feature to have.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.670
For the car industry,
this is the first step

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:26.290
to start practicing towards
reaching autonomous driving.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:30.140
The second step starts 2016, and
this is with the eight cameras

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.700
that I showed you slide before.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.411
Here, the car can drive
autonomously from highway

00:36:36.411 --> 00:36:36.910
to highway.

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:40.220
So on ramp, off ramps,
are done autonomously.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.200
So you-- you with Google Maps or
whatever navigation program you

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.240
chart your route, and until the
car reaches city boundaries it

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.400
will go all--

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.090
go autonomously.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.850
From highway to highway it will
switch from highway to highway

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.340
and do that autonomously.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.000
Still, the driver has primary
responsibility, and is alert.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.720
So there's no-- nothing
here is transformative.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.070
It's a nice feature.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:09.670
Again, it's part of a phased
approach of the car industry

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.250
to start practicing.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:16.765
Starting from 2018, would come
the first small disruption.

00:37:16.765 --> 00:37:20.080
The first small disruption
is that technology

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.790
would reach a level in
which driver is responsible.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.600
The driver must be there
but not necessarily alert.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.090
So it means that the
driver is an attendant.

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.430
The driver is monitoring
just like a pilot

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.220
sitting in an airplane while
the plane is in auto-pilot.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.560
The driver needs to be there
in case there is a problem.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.672
The system will give
a grace period of time

00:37:40.672 --> 00:37:42.505
until the driver needs
to take back control.

00:37:42.505 --> 00:37:47.130
So it's not taking control
in instant-- immediately.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.200
And so this transition
from primary responsibility

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.990
to monitoring, like
in aviation, will be

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:56.297
the first disruption, the
beginnings of a disruption.

00:37:56.297 --> 00:37:58.630
So let's try to imagine what
kind of disruption this is.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.180
So let's take Uber
as an example.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:05.200
So today you have free time.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.560
So you own a car.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.280
You have a free time, say
between 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.960
So you take your car and
apply Uber and take passengers

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.030
and earn some money.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.290
That's Uber today.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:21.070
Now let's look at 2018 - 2019.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.380
You have zero skills and
you don't have a car.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.420
All what you have, you
have a driver license.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.480
So you are willing
to be an attendant.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.900
So you say, OK, now
I have free time.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.559
An Uber car would come
with an attendant.

00:38:33.559 --> 00:38:35.100
You switch places
with the attendant.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.867
You sit behind the steering
wheel and you do nothing.

00:38:37.867 --> 00:38:38.950
You don't control the car.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.190
You don't control the
passengers who are coming

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.660
who are being taken by the car.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.580
You simply sit there.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.160
Zero skills, therefore your
payment is very, very small.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.750
So now these cars can drive
24/7 because attendant can

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.600
be replaced every hour or so.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.830
So here we have
another business model

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.620
which makes this public
transportation, the Uber type

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.050
of public transportation,
now much more powerful

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.740
than it is today.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.126
So this is kind of the
beginning of disruption.

00:39:09.126 --> 00:39:10.250
What will be the next step?

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:16.630
The next step 2020-2022,
imagine that a driverless car

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.730
can drive without passengers.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:22.480
So this is one step
before you can allow a car

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.850
to drive autonomously.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.920
So without passengers means
that all what you need to prove

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.510
is that the car,
your car, would not

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.860
hit other cars or pedestrians.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.387
But if it hits an
infrastructure nobody gets

00:39:33.387 --> 00:39:35.470
killed because there are
no passengers in the car.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.110
No passengers meaning
nobody in the car.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.542
Now this is already
a major disruption

00:39:40.542 --> 00:39:43.000
because what it means, it means
that the household does not

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.970
need to own multiple cars.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:46.930
One car is enough.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.280
I drive to work with the car.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.260
I send the car back home.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.470
Takes my wife, take her
to work, comes back home.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.320
You get the picture.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.400
So this is kind of a beginning
of a major disruption.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.960
Then about 2025 - 2030,
sufficient experience

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.870
with mapping data, car
to car communication,

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.400
one can imagine how
these cars would

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.590
be completely autonomously.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:12.272
And that is where the
major disruption happens.

00:40:12.272 --> 00:40:13.420
OK?

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.000
So this is autonomous driving.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.900
Let me go to the second part
about wearable computing.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.320
And then we can take questions.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.850
So this will be much shorter.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:28.300
So again, computer
vision, but now the camera

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.350
is not beside us,
like in the car.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:31.850
The camera is on us.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:34.930
Now if the camera is on
us, the first question

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.280
that you would ask, who
needs a camera to be on you?

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.280
Right?

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.220
So the first market segment
for something like this

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.130
are the blind and
visually impaired.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.690
So the way to imagine this.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.074
you are visually impaired
or a blind person

00:40:51.074 --> 00:40:52.990
so you don't see well
or you don't see at all,

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.710
or you don't see well.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.209
So it's very, very
difficult for you

00:40:55.209 --> 00:40:56.960
to negotiate the visual world.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.980
You cannot read anything unless
it's few centimeters from

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.000
your eye.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.220
You cannot recognize people
unless they start talking

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:03.719
to you.

00:41:03.719 --> 00:41:05.409
So you can recognize
their voice.

00:41:05.409 --> 00:41:07.450
You cannot cross the street
because you don't see

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:08.892
the traffic light.

00:41:08.892 --> 00:41:11.350
You cannot go on a bus because
you don't think what the bus

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:12.110
number is.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.930
So basically you are very,
very constrained, very limited.

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.495
Now let's assume that you have
a helper standing beside you.

00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:20.770
Now this helper is
relatively intelligent

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:24.795
and has correct eyesight.

00:41:24.795 --> 00:41:26.680
Now the helper
looks at you, sees

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.020
where you are pointing
your hands, for example,

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.861
or pointing your gaze,
looks at the scene,

00:41:32.861 --> 00:41:35.110
understands what kind of
information you want to know,

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:37.510
and whispers to your
ear the information.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.965
So say you want to catch a bus.

00:41:39.965 --> 00:41:42.340
You know that the bus is coming
because you hear the bus,

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.970
maybe you see a silhouette.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.220
So you look at that direction.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.500
The helper looks at the bus.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.670
It sees that there is a bus.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.410
Tells you what
the bus number is.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:51.679
You want to cross the street.

00:41:51.679 --> 00:41:53.720
You know the traffic light
is more or less there.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.750
But you cannot-- you don't know
what the color of the traffic

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:56.740
light is.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.334
So the helper
looks at your gaze,

00:41:58.334 --> 00:42:00.000
sees that there's a
traffic light there.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.440
Tell you it's a green light.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.730
You're opening a newspaper.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.350
You point someone
on the newspaper,

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.650
the helper would
read you the article.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.300
Or there is a street name.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.560
You point towards
the street name.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.960
The helper would
look at the scene,

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.010
understand that there
is a text in the wild,

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.460
and simply read you
the street name.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.390
A familiar face appears,
the helper will whisper,

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:24.700
you know, Joe has now--
is now in front of you.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.060
And so forth.

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.290
So if you have now replaced
this helper with computer vision

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.810
you can imagine how
this could help someone

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.100
who is visually impaired.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.470
So let me show you--

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:39.530
so first of all, the number of
visually impaired is quite big.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:43.960
So the number of blind people
in the US is about 1.5 million.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.100
That's not big.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.310
The number of visually
impaired, and it's people that

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:52.180
their ailment cannot be
corrected through lenses,

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.400
is about 26 million.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.630
So this is a sizable number.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:58.750
World wide is above
400 million people

00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:59.960
who are visually impaired.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.950
And they don't have much
technology to help them.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:05.710
So this is what OrCam is doing.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:08.767
It's a camera which
clips on eyeglasses.

00:43:08.767 --> 00:43:11.350
And there is a computing device,
which you put in your pocket.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.240
And the way you interact with
the device is with your hand,

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.110
with your finger.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.750
Because the camera is on you
it could see also your hand.

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.330
Once you point,
the camera starts

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.700
to extract information
from the scene and talks

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.527
to you through an earpiece.

00:43:23.527 --> 00:43:24.610
So let's look at the clip.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:24.760
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.420
- Hi.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.630
I'm Liette and I'm

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:32.539
I want to show you today how
this device changed my life.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:40.781
- Massaryk.

00:43:40.781 --> 00:43:41.280
- Great.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.741
Let's go there.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.983
- Red light.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:51.440
Green light.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.350
50 shekel.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.554
- 50 shekel.

00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:00.470
Let's buy some coffee.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:06.450
- Breakfast.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.087
Bagel plus coffee with
cream cheese [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:09.087 --> 00:44:09.670
[END PLAYBACK]

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.440
AMNON SHASHUA: OK?

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.530
So you get the idea.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.500
So we started 2010.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.730
2013 we had already
a prototype working.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:22.027
And we had a visitor, John
Mark from the New York Times,

00:44:22.027 --> 00:44:23.860
and he came and he wrote
a very nice article

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.002
about what the company is doing.

00:44:26.002 --> 00:44:27.460
And we thought that
at that time it

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.520
would be good to launch
the website of the company

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.060
and try to get a number,
say, 100 first customers,

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:38.580
so that we can start
experimenting, do field studies

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.500
with a prototype device.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.670
So we launched the web site.

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:45.100
We wrote that the
device cost $2,500.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.961
That was June 2013.

00:44:46.961 --> 00:44:49.210
And the first 100 people who
would purchase the device

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.010
will receive the
device in September.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.970
So within an hour those
100 devices were sold.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:45:01.210
And then we kept a waiting list,
which today is about 30,000.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:05.840
And we started shipping the
devices about a month ago.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:12.970
So in the last year this device
was with about 200 people.

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:16.980
And we got a lot of feedback
from real users and improved.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.150
And let me show you
some real users.

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:22.390
So this is Marcia from Brazil.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:24.790
The device at the moment
only works in English.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:27.710
Later we'll put more languages.

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:31.730
And so she's being
trained to use a device.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.560
And this is a short clip
of about two minutes.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.760
And, you know, watch
her body language.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:40.210
And also she explains
how she copes

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.910
with her disability, especially
how she distinguishes

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.910
between different money notes.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:45.660
They're all green.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.522
So how do you
distinguish between them?

00:45:47.522 --> 00:45:48.730
So let's have a look at this.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.780
So the device is reading
the newspaper for her.

00:46:22.661 --> 00:46:24.030
- It green.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:36.950
All green and I put mark
color, yellow, green, orange.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:38.180
Different note.

00:46:41.302 --> 00:46:53.144
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:53.144 --> 00:46:54.126
- $20.

00:46:57.072 --> 00:46:59.036
[? Genia ?]

00:46:59.036 --> 00:47:03.946
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:03.946 --> 00:47:05.420
[END PLAYBACK]

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.130
AMNON SHASHUA: OK.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:10.570
Here's a recent-- from CNN.

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:14.330
It was aired a month ago.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:16.670
It also gives a bit more
information about the device.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:17.470
Let's run this.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:18.820
It's again two minutes.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.486
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:19.486 --> 00:47:22.630
- Two weekends ago I sat down
and read The New York Times.

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:25.650
I haven't done that
in maybe 30 years.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:26.980
My wife came down.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.250
I had a cup of coffee.

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:31.120
I'm reading The New York
Times and she was crying.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:35.080
- Just being able to read again
is emotional for Howard Turman.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.600
He started losing his
vision as a child.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.150
His new glasses
don't fix his eyes

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.240
but they do the next best thing.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.600
- Put on my glasses, it
recognizes the finger,

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.780
snaps the picture.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.920
Now it just reads.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.490
- The glasses have a camera
that recognizes text and can

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:56.300
read the world to him.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.360
- Pull here.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.440
- The technology is called OrCam
and Turman says it gives him

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.090
a sense of normalcy.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:07.180
- Even finding out that Dunkin'
Donuts has a donut I never

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.430
tried was exciting.

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.530
- Dunkin' Donuts.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:13.360
- It's a clip on camera.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.230
So a camera that you can
clip onto any eyeglasses.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.270
And you have here a
computing device, which

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.120
you can put in your pocket.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.370
And the way it interacts,
it's with a hand gesture.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.580
For example, it's written
there, rental and tours.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.570
- Rentals and tours.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:33.160
- It's not perfect though.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:36.010
It uses a pretty bulky
cable and sometimes it

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.017
needs a few tries
to get things right.

00:48:38.017 --> 00:48:40.350
- It doesn't read script
because everybody's handwriting

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:40.960
is different.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.060
So it doesn't do cursive
very well at all.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.650
- OrCam has a harder
time in bright light,

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:51.200
or in tougher situations,
like signs on windows.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.510
- [INAUDIBLE] U donuts
hours of operation.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:55.780
Low PM.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.950
Pound's PM.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:58.240
9:00 PM.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.910
How was your service today?

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.790
- Shashua says improvements
are on the way.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.700
Where do you see this technology
going over the long term?

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.100
- Reading, recognizing
faces, recognizing products,

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.230
is only the beginning.

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:13.510
Where we want to get is
complete visual understanding

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.050
at the level of
human perception,

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:17.590
such that if you
are disoriented you

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.530
can start understanding
what's around you.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:20.920
For example, where's the door?

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.750
The door is there.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:22.583
Where is the window?

00:49:22.583 --> 00:49:26.844
Where is an opening in
the space around me?

00:49:26.844 --> 00:49:27.700
OK?

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.940
This is face recognition.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.540
So again, one of the first 100.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.891
- Teach OrCam to
recognize anybody?

00:49:32.891 --> 00:49:33.390
- Yep.

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:35.410
- Who does it know?

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.300
- Libby, my mother.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.114
- You want to show me?

00:49:38.114 --> 00:49:39.105
- Yep.

00:49:39.105 --> 00:49:39.605
OK.

00:49:43.084 --> 00:49:44.078
- All right.

00:49:44.078 --> 00:49:46.066
[INAUDIBLE] Let's see.

00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:50.042
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:50.042 --> 00:49:51.944
- Libby.

00:49:51.944 --> 00:49:52.527
[END PLAYBACK]

00:49:52.527 --> 00:49:53.277
AMNON SHASHUA: OK?

00:49:53.277 --> 00:49:55.450
So that's also face recognition.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:57.690
Last two slides.

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:01.865
We started also providing the
device to research groups.

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:05.330
And this is one of-- this is
a paper in ARVO where they

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:08.970
took eight visually
impaired and gave them

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:10.190
the device for one month.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.256
And then measured the
change in quality of life.

00:50:13.256 --> 00:50:15.380
And how they measure the
change of quality of life,

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.290
they interview them.

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:21.470
And seven out of the eight
reported significant change

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:22.390
in quality of life.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:25.390
Now they sent us some
of the interviews.

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.660
So on the next--

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.929
here, I'm showing you
part of the interview.

00:50:30.929 --> 00:50:32.720
And what's interesting
about this interview

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.880
is that there is
a trick question.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.130
The interviewer,
after she tells him

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.520
how the device is,
you know, lifesaving

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.630
and so forth, he tells her, well
the device is very expensive.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.190
It's a few thousands of dollars.

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.330
Is it worth it?

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.640
So it's one thing to get
something for free and say,

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.870
it's very, very good.

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.630
Another thing's is it's going to
cost you thousands of dollars,

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:54.390
is it worth it?

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:55.670
And let's hear her answer,
which is very nice.

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:56.336
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:50:56.336 --> 00:50:58.840
- In the first few
days I had the OrCam

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.900
I was in total awe of it
because for the first time

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.890
I was able to open
mail and read it,

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.520
instead of having my
husband read my mail.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.070
And I was able to
go to a restaurant

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:18.700
and actually read the menu and
order myself with the waitress.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.300
And that was exciting.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.890
When you can't do something
for such a long period of time,

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.750
the OrCam was incredible.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.570
- Believe is what
the estimate is.

00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:31.130
Do you think such
a high price would

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.530
be something people
would be willing to pay

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.160
for a device like this?

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.034
Do you think it's marginally
worth it right now?

00:51:39.034 --> 00:51:41.330
- I think you're going
to find that that's going

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:43.920
to be on a case by case basis.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.430
You know, people who have
money there's certainly

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:49.430
no problem $2,000.

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:50.930
I don't have money.

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.870
I am low income.

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:56.300
But I would save my money,
scrape it together in order

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.566
to get it at $2,000.

00:51:58.566 --> 00:51:59.260
[END PLAYBACK]

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.110
AMNON SHASHUA: So
that's interesting.

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:03.410
Where is it going?

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:06.590
So there are two
lines of progress.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:10.370
One, is when this
existing niche is

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:14.780
to make the camera understand
the visual field at higher

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.750
levels of detail.

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:18.530
So one of the things that
we are now working on

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:21.140
is, we call this chatting mode.

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.110
So it's like-- it's
the image and notation

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:27.380
type of experiment, or
the ImageNet together

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.470
with natural
language processing.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:34.880
Say you are visually impaired
or blind and you're disoriented.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.740
You don't know where you are.

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.990
So you would like
the device to tell

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:40.670
you every second what it sees.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:41.780
I see here Tommy.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.710
I see here chairs.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.020
I see here another person.

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.520
I see here a wall, an opening,
a painting, blah, blah, blah,

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.850
blah, blah, until you get back
your sense of orientation.

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.690
So you want the device
to be able to have

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:53.450
say, several thousands
of categories,

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:58.100
like in ImageNet, together with
image annotation capability.

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:02.180
The kind of stuff that people
are now writing articles about.

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.240
And being able to do
this at the frame rate of

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.500
say, once per second.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.960
So wherever I'm looking
at tell me what--

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.530
what you see.

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:12.020
This is one-- another thing
is to have natural language

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.380
processing, NLP ability.

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:18.686
For example, if you are
looking at an electricity bill.

00:53:18.686 --> 00:53:20.060
The system would
know that you're

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:24.950
looking at an electricity bill
and give you just the short--

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:26.674
what is the amount
due, for example.

00:53:26.674 --> 00:53:29.173
The system will tell you are
looking at an electricity bill.

00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:31.220
The amount due is such and such.

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:35.070
So having more and more
intelligence into the system.

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.270
So this is one area.

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:40.820
Another area is to go for a
wearable device for people

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.100
with normal sight.

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:46.260
So here we're talking about, you
know, real wearable computing.

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.490
So this Apple Watch
is wearable computing.

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:51.285
But doesn't do much computing.

00:53:51.285 --> 00:53:51.920
Right?

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:56.030
It displays, you know my text
messages, emails, you know,

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:59.074
measures certain biometrics.

00:53:59.074 --> 00:54:00.740
But that's not, you
know, the holy grail

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.030
of wearable computing.

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:03.800
The holy grail of
wearable computing

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.580
is assume that you had
Siri with eyes and ears.

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:11.600
So you had a camera on you
that is observing the scene all

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.710
the time and providing you
real time information whenever

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:19.030
you need the information,
like the people that you meet.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:22.040
What were the recent tweets
of those people that you met?

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.780
What is common
between you and them

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.350
based on Facebook and
LinkedIn and so forth?

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:28.100
So knowing more about
the people you meet.

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.410
Knowing more about the
stuff that you are doing.

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:32.480
And creating an
archive of all what you

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.509
are doing throughout the day.

00:54:35.509 --> 00:54:36.800
And this is a device like this.

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.400
This is how it looks like.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.410
We call it Cassie.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.580
So this is a real device.

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:51.150
It works continuously
for about 13 hours.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:54.170
So you have a camera working
continuously for 13 hours.

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:56.150
And the purpose of this camera--

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:58.120
so the way-- you
put it like this.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.060
OK?

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.920
So the purpose of the camera
is not to take pictures.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.410
It doesn't store any picture.

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:06.110
The purpose of the
camera is to be a sensor,

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:09.470
is to interpret the visual
world and provide information

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:11.190
in real time.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.070
And if everything
goes well, we'll

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:16.940
start launching this
within six months from now.

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.510
So this is the next big thing,
to go into wearable computing,

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:24.800
to go into a domain in which a
camera is on you and processing

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.280
information all the time.

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.530
Unlike now, a camera on
your smartphone in which

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:31.860
you take a picture on demand.

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.507
It's not working for
you all the time.

00:55:33.507 --> 00:55:35.090
Here it's working
for me all the time.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:37.490
All the time it's
viewing the visual field.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:39.440
Whenever it finds
something interesting

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.330
it will send it
to my smartphone,

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:45.590
like people that I meet and
other activities that I do.

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:49.970
So this will be the beginning
of real wearable computing.

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:51.505
So wearable computing
with sensing,

00:55:51.505 --> 00:55:55.310
with the ability to hear
and listen, to hear and see,

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:57.450
and process information
in real time.

00:55:57.450 --> 00:55:59.240
This is the next thing that--

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.980
the next big challenge
that we are working on.
