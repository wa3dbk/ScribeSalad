00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.700
GIORGIO METTA: So
I'll be talking

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.080
about my work for
the past 11 years.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.110
So this has been,
certainly, exciting,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.840
but also was long in
duration, so we had

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.500
to sort of stick to the goal.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.690
And I'll show you also
a couple of things--

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.810
I mean, most of this
work has been possible

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.560
because we have a team of
people that contributed

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.220
to both the design of the
robot and the research

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.950
we're doing on
the robot, so I'll

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.050
be freely drawing from the
work of these other people.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.090
I just cited them
as the iCub team,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.000
because I couldn't
list everybody there,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.480
but you'll see a
picture later that

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.300
shows how many people
were actually involved

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.520
in developing this robot.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.160
So our, let's say, goal,
although we didn't start it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.580
like this, is to build robots
that can interact with people,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.610
and maybe one day be
commercially-available to be

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.280
deployed in the household.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.020
Everything we've done is--

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.770
on the design of
the robot has to do

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.680
with a platform
capable of interacting

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.010
with people in a natural way.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.780
And this is reflected in
the shape of the robot,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.120
that it's humanoid.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.370
It's reflected in
the type of skills

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.200
we tried to implement
in the robot.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.500
And overall on the
design, the platform

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.770
excels in terms of strength, in
terms of sensors, and so forth.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.030
There was an, let's
say, hidden reason.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.790
We wanted to design a
platform for research, also,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.590
so when we started,
we didn't think

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.870
of a specific application.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.320
Our idea was to have a robot
as complicated as possible

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.360
to give researchers the
possibilities of doing whatever

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.860
they liked.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.270
So the robot can walk, has
cameras, tactile sensors.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.460
It can manipulate objects.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.600
We put a lot of effort into
the design of the hands.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.530
And it's complicated.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.480
And it breaks often, so it's not
necessarily the best platform,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.746
but it's the--

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:37.120
I believe, the
only platform that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.180
can provide you with
mobile manipulation,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.850
and at the same time with
a sophisticated oculo motor

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.100
system in the eyes and cameras.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.590
And maybe it doesn't
give you lasers,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.880
so you have to do
with their vision.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.110
The result is this
platform that's shown here.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.850
This started as a
European project,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.280
so there was an
initial funding that

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.700
allowed for basically hiring
people to design the mechanics

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.770
and electronics of the robot.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.620
And unfortunately, the
robot is not very cheap.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.770
I mean, the overall--

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.120
we tried to put the best
components everywhere.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.710
And this is reflected in
the cost, which doesn't help

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.020
diffusion, to a certain extent.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.315
In spite of this,
we managed to, let's

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:28.060
say, "sell," between
quotes, because we

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.100
don't make any profit out of
it, 30 copies of the robot.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.550
There are still two of them
to be delivered this year,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.830
so there are, at the
moment, 28 around there.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.120
And four of them are in
our lab, and are used daily

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.920
by our researchers.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.180
And given the complexity
of the platform,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.710
we managed, at best, to
build four robots per year.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.990
And at best means that we're
always late in constructions.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.440
We're always late in
fixing the robots.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.790
And that's because, I mean, we
have a research lab trying also

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.770
to do-- to have this, let's say,
more commercial side or support

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.040
side to the community of users,
which, in fact, doesn't work.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.620
I mean, you cannot ask your PhD
students to go and fix a robot

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.990
somewhere in the world.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:25.350
It was striking a bit that
we managed to actually sell

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.690
the robot in Japan.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.110
And that's because,
you know, you

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.370
see Japan as the place
of humanoid robots.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.740
And having somebody asking
a copy of our robot there

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.790
was a bit strange.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.620
But nonetheless, the project
is completely open-source.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.240
If you go to our website, you
can download all the CAD files

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.470
for the mechanics, for
the electronics, all

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.710
the schematics, and
the entire software,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.860
from the lowest possible
level up to whatever

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.690
latest research has been
developed by our students.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.200
Why we think the
robot is special?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.920
As I said, we wanted
to have hands.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.220
And we put considerable effort
into the design of the hands.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.430
There are nine motors
driving each hand.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.420
And-- although, there are
five fingers and 19 joints,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.940
which means some of
the joints are coupled,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.150
so the actual dexterity of the
hand is all to be demonstrated,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.180
but it works to
a certain extent.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.510
There are some sensors.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.190
It's entirely human-like.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.410
We don't have, for
instance, let's say,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.000
we don't have lasers.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.230
We don't have ultrasound
or other fancy sensors

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.850
that, from engineering
standpoint,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.400
could also be integrated.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.030
But we decided to
stick to certain subset

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.500
of possible sensors.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.630
There's one thing that
I think is quite unique.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.450
We managed along the
way to run a project

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.310
to design tactile sensors.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.530
And so I think it's one
of the few robots that

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.520
has almost complete body
coverage with tactile sensors.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.420
There are about 4,000 sensing
points in the latest version.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.480
And we hope to be
able to use them.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.326
I mean, you'll
see certain things

00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:07.450
that we started developing.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.890
But for instance, we--

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.900
there was discussion
about manipulation

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.510
and the availability
of tactile sensors.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.720
We just scratched the
surface in that direction.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.140
We haven't been able to
do much more than that.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.230
As I said, we designed,
also, the electronics.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.570
And the reason
for doing this was

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.070
that wanted to be
able to program

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.640
the very low-level of the
controllers of the robot.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.330
This didn't pay off for many
years, but at a certain point,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.550
we started doing torque control.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.500
And we started hacking also
the low-level controllers

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.050
of the brushless motors.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.915
And so it paid off eventually,
because that wouldn't

00:06:46.915 --> 00:06:49.150
have been possible
without the ability

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.050
to write low-level software.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.710
Not that many
people are modifying

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.090
that part of the software.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.650
It's open-source,
also, that part,

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.660
but it's very easy to
burn your amplifiers

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.040
if you don't do the right
thing at that level.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.510
And the other thing
is that, as I said,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.310
the platform is reproducible.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.110
And at the moment there
is GitHub repository--

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.980
well, a number of GitHub
repositories which contain,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.580
whatever, it's some, a few
millions of lines of code,

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.330
whatever it means.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.690
It just means probably
that a lot of students

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.320
are just committed
to the repositories,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.290
not necessarily that the
software is super high-quality

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.460
at this point.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.830
There are a few modules
that are well-maintained.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.420
And that's the
low-level interfaces,

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.390
which is something we do.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.040
Everything else can be in
different ranges of readiness

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.540
to be used and things.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.765
Well, why humanoids?

00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:50.630
There were, at least at the
beginning, scientific reasons.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.980
One, paraphrasing Rod Brook's
paper, Elephant's Don't

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.320
Play Chess, the reason of
developing intelligence

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.030
in a robot that
has a human shape

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:06.040
may give an intelligence that
is also comparable to humans,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.820
but also provides for natural
human-robot interaction.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.760
The fact the robot can move
the eyes is very important,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.280
for instance, has
a very simple face,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.410
but it's effective in
communicating something

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.820
to the people the robot
is interacting with.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.700
And also, building a
humanoid of a small size--

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.130
the robot is only a meter tall--

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.260
was very challenging from the
mechatronics point of view.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.429
So for us, engineers,
was a lot of fun too--

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.400
the initial few years
when we were designing,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.890
every day was very,
very funny, our--

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.880
a lot of satisfaction seeing
that the robot was growing

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.820
and being built, eventually.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.800
The fact that the platform
is open-source I think

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.960
is also important, allows
for repeating experiments

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.300
across different-- in
different locations.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.680
So we can develop
a piece of software

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.880
and run exactly the same
module somewhere else

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.000
across the world.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.790
And this may, again, give
advantages in-- first of all,

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.450
debugging was a lot easier, so
many people complaining when we

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:19.950
do--

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:25.440
when we did something wrong,
and allowed for also, let's say,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.260
shared development, so building
partnerships with many people,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.110
mostly across Europe, because
there was funding available,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.320
so for people to work together.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.290
And this may eventually enable
better benchmarking and better

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.050
quality of what we do.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:50.750
As part of the project, we
also develop middleware.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.700
So maybe you may think that
we have been a bit crazy.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.205
We went from the mechanical
design to the research

00:09:57.205 --> 00:09:59.620
on the robot, and passing
through the software

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.530
development, but
actually, this was

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:07.870
a middleware that was started
before ROS even existed.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.380
And in fact, it was a
piece of my work at MIT

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:17.520
with a couple of the
students there in 2001, 2002.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.740
So the first version
actually ran on COG

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.310
and run on QNX, a
real-time operating system.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.030
Later we did a major
porting to Linux,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.110
and Windows, and MacOS, which--

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.500
so we never committed
to a single version.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.760
And that because we had
this community of developers

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.650
from the very
beginning, and there

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.830
was no agreement on what
development tool to use,

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.150
and so we say, why don't
we cover almost everything.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.860
And this part of the
software is actually

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.170
very solid at the moment.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.470
This has been,
you know, growing,

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.960
not in size, but in
quality, in this case,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.080
so the interfaces remain
practically the same.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.730
And I think the low-level byte
coding of the messages passing

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.315
across the network didn't
change since the COG time.

00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:11.315
Everything else changed.

00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:13.456
It is completely new
implementation now.

00:11:16.006 --> 00:11:19.930
But it has portability,
so as I say,

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:25.210
this was a sort of requirement
from the researchers

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.770
not to commit to anything,
and so we have developers

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.670
using Visual Studio on Windows
or maybe using GCC on Windows,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.420
and other developers running
whatever IDE available

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.160
on Linux or MacOS.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.900
And this worked pretty well.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.640
And there's also
language portability.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.680
We can link-- so all
this middleware is just

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.040
a set of libraries, so
we can link the libraries

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.170
against any language.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:55.480
And so we have bindings for
whatever, Java, Perl, MATLAB,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.790
and a bunch of other languages.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.970
And this helped
researchers also to do

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:09.740
some rapid prototyping maybe
using Python and so forth.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.250
As I said, the project is
open-source, so you will find,

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.380
if you go to the website,
there's a manual,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.090
not particularly
well taken care of.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:22.990
It works.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.820
At least, it works
with our students,

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.150
so it should work for everybody.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.230
But it also, the drawings--

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:34.480
so you can go with drawing like
those to mechanical workshop.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.250
And you get the parts in return.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.470
And then from those,
you can also figure out

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.260
how to assemble the components.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.117
Although it's not super-easy.

00:12:43.117 --> 00:12:45.700
It's not something you do, just
because you have the drawings,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.620
you do in your basement.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.730
I mean, one of the groups
in one of our projects

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.810
tried doing that.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.920
And I think they stopped
after building part of a arm

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.830
and maybe part of a leg.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.790
I mean, it was very
challenging for them.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:06.940
And you need a very, let's
say, a proper workshop

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.530
for building the components,
so it takes time, anyway.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:17.650
Continuing on the sensors, I
mentioned that we have skin.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.660
And I'll show you a bit
more about that in a moment.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.720
But we also have
force-torque sensors,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.060
and gyroscopes,
and accelerometers.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.450
So if you take all these pieces
and you put them together,

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.080
you can actually sense
interaction forces

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.250
with the environment.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.200
And if you can sense
interaction forces,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.850
you can make the
robot compliant.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.000
And this has been an
important development

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.700
across the past few years
that allowed the robot

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.370
to move from position
control to torque control.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:51.490
And this has been
needed, again, to go

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.880
in the direction of
human-robot interaction.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.500
And so these are standard
force-torque sensors,

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.010
although we designed, as usual.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.436
We spent some time and
designed the sensors.

00:14:05.436 --> 00:14:06.685
And this was a reason of cost.

00:14:06.685 --> 00:14:11.290
The equivalent six-axial
force-torque sensor,

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.900
commercially, cost,
I don't know, $5,000.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.320
And we managed to
build it for $1,000.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.250
So it maybe is not
as super rock-solid

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.040
as the commercial component,
but it works well.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.810
And about the skin, this
was a sensing modality

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.960
that wasn't available.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.440
And again, we managed
to get funding

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.660
for actually running a
project for three years

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.050
to design the skin
for the robot.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.000
And we thought it was
a trivial problem,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.680
because at the beginning
of the project,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.357
we already had the idea
of using capacity sensing.

00:14:48.357 --> 00:14:49.690
And we actually had a prototype.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.090
And we say, oh, it's trivial.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.710
Then we spent three years
to actually engineer

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.290
it to make it work
properly on the robot.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.570
So the idea is trivial, so
since capacity sensing is

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:07.420
available for
cellphones, we thought

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.760
of moving that into a version
that would work for the robot.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.430
There were two issues.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.070
First of all, the
robot is not flat,

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.970
so we can't just stick cell
phones on the robot body

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.490
to obtain tactile sensing.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.860
So we had to make
everything flexible

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.680
so they can be conformed to
the surface of the robot.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.160
The other thing is that
the cell phones only

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.690
sense objects that are
electrically-conductive.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.029
That's because the way
the sensor is designed,

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:39.070
so we had to change that,
because the robot might

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.210
be hitting objects
that are not--

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.370
that are plastic, for instance.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.100
So what we've done
was to actually build

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.730
the capacitors over two layers.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.330
There's an outer layer
and a set of sensors

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.570
that are etched on a flexible
PCB that is shown there.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.390
And what the sensor
measures is actually

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.810
the deflection of the outer
layer, which is conductive,

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.130
towards the sensors.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:07.600
And in between, we have
another flexible material.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.660
And that's another part of the
reason why it took so long.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:15.820
We started with materials like
silicone that were very nice,

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.280
but unfortunately, they
degrade very quickly,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.880
so we ended up running sensors
for a couple of months.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.760
And then all of sudden they
started failing or changing

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.860
their measurement properties.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.740
We didn't know why.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.730
We started investigating
all possible materials

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.540
until we found one that
was actually working well.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.080
The other solution we
had to, basically, design

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.280
was the shape of
the flexible PCB.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.640
So we had the challenge
of taking 4,000 sensors

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.230
and bringing all the signals
somewhere to the main CPU

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.540
inside the robot.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.610
And, of course, you cannot
just connect 4,000 wires.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.650
So what we've done on
the back side of the PCB

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.100
there's actually a routing
for all the sensors

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.350
from one triangle to
the next until you

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.630
get to a digitizing unit.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.960
And-- sorry, each triangle
digitize its own signals.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.960
And they travel in digital form
from one triangle to the next

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.329
until they reach a
micro-controller that

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:18.450
takes all these numbers and
sends them to the main CPU.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.550
And this saves on
the connection side,

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.160
and so it actually
enables the installation

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.480
of the skin on the robot.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.430
So this is a, let's say,
industrialized version

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.930
of the skin.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.840
And that's the customization
we've done for a variant arm.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.910
And those are parts of
the skin for the iCub.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.620
So the components that we
just screw onto the outer body

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.955
and to make the iCub sensitive.

00:17:49.955 --> 00:17:52.480
This is another solution,
which is, again,

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.600
capacitive for the fingertips,
simply because the triangle was

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.290
too big, too large for the
size of the iCub fingertips,

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.170
but the principle
is exactly the same.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.200
It was just more
difficult to design

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:10.150
these flexible materials,
because they are just

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.360
more complicated to fabricate
on those small sizes.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.900
And the result, when you
combine the force-torque sensors

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.430
and the tactile
sensors is something

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.460
like this, which is a compliant
controller on the iCub, where

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.360
you can just push
the robot around.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.900
This is in
zero-gravity modality.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.450
So you can just push the robot
around and move it freely.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.460
And this has to be compared to
the complete stiffness in case

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.260
you do position control.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.520
And another thing that is
enabled by force control

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.222
is teaching and demonstration.

00:18:44.222 --> 00:18:45.430
This is a trivial experiment.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.740
We just recorded
trajectory and repeated

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.730
exactly the same
trajectory, so it's not--

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.590
I mean, you can do
learning on top of that,

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:54.980
but we haven't done it.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.720
It's just to show that the
fact that you can control--

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.140
the robot in torque
mode enables these type

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.630
of tasks, so teaching
a new trajectory that

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.010
was never seen by the robot.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.870
There's another less
trivial thing you can do.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.600
Since we can sense
external forces,

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.490
you can do something
like this, which

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.820
is, we can build
a controller where

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.260
you keep the robot compliant.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.530
You impose certain
constraints on the center

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.400
of mass and the
angular momentum,

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.570
and keep the robot, basically,
stable in that configuration

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.590
like this one, in spite
of external forces being,

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.830
in this case,
generated by a person.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:40.530
This is part of a
project that is basically

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:45.010
trying to make the iCub walk,
more or less, efficiently.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.530
And as part of the
project, we actually

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.110
also redesigned the ankles of
the robot, because, initially,

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.620
we didn't think of
bipedal walking,

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.030
and so they weren't
strong enough to support

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.000
the weight of the robot.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.590
And this is basically
the same stuff

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:09.580
that was shown on
the previous videos,

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.730
just the same
combination of tactile

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.050
and force-torque sensing used
to estimate counter forces.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.600
We actually added two
more force-torque sensors

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.700
in the ankles, so
we have six overall

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.690
here in this version
of the robot.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.500
Now, as part of this,
we also played a bit

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.550
with machine learning.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.130
For mapping the tactile
formation and force-torque

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.730
sensor information
to the joints,

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.230
since they are not localized
on the joints of the robot,

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.250
we have--

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.460
and also for separating what
we measure with the sensors

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.690
from the forces generated
by the movement of the robot

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.980
by its internal
dynamics, we have

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.650
to have information
about the robot dynamics.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.220
And this is something we can
do, or we can build a model

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.220
for using machine learning,
since we have measurements

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.330
from the joint position
velocities and accelerations,

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.110
and the torques measured from
the force-torque sensors,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.050
we can compute the
robot dynamics.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:19.170
And this can be done either
using a let's say, computer

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.660
model from the CAD,
or from learning

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.840
the model via machine learning.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.530
And so we collect the
data set from the iCub.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.780
In this case, it was a
data set for the arm,

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.430
for the first four joints.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.150
We didn't do anything
for the rest.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.850
And in this case, we used--

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.200
we sort of customized a
specific method, which

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.990
has custom processes,
to be incremental,

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.060
and also to be
computationally-bounded

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.480
in time, so we wanted
to avoid the explosion

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.820
of the computational
time due to the increase

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.470
in the number of samples.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:22:00.960
And this was-- well, it was
basically an interesting piece

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.235
of work because everything
we do on the robot,

00:22:03.235 --> 00:22:06.220
if it's inserted
in a control loop,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.660
has to have a predictable
computation time,

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.170
and possibly limited enough
so that we can run the control

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.390
loop at reasonable rates.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.470
And this is some of the results.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:22.040
And actually, we also compare
with other existing methods.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.120
This is just to show that
the method we developed,

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:31.570
which uses an approximate
kernel, works pretty much

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.420
as well as a standard
Gaussian process

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.650
regression in this
case, and works

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.510
much better than other
methods from the literature.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.070
This was just to
have a rough idea

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:47.280
that this was entirely doable.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.500
Also, by shaping
the kernel, it's

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.706
possible to compensate
for temperature drifts.

00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:54.330
Unfortunately, the
force-torque sensors

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.055
tend to change response
due to temperature,

00:22:58.055 --> 00:23:00.300
not that the lab is
changing temperature,

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.990
but often, the electronics
itself is heating up

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.450
around the robot, so
it's making the sensor

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.120
read something
different, and but it's

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.960
possible to show that,
again, through learning,

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.940
you can build a
compensation also

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.990
for the temperature
variations just

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:25.020
by shaping the kernel to include
a term that depends on time.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.140
This is one example
of how we've done

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.540
machine learning on the
robot, although the problem is

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.125
fairly simple.

00:23:31.125 --> 00:23:32.541
A problem that is
more complicated

00:23:32.541 --> 00:23:35.110
is learning about objects.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.320
So in this scenario, we--

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.890
targeting is shown
here, where we have,

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.730
basically, a person that
can speak to the robot,

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.610
tell the robot that
it's a new object.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.220
And the robot's
acquiring images.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.420
And we hope to be able to
learn about objects from-- just

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.180
from these type of images.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.670
This is maybe the most
difficult situation.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.370
We can also lie
objects on the table

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.640
and just tell the robot to
look at a specific object,

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.260
and so forth.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.470
Again, the speech
interface is nice,

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:11.250
because you can basically
also attach labels

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.290
to the objects that
are what it's seeing.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:19.510
The methods we tried, in the
recent past, we've done--

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.880
we basically applied
sparse coding

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:30.110
and then regularized least
squares for classification.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.500
This was basically how we
started a couple of years ago.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:41.250
And more recently, we used an
off-the-shelf convolutional

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.830
neural network.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.280
And again, the classifiers
are linear classifiers.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:55.230
And this, I mean, has proved
to work particularly well,

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.410
but also, since we aren't
the robot, we can, let's say,

00:24:58.410 --> 00:24:59.610
play tricks.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.160
One trick that is easy to
apply, and it's very effective,

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.280
is actually, you're
seeing an object,

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.020
but you don't have
a single frame.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.460
You can actually take subsequent
frames, because the robot may

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:16.260
be observing the objects for
a few moments, for seconds,

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.190
whatever.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.140
And in fact, there's
an improvement

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:24.090
that is shown in this plot
there, the one to the right.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:29.519
If you increase the
number of seconds

00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:31.060
you're allowed to
observe the object,

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.090
you improve, also, performance.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.710
And the plot is over
the number of classes,

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:43.020
because we also like to improve
on the number of classes

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.660
that a robot can
actually recognize,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:52.260
and which was limited until,
let's say, a couple of years

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.880
ago, but now, with all these
new deep-learning stuff,

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.680
it seems to be
improving quite a lot,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.890
and our experiments
in that direction.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.730
There's another thing
that can be done,

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:07.510
which is try to see what
happens if we have--

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.350
since we have, again, the
robot interacting with people

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:14.640
for entire days, if we collect
images on different days,

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.410
and then we can play
with different conditions

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:20.820
on the testing case.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:25.230
So for instance, the
different plots here

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:31.710
show what happens if you train
and test on the current day,

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.590
so you train cumulatively
on up to four days

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.319
and you test on
the last day only.

00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:40.110
And you see, of course,
performance improve

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.570
as you increase the train set.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.640
Conditions may be slightly
different from one day

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.340
to the next.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.900
Light may have changed,
just because it was more

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.190
a sunny day or a cloudy day.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:27:01.770
And the other conditions are
to test also on past days

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:06.460
or to test on future
days, so where conditions

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.710
may have changed a lot.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.870
And in fact, performance
is slightly worse

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.670
in that situation.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.840
OK and this is a video that
shows, basically, the robot

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.710
training and some of the
experiment on testing

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.060
how the robot perceives
a number of objects.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.830
And unfortunately,
there's no speech here,

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.060
but this basically a
person talking to the robot

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.560
and telling the robot
what is the name

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.390
for this specific object, then
putting another object there,

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:43.440
drawing the robot's attention
to the object, and then, again,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.830
telling the name.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.860
This is the Lego.

00:27:49.492 --> 00:27:51.570
It becomes faster in a moment.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.390
OK, and then you can continue
training basically like that.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:22.800
And the video shows
also testing--

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.150
was showing a bunch of objects
simultaneously to the robot.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.400
And here, we simply click
on one of the objects

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.820
to draw the robot's attention.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.060
And on the plot there,
you see the probability

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.010
that a given object is being
recognized as the correct one.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:52.410
OK, I think I have
to cut this short,

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.300
because I'm running out of time.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.880
Another thing I
wanted to show you

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:03.090
is, basically, now we have this
ability to control the robot.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.350
We have the ability
to recognize objects.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.880
We also have the ability
to grasp objects.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:15.420
And this is something
that uses stereo vision.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.510
And in this case,
what we wanted to do

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.700
is to present an object to
the robot, no prior knowledge

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.950
about the shape of the object.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.510
We take a snapshot.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.600
We reconstruct a stereo pair.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.980
We have to construct
the object in 3D.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:35.130
And then we apply optimization,
constrained optimization,

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.950
to figure out a
plausible location

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.220
for the palm of the hand.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.820
And then that will
maximize the ability

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.800
to grasp the object
by closing the finger

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.810
around that particular position.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.570
This is our, let's say,
definition of power grasp.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.090
So put the palm of
the hand of the robot

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.510
in a region of the object
that has a surface, which

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:02.160
has a similar shape or a
similar size of the palm itself,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.140
and where the
orientation is compatible

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.760
with the local orientation
of the surface.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.480
And this works
with mixed results.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.625
So it works with
certain objects.

00:30:11.625 --> 00:30:13.110
It doesn't work always.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.120
There are objects that
are intrinsically more

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.510
difficult for this
procedure, so some of them

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:22.920
will only be grasped with
65% probability, which

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.749
is not super-satisfactory.

00:30:24.749 --> 00:30:26.290
If you run long
experiments, you want

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.700
to grasp three, four objects,
you start seeing failures.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.370
It becomes boring to
actually do the experiments.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.050
So it works well
for soft objects,

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:39.220
for instance, as expected.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.130
We moved a bit
into the direction

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.980
of using the tactile sensors,
and-- but at this point,

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:50.060
we've only been able to try
to characterize forces out

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.080
of the force of the
tactile sensor measurement.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.480
So we-- basically, taking a
fingertip, we have 12 sensors,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.637
and we're trying to--

00:30:57.637 --> 00:30:59.970
and this is another case where
we apply machine learning

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.700
trying to reconstruct
the force direction

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.210
and intensity from the
tactile sensor measurements.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.950
And this is basically
the procedure,

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.470
is we take the sensor.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.230
We move our six-axial
force-torque sensor.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.280
We take the data.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.900
And we approximate this,
again, with a Gaussian process.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.110
Just one last video, if I can.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:32.170
OK, so basically, we've put
together all these skills.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:36.040
We may be able to do something
useful with the robot.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.195
In this case, the video
shows a task where

00:31:40.195 --> 00:31:41.890
the robot is cleaning a table.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:46.990
And it's actually using
the grasp component,

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:55.480
and the ability to move the
object, to see the object,

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.430
recognize them, and
grasp them, and put them

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.060
at a given location,
which was pre-specified,

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.160
in this case, so
it's not recognized

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.000
that this a container.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.060
It's just putting things there.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.110
And there's one last skill
that I didn't have time

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:14.170
to talk about, which is
recognizing certain objects as

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.220
tools, and one specific
object, like this one.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.350
An object like the
tool here can actually

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.110
be used for pulling
another object closer.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:35.010
And this is, again,
something that

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:39.090
can be done through learning.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:42.480
So we learn the size of the
sticks or set the sticks,

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.410
and we also learn how good
they are for pulling something

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:50.870
closer through experience,
by, basically, trial

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.190
and error over many trials.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:55.620
And the result is
that you can actually

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.680
generate a movement that
pulls the object closer

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.480
so they can later be grasped.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.720
And that's basically
a couple of ideas

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.440
on how to exploit the
object affordances, not

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.340
just recognizing
them, but also knowing

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.270
that certain objects have
certain extra functions which

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:20.210
may end up being useful.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:24.060
OK, I just wanted to acknowledge
the people that are actually

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.390
working on all this.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:27.630
I promised that I will do that.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:31.470
And this is actually a
photo around Genoa showing

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.460
the group that has been mainly
working on the iCub project

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.716
over--

00:33:36.716 --> 00:33:38.340
let's say, this is
the group last year,

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.820
so there may be more
people that just left,

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.650
or some of them moved to MIT.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.760
OK, thank you.
