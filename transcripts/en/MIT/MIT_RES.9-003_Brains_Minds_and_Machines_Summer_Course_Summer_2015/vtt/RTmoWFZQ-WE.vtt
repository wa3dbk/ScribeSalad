LARRY ABBOTT: So I
put this slide up

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.550
so you could walk in and
say, I came to this course

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.340
to learn about high level
cognition machines that

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.450
do amazing things.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.870
Surely this guy's not
going to talk about a fly.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.110
But I am going to
talk about a fly.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.290
And I will try in the beginning
to explain to you why.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.050
And hopefully, by
the end, we'll see.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.470
I won't declare victory at
all, and you can tell me

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.740
if it applies or whatever.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.430
The reason I'm talking about
the fly is this quote, really.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.511
Flies are in all sorts
of mushroom bodies.

00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:58.760
I'm going to talk about a
part of the fly brain called

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.900
the mushroom body.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.750
And mushroom bodies are
in all sorts of insects.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600
And I kind of like this quote.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.980
We more like to say the mushroom
body is the soul of the fly.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.230
But what I want to point out
here is this part of the quote.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.020
Flies are not as
intelligent as you,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.062
but they're
intelligence, much of it,

00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:22.520
comes from this small part of
the brain called the mushroom

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.500
body.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.440
If you have free will,
they have free will.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.500
But unlike you, we can here
point to a part of the brain

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.580
and say, that's where it is.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.680
And I'll try to convince
you of that as we go on.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.150
And so that's why I'm
talking about a fly.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.019
You can really say there's this
small part of the brain called

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.810
the mushroom body--

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.760
I'll show it to
you in a second--

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.540
where maybe not uniquely,
but certainly is

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.680
a point at which
intelligent behavior arises,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.470
in which something like
free will, whatever

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.020
makes different flies
do different things

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.360
on different occasions arises.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.150
Now, not only that,
again, compared

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.240
to what you might
know in a mammal,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.550
this is a region of the
brain where all the cell

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.050
types are known.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.780
There's genetic control
over all the cell types.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.800
There is a very good
optical level anatomy.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.800
And very soon, there'll
be an EM level anatomy.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.800
So it's a region of the
brain that has all of that.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.900
And so I thought it would
be a good example of where

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.010
the limits of knowledge
of neuroscience

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.944
are really extended out.

00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:37.610
You have to put up
with it's only a fly.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.860
Sure, it's kind of
a stupid animal.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.340
But I'll show you some behaviors
and what this thing can do,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.900
and we'll see how it will go.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.240
And maybe just some
machine learning.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.860
So these are the
people involved.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.930
This is a talk in which the
fraction of the work that I did

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.990
is not zero, but it's
very, very small.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.040
And so much of it is
done in collaboration

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.670
with Richard Axel and members
of his lab, of whom all

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.080
of these-- you
can see the names.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.900
Ann is a theory student
who worked with me.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.660
But an awful lot of the
work is done at Janelia

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.960
in a collaboration with
Jerry Rubin's group,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.910
and in particular, Yoshi Aso
did a huge amount of work here.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.170
So I feel just fortunate to
be able to kind of correct

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.090
the commas on the paper.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.200
That was my role
in this project.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200
So that's the people.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.080
OK, so what is the
mushroom body all about?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.181
This is a diagram of
the olfactory system.

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:36.680
I should have said
at the beginning,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.050
not only is it flies,
it's olfaction.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.100
Two of the most--

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.340
can you pick a more boring sense
and a more boring creature?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.240
So anyway, let's give it a try.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.990
So flies have receptors
along their antenna.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.410
The don't have a
nose, but that's

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.810
where the olfactory
receptors are.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.240
I'll show you in a schematic
a little bit later.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.670
There are neurons that
receive the odors,

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.010
then send a signal
to this structure.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.430
This is called
the antennal lobe.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.220
And at that point,
it gets relayed

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.650
from these set of neurons
to a set of neurons

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.240
called projection neurons.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.356
Those go up here, and
they send their signal

00:04:14.356 --> 00:04:15.230
to the mushroom body.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.829
And the mushroom body is
this kind of L-shaped thing

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.829
here that I'll describe
in more detail.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.340
And then they also send axons
to another region of the brain

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.930
called the lateral horn.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.340
I'll come back to that.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.500
I think I'll come back to that.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.110
Maybe I should say it
now so I don't forget.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.600
So as you'll see,
the mushroom body

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.240
is going to be responsible
for learned behaviors,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.720
is responsible for learned
behaviors in the fly.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.700
And the lateral
horn is responsible

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.804
for innate behaviors.

00:04:44.804 --> 00:04:46.220
You'll see at the
end of the talk,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.810
actually, evidence of that.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.650
So there's a division which
actually occurs in your brain

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.300
too of the olfactory
pathway to an innate

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.690
pathway and a more
flexible learned pathway.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.550
So this is a diagram.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.510
This is, again, from
the Janelia work

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.260
of real pictures of the stuff.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.570
It's overlaid on a fly brain.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.500
You don't see the
periphery here,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.200
but these are the
antennal lobes.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.380
So this is this relay
station in the fly brain.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.990
Here is one of the projection
neurons you see here.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.160
This is the mushroom body.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.110
Again, this L-shaped thing.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.460
And then it goes backwards.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.910
So that purple are the cell
bodies of the mushroom body.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.520
And here you can see it, again,
going to the lateral horn.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.770
This is the optic part of the
fly brain for doing olfaction.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.880
This is obviously a
schematic of the stages

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.220
of olfaction in the fly.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.060
These are supposed
to be the receptors,

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.810
so let me start with them.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.150
They're called olfactory
receptor neurons.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.980
There are about 1,000 of them.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.630
They come in around 50 types.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.250
And here the types have
been drawn in colors.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.120
And what a type means
is a cell that expresses

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.150
a single receptor molecule.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.300
So it will bind to a
set of odors, whatever

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.430
that particular molecule does.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.410
And so all of these
red guys are virtually

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.330
identical in their responses.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.540
All of the green guys
are identical, et cetera.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.750
And there are 50 types.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.290
And I'll show you
in a second, they

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.440
form about a 30-dimensional
representation

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.060
of olfactory space.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.670
Not as high as in your nose.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.090
Not nearly as high
as in a mouse's nose.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.740
But that's what you get.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.930
OK, as I mentioned,
these project

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.930
to this structure, which
is the antennal lobe

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.370
in my little diagram.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.870
And they have the
property that all

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.500
of the cells of a certain
type, in other words expressing

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.400
a particular receptor, project
to the same site, which

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.990
is called a glomerulus.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.480
So you can see all the red
guys go to the red one.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.880
All the purple guys to
the purple one, et cetera.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.760
So this is an incredibly
precise wiring

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.590
getting these 50 olfactory
signals from the 50 types

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.640
to a point in space,
or a region in space.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.890
And that's the point at
which the next cells--

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.620
so this is obviously
the input layer.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.630
I'm sort of over here,
giving you computer language,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.200
if you want, for all this.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.910
So at this point, you have
the projection neurons

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.290
pick up the signal.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.970
There are about
200 of them, again,

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.740
in the exact same 50
types, because there

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.860
are a few projection
neurons for each

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.380
of these different glomeruli.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.919
And they send the signal
onto the mushroom body,

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.460
and as I mentioned,
the lateral horn,

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.240
although we won't talk about
that whole lot until the end.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.940
And this is a
one-to-one connection.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.310
So every projection neuron--

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.130
let's say there are
red type projection

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.362
neurons that just pick up the
red signal, send it onward.

00:07:49.362 --> 00:07:51.320
There are purple type
guys-- they're not really

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.570
called this-- but they accept
these 50 signals, maintain them

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.910
as separate pathways.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.510
So what's this thing doing
from a sort of computer science

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.410
point of view?

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.030
Obviously, it's pooling.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.040
So these 1,000 cells are
pooling their resources

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.850
into 50 glomeruli.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.800
So you're averaging and
you're reducing noise.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.160
And there's also a normalization
process that goes on here.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.170
There are lateral
connections here

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.220
that try to even out
the responses so that--

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.010
let's say at a fixed
concentration, one odor that

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.100
causes a lot of responses
in the receptors

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.390
and another odor that gives
much less response kind of get

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.620
equaled out here, so that
the strong odor doesn't

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.789
overwhelm the weaker odor.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.310
OK, so that's this stage.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.340
And I thought I'd show you
some of these responses.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.610
So here are the 50.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.030
This is not all data.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.850
This is data plus extrapolation.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.650
But the data comes
from a beautiful study

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.120
of Hallem and Carlson.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.480
These would be the 50 ORNs,
types, so one of each type.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.710
And here are 110 orders
that were tested.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.700
And the responses in firing rate
color kind of look like this.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.660
You can see they've
been graded here.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.000
The responses get stronger as
you move from left to right.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.870
That's just the way
they ordered them.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.140
And you can see
they're quite uneven.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.780
So here is a kind of
weak responding odors

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.600
and here are much
stronger responding odors.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.520
So that's what's coming in.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.570
Now, if you look at the PN
level-- now, this is not data.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.470
This is a model.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.880
It's a model really due to
Rachel Wilson and members

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.150
of her lab, but also
constructed by Sean Luo

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.370
and Ann Kennedy in my group.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.310
And you can see the argument.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.860
So basically, what's
happened is these inputs

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.370
come in and have gone through
a model that reproduces what

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.290
we think the PNs are doing.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.080
PNs have not been tested with
this whole panel of odors.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.120
But you can see the
normalization effect.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.920
You notice that the activity
is spread much more equally

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.320
across these odors
than these odors.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.050
And that's reflected in the
fact that if you measure

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.110
by various ways the dimension
of this representation,

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.220
you get about 30.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.800
And here it goes up
a little bit to 35

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.440
because of this kind
of equalization effect,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.840
and also some decorrelation
effect that goes on.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.880
So there is that.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.580
So what I've described here
is sort of the front end

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.230
of this olfactory system.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.430
And it is completely
stereotyped.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.680
It's a precise wiring.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.120
I've described it to you.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.070
It's the same in every fly.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.950
If you look at two
neurons of the same type,

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.820
they look virtually identical.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.570
So this is a hard-wired system.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.750
And you would not say
there's any free will

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.280
or intelligence in this system.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.590
It's just getting the signal in.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.820
And you'll see a little
bit more of that later.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.050
OK, so what about
the next level?

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.850
The next level is
the mushroom body.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.380
So these yellow things are
the mushroom body neurons.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.060
They're called Kenyon cells.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.920
There are about 2,000 of them.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.990
They come in only seven types.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.850
So already, we sense
something's happening here.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.420
There's something changing
about the representation.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.180
The representation is getting
much higher dimensional.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.430
It's something like
1,000 dimensional.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.180
So there's a projection
out to a high dimensional

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.620
representation.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.190
And this is where the
free will comes in.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.730
And in anatomical terms, the
reason it does is because--

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.770
I'll try to persuade
you with the data--

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.770
that this acts exactly like
a random, high dimensional,

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.800
hidden layer in a
machine learning system.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.090
So this guy is
suddenly a new beast.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.580
Within one synapse,
the system's gone

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.570
from completely stereotyped
to, you know, crazy.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.040
Completely random.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.140
I would say there's
lots of evidence

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.120
that it's different
in every fly,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.910
that every one of these
neurons is different.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.060
And you've completely
given up the stereotypy.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.340
So now, how do you
get back to sense?

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.740
Because you've built
this beautiful olfactory

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.860
representation here, and it's
as if you've thrown it out.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.290
You've just gone crazy.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.430
And so now, I put the box
around here just to remind us,

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.800
this is a different
beast all of a sudden.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.400
And it's a very unusual
beast in the fly brain.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.380
I'll come back to that.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.440
But now you have output.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.280
So these yellow
neurons, as you'll see,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.080
do not leave the mushroom body.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.610
They don't send any signal out.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.920
They're completely intrinsic
to the mushroom body.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.370
But there are neurons called
mushroom body output neurons

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.770
that do send the signal out.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.430
And again, now it's
a new ballgame.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.960
First of all, look
at the numbers.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.760
You've gone from 2,000 neurons
to 34 neurons of 21 types.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.310
You've got about a
20-dimensional representation.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.770
There's been a collapse
of the representation.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:03.360
So I would argue you can just
see right away from this slide

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.910
that this is an
olfactory representation.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.070
This is an olfactory
representation cleaned up

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:08.670
a bit.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.410
This is a crazy, random
olfactory representation.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.680
This is not an olfactory
representation.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.280
The dimension is lower
than what you started with,

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.130
so there's no way you can
represent the full thing.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:24.330
This is already, somehow, making
a decision about olfaction.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.180
It's well on the
way to a behavior.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.050
And again, the great
thing about the fly

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.220
here is that you get
there very quickly.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.350
If you went to Jim's
talk today, I'm

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.590
sure he talked to you
about the long pathway

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.550
in the visual
systems of monkeys,

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:49.210
in which these stages take up
a good fraction of your brain.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.990
These more complicated
stages do it.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.150
And then it's very
difficult to see

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.860
where this transition is to
decisions and things like that.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.680
Here, the transition from
orderly input representation,

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.400
sort of retinal-like,
to IT-like,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.580
if you want, in the visual
system occurs in one synapse.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.510
And then the return to
a decision, a behavior,

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.590
in another synapse.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.910
It's very quick.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.240
And I would think of that
in computer science terms

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.294
as a readout layer.

00:14:19.294 --> 00:14:21.210
As you'll see, it's
actually a layered system,

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.710
but it's the readout.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.640
OK, and this system
here, it goes back

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.500
to being completely stereotyped.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.300
There are very few neurons
per type, if you notice.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.680
There are almost as many cell
types as there are neurons.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.350
And they're the same
in every animal.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.020
So you've gone from
stereotypy at the input

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.470
stage, a wild and crazy
random thing in the middle,

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.560
and then back to stereotypic
to get to the output.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.630
Which of course, you
have to do, right?

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.800
Your motor neurons have to
go to the right muscles.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.250
You can't randomly wire
your motor neurons.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.064
And thinking occurs
between those.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.230
Same thing with your retina.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.140
It has to be wired to give
you the basic visual signal.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.910
But between those
two extremes, that's

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.350
where we do our thinking.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.500
And as I say, that
you can see here,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.710
but it's in this one layer, OK?

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:18.610
All right, and the key is going
to be exactly as in a machine

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:19.810
learning system.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.480
As you'll see, the key
to the whole system

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.000
is the plasticity and
modulation that occurs

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.860
at that set of connections.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.130
There's no evidence that these
connections, these connections,

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.530
and these connections are
at least very plastic.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.510
They may be modulated
a little bit,

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.430
but the business
end of this thing,

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.600
just as in many machine
learning networks,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.990
is that the readout
unit's being adjusted.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.280
And I will come back to that.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.010
All right, so here,
the mushroom body,

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.590
it started out as
it was in the fly.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.070
And as it turns, you'll see why
it's called the mushroom body.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.050
Yeah, now it looks
like a mushroom.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.880
So these are the cell bodies.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.010
They receive-- you can't
really see very well here,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.570
but they receive their input
right under the mushroom.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.580
And then they send axons down.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.570
And these axons form the load.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.170
So this whole thing is
made out of Kenyon cells.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.240
That's the Kenyon cells
all together forming

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.010
this structure.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.810
How many cells?

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.870
A couple of thousand.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.960
OK, now here you can see one
of the projection neurons.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.720
Here's where it gets its
input from the antenna lobe,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.510
goes up to the mushroom body,
goes over to the lateral horn.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.830
And here you can see-- it's
sort of hard to distinguish

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.760
that neuropil from
the cell bodies here,

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.610
but here you can see that sort
of under this layer of cell

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.820
bodies, it's making
its connections.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.240
And what I want to
stress here is this idea

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.750
that the projection
neurons occur

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.940
very few cells per cell type.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.020
Now, these cells types--

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.970
I guess I'm going to get
ahead of myself a little bit.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.220
But through work at
Janelia Farm in particular,

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.800
there have been these
intersectional strategies

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.790
for expressing various
markers in these cells.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.160
And they've been
supremely successful.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.720
So typically, when you get a
cell type in this business,

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.839
it's often two cells, one
on each side of the fly.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.339
They're perfect mirror
images of each other.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.800
And they're identical
in all flies.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.319
So that's what you
mean by a cell type.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:29.080
And in much of the fly, there
are very few of them per--

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.550
this is per side.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.980
There will always
be an even number.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.460
And you can see, there are 50
types, a couple hundred cells.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.990
That's part of the
specific wiring.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.390
Now, if you look at the Kenyon
cells, so here they are,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.570
there are, as I mentioned, about
a couple of thousand of them.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.570
And there are up to
600 of them per type.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.610
It's much more like what
we think of as cortex.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.840
We don't think of the cortex
as having millions and millions

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.620
of cell types.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.320
Maybe thousands, but there are
many, many cells per cell type.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.440
And that occurs here.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.210
Very small number of cell types
relative to the other things.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.900
And here's one of them.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:08.980
It's superimposed.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.820
So these Kenyon cells, they
have their cell body here.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.050
They make their connections.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.410
So they get the input from
the projection neuron,

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.380
send an axon down, which
in some cases splits.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.710
And there are five lobes here.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.570
There is an alpha lobe
or an alpha prime lobe

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:28.780
here, a beta lobe or a
beta prime lobe here.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.760
And then some of them
send a single axon

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.360
down to a gamma lobe.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.350
You will see that
a little bit more.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.090
Then that's it.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.590
That's how the mushroom body's
built. And if you notice,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.990
they do not send anything
out of the mushroom body.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.840
So the first thing
I want to ask, then,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.010
is what happens at this junction
between the orderly world

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.890
of the fly, characterized
by these PNs,

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.130
and the wild and random world
of the fly, characterized

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.090
by these Kenyon sets?

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:59.470
Here's where they meet in this
calyx of the mushroom body.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.110
So the experiment
that I was involved

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.950
in the data analysis of
came from Richard's lab

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.450
and was done in
the following way.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.600
First, a single Kenyon
cell-- so here you

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.480
can see all these cell
bodies of Kenyon cells.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.980
There are zillions
of them up there,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.390
thousands of them up there.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.310
But one of them has been--

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.970
the GFP in one of them has
been activated, photoactivated.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.290
So you can see this single
Kenyon cell comes down.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.470
Here it's making connections
to get the olfactory input

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.880
from the projection neurons.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.470
And then the axon's
going to go down

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.400
through the floor into the
other parts that I showed you.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.510
So the trick in this thing--
you can't see very well,

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.490
but I think I maybe made
a circle around one.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.000
You can't see it very
well, but the terminals

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.760
of this guy, the postsynaptic
terminals, are like claws.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.870
They're called claws.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.290
And they grab hold of one of
the terminals of the projection

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.850
neurons and make a synapse.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.480
So that's how they work.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.870
This guy has about
seven of these claws,

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.160
so there are very few
connections per Kenyon cell.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.230
The trick was for Sophie
to inject the die right

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:12.100
into the claw here, which
is a very tightly sealed

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.590
little microglomerulus.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:19.000
And that die is taken up by
a projection neuron, the one

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.700
and only one projection neuron
that has a terminal there.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.930
And here you can see the axon
of that projection neuron

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:30.070
as it makes terminals in
other parts of this calyx

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.510
and makes connections
with other Kenyon cells.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.160
So there it is.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.730
So that's not the
important part.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.170
The important part is you can
trace back this projection

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.715
neuron to the antenna lobe and
see where it got its input.

00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:43.090
And now, because
the antenna lobe

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.270
is a totally stereotyped,
structured thing,

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.770
you can now read out.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.240
If you know the
antennal lobe, you

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.330
will know that this input
is of a certain type.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.890
It's from a certain
set of receptors.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.540
So you know right away that
this guy is getting input

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.770
from receptor number three,
or whoever sends projections

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.830
to that thing.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.730
Furthermore, you can repeat
this with other terminals

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.030
of that cell, get a
whole lot of projections,

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.750
and find, essentially,
all of the inputs--

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.720
sometimes not all, but
most of the inputs--

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.330
that go to this Kenyon cell
and figure out what they are.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.240
So in other words,
the result of this,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.030
without doing EM or all
that, is a connectome.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:29.080
It's the connection matrix
between the glomeruli,

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.540
or if you want, these
olfactory channels.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.020
And there are 50 up around
here, plus some hot and cold

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.990
and some other stuff.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.310
But basically, the 50
glomeruli are at the top.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.570
And 200 Kenyon cells that were
measured going down the side.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.820
Not all 2,000 Kenyon
cells were measured.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.010
These are not measured
from the same animal.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.920
But you basically get
this connectivity matrix.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.390
A red little square here
means that this connection

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.730
was found for this Kenyon cell.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.280
And a yellow one means
a double connection.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.980
There were actually two
connections between that Kenyon

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.230
cell and that glomerulus.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.580
So there's the matrix.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.710
So then my job at this
point was say, well, what's

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.860
the structure of this matrix?

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.110
And that's a trickier problem.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.693
I mean, you look at it by eye,
you say, well, it looks random.

00:22:14.693 --> 00:22:16.360
It just looks like
a bunch of dots.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.860
But what you have
to remember, and I

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.443
think this is a
really important thing

00:22:19.443 --> 00:22:22.000
to remember in
connectomes, is connectomes

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.950
don't come labeled, all right?

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.490
So this matrix is arranged
in the following way.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.710
This is alphabetical,
which probably is not

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.440
of fundamental
neuroscience significance.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.060
And this is the order in
which the cells were measured,

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.330
which is also probably not
of neuroscience significance.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.540
So the question is,
is there any way

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.690
to permute the rows and
columns of this matrix

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.890
to get a structure?

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.320
That's the question you
have to answer here.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.370
And just let me show
you an example of that.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.630
So here's a matrix that
I've shrunk the size a bit,

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.550
but it's exactly the
same kind of matrix.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.270
In fact, it probably looks to
you pretty much like the data.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.270
It doesn't have the colors,
but other than that.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.790
So here's a data matrix.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.646
But this one I made up.

00:23:02.646 --> 00:23:04.520
And it turns out, of
course, I knew the trick

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.290
that if you re-sort, if you
permute the rows and columns,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.340
it looks like this.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.970
So just because
that looks random

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.430
does not at all mean
there's no structure there.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.200
So you have to do
a lot of analysis

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.440
to convince yourself that
there's no structure.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.020
So one of the first
things you could do--

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.630
random doesn't mean uniform.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.760
So one thing you can do is
just sum down the columns here

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.570
and ask, how many connections
does each of the glomeruli

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.390
make?

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:33.760
And it's not uniform.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.900
It's quite uneven.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.370
Here's the histogram.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.550
But really, the question
we ask is, is there

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.090
something more to it?

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.920
For example, if a Kenyon cell
gets one of these inputs,

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.660
is it more likely to also
get one of those inputs?

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.670
Are there any correlations here?

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.320
And that's really the question.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.230
And we did a whole
lot of analysis.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.280
And the answer's no.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.350
I'm not going to
take you through it.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.420
That all the tests
we could possibly

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.110
do are completely consistent
with just randomly selecting

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.480
from this probability
distribution

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.740
without independent ID,
or whatever it's called.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:14.920
OK, so there are other
papers, an earlier paper

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.810
and a later paper,
that essentially

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.230
come to the same conclusion.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.820
What's interesting about the
Murthy, Fiete, and Laurent

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.405
paper is they actually
provide some evidence

00:24:24.405 --> 00:24:26.530
that, in fact, it's different
in different animals.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.260
This doesn't prove that
because this is already

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.485
taken from different animals.

00:24:30.485 --> 00:24:32.110
I'm not going to
present that evidence.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.309
But there is
evidence that this is

00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:35.600
different in different animals.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.290
So this looks like
a random structure.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.200
Now, it's interesting, you
guys, why seven connections?

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:47.410
Seven seems awfully small to
us cortico-centric people.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.120
And so why seven?

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.580
Well, you can do a
following little exercise.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.390
You can say, suppose that
the Kenyon cells only had

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.100
one connection.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.360
Then how many duplicate
Kenyon cells would there be?

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.280
Well, there are only 50
possible types of input, right?

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.159
There are 50 types
of Kenyon grand cell.

00:25:05.159 --> 00:25:06.575
So if you only
have one connection

00:25:06.575 --> 00:25:08.270
and you're making
2,000 cells, you're

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.480
going to get tons of repeats,
hundreds of thousands

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.150
of pairs that are identical.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.292
So that you would
not spread out.

00:25:15.292 --> 00:25:17.750
Now, you can do this calculation
for two connections, three

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.200
connections, four connections.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.940
And it goes down.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.330
And if you look at the
line where you'd only

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.980
expect one pair to be the same,
the mushroom body-- in fact,

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.050
if you average, it's
between six and seven.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.690
It's right in there.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.920
The mushroom body is
right at the point

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.710
where you convince yourself
that most of the time every cell

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:37.760
will be different.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.630
And then why go any further?

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.630
Some of you may know something
about the cerebellum.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.810
These are like granule
cells of the cerebellum.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.677
Granule cells in the
cerebellum typically

00:25:49.677 --> 00:25:51.260
have four or five
inputs [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.460
They're small cells with
claws with very few inputs.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.900
And their axons
form parallel fibers

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.540
and then can get connected
by Purkinje cells.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.350
This system is the
same, if you notice.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.160
The parallel fibers
are forming the trunk

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.800
and that L-shaped region
in the mushroom body.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.230
So these are like granule cells.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.030
OK, so where are we?

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.980
So we've got to get a
signal out of this thing

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.450
or it's completely
useless, right?

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.150
So we've got this random
signal into this beast.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.170
So what do the output
neurons look like?

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.410
There's an output
neuron, one of them.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.940
And what you might
notice is it's

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.400
going to a very
compact region right

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.705
at the head of this alpha--

00:26:34.705 --> 00:26:36.830
I don't know if this is an
alpha or an alpha prime.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.350
But it's going to one or
the other of those lobes.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.340
So it's very restricted
in its dendrites.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.880
And then off it goes carrying
the signal wherever it's going.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.880
So in fact, I tried
to argue earlier

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.710
that the output neurons
in a mushroom body

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.960
have gone back to
this other mode.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.940
Very few cells per type.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.610
Practically as many
types as output cells.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.630
And a very small
number of cells.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.910
And if you took a picture of
this cell in another animal,

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.010
it would look exactly the same.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.020
All right, so it was known
before this Janelia work,

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.300
that if you take the
mushroom body lobe--

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.540
so this is this L-shaped
structure at the bottom,

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.600
or it's really at the front
of the mushroom body--

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.640
and you peel off the
gamma lobe, the gamma

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.990
would sit there but it would
kind of block your view.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.570
So it's been peeled off here.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.390
So you have this
alpha beta lobe.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.420
That's one set of axons
that have bifurcated.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.420
And they come in sort of
here and then bifurcate.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.000
You have the alpha prime
beta lobe bifurcating.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.800
And then you have
this third gamma lobe.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.290
That divides up each of
these into five sections.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.110
They're numbered like this,
but there are five of them, OK?

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.990
Alpha 1, 2, 3 and beta 1, 2.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:55.030
So each of these guys gets
divided into five compartments.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.800
And then there's an extra
compartment right here

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.340
called the peduncle, where--

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.970
here's the mushroom head.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.230
Here's the stock.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:04.190
And then you get this.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.460
And right at the base of the
stock, there's another one.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:13.550
And so what the Janelia
collaboration figured out

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:17.760
by genetically targeting
these cells very precisely.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.160
It is summarized
by this picture.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.970
So this shows different
types of these output

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.590
neurons in different colors.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.540
And what you can
see is that they are

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.090
respecting the compartments.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.960
That you have basically one
type of output neuron going

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.240
to each compartment
without overlap.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.350
And there really is--

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.810
there's now EM level
data, and they really

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.410
don't overlap at all.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:45.220
Here's kind of what it looks
like in an anatomical diagram.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.640
Here are the Kenyon cells.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.890
Here's the calyx where
they get their input.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.740
Here's this L-shaped structure.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:56.560
And these output neurons
respect each other's territory.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.980
Here is the 16
compartments where they do.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.750
And then they're very well
organized in another way.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.240
You notice these colors here.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.130
These colors refer
to the transmitter

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.480
of the output neuron.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.880
So all the glutamate
guys are over here.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.750
All the GABA guys are down here.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.060
The cholinergic
guys are over here.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:20.010
Now, again, you get this extreme
order returning to the system.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.990
Here's a theorist's
version of this.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:25.770
Here are the compartments, the
16 compartments, 5 per lobe,

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:29.190
plus the peduncle, which kind of
belongs to the alpha beta lobe.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:31.230
Here they are, the
different compartments.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.650
And then here are the output
cells assigned to them.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.470
They're not necessarily
one cell per blob here.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.050
Sometimes there are a few cells.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.220
But basically, those
are the cell types.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.910
And as I mentioned,
they respect--

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.430
they only go to one
compartment each.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.200
And then those are
the transmitters,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.300
which in this diagram,
they don't cluster nicely.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.150
But in the other
diagram they do.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.250
Now, you can ask, why
bother to do this?

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.280
Because there are
axons going down.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.010
The parallel fibers that
the Kenyon cells make,

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.090
they go that way.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:07.170
So all of these guys have access
to exactly the same input.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.570
So what would it matter
if this guy decided

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.697
to send a branch over and pick
up the axon over there instead

00:30:12.697 --> 00:30:13.280
of over there?

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.190
It would make no
difference at all.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.740
So at this point,
you would sort of

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.770
wonder, why are they respecting
these compartments so

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:20.790
faithfully?

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.900
And that's answered
in this slide.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.750
So these are the
output neurons, as you

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.950
can see, kind of tiling the
thing in these compartments.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:30.870
And this is a set
of dopamine neurons,

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:34.200
which were also genetically
isolated in this way

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.790
and labeled, that target
these compartments.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.360
And you notice the
perfect alignment.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.530
So the reason these guys
are compartmentalized

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.970
is so they can be individually
modulated by dopamine.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.660
And you can see that here.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.200
So the dopamine
neurons come, again,

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.170
in slightly more
numbers of types.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:31:01.050
But they align and exactly
innervate these compartments

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.550
without overlap.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.790
So the reason the
beta 2 guy's in here

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.370
is so it can be innervated
by these particular dopamine

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:09.870
neurons.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.110
The dopamine neurons are
divided into two classes.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.150
And again, if we go to
the anatomical-- oh,

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.020
I should mention.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.240
If you notice, there were some
missing compartments there,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.890
but some of the dopamine
neurons go to 2,

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:24.540
so everybody gets covered.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.170
If you go back to this
anatomical diagram, what

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:32.010
you see is everybody
over here gets

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.290
modulated by these, what are
called, PAM dopamine neurons.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.290
And they're associated
with reward.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.690
So when good stuff
happens, you hammer

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.650
this part of the mushroom body.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.160
When bad stuff happens,
you hammer this part

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.260
of the mushroom body
with a different set

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.290
of what are called
PPL1 dopamine neurons.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.810
So again, this
beautiful structure.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:56.260
All right, so let me finish
elaborating this for you.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.520
This is the basic structure.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.040
Again, I didn't put it on at
first, but some of these guys

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.590
actually conduct
two compartments.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.010
So it's not quite
true what I said.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:12.600
But basically, that's the output
stream from the mushroom body.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:18.750
And then there is a
layered system put on.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.000
These are the
connections, but I kind of

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.580
depicted it down here
more schematically.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.710
What you have in
this output system

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:29.850
is a one layer system down
here, a two layer system,

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.470
a three layer system,
and a four layer system.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.170
So the output is actually
a four layer network,

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.470
feedforward network.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:42.150
There's no recurrence
up to this point.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.910
And all of the action occurs
on the alpha beta lobe.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.310
The alpha beta
lobe is responsible

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.720
for long-term memories.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.900
You could think of this as
the most sophisticated lobe.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.360
Gamma lobe is more for
short-term memories,

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.830
has a simpler readout.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:00.910
Alpha prime beta prime lobe is,
to me, kind of God knows what.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.370
But probably somebody knows.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.160
Anyway, but it's, again,
a simpler output system.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.267
So it's just a beautiful system.

00:33:07.267 --> 00:33:08.850
In part, I'm just
telling you about it

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.470
because it's beautiful.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.540
OK, so that's the thing.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.870
And then these outputs
go to various regions.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:18.160
If you don't know the fly
brain, you don't care.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.120
But what's interesting
is now the loop closes.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.600
So the regions that receive
output from the mushroom body

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.960
also provide input to
the dopamine neurons.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.870
So when the mushroom body
acts, the dopamine neurons

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.510
know about it.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.740
And when the dopamine
neurons react,

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.250
the mushroom body
knows about it.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:40.500
So you have this closed system
which finally loops together.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.850
And the dopamine system
is a reporter of behavior.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.930
So it tells the mushroom
body what the fly's doing.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.770
Or also internal state,
how the fly's feeling.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.930
I'll show you that in a second.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.565
And then these are going
to be, obviously, some sort

00:33:55.565 --> 00:33:58.200
of learned or
modulating responses,

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.070
modulated by this system.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.940
You remember that these cannot
have any intrinsic meaning,

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.760
because they've gone
through a random stage here.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.420
They cannot be assigned meaning
without some sort of learning

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.530
or instruction.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.909
So these are learned outputs.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:15.530
And so that's the system.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:19.639
OK, so what does this system do?

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:23.420
One of the nice things
that's happened in parallel

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.719
with this anatomical advance
that I've been describing

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:31.460
is a behavioral advance of
what's the mushroom for.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.170
I'll start with the
classic picture.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.389
Mushroom body has been
studied for a long, long time.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:37.370
That quote was from 1850.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.460
And it's mostly been studied
as a classical conditioning

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.380
system, memory system.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.690
You train a fly to
be afraid of an odor

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.659
or to be attracted to an
odor through a classical

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:48.920
conditioning experiment.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.909
And here's a nice,
recent version

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:54.870
of that that's
quite instructive.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.630
So in this experiment,
what you do is

00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:00.950
you put one odor in the end of
a chamber, a very small chamber

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:01.970
that holds a fly.

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.367
One odor comes in one end.

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:04.700
One odor comes in the other end.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.690
You pump it out in the middle.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.000
And then you track the fly.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.860
Flies pace back and forth.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.010
And so the fly paces
back and forth.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.650
But frequently, if it
doesn't like odor B,

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:18.930
it might come to this central
region, say, oh, that's odor B,

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.510
turn around and go back.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.150
And so what you do is
count electronically

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:27.080
how many times the fly
crosses these boundaries.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.210
And you can get a
measure of its preference

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.470
for being in the A
end or the B end.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:36.230
And this is experiments done in
Gero Miesenboeck's laboratory.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.440
Now, what you can do then is--

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.140
in the first set of
experiments that I'll show you,

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.360
they just look at
the innate preference

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.280
of the fly for an odor,
without any training.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.550
That's due to the lateral
horn, as you'll see.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.000
But then you can associate
one of the odors,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.740
for example, with
an electric shock.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.740
And presumably, the fly
is going to then associate

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.140
that odor with
danger and avoid it.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.560
So here's the data.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.680
No, first I guess I
built a little model.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.690
So it's been long suspected
how this could work.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.010
This is quite easy.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.047
You have-- there are
the Kenyon cells.

00:36:10.047 --> 00:36:11.630
Here's a mushroom
body, output neuron.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.040
Here's a dopamine neuron.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.980
So an odor comes along-- that's
the conditioned stimulus--

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.430
activates some Kenyon cells.

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.970
Then the unconditioned stimulus
comes along, the shock.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.640
That activates the
dopamine neuron.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.180
And where you have activity
plus dopamine, for example,

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.745
you strengthen the synapses.

00:36:30.745 --> 00:36:32.120
There's evidence
that it actually

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.910
might work by weakening the
synapses, but for this diagram,

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.250
I strengthen the synapses, OK?

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:41.720
Then, later on, when
the odor comes along,

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.372
it activates the same set.

00:36:43.372 --> 00:36:45.080
Now you have these
strengthened synapses.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.570
You activate the mushroom
body output neuron

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.350
and you send an alarm signal.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:53.230
So that's just classical
conditioning with this system.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.410
And here are the data
showing it works.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.770
So first of all, this is
the innate preference.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.360
What's interesting--
the reason I

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.520
included this
later experiment is

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.340
because they looked at the
innate preference as well

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.750
as the learned preference.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.690
So this is just
showing you that this

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:13.820
is the distance between the
PN activity for these odors.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.280
So this is a measure of
the discriminability.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.000
And they sort of argue
that these odors which

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.210
have a zero
preference maybe can't

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.560
be distinguished by the fly.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.540
You don't know that,
but any rate, zero

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.280
means they're equally
likely to go to both ends.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.920
So these odors, they don't care.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.930
But when the odors
are quite different,

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.530
they can have a fairly
strong preference

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.630
for one odor over the other.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.890
Now you train, and
suddenly you have

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:46.850
a strong preference or a strong
avoidance, a preference for one

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.000
over the one that was
associated with shock.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.160
And now what they
did was genetically--

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.860
I mentioned that we
now have genetic access

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.880
to all these cells.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.790
One of the things you can do
is block synaptic transmission

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.230
from all the Kenyon cells.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:03.520
So you just wipe out the
output of the mushroom body.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.560
That's done by raising the
temperature of these flies.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.500
And suddenly, they go right
back to their innate preferences

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.290
as if they'd never
learned something.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.510
But they still can
sense the odor.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.190
They still have their
innate preference,

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.542
almost identical to
what it was before.

00:38:18.542 --> 00:38:19.250
But they've lost.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.350
Now, if you cool
down these flies,

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.700
they'll pop back up to there.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:29.030
OK, that's classical
conditioning.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.550
Oh, I know what I was
going to mention here.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.490
Not in these experiments,
but in other experiments,

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.710
you can replace
the electric shock

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.570
by an activation of
the dopamine neuron.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:43.730
So you can show that these
avoidance type dopamine

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.720
neurons really do convey the
avoidance message, because you

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.990
can train them to avoid
odor B when all they got

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:54.920
was an activation, let's say
an optogenetic activation

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.060
of a dopamine neuron.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.350
That's been done tons now.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.790
OK, so here's another example.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:05.570
As I said, I think the classic
literature on the fly is that.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:09.170
It's classical conditioning
studied in zillions of ways,

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.940
looking at the molecular
basis, et cetera, et cetera.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.820
But here's some
more newer results.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:19.050
Here's one from Daisuke
Hattori in Richard's lab.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:21.630
It involves this alpha
prime 3 lobe, just

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.060
to show you what it is.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.490
And it has the
following features.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.590
So it's a little
hard to see, maybe,

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:30.850
but this is a pulse that
shows that the odor, which

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.150
is MCH here, the odor
has been introduced.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:39.890
And here is the response of this
alpha prime 3 output neuron.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.600
So there you're
seeing a response.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:45.050
And if you look across time,
that response fades away.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.240
It even starts to reverse maybe.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.820
So there's an adaptation
of this response.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.300
You say, big deal.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.300
But this adaptation
is definitely

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.670
occurring at the output
of the mushroom body.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.650
The Kenyon cells
are not adapting.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.840
It's due to the dopamine,
because if you block

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.340
the dopamine you don't get it.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.700
So this is dopamine
specific adaptation.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.850
But what's more interesting
about it is shown here,

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.680
that if you take an odor
response to MCH, adapt it

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.350
away, but then
present a new odor,

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:19.610
benzaldehyde, now you
get a response again.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:23.600
Then you can adapt the way the
response of the benzaldehyde

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.670
and introduce a third
order, you get a thing.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:29.280
So this is an
odor-dependent adaptation,

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.170
which really suggests that
the dopamine is specifically

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:36.440
weakening the synapses
that are active at the time

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.670
of the dopamine response.

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.980
So it's like the
classical conditioned,

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.620
but there's no
conditioning here.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:47.610
Furthermore, when you adapt
one odor and then another,

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.310
the first order remains adapted.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.920
So I sort of see this system--

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.200
I've always had trouble
with the classical condition

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.060
experiments, imagining
where would a fly

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.370
get into a situation
where it smells an odor

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.640
and gets a shock, or
something like that?

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.300
But this, you can immediately
see, would be very useful.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.170
You could adapt
to an environment

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.060
that has a whole set of odors.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.400
And then if you come
back to that environment

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.110
and there's a new
odor present, you'll

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.970
immediately know it,
because this neuron

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:15.230
is going to respond.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.870
Whereas if you come back to
the identical environment,

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:21.630
or without new odors,
this won't respond.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:27.230
So this is a neuron to
identify unexpected olfactory

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.420
features of an environment.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.350
Or it's one thing it could do.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:36.180
OK, I think I just repeated that
because I wanted to say that.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.370
Here's another example.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:42.350
This comes from Raphael
Cohn and Vanessa Ruta's lab.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:47.180
And this is really the
effect of internal state.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.180
So I argued for you that
these dopamine neurons

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.860
were reflecting the internal
state of the animal.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.380
And they have a very
beautiful experiment on that.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.110
So these are the gamma.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:59.270
I guess I didn't say
before, but these

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:01.849
are the gamma 2 through
gamma 5 compartments

00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:03.140
that we're going to talk about.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.240
What they did was to
image the dopamine

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.840
neurons in those compartments,
gamma 2, 3, 4, and 5,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.240
and observed that
when the fly is--

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.550
the fly is in an
uncomfortable position,

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:15.040
to put it mildly here.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.270
It's glued to something,
I don't know what.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.570
And there's a hole in its head.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:22.070
Other than that,
everything's fine.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:24.050
So it's an unhappy fly.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.650
You might want to speculate
that this is an unhappy fly.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.810
And what they observed
is while the fly is

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.860
flailing about and unhappily
expressing its unhappiness,

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.910
these gamma 2 and
gamma 3 compartments

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.590
have dopamine input.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.527
And the gamma 4
and gamma 5 don't.

00:42:41.527 --> 00:42:43.610
But they also observed
that every once in a while,

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:48.020
the fly just chills out,
hangs there, like, oh Christ.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.740
And when that happens,
it reverses the pattern.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.150
Now these are not
dopamine activated

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.120
and these ones are
dopamine modulated.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.730
Although this is not
unequivocal happiness.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:02.660
This is mixed.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.290
But then they
started manipulating.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.770
So here, you take one
of these unhappy flies,

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:10.130
you give it some sugar, it
becomes a happy fly, right?

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.530
Remember, the red over
here, this is a happy fly.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.320
This is a sad fly,
because they shocked it.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.530
So it's clear that this
thing is really reading a--

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.250
they'll be a little fanciful--
but happy fly, sad fly.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.530
You could take a look at
these compartments and say,

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:29.510
that is one unhappy
fly, or one happy fly.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.060
Furthermore, now, so that
means the internal state

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.770
is being represented here.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.032
But in addition,
it has an effect.

00:43:36.032 --> 00:43:37.490
So this is an
experiment where they

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:45.330
imaged the output term, the
dendrites of the output neuron.

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.900
So they're looking at
transmission from the Kenyon

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.280
cell to the output neuron.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.570
They present an odor.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.270
And they activate the
dopamine neuron themselves.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.630
So when they don't activate
the dopamine neuron,

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.990
this is a measure of
synaptic transmission.

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:01.660
The odor response here is weak.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.070
When they do, it
gets much stronger.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.890
So now what you
have is something--

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:09.630
I mean, I think if I saw
this in cortex, I'd go wild--

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.820
is a gating effect.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.640
You have internal state
affecting the thing of this,

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.670
and it determines
where the output goes.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:20.475
So for example, if you're--

00:44:20.475 --> 00:44:22.100
I can never remember
which one's happy.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.440
This is happy, right?

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.130
So if you're happy, then
odors go to one thing, which

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:31.270
might say, approach that order.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.550
You know, be sort of a
little more easy going.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:38.590
If you're unhappy, then an
odor response gets relayed out

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:39.920
this pathway.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.040
And it might tell you to
be afraid of all odors,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:42.998
or something like that.

00:44:42.998 --> 00:44:44.030
Be very cautious.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.540
So you start to
see in this system

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.010
the routing of sensory
information by internal states.

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.750
That, to me, is a very
exciting thing to see.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.890
OK, here's another one--
internal state affects memory.

00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:01.750
This is from Tanimoto, another
collaboration with the Janelia

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:02.530
lab.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.320
So you can do the same
kind of experiment

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.320
I showed you before with
shock, only do it with sweet.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.630
So in this case, it's a T maze.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.790
A fly comes in this way.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:18.200
And you associate, let's say,
odor A with a sweet reward.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.010
Then the fly is going to come
in here and most of the time

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:21.550
go this way.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:25.090
Flies are never 100%
performers, but they'll

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:28.410
tend to go to odor A because
they associate that with sweet,

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:29.410
provided they're hungry.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.320
I'll come back to
the hungry part.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.785
So you take a hungry
fly, it goes this way.

00:45:33.785 --> 00:45:35.660
Now, here's what they
did that's very clever.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:40.210
It involves these PAM
neurons, PAM dopamine neurons.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:46.360
So as you all know, you get
the hit of sugar in your mouth

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.140
right away.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.140
And then you get
nutritional value,

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.130
or you get fat or
whatever later.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:55.540
And the decoupling of those
causes us a lot of problems.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.950
So you see that here
in this system very,

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:02.080
very well, because they take
a sugar that's sweet tasting

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:05.380
to the fly but can't be digested
by the fly, that provides

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.780
no nutritional value at all.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.970
And when they do that--

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.890
so there's no nutrition
in this sugar--

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:16.360
what they get is a short-term
attraction to that odor,

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.790
enough to buy the
next Coke, sort of.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:20.950
It's conveyed
through octopamine,

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:23.260
so the sweetness
activates octopamine.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:27.370
Octopamine activates a certain
set of these PAM neurons.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:31.210
That makes changes
in the transmission

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:32.500
in various compartments.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.020
This is not isolated to
a unique compartment.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.660
Then the next time that odor
comes on, it goes out here

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.160
and it gives you attraction.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.570
But it's a short-term
attraction, lasts a few hours.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.800
Now, if you make the
sugar nutritious--

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.840
and they do this in a clever way
by using another sugar that has

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.900
no taste to the fly but
that the fly can digest,

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.670
so now this nutritious--

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:01.090
then it activates a fructose
receptor, blah, blah, blah,

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:04.450
activates a different
set of dopamine neurons.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:07.940
That potentiates or depresses--
we don't actually know--

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.180
but it changes synapses
in the alpha 1 lobe.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.170
And now you get a
long-term memory.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:14.560
So flies are smarter
than people in a way.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.060
They'll only do this
long-term memory

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:20.290
if they then also sense
a nutritional benefit

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:23.680
to whatever they're eating.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.529
OK, so very elegant thing.

00:47:25.529 --> 00:47:27.320
And then I think this
is my final example--

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.750
I'll start winding up--

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:32.890
from Scott Waddell's
lab, that another feature

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:35.170
of this sweet thing is
if the fly's not hungry,

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:37.510
not surprisingly, it
doesn't care anymore.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:42.070
So it's associated odor A with
sweet, but now it's well-fed,

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.480
so who cares.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.250
And that's a real effect.

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:50.470
So a fed fly will not
express this odor preference.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:53.320
But it still has the memory,
because if you then starve it,

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.362
now it will go to odor A.

00:47:56.362 --> 00:48:01.090
OK, So what Scott Waddell
and his group realized

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:04.690
was that this was activated
through this dopamine neuron.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:08.519
Now, this was done before all
this circuitry was derived.

00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:10.810
But they figured it out that
it's this dopamine neuron,

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:13.090
because they could activate
this dopamine neuron

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:18.070
and simulate the fed state, so
the fly would ignore the odor.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.320
Or they could silence
this dopamine neuron

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.340
and then they would
simulate the hungry state

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.670
and the fly would be
attracted to the odor.

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.330
But now, you notice
this circuitry,

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:30.370
this is a GABAergic
neuron that inhibits

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.590
the alpha beta lobe output.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.960
So this is a perfect
pathway by which

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.430
you could turn off the learned
response in this during the fed

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:40.270
state.

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:42.880
And then you inactivate
this pathway,

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.960
and now you turn it on.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.330
So again, an internal
state gating a memory.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:48.400
But it's a case--

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.820
we don't really know that
everything I'm saying is true.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.730
One should never assume that.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:58.560
But we now have this pathway.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.850
People-- we, I say, but people,
we can block this pathway.

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:06.400
There's enough known about the
circuitry to really work out

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.280
that what I said is
true, that you can

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.650
start to get at these things.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:14.430
So one-- yeah, I got a
minute to do CO2 avoidance.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.620
CO2 avoidance is
a really cool one.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:22.475
So CO2 is innately
repulsive to a fly.

00:49:22.475 --> 00:49:23.820
It doesn't like CO2.

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.470
And the reason that
is is in a group

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.920
of flies that are stressed,
they release a lot of CO2.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.580
So a fly will sense CO2, know
there's trouble in the area,

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.840
and will avoid it.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.040
So there's a natural avoidance
through the innate pathway

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.120
to CO2.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.360
Now, that's kind of a fatal
flaw in the design of the fly,

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:47.280
because flies eat rotting fruit
that releases tons of CO2.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.190
So you don't want to
avoid your food source.

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:53.340
So what happens-- it's
not completely understood.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:58.920
But somehow, the innate system
trains this beta 2 pathway

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:02.550
to have, in addition to the
innate pathway, a learned

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.240
pathway for CO2 avoidance.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.625
And in the hungry state,
the fly channels its CO2--

00:50:08.625 --> 00:50:10.320
it still has CO2 avoidance.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.040
It channels it
through this pathway.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.150
Then if, at the same time,
there are fruit odors or fruit

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:21.120
tastes, it can
modulate this pathway,

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.690
shut it down, and
turn the CO2 avoidance

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.820
into a CO2 attraction.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.820
So again, you start to
see the neural substrates

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:33.390
of these really quite complex
behaviors sitting right

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:36.270
before you in this structure.

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:40.070
All right, I'll
end here with sort

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.200
of the lesson for
the machine learners.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.980
So from a machine
learning perspective,

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.260
this is a simple system.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.310
It's not very deep.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:50.430
It's a little bit deep,
but not very deep.

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:54.210
It contains a random
hidden representation.

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:57.300
That's not really
anything radical.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.940
It contains a set
of output neurons.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.290
It's actually a layered output.

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.870
Again, nothing very radical.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.255
In neuroscience term,
it's kind of interesting

00:51:06.255 --> 00:51:09.570
that it goes from these highly
stereotyped to random to highly

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:11.190
stereotyped.

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:14.250
But really, the
lesson here is this

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.850
is a mediocre machine
learning architecture.

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:20.250
Not very many
units and all that.

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:22.180
Where does this
thing make up for it?

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.510
It makes up for it
in a stupendous,

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:29.490
complicated modulation and
plasticity beyond any machine

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.260
learner's dreams.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.610
We don't know about this.

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:35.310
I tried to give you hints of
the different things it can do.

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:36.780
Dopamine can gate.

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.460
It can induce
short-term learning.

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.290
It can induce
long-term learning.

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:44.620
It can induce gating of
gating, gating of learning.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.040
That's what has to be
worked out in this system.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.210
But there's going to be a really
beautiful effect of dopamine

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:54.390
acting in many ways
on many time scales.

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:57.360
And to me, in this
system, that's

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.120
where evolution has put
its money, right there.

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:04.560
Not in building 20 layers
here or something like that.

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.050
Not in worrying about a
whole lot of back prop.

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:08.160
This is random.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.250
It doesn't appear
to be back propped.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:17.670
But in putting huge resources
into a rich set of modulatory

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:21.390
and plastic processes at
these output synapses.

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:24.390
And I think in the years to
come, they will be worked out.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:26.880
And maybe they'll
have implications

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.470
for machine learning once
we know what they are.
