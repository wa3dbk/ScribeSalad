JESSICA SOMMERVILLE:
So this morning

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.930
we heard Laura give a
really beautiful overview

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.747
of her research program,
and my talk today

00:00:26.747 --> 00:00:28.330
is going to be a
little bit different.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.700
I'm going to talk
about some things that

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.399
are going to be
highly related to what

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.940
Laura was talking
about, particularly

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.320
at the end of her talk.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.350
But because this is like brand
new hot off the press work,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.860
some of it's actually ongoing as
you'll see as the talk unfolds.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.650
I'm going to be focusing on a
more kind of specific detail

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.150
level.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.108
So I may tell you about
four different studies,

00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:48.779
three of which are completed,
one of which is ongoing.

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:50.820
And they all have to do
with infants' sensitivity

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270
to costs and benefits.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.190
OK.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.332
So, as we all know,
cost benefit analyses

00:00:56.332 --> 00:00:57.790
are really central
to the decisions

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.105
we make at both a conscious
and an unconscious level.

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:02.230
And, of course, there's
all kinds of different ways

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.861
that we make decisions, right?

00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:05.319
But one of the
things that we often

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.000
do when we're
making a decision is

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.660
we think about what rewards do
we anticipate from following

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.594
a particular course
of action, and how

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:14.260
do those compare to
the costs that we'll

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.900
incur from performing
that same action.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.580
And we will act
in a sense to try

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.179
to maximize the value that we
get out of a particular choice.

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.220
That's true of simple
decisions like this, right?

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.553
This woman deciding what she's
going to eat for dessert.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.180
And we can also
apply these analyses

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.950
to more complex
decisions, like things

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.449
like where we're going to go
to college, what kind of career

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:34.750
are we going to pursue,
where are we going to live.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.339
OK.

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:37.630
One of the things that we
heard from Laura this morning

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.721
is that cost benefit
analyses don't just

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.970
apply to her own behavior
and her own decision making.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.720
She showed some
really neat evidence

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.150
that these types
of analyses form

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.970
the basis for the inferences
that we make about other people

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.010
and that we make
about their behavior.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.140
So that raises the very
interesting question

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.605
of the developmental origins
of these types analyses.

00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:56.980
And that's what
I'm going to talk

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.355
about today,
infants' sensitivity

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:00.872
to costs and benefits.

00:02:00.872 --> 00:02:03.080
My talk is going to kind of
have two different parts.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.496
In the first part,
I'm going to be

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:05.950
talking about
cases where infants

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.720
are observing other people.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.120
And what the question
that I'm asking there is

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.210
do infants-- are they able to
register the costs that are

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.425
behind other people's actions?

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:17.050
And then in the second
part of my talk,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.250
I'm actually going
to switch gears,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.440
and I'm going to talk
about infants' registration

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.579
and minimization of costs,
the registration of benefits,

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.870
to guide their own behavior,
their own decision making.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.872
I'm going to talk about
a particular test case.

00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:30.205
And that's the test case of
infants' prosocial behavior.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.180
OK.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.860
And I want to be kind
of specific here.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.450
So across all of
these studies, I'm

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.250
talking about cost in
one particular way.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.750
Of course, there's
all kinds of ways

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.640
you could operationalize cost.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.470
But what we've been
focusing on so far

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.540
is physical effort,
the physical effort

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.880
behind an action as a cost.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.662
Why would we start here?

00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:52.620
Well, there's several
different reasons, right?

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.090
And the basic kind of
evolutionary level, it's

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.910
really important
that we can register

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.070
and that we can minimize
energetic costs,

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.150
effortful costs, right?

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.830
Our very survival
depends on that.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.050
We have to metabolically
and energetically budget,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.044
or we won't stick around, right?

00:03:07.044 --> 00:03:08.710
So that gives us good
reason that that's

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.860
a good starting place in terms
of looking at young infants'

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.390
ability to register costs and
minimize cost potentially.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.240
Another reason is that
for decades, scholars

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.970
have really given a central role
to effort in decision-making.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.490
And this dates
back to the 1940s,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.170
the whole in Solomon
who postulated

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.580
the law of least effort.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.406
So the idea here is that if
there are two lines of actions

00:03:30.406 --> 00:03:31.780
that lead to equal
rewards, we're

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.863
going to take the path of
least resistance, right?

00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:36.250
We're going to seek
to minimize effort.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.530
And then, finally, in
more contemporary work

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.570
that's looked at
cost-benefit decision-making,

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.120
both in adults and in nonhuman
animals, a lot of this work

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.530
comes from the
neuroimaging literature.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.125
Effort has been a fairly
heavily studied cost.

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:50.500
So this is a good
starting place,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.583
because we have a pretty
good understanding of how

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:55.030
effort and various benefits
or reward are integrated

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.010
at both the neural and
a behavioral level,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.930
at least for nonhuman
animals and for human adults.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.740
OK.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.690
So the first
question we might ask

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.820
is, what is the
existing evidence

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.710
in terms of the question
of whether infants

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.909
have a basic ability to
register cost behind actions.

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.450
And there's really
two different ways

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.620
we could pose this question.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.899
We can think about the
question with respect

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.390
to infants own behavior,
their own actions.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.260
Is there evidence that infants
will act to recognize costs

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.890
and to minimize costs
in their own behavior.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.640
The other way that we
can ask the question

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.980
is in terms of infants
observation of other people's

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.480
behavior.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.972
Do they recognize the cost
behind other people's actions.

00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:36.430
You know, surprisingly
there really

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.290
hasn't been a lot of work
that's looked directly

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.000
at this when we're
talking about infants

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.620
own behavior, their
own decision making.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.970
There is some work from the
weight perception literature

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.660
that's looked at
how infants interact

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.049
with blocks of different ways.

00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:49.840
And so what people will
do in these studies

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.215
is they'll present little
babies, nine-month-old infants,

00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:55.030
with two blocks that
look virtually identical.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.560
They only differ
from one another

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.665
in terms of their
respective weights.

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:00.040
And what these
studies have shown

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.260
is if you give infants a choice
between these two objects,

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.330
they'll systematically
prefer the light object

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.897
over the heavy object.

00:05:05.897 --> 00:05:08.230
So one way to think about
these findings is what infants

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.840
are doing here is exactly
what we're interested

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.850
in, they're minimizing
the physical cost, right?

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.756
They're taking the past of--
the path of least effort.

00:05:15.756 --> 00:05:17.380
One challenge, though,
for interpreting

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.630
these finding is oftentimes
in these studies,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.130
the heavy blocks
that are being used

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.370
are beyond infants
lifting capacity.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.870
So what that means is it's hard
to know if these results are

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.874
about infants
registering cost per se,

00:05:27.874 --> 00:05:29.290
or if what we're
really getting at

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.500
is just infants repeating a
sort of successful interaction

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.960
with an object that they've
acted on previously.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.460
OK.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.680
So Laura talked a little bit
about this in her talk today.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.680
What about the evidence
of registration of costs

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.971
and other people's actions.

00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:43.720
And one of the things
that Laura mentioned

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.030
that we know from many,
many different studies,

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.370
is that infants appear
to expect efficiency

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.870
in other people's actions.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.490
Laura showed you
one example of that.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.760
I'll show you a
different example

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.510
of that, which comes
from actually a study

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.709
that Liz did with one of
her graduate students.

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:58.250
So here we see
someone who's reaching

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.080
over a barrier in
order to get an object.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.670
The barrier is then removed.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.870
Infants have the
expectation that that person

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.620
is going to reach
directly for the object,

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.640
right, rather than performing
that funny arcing motion.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.730
So, again, one way to
think about these findings

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.260
is that what
infants are doing is

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.060
they're expecting that the
person is going to take

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.380
the least costly action, right?

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.510
And, in fact, there's
all kinds of costs

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.430
to this particular
arcing motion, right?

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.950
It's indirect, it
probably takes longer,

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.396
it's probably more difficult,
it's more effortful.

00:06:26.396 --> 00:06:28.145
And so we wanted to
ask the question, too,

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:31.550
to begin with if infants
were able to register costs.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.320
But unlike in this
situation where

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.740
there's multiple
potentially redundant cues

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.630
that this arching motion
is a costly behavior,

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.310
we wanted to really
kind of focus

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.830
in on situations in
which there aren't

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.980
a lot of overt observable
cues to the costs underlying

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.980
another person's action.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.680
So the way that we did
this is we showed infants

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.820
different actions that look
similar on their surface level,

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.299
but these actions
differ in terms

00:06:58.299 --> 00:07:00.840
of the degree of physical effort
that are required to perform

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.490
them, and the way
that we achieve

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.464
that is by having infants
watch people lift objects

00:07:05.464 --> 00:07:06.630
of different weights, right?

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.180
So, obviously, heavy weighted
objects are harder to lift.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.830
They're more effortly costly
than lifting a light object.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.070
And what we wanted to
know is can infants

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.400
recognize under conditions
where they have really minimal,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.280
observable cues, no cues
about, for example, straining

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.810
or sweating or
things like that that

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.480
might be really obvious for
figuring out the effort.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.109
Will they be able to understand
that when someone is lifting

00:07:30.109 --> 00:07:32.400
a heavy block, that's a more
effortful action than when

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.460
they're lifting a light block.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.390
In addition to that kind
of primary question,

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.990
we were also interested in
whether this ability in infants

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.074
might be individually variable.

00:07:42.074 --> 00:07:43.740
So this might come
as a surprise to you,

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.755
but infants, like adults,
are individually variable.

00:07:46.755 --> 00:07:48.630
And they're individually
variable, of course,

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.380
in many ways.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.450
But one way in which they
vary from one another

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.199
is in terms of how
strong they are, right?

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.880
Just like human adults, right?

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.900
We're variable in terms
of how strong we are.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.240
And we have an
idea, or hypothesis,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.820
that infants individual
differences in strength

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.029
might actually be
important for registering

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:07.320
the effort-related costs
behind these different lifting

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.502
actions with different
weighted objects.

00:08:09.502 --> 00:08:11.460
One of the reasons that
they might be important

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.580
is because of core strength
gates the type of experience

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.250
that infants are going to have
in their everyday life, right?

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.860
If you're a strong baby,
you can lift heavier objects

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.820
than a weak baby.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.030
You can also lift a wider
contrast of range of objects,

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:24.750
right?

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.370
So we thought maybe
there's something

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.100
about individual differences
in strength, particularly,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.930
for babies who are
stronger where they'll

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.960
be better at recognizing
the differential effort that

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.610
goes along with
lifting actions when

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.980
you're talking about
blocks of different weight.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.480
OK.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.010
So let me tell you
about the study

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.559
that we conducted to
ask this question.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.570
We tested 12-month-old
infants in this study.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.880
They took part in a
turn taking procedure

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.920
where we recorded EEG,
electrical activity

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.580
from the brain as it
propagates the scalp.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.050
And in the course of this
task, what they did is

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.470
they took part in
different types of trials.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.720
On observation trials, they
would watch an experimenter who

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.720
would lift these different
objects or these blocks,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.030
and these blocks looked
perceptually identical

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.240
in terms of size and shape.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.300
They were different colors so
infants could individuate them

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.090
and keep track of them, but
what varied from trial to trial

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.980
was exactly how much
the objects weighed.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.700
So they range from being the
weight of a typical bath toy

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.500
to being quite heavy.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.689
So infants can lift
the heaviest blocks,

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:23.730
but they're pretty effortful
in order for infants

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.200
to be able to lift them.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.810
In the trials where they watched
an experiment or interact

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.268
with these blocks,
the experimenter

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:31.740
would do things like put
the block up on a platform,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.370
drop it into a bucket after full
type of actions where you can

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.920
sort of register at
least in principle

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.930
the type of effort
behind the action,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.430
and then infants would also
have the opportunity to act.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.340
They could perform the
same actions with objects.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.250
Infants also for
measurement purpose

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.470
received baseline
trials where we're just

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.620
registering EEG in
response to abstract images

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.970
like a checkerboard
pattern, for example.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:55.470
OK.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.880
So what are we
interested in here?

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.490
So, in this particular
study, we were

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.740
looking at the suppression
of a particular oscillatory

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.110
frequency called
sensorimotor alpha,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.930
or some people call
it mu attenuation.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.050
So we know that at rest,
neurons in sensorimotor

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.440
cortex fire spontaneously
and they fire in synchrony.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.980
And what that means is we
get these large amplitude EEG

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.670
oscillations in the
alpha frequency band.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.190
When the motor cortex is
activated in remote motor

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.390
cortex is activated, and
that happens, of course,

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:25.980
when we act.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.040
It also happens when we
watch other people act.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.620
What you see is you see a
suppression in sensorimotor

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.720
alpha.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.730
So many people recently
have been interested

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.250
in suppression of sensorimotor
alpha new attenuation

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.130
from the perspective of looking
at the mirror neuron system.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.910
More broadly and
for our purposes,

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.670
we're really just
thinking about this

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.520
as a measure of sensorimotor
cortex activation.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.580
So greater suppression equals
more sensorimotor cortex

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.920
activation.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.250
And our question here was
whether infants activation

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.200
sensorimotor cortex
wouldn't vary

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.390
as a function of
watching people lift

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.560
blocks of different weights.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.140
Would you get greater
activation when people

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.270
were lifting heavier objects?

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.694
Which would, of
course, be a sign

00:11:07.694 --> 00:11:10.110
that infants were distinguishing
between different actions

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.651
on the basis of effort.

00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:13.150
OK.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.820
So in addition to
looking at that,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.040
we also gave infants a
group strength assessment.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.540
OK.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.220
So let me tell you a little
bit about the grip strength

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.594
measure, only because it took
us several years to come up

00:11:22.594 --> 00:11:25.800
with this so I feel like I need
to talk about it a little bit.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.230
So we wanted to measure
infant strength, and the way

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.150
that we did that is by measuring
infants' grip strength.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.410
But, of course,
the challenge here,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:32.610
if you're an adult,
right, and you

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.200
want to measure an
adult's grip strength,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.120
you just get something
called the dynamometer,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.400
you have an adult squeeze a
bulb or squeeze the hand grip

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.560
and then you get this nice
force reading from that, right?

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.040
And that all works very smoothly
with adults but, of course, you

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.040
can't just hand
that to an infant

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.539
and say, squeeze
as hard as you can,

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:47.220
that doesn't work, obviously.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.930
So what we did here is we had
an experimenter who had a toy,

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.580
the infant had the same toy.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.340
The experimenter would squeeze
her toy, and what we hoped

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.710
is that this would motivate
infants, or lead infants,

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.420
to squeeze their toy.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.540
Their toy, in contrast to
the experimenter's toy,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.830
had both a hidden sensor
embedded within the toy, which

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.080
led to playing Old
McDonald, which, of course,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.530
infants greatly like, right?

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.200
They find that very enjoyable.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.420
And it also had a hidden
pressure sensor within it.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.720
So we were able to
get-- or to measure how

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.584
hard infants squeezed the toy.

00:12:18.584 --> 00:12:20.500
Now, the trick here was
we want to get infants

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.541
strongest squeeze, right?

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:23.440
So what we did is we
set up our device so

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.690
that each time the
infant squeezes it,

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.300
they have to squeeze harder
to get Old McDonald to play.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.670
And, of course, they want
Old McDonald to play, right?

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.630
So they're motivated
to keep doing that.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.930
So that's how we record
infants' maximum grip strength.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.420
We like essentially keep
going as long as infants will

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.656
allow us to do that, basically.

00:12:39.656 --> 00:12:41.530
There are some other
things that we measured.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.030
We measured infants weight.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.946
Our motivation for doing this
is that an adults' strength

00:12:45.946 --> 00:12:47.320
and weight are
highly correlated.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.695
They were in our sample so
that kind of helps to validate

00:12:49.695 --> 00:12:51.130
or grip strength paradigm.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.860
And there were things like
general motor maturity that we

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.170
measured, gross motor skills.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.324
We measured how frequently
infants lift blocks

00:12:58.324 --> 00:13:00.490
within the task, because
we want a control for these

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.210
in our analyses.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.626
We're wanting to
look specifically

00:13:02.626 --> 00:13:04.910
at the effective grip strength.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.140
OK.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:06.640
OK.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.127
So let me tell you a bit-- the
first thing that we looked at.

00:13:10.127 --> 00:13:12.210
So I'm going to show you
a series of scatter plots

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.830
that look at the relation
between sensorimotor alpha

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.620
suppression, and
infant's grip strength.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.750
And these are
plotted as a function

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.460
of the weight of the block.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.847
And these are when infants
are observing other people.

00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:27.180
So the thing to know is we're
talking about suppression,

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.763
so you're looking
for negative scores.

00:13:28.763 --> 00:13:31.450
More negative scores
mean more suppression.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.130
And we had a
particular hypothesis

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.920
about how this would go, or
idea about how this would go.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.070
We thought that when the
blocks were relatively light,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.630
grip strength would be
less of a good predictor

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.600
of sensorimotor
alpha suppression.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.310
And the reason for
thinking that is

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.100
that whether an infant is
relatively strong or relatively

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.770
weak, they all probably have
lifetime experience lifting

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.700
relatively light objects.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.800
However, where strength
really comes into play

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.160
is as objects get
heavier, right?

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.410
So stronger infants,
very likely,

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.640
have a greater lifetime history
of lifting heavier objects.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.470
So our prediction was
that these two things

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.100
would be increasingly tightly
integrated as block weight goes

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.130
up.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.460
And, in fact, that's
exactly what we found.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.340
So there's weak relations
when the block is light,

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.110
when it's that heavy block--

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.420
we call them the heavy and
the super heavy block--

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.590
there's a tighter relation.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.750
And you see the
strongest relation here

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.510
when the block is
extremely heavy.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.030
And these analyses
control for things

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.610
like infants in task lifting
experience, their weight,

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.842
their motor development scores.

00:14:32.842 --> 00:14:34.300
So the next thing
we wanted to know

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.716
is we wanted to
know whether there

00:14:35.716 --> 00:14:38.110
was any evidence that
suppression of sensorimotor

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.060
alpha would be greater in cases
in which the block is heaviest

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.710
versus the block is lightest.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.965
So this is really our
index, or our measure,

00:14:46.965 --> 00:14:49.090
of whether infants are
differentiating when they're

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.000
watching other people act
on objects, whether they're

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.150
differentiating the degree
of effort that goes along

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.580
with lifting the object as
a function of block weight.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.538
So what I'm going to show
you is change scores.

00:14:59.538 --> 00:15:01.300
So more negative
means that you're

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.200
seeing increasing sensorimotor
alpha suppression for heavy

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.700
versus light blocks,
and these are

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.449
plotted as a function of
infants' grip strength.

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:11.740
So what you can see here is
that for the weaker babies,

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.781
the lower grip strength
babies, you're not really

00:15:13.781 --> 00:15:16.060
seeing any systematic
change from the latest

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.475
block to the heaviest block.

00:15:17.475 --> 00:15:19.840
But you are for the
stronger infants.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.510
So what these findings suggest
to us is that the stronger

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.912
infants appear to be
differentiating these actions

00:15:24.912 --> 00:15:27.370
on the basis of the weight of
the object that the person is

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.950
lifting, the weaker
infants aren't.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:31.450
OK.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.489
So what do we know
from this data.

00:15:33.489 --> 00:15:35.280
Well, we have some
evidence that activation

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.750
of sensorimotor cortex
as indexed by suppression

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.330
of sensorimotor alpha,
while babies are watching

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.306
other people lift blocks
of different weights,

00:15:42.306 --> 00:15:44.680
varies as the function of the
weight of the block, right?

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.360
So this might
signal that infants

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.330
are able to recognize that
different actions have

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.860
different degrees of physical
effort that go along with them.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.440
And we also see that the
ability to make this distinction

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.800
is tied to infants own strength,
their own grip strength.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.450
And our interpretation
of this is

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.420
that this might have to
do with strength being

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.310
a rate limiter,
or a facilitator,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.890
or the type of experience
that infants previously

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.454
have with objects of
different weights.

00:16:11.454 --> 00:16:13.120
And, in particular,
the stronger infants

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.580
might have more experience
with lifting heavier objects.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.040
They might have more
contrastive experience, which

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.494
allows them to better recognize,
or better differentiate,

00:16:20.494 --> 00:16:21.910
the degree of
physical effort that

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.680
go along with
different actions when

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.540
you're talking about lifting
objects of different weight.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.450
OK.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.130
So that's part one.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.980
So I think what these data tell
us is that in this context,

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.660
infants have a
means of registering

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.680
effort related costs.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.290
I think where they go above
past data is that they tell us

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.410
that infants can do this
under conditions in which they

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.720
have minimal behavioral cues.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.720
So we think back to that
reaching action, right?

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.550
There's all kinds of cues that
this is a costly action, right?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.230
There's all kinds of ways that
it differs from a direct reach.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.020
In this situation, we're
talking about actions

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.230
that are really minimally
different from one another.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.570
What I want to do now is I
want to switch gears and talk

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.850
about kind of the
flip side of the coin.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.099
And that is infants use
of costs and benefits,

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.780
or reward, to guide
their own behavior.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.550
And I'm going to be
specifically focusing

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.919
on the test case of
infants prosocial behavior.

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:13.460
So many of you may
know this already,

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.560
but infants are highly
prosocial, right?

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.528
There's been a lot of
studies on this recently,

00:17:17.528 --> 00:17:19.069
and all of these
studies have kind of

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.780
come down on the
conclusion that starting

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.238
in the second year
of life, infants

00:17:22.238 --> 00:17:24.920
will do things like help
people achieve their goals,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.099
they will share toys or
objects with other people,

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.960
they're comfort
people in distress.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.820
But there are
questions and debates

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.370
that are hotly contested about
early prosocial development,

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.760
and I just want to bring two
of them to your attention.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.650
OK.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.560
So one question is, when
does infants or children's

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.880
prosocial behavior become
selective or strategic, right?

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.710
So we know that
by preschool age,

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.110
early school age, children's
prosocial behavior

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.841
is somewhat selective,
meaning that there

00:17:52.841 --> 00:17:54.590
are some people, for
example, that infants

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.190
are more likely to help
than others, right?

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.990
And children are-- not
infants, children-- children

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.570
are more likely to
help under situations

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.080
where they are perhaps
reputational concerns involved.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.510
But what we don't yet
know is whether this

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.922
is true of very early
prosocial development.

00:18:10.922 --> 00:18:12.630
So what is the
developmental course like?

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.710
Do kids start off being
selective and strategic?

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.080
Or do they only get there
over time with development?

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.539
That's one question.

00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:21.080
There's another
related question that

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.420
has to do with what is
the underlying motivation

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.000
for prosocial behavior, right?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.890
So the kind of
generous interpretation

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.640
of infants prosocial is actions,
children's prosocial action,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.086
is what is going on here
is infants are motivated

00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:35.210
by empathic concern, right?

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.751
They care about
other people's needs,

00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:38.690
they care about other
people's desires.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.250
And in these
experimental context,

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.830
what they're doing is they're
acting to meet another person's

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.260
needs, they're acting
out of empathic concern.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.780
But there's also other reasons
why infants, or anyone,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.750
for that matter, might
behave prosocially,

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.520
that might have to do
with social affiliation

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.880
biases, social motivation,
that might have

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.400
to do with wanting to see
a goal being completed,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.490
et cetera, right?

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.680
So one of the ways that we
can start to get traction

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.070
on these issues is by looking
at the impact of various costs

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.390
on infants' prosocial behavior.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.060
And somewhat surprisingly, this
is not a terribly well studied

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.870
topic as of yet.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.089
So there are some studies
that are both with infants

00:19:15.089 --> 00:19:16.880
and with children,
where people have looked

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.250
at the impact of personal
cost on prosocial behavior

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.670
and, usually, the way personal
costs are operationalized

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.599
is in terms of,
let's say, an infant

00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:27.140
is tested in a paradigm where
they need to help someone else,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.869
or share an object
with someone else.

00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:30.410
And they might be
required to give up

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.000
their own object versus an
object that's just sitting

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
there in the lab, right?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.900
Presumably, their own object
has higher personal cost.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.300
Now, we don't really know
when personal costs start

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.920
to impact infants'
prosocial behavior,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.900
because there's been a
lot of mixed evidence.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.270
And, particularly, in
infancy, there's, as of yet,

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.490
no systematic evidence that high
personal costs actually reduce

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.174
infants' prosocial responding.

00:19:53.174 --> 00:19:55.340
What about the question of
energetic physical effort

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.510
related costs?

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.890
Well, again, here, this is
really an understudy topic.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.350
So there's one
existing study that

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.030
has looked at infants
helping under kind

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.279
of minimal physical effort cost.

00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:07.820
And it's a little bit hard to
know what to make of that study

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.740
because we know that
infants helping behavior

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.679
is still present under
those conditions,

00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:13.970
we just don't really know
how it compares to conditions

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.770
where the physical
costs are low.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:18.560
OK.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.410
So we started off by asking a
really super simple question

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.180
about infants
prosocial behavior,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.480
and that was whether the
anticipated physical effort

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.850
that goes along with
prosocial responding

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.160
influences infants
prosocial responding.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.710
In particular, when the effort
is high, does it increase,

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.070
or rather, decrease
infants prosociality.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.210
OK.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.396
So we tested 18-month-old
infants in this study.

00:20:42.396 --> 00:20:44.520
Start by telling you about
the critical test phase,

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.900
it was a helping task.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.307
An experimenter was on the
opposite side of the room.

00:20:48.307 --> 00:20:49.890
She needs a block
in order to complete

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.140
a tower that she's building.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.981
What happens before
that is all infants

00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:55.230
take part in a training phase.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.813
They're faced with
these vinyl blocks.

00:20:56.813 --> 00:20:58.560
You'll see a video
clip in a moment.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.000
And these vinyl clocks have--

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.072
blocks have been rigged by us
so that they range in weight.

00:21:03.072 --> 00:21:05.030
There's five of them,
they're different colors,

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.569
so infants can
keep track of them.

00:21:06.569 --> 00:21:08.610
During training, what
happens is the experimenter

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.320
plays a game with
an infant where

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.860
they get them to drop
each block into a bucket.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.590
Babies like to do that, it
makes a cool noise, right?

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.090
And, really, this training
phase serves two purposes.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.580
The first purpose
that it serves is

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.460
we want infants to learn
how much each block weighs.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.960
The second purpose
that it serves

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.000
is we want to be
able to record what

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
is the heaviest block that
infants are capable of lifting.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.350
All right.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.850
In the test phase,
as I told you,

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.680
the experimenter's on the
opposite side of the room,

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.120
she's building a
block tower, she

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.072
needs a block to complete it.

00:21:38.072 --> 00:21:40.530
There's a single target block
available to infants and what

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.510
varies between
our two conditions

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.920
is the weight of that block.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.590
So for half of the babies, the
lightest block of the training

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.169
blocks is left behind.

00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:49.710
And for the other
half of the babies,

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.080
the heaviest block that
infants are capable of lifting

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.400
has been left behind.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.226
So we're contrasting
effort here in terms

00:21:55.226 --> 00:21:56.850
of the weight of the
block that infants

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:01.960
have to carry across the room
to help the experimenter.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.050
So we're looking at
infants block retrievals.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.570
The other thing that we
recorded was a parent report

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.900
of infants walking experience.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.800
So these are 18-month-old
infants, they can all walk.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.990
On average, they've been
walking for six months

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.970
so they're all
experienced walkers.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.470
But there's
individual variability

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.290
in terms of how long
they've been walking for.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.470
So why was this important?

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.750
Well, here was our
underlying logic.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.833
Imagine that you and a
friend are going on a hike,

00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:26.550
you're both equally strong,
you can both lift 60 pounds.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.260
But your friend
is an expert hiker

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.972
and you're a novice
hiker, right?

00:22:29.972 --> 00:22:32.430
And you both have to carry a
60 pound backpack up the hill.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.244
Well, despite the fact that you
might both be equally strong,

00:22:35.244 --> 00:22:36.660
if you're the
novice hiker, that's

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.451
probably going to be
more effortful for you

00:22:38.451 --> 00:22:40.830
to get that backpack up the
hill than it is going to be

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.850
for your friend or your buddy.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.700
So we had a
particular prediction

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.060
that what we would see is a
relationship between parent

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.120
reporter walking experience,
and infants likelihood do this--

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.160
likelihood to help the
experimenter by carrying

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.040
the block across the room, and
that this would be selective,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.780
or at least stronger, for
the high effort condition.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.070
OK.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.140
So let me show you a
couple little video clips

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.064
here so you can get a
flavor of the procedure.

00:23:07.064 --> 00:23:08.730
This is just showing
you the test phase,

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.919
so it's exerted
from the test phase.

00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:12.960
There's one thing I want
to explain a little bit.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.765
So you can see up here there's
this striped bucket here.

00:23:17.765 --> 00:23:19.140
And the reason
that we have there

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.514
is-- that there is because we
want the experimenter to be

00:23:21.514 --> 00:23:23.670
unaware of the target
block that is left behind,

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.860
so they're naive to
the infant's condition.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.780
It looks like from the infants'
perspective that they can see

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.180
the target block, but
they actually can't.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.420
They don't know if they're
in the high or low effort

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.260
condition.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.440
So this is the baby who is
tested in the low effort

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.952
condition.

00:23:36.952 --> 00:23:37.618
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:37.618 --> 00:23:40.500
I'm going to use these
blocks to make a tower.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.010
These blocks can go here.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.976
This one can go here.

00:23:47.976 --> 00:23:50.560
And this block can go--

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.140
oh, no.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:58.010
Oh, no, I'm missing the block
I need to finish my tower.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.994
I'm missing my block.

00:23:59.994 --> 00:24:02.994
Ah, oh, there it
is, Joelle look.

00:24:02.994 --> 00:24:06.140
The block got moved
on your blanket.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.048
Can you bring me the blocks
so I can finish my tower?

00:24:14.327 --> 00:24:14.910
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:15.459
All right.

00:24:15.459 --> 00:24:17.000
Sorry, we exerted
a little bit early.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.666
He goes over and he
gives her the block.

00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:19.410
OK.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:19.910
OK.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.890
Now let's watch a baby in
the high effort condition.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.840
Remember, the only difference
between these two conditions

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.210
is the weight of the block
that's been left behind.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.412
OK.

00:24:27.412 --> 00:24:28.344
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:28.344 --> 00:24:32.275
I'm going to use these blocks
to make a tower These blocks can

00:24:32.275 --> 00:24:34.430
go here.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.150
This one can go here.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.548
And this one can go--

00:24:39.548 --> 00:24:41.908
oh, no.

00:24:41.908 --> 00:24:46.462
Oh, no, I'm missing the block
I need to finish my tower.

00:24:46.462 --> 00:24:48.872
I'm missing my block.

00:24:48.872 --> 00:24:50.318
Ah, oh.

00:24:50.318 --> 00:24:51.764
There it is, Rose.

00:24:51.764 --> 00:24:54.360
The block got left
on your blanket.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.140
Can you bring me the block
so I can finish my tower?

00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:07.035
[LAUGHTER] Can you
bring me the block?

00:25:11.936 --> 00:25:16.972
Rose, can you bring me the
block so I can finish my tower?

00:25:16.972 --> 00:25:17.472
No.

00:25:24.307 --> 00:25:24.890
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.430
So it's a little hard to
hear what she was saying,

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.700
but if you couldn't hear it,
she was saying, no, thank you.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.240
So she said, no.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:29.770
No, thank you.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:30.353
No, thank you.

00:25:30.353 --> 00:25:31.760
OK.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.470
So that's a-- pretty
illustrative of the procedure.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.970
OK.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:35.890
So what did we find?

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.161
So here's infants' rates of
helping in the low effort

00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:38.660
condition.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.880
In the high effort
condition what you can see.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.440
So infants help
much more frequently

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.055
in the low effort condition
than in a high effort condition.

00:25:45.055 --> 00:25:46.430
Here's what we
found with respect

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:47.900
to infants' walking experience.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.930
A walking experience, how long
an infant has been walking

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.390
predicts infants' likelihood
of helping in the high effort

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.470
condition.

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.115
And what this tells us
is that for each month

00:25:57.115 --> 00:25:58.490
of additional
walking experience,

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.950
infants are twice
as likely to help.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.170
Now, what we can see
here is that infants

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.690
are less likely to help under
high effort conditions, right?

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.910
So infants prosocial
behavior is influenced

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.100
by the effort related costs
of prosocial responding.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.430
And a critic, I
guess, could say,

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.820
well, maybe it's that--
it's not that infants

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.920
are going by the
effort, it's maybe

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.600
that they're not able to help
in the high effort condition.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.990
We don't think that that's
the case, because infants have

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.960
given us evidence that they're
capable of lifting that block,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.480
right?

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.854
That they're later-- later
tested with in the high effort

00:26:29.854 --> 00:26:30.395
condition.

00:26:30.395 --> 00:26:31.895
But the next condition
I'll show you

00:26:31.895 --> 00:26:35.250
will also kind of speak to that.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.550
And the important--
another important thing

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.150
to recognize here
is that infants

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.280
seem to be recognizing these
costs at an objective level.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.500
I think Laura called
this in her talk an agent

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.700
independent level, right?

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.280
As a function of the
circumstances of the situation,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.240
right?

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.520
And they're also
recognizing costs

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.200
that at a more
subjective level in terms

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.000
of their own
capabilities and how that

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.440
influences the particular cost.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.690
In this case, it's their
amount of walking experience,

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.450
how expert a walker they are.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.850
OK.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.040
So what we wanted to
do next is to find out

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.230
whether if when
infants are presented

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.277
with these high effortful
helping situations,

00:27:11.277 --> 00:27:12.860
whether infants
helping behavior would

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.160
vary as a function of
the motivational benefits

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.900
of prosocial responding.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.930
Now, it's been pretty
firmly established

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.180
that early prosocial
responding appears to be

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.750
immune to extrinsic rewards.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.270
So what that means
is if you test

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.936
a baby in one of these
helping paradigms

00:27:27.936 --> 00:27:29.889
and you say, good job,
way to go, good job.

00:27:29.889 --> 00:27:31.430
That's actually not
going to increase

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.846
their subsequent
helping behavior.

00:27:32.846 --> 00:27:35.701
If anything, it
will decrease it.

00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:38.360
But that doesn't mean that
more intrinsic rewards

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.860
don't influence
how infants perform

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.943
on these particular tasks.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.820
We know from some prior work
that infants by this age

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.250
have certain affiliated
biases, right?

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:51.200
They have biases
for individuals who

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.300
share their preferences,
who share the--

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.290
who like the same things
that the infant likes.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.140
They prefer to play
with those people who--

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.690
than people who don't like
the same thing that they like.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.110
And they also have-- possess
affiliated biases for people

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.860
who could be--

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.716
said to share sort of in-group
member characteristics, right?

00:28:06.716 --> 00:28:08.090
So infants, like
people who speak

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.464
in native-- their
native language

00:28:09.464 --> 00:28:12.200
over a nonnative
language speaker.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.970
And, of course, these
affiliated biases

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.250
might have important
functional consequences, right?

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.070
They might be important
for cultural learning.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.380
So what we wanted to
know in this next study

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.800
is whether we could kind of push
around these intrinsic benefits

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.870
for infants to see if
their behavior would

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.599
change under these high
effort helping conditions.

00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:35.640
The way that we did this
in this particular study

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.530
is prior to the test
procedure, the helping task,

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.750
we had infants take
part in this little task

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.070
where they were given one--

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.580
two toys.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.840
They could choose
between the two toys.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.190
This happened on three
different trials,

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.394
different toys each trial.

00:28:48.394 --> 00:28:49.560
Infants would make a choice.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.010
And then the experimenter
would subsequently

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.010
show that she liked one toy
and disliked the other toy.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:57.720
And the really
simple manipulation

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.310
between these two
different conditions

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.400
was whether the experimenter
liked the same toy as the baby,

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.050
or whether she
liked the other toy.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.420
So did she share the
infant's preferences,

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.706
or did she oppose their
preferences, right?

00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:10.330
And we would think
in terms of the data

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.910
on infants affiliative
biases, that they

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.451
would prefer to
interact with someone

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:16.320
who shares their preferences.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.570
Infants took part in
the same helping task

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.340
as they did in the
first experiment.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.160
To streamline the procedure,
we used the medium block weight

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.174
that infants have been capable
of lifting in the first study.

00:29:26.174 --> 00:29:28.590
The other thing that we did
is we added a post-test phase.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.380
So we excluded any
infants who were not

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.350
capable in the post-test
of lifting the target block

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.490
or a heavier block, right?

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.370
So we know for all of
these infants in the sample

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.690
that they can lift the block.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.084
The question is, do they
help the experimenter.

00:29:46.491 --> 00:29:46.990
OK.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.760
So we again looked at
infants' helping behavior,

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.540
we looked at their
walking experience.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.850
The other thing that
we did in the study

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.280
is we looked at infants helping
as a function of the response

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:54.780
period.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.435
Whether helping
occurred in the--

00:29:56.435 --> 00:29:58.810
rates of helping in the first
half of the response period

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.630
versus the rates of helping
overall in the response period.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.220
And our motivation
for doing this

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.320
is that we thought that
if there are differences

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.819
in the degree of
motivation to help,

00:30:06.819 --> 00:30:09.700
you might see early differences
in the response period, right?

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.620
So early on, infants
might differentiate

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.100
across the conditions.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.410
But these might
attenuate over time.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.560
One thing I forgot to
mention is that in the course

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.540
of the response
period, infants receive

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:23.260
prompts at certain
intervals in order to say,

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.910
can you get me the block, right?

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.590
So the question is
with these prompts

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.840
will any early differences that
we see attenuate over time?

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.377
OK.

00:30:31.377 --> 00:30:32.460
So here's what we can see.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.850
This is the first half
of the response period.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.600
Infants in the shared
preference condition

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.530
are significantly more likely
to help the experimenter

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.350
than infants in the nonshared
preference condition, right?

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.690
So when there are intrinsic
rewards associated

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.310
with engaging in
high effort behavior,

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.670
infants are more likely
to help the experimenter.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.450
And the other thing
that we saw is

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.970
that infants walking
experience significantly

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.870
predicts helping behavior in the
nonshared preference condition.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:58.630
So when the motivational
benefits are low,

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.990
these subjective costs
seem to exert a stronger--

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.980
a stronger role, have a
stronger predictive value,

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.819
than when the motivational
consequences-- or, sorry,

00:31:07.819 --> 00:31:09.110
motivational benefits are high.

00:31:11.521 --> 00:31:14.020
And then here, this just shows
you infants' helping behavior

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.180
but, now, as a function of
the overall response period.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.180
You can see they're still
numerically different,

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.870
but they start to
come together, right?

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.520
So the differences
are really driven

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.860
by what's happening early
in the response period.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.087
OK.

00:31:28.087 --> 00:31:30.170
So these findings suggest
that infants willingness

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:31.730
to engage in high effort--

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.680
high cost helping is
motivated or affected

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.867
by intrinsic
motivational factors.

00:31:35.867 --> 00:31:38.450
Infants are more likely to carry
a heavy block to help someone

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:39.740
who shares their preference.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.156
One thing I want
to point out here

00:31:41.156 --> 00:31:43.426
is that these findings
help us sort of

00:31:43.426 --> 00:31:45.800
interpret what's going on in
the first experiment, right?

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.140
If the first experiment
was explained by the fact

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.656
that it's a lack of ability
versus a lack of effort,

00:31:50.656 --> 00:31:52.280
we shouldn't get
these findings, right?

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.620
Because the effort is equivalent
across these two conditions

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.119
here.

00:31:55.119 --> 00:32:00.625
And what simply varies are the
kind of motivational benefits.

00:32:00.625 --> 00:32:01.432
OK.

00:32:01.432 --> 00:32:03.140
So, now, I want to
tell you about a study

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.885
that we're just in the
middle of conducting.

00:32:05.885 --> 00:32:07.760
I think it's really
exciting and interesting.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.820
I'd be curious to
get your thoughts.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.760
So we're literally
mid data collection,

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.590
but I think I have
enough data to tell you

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.110
what's going on so far.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.630
So, now, we're trying to
expand the scope of benefits

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.400
that we're looking at, right?

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.720
And as we sort of
alluded to earlier,

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.530
we don't-- really
don't know as of yet,

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.940
or we don't know very much,
about what cost counts

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.970
as a cost and a benefit
for infants, right?

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.345
That's something
that we actually

00:32:29.345 --> 00:32:31.509
have to figure out to
determine empirically.

00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:33.050
There's been some
recent studies that

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.510
have shown that three- and
four-year-olds, perhaps

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.540
paradoxically, when they're
tested in sharing tasks,

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.450
are more likely to share
with a rich recipient

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.460
than a poor recipient, right?

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.740
And that is paradoxical in
the sense that, of course,

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.160
the rich recipient has less of
a need than the poor recipient.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.550
But, perhaps,
unsurprising in the sense

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.470
that there's something
self-serving, right,

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.810
like it might be in your
self-interest to affiliate

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.018
with people who have a lot
of resources versus people

00:32:59.018 --> 00:33:00.230
who have few resources.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.080
In our study, what we did, is
before infants got the helping

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.660
task, we demonstrated to
them that one individual

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.420
had more resources than
the other individual.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.890
It's a really
simple manipulation.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.690
What they did is they
saw two individuals are

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:12.481
sitting at a table.

00:33:12.481 --> 00:33:14.810
They both had these like
transparent fish bowl looking

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:18.110
balls, and on each trial
they have different goods

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.520
in the fish bowls.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.030
So what happens is that
one individual always

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:24.297
has lots of stuff, right?

00:33:24.297 --> 00:33:26.380
On one trial it's animal
crackers, the other trial

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.650
it's these cool little balls.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.280
The third trial it's these cool,
flashing little blingy rings.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.800
And the other
person has very few.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.930
But they both do
exactly the same thing

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:36.980
during this first phase.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.530
What they do is
they take turns--

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:40.280
we counterbalance
everything, of course--

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.260
they pull out three
objects one at a time

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.700
and, they say, hey, baby,
look at all my toys, right?

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.390
So they're both doing the same
thing, exactly the same thing.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:53.690
What differs is the kind of
resource contacts, right?

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.050
One of them has a lot of stuff.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.240
One of them only has
three things, right?

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.670
And we do that on
repeated trials,

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.000
because we're trying
to give babies

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.240
the impression that,
generally, this person has more

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.945
stuff than the other person.

00:34:03.945 --> 00:34:05.300
OK.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.197
So then we test infants
in the helping task.

00:34:07.197 --> 00:34:09.530
This helping task is a little
bit different than the one

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:11.196
I just told you about,
because now we're

00:34:11.196 --> 00:34:13.500
pitting these two experimenters
against one another.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.280
The experimenters in the helping
task have equivalent need.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.409
They both, like Miranda
was doing earlier,

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:19.701
are building this tower, right?

00:34:19.701 --> 00:34:21.450
They're missing a
block, they need a block

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:22.850
to complete their tower, right?

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.020
The only thing
that differentiates

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.730
the experimenters is
what happened previously.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.688
One person had a lot of
stuff, the other person

00:34:27.688 --> 00:34:29.840
didn't have very much stuff.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.239
And the other thing that
we're manipulating here

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.420
is whether the
infant has to engage

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.830
in equally effortful actions
to help the two experimenters,

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.560
or whether helping one
of the experimenters

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.000
is more effortful.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.920
And the way that we've
operationalized this so

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.960
far in this study is by varying
how long the baby has to walk.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.600
So, in one case, the person
is within a few feet,

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.440
in the other case,
they're across the room.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.560
OK.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.990
So let me show you the data,
first, for the equal effort

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.580
condition.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.660
So these are-- this is--

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:06.410
what this graph shows you
is who the baby is helping.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.950
And what you can see here is
when effort is equivalent,

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.290
infants are systematically
helping the person

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:13.490
who has more resources.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.346
They're helping the rich
experimenter, right?

00:35:16.346 --> 00:35:17.720
So now the question
becomes, what

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.504
happens in cases
of unequal effort?

00:35:19.504 --> 00:35:21.170
And as I said, this
data is still coming

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.086
and we're still testing
this, so the condition

00:35:23.086 --> 00:35:26.150
that we started with, given that
we have this initial pattern,

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.760
is the condition where the rich
experimenter is the one you

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.021
have to walk a long way to.

00:35:30.021 --> 00:35:31.520
And the poor
experimenter is the one

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.432
you have to walk a short way to.

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:35.390
And here's what we see.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.680
It flips.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.080
So I think what this suggests is
that infants are both weighing

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.080
the costs of the action
they have to perform,

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.770
and the intrinsic motivational
benefits as defined

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.240
by these sort of
things that might

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.370
be important for
social affiliation.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:55.550
OK.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.008
So what implications
does this have

00:35:57.008 --> 00:35:59.182
for infants' prosocial behavior?

00:35:59.182 --> 00:36:00.890
Well, it suggests that
it may be the case

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.750
that cost benefit
analyses underlie

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.070
infants prosocial behavior.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.890
In particular, their
helping behavior.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:09.304
And I also want to take us
back to two of the questions

00:36:09.304 --> 00:36:10.220
that I raised earlier.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.680
One was about the
selective nature

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.830
of early prosocial behavior,
the strategic nature.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:19.160
And the other was about
the underlying motivation.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.020
So think in terms of the
selective strategic question,

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.400
on the one hand, we can say,
fairly early on at 18 months,

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.340
infants' prosocial behavior
is strategic in the sense

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.350
that what they
seem to be doing is

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:33.330
minimizing costs and maximizing
motivational benefits.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.300
And in terms of
the motivation, I

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.860
think what these
findings tell us,

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.170
and this is not to say that
infants are never motivated

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:43.586
by empathic concern,
they're never

00:36:43.586 --> 00:36:45.270
motivated by other
people's needs,

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.620
but there are other things
that come into play here.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.120
So infants' underlying
motivation to help

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.910
is influenced by a tendency
to want to affiliate

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:56.750
with particular individuals.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:57.377
OK.

00:36:57.377 --> 00:36:59.960
So I told you a little bit about
infants registration of costs

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.757
in the actions of other people,
their use of costs and benefits

00:37:02.757 --> 00:37:04.340
to guide their own
prosocial behavior.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.030
I just want to close by kind of
raising some questions that I

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.010
think we should be interested
in pursuing in the future.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:11.510
OK.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:12.920
So this came up earlier, right?

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.545
So one thing that we
have to understand

00:37:14.545 --> 00:37:16.040
to understand
infants' behavior is

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.200
to understand what acts
as a cost for infants

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.984
and what acts as a
benefit for infants.

00:37:19.984 --> 00:37:22.400
And I think the thing that's
really important to point out

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.000
here is it won't necessarily be
what we think as adults, right?

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.322
It won't be intuitive
to us, right?

00:37:28.322 --> 00:37:29.780
And the classic
example that we can

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.720
think about is, you know,
you buy your child this toy,

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.280
you bring it home
from the store,

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.830
you're so excited to give your
child this cool snazzy toy,

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.530
and all they want to do is
play with the box, right?

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:42.414
So what that shows us is we're
not good models, necessarily.

00:37:42.414 --> 00:37:44.330
We have to kind of
determine this empirically.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:49.550
We can't necessarily use our own
intuitions to figure this out.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.190
Another question is how
are costs read, right?

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.000
So in the first
study I showed you

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.270
that infants' experience
potentially is important,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.869
or factors that gait
infants' experience, right?

00:37:58.869 --> 00:38:00.410
But that's in a
situation where there

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.220
aren't a lot of
observable cues to effort.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.970
So I think it may be
the case that there's

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:06.350
some variability here.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.080
Some costs infants
may require experience

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.530
with in order to figure out
what is the cost, right?

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:13.709
How much of a cost is this?

00:38:13.709 --> 00:38:16.250
And maybe there are other costs
that infants can more readily

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.250
read from the get go.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.390
And then, finally, I
think at some point,

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.390
we need to ask whether
infants and, potentially,

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.622
children are sensitive to other
types of costs beyond effort.

00:38:26.622 --> 00:38:29.080
Also, if they have a kind of
higher level category of cost.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.490
So one thing that's really
interesting in the literature

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:33.500
on nonhuman animals
is that there are just

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.260
so simple neural systems
that are responsible

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.210
for effort reward
decision-making,

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.130
and for delay reward
decision-making.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.350
But, obviously, we, as
adults, can group these things

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.660
together, or I wouldn't be
able to give this talk today,

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.030
and Laura wouldn't have been
able to give her talk today.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.160
So one of the things we
have to start to understand

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.530
is when did those things
kind of come together

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.940
in service of this
larger category of cost.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.440
OK.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:59.200
So I'm going to stop there
and ask for questions.
