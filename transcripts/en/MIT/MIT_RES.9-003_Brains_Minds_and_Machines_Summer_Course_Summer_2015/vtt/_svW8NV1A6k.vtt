00:00:23.327 --> 00:00:25.160
TOMASO POGGIO: This
problem of intelligence,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.950
it's one of those problems that
mankind has been busy with it

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.710
for the last 2,000 years or so.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.120
But 50 years ago or
so, that was the start

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.620
of artificial intelligence.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.160
It was a conference in
Dartmouth, '62 or so,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.460
with people like John
McCarthy and Marvin Minsky,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.570
who coined the term
artificial intelligence.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.540
And at that time,
progress was made.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.720
Progress has been made,
especially in the last 20

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.219
years.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.070
I'll go through it.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.600
But they relied, really,
only on computer science

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.430
and common sense.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.040
And in the meantime, there are
all these other disciplines

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.470
which have made a
lot of progress,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.110
and that are very likely
to play a key role

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.090
in the search for answers to
the problem of intelligence.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.850
So it was obvious that we
needed different expertises.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.200
Not all in computer
science, but in other ones.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.630
And so, this was the
people that we put together

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.560
from different labs, from
neuroscience, from computer

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.190
science, from cognitive
science, and from a number

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.120
of institutions in the US.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.520
Especially MIT and Harvard.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.100
Let me tell you a bit more
about the background here.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.750
This idea of merging brain
research and computer

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.240
science in the quest to
understand intelligence.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.250
Part of the reason for this
was progress and convergence

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.139
we saw between
different disciplines.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.130
And one of them
was progress in AI.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.500
And this started,
really, with Deep Blue,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.650
I guess it was
called at the time.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.820
The machine IBM that managed
to beat Kasparov at chess

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.770
for the world championship.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.810
And then, of course, there
was Watson beating champions

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.310
in Jeopardy.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.620
And things like drones able
to land on aircraft carriers.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.150
So that's the most difficult
thing for the pilot to do.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.760
And in the meantime, things had
continued to go pretty fast.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.140
This was the cover of
Nature, probably eight months

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.370
ago or so.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.940
DeepMind, which is one of
our industrial partners

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.600
in the center, has developed
an artificial intelligence

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.900
called DeepQ I
think, that learned

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.870
to play better than humans,
49 classical Atari games.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.285
By itself.

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:18.280
And this was two or
three months ago,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.515
a cover of a Nature supplement,
on artificial intelligence

00:03:22.515 --> 00:03:23.390
and machine learning.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.280
This is showing a
system by Mobileye,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.030
this is an old video,
that gives vision to cars.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.290
There is a camera
looking outside,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.292
and is able to brake and
accelerate when needed.

00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:49.252
[AUDIO OUT]

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.010
There have been,
there are, and there

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.660
will be a lot of
significant advances in AI.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.590
I think it's a golden age
for intelligent applications.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.660
You know, if people want
to make a lot of money

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.020
with useful things,
that's the time.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.320
But this is kind of engineering.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.770
Interesting one,
but engineering.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.660
And we are still very far from
understanding how people can

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.040
answer questions about images.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:26.250
This is one of the main
focus in the center, really.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.070
How does your brain
answer simple questions

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.230
about this image?

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.890
About what is there?

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.680
And what is this?

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.850
Who is this person?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.860
What is she doing?

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.320
What is she thinking?

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.100
Please tell me a story
about this, what's going on?

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:57.030
And we would like to know to
have a system that does that.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.070
But also, to know how
our brain does it.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.290
So that's the science part.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.620
It's not enough to
pass the Turing Test.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.820
In this case, to have
a system that does it.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.480
We want to have a system
that does it in the same way

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.300
as our brain does it.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.160
And we want to compare
your model, our system,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.440
with measurements on the brain
of people, or monkeys, also

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.420
during the same task.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:37.890
So that's what we call
Turing plus, plus questions.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.650
And part of the
rationale about it

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.680
is, this is kind of a more
philosophical discussion.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.330
I personally think
that it's very

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.440
difficult to have a definition
of intelligence, in general.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.210
There are many different
forms of intelligence.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.300
What we can ask is
questions about,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.490
what is human intelligence?

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.310
Because we can study that.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.810
Right.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.270
You know, it is, I don't
know, the ENIAC computers

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.510
in the '50, more or less
intelligent than a person.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.450
You know, it can do
things a person cannot do.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.600
And so on.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.560
There are certain things ants
or bees do, are pretty amazing.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.700
Is this intelligence?

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.870
Yeah, in a certain sense is.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.440
So I think, in terms of
a well-defined question,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.628
the real question is
about human intelligence.

00:07:36.628 --> 00:07:40.900
And so that's what, from
the scientific part,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.400
we are focused on.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.190
And would like to be
able to answer how

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.310
people do understand images.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.600
We start with vision.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.790
We are not limited,
eventually, to vision.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.400
But in the first five
years of the center,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.406
that's the main focus.

00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:02.110
And answer the
question about images.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:08.500
And we want to understand
how the answers are produced

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.580
by our brain at the
computational, psychophysical,

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.240
and neural level.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.920
It's ambitious.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.040
And I think there are
probably, in terms

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.500
of having all these
different levels, levels

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:35.200
of really understanding from the
what, where, the neuroscience,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.669
to the behavior.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.950
We are not yet at
the point in which

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.710
we can answer all
those kind of questions

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.190
at all these different levels.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.080
But some, we are.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.150
One example is, who is there?

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.380
It's essentially
face recognition.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.830
And this is an
interesting problem.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:02.380
Because we know from work,
originally in the monkeys,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.640
and then with fMRI in humans.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.700
Shown here, parts of
the brains of cortex,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.210
which are involved in
face recognition and face

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.440
perception.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.870
And then, it's possible
to identify analog regions

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.430
in the monkey.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:29.830
And record from the different
patches in the monkeys,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:35.590
each one probably around 100,000
neurons, maybe 200,000 or so.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.240
And look at their
properties when the monkeys

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.950
is looking at the face.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.270
And make models of
what's going on.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.510
And, of course, we
want these models

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:54.550
to respect the neural
data, ideally the MRI data.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:10:00.010
And do the job of recognizing
faces as well as human do.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.520
So we are getting there.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.080
I'm not saying we
have the answers,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.880
but we have at least
models that can be tested

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.760
at all these different levels.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.520
So that's kind of
the ideal situation,

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.800
from the point of view of what
we want to do in the center.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.710
Now as I said that,
not all problems

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.040
are mature at this level.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.780
There are certain
like telling a story.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.060
We don't know exactly.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.330
We cannot record yet from
neurons in the monkey,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.610
when the monkey is
telling a story.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.180
Because the monkey has not been
able to tell its story, right.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.770
And so there are other
questions that are not

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.210
as advanced as this one.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.960
But other type of studies can
be done on them, should be done.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.880
And this is what
we'll hear about.
