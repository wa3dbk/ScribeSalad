TOMER ULLMAN: What we're
going to do in the last

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.820
section is not so much
have a lecture as a debate.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.980
And it's going to be a
debate between myself

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.150
and Laura Schultz.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.070
And hopefully at
the end, all of you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.990
can join in for some
sort of free for all.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.760
Although, of course,
you're welcome to ask

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.370
questions at any moment.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.830
Now, Laura and I have had
this debate a few times now.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.230
It's a debate about where
do new ideas come from.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.070
It's about theories.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.510
It's about imagination.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.760
The last time that we were
supposed to have the debate

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.540
was in SRCD, which is a
child development conference.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.030
But Laura couldn't make it.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.000
So I ended up pulling
a Monty Python man

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.590
wrestles with
himself routine where

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.430
I was arguing both my
point and Laura's point.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.950
So it's nice to have a
sparring partner again

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.260
after that experience.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.877
I am still a little intimidated.

00:01:06.877 --> 00:01:09.210
Just to give you a sense of
the caliber of my opponent--

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.293
the reason Laura didn't
show up to our SRCD debate

00:01:11.293 --> 00:01:14.260
was that she was giving
a talk of her own

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.639
in something called TED.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.180
I don't know if
you've heard of SRCD,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.520
but presumably
you've heard of TED.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.300
OK.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.610
So what's this debate about?

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.620
What am I talking about?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.010
Here's a 65 second prologue
sort of setting it up.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.440
And then we'll get into it.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.910
The background to this
debate is that, you know,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.370
we have this sort of really
nice picture coming out

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.750
of development and models.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.690
And sort of Laura and Josh
have set up the perfect intro

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.430
to that, which is
from development

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.220
we have this idea of children
are sort of like scientists

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.680
or hackers or what have you.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.770
They come up with these
theories to explain the world.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.920
And they do it beautifully.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.620
And that's what they
do in development.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.960
And then we have
this idea coming out

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.410
of computational
land which is, well,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.300
what we mean by theories--
how do we actually

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.740
capture that computationally?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.120
How do we formalize that?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.820
Well, maybe it's something
like hierarchical learning

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.760
over space of programs, right?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.740
Because programs
are this the thing

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.952
that's kind of like theories.

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:10.410
And they kind of
explain the world.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.470
And you can learn them via
Bayesian inference and programs

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.970
over programs and
learning over learning.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.420
And that's sort of a
really nice picture.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.512
But a lot of people--

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:21.970
Josh I think was
using the phrase--

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.320
or Nour was using the
phrase-- "give us grief."

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.960
A lot of people give grief
to these computation models

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.560
correctly.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.850
They say something
like, wait a minute.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.590
These computational models
that you've described,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.964
like Josh was
describing earlier,

00:02:32.964 --> 00:02:35.490
these hierarchical
programs over programs,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.630
what's the theory
space on that, right?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.690
Like, what's the space
of all possible programs?

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.190
Remind me.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.270
Isn't that infinite?

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.590
And isn't infinite
really, really big?

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.840
What are you trying to
suggest, that children are just

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.150
searching through this
giant space of programs?

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.360
How could they
possibly be doing that?

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.430
And what we'd like to
argue and I'll spell out

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.388
is that while we don't
search through the space

00:02:55.388 --> 00:02:58.170
of all programs, we don't
do that when we write out

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.070
our programs, right?

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.224
We somehow figure it out.

00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:01.890
We're writing out
these infinite spaces.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.816
And yet we search
them in our computers.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.190
That's what we're
try to suggest.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.231
The same way that we search
them in our computers

00:03:07.231 --> 00:03:09.750
might be something like the
way the children actually have

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.040
to search for their theories.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.250
And it's hard, grueling work
for computers and children.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.770
And the algorithms that we're,
in particular, interested

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.930
in-- there's all sorts of
learning algorithms, of course.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.280
But one of the most
influential learning

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.620
algorithms that people have
used for learning these programs

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.711
and hierarchical programs
over programs and things

00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:27.210
like that is just sort of this
version of stochastic search.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.950
And I've told you a little bit
about that-- those of you who

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.800
went to the church tutorial--
about Markov Chain Monte

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.280
Carlo, and all that stuff.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.696
But the point is
something-- well,

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:37.320
the way to search large,
complicated theory spaces

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.336
is through something
like stochastic search.

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.460
And, well, if it's something
like stochastic search

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.460
algorithms for our
theories, maybe children

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.750
are doing something like
stochastic search, right?

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.621
No is what Laura's going to say.

00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:53.370
Or she is going to say
that can't possibly

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.842
be the whole story, and
here's what's missing.

00:03:55.842 --> 00:03:57.300
So does everyone
sort of understand

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.730
what the debate is going
to be about more or less?

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.190
I'm going to spell out,
of course, all of this

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.590
in the next few minutes.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.220
OK.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.350
So as I said, we're going
to switch back and forth,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.770
Laura and I.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.910
The outline of the
debate is that I'm

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.701
going to give some
background for like what

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:12.780
good our theory is or
presenting a good theory--

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.950
just really sort
of covered that.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.150
So I'll be zooming
through it just

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.160
to give you an example of
what I'm talking about.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.618
Because I want to tell you what
stochastic search in theory

00:04:19.618 --> 00:04:21.839
space looks like.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.220
After I do that, Laura
is going to step in.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.040
And she's going to
rudely interrupt

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.120
me and say, no, no, no.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.310
That can't possibly be true.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.268
Here's all the things
that are wrong with that.

00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:31.560
I will then give a rebuttal.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.349
And then Laura will
end and summarize.

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.390
Beyond all these things,
something I didn't write

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.190
was all of you.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.240
Jump in and say what you think.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.740
OK.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.850
So what good is a theory?

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.266
Like I said, Josh sort
of went through this.

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:46.890
I don't think you guys need that
much convincing at this point.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.181
But by theory, I mean some
sort of structured knowledge

00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:50.820
that goes beyond
the data, compresses

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.760
the data in some way, and is
able to predict new things.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.350
My running example
is going to be

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.670
much simpler than character
recognition or anything

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.170
like that.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.990
It's going to be about
magnets and, in particular,

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.612
very simplified
theory of magnetism.

00:05:03.612 --> 00:05:05.320
So suppose we bring
a child into the lab.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.062
And we tell her,
look at these blocks.

00:05:07.062 --> 00:05:08.020
They all look the same.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.780
Play with them.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.900
See if you can figure
out what's going on here.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.500
OK?

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.230
And unbeknownst to the
child, but beknownst to you,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.730
is that these
things are magnets.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.730
They're not just blocks.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.470
Some of them are metal.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.511
Some of them are magnets.

00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:19.660
Some of them are plastic.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.320
OK?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.147
So she's going to start
playing with them.

00:05:22.147 --> 00:05:23.980
And she's going to start
noticing something.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.830
Like, sometimes none of these
things do anything, right?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.940
They don't stick.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.730
But sometimes,
huh, they do stick.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.012
And she starts
collecting observations

00:05:33.012 --> 00:05:33.970
in something like this.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.200
Like, how could she
explain the data?

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.530
Well, she could explain
the data in this.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.654
You can just write it down.

00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:39.370
She could like
label these somehow.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.080
She could have
all these, A to I.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.776
And she could say, well, A
and B attract one another,

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:46.150
B and A attract one another,
B and C attract one another,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.160
and so on.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.800
OK?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.210
That's her theory.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.762
That's her explanation
of the data.

00:05:50.762 --> 00:05:52.220
This is horrible,
of course, right?

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.810
Like, this is not an explanation
in any sense of the word.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.320
It's just a table of data.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.079
But in one sense, why
is it not a theory?

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.620
It's because it's just writing
down what you've already seen.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.530
It doesn't compress
it in any way.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.070
And it can't predict
anything new.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.880
If I now give you a new block
X and I tell you, listen,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.070
X attracts B, what else
can you tell me about it?

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.880
And she'll say, well,
X attracts B. Yeah.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.380
OK.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.700
That's what my table tells me.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.990
You can't really
predict anything new

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.310
from a giant table like that.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.600
You want some sort
of compression.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.560
You want some sort of theory.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.880
But what else could she
come up with, right?

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.210
There's all sorts of things
you could come up with.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.251
But she could have come
up with a very simplified

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.417
theory that goes like this.

00:06:26.417 --> 00:06:28.000
Suppose that we
imagine that there are

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.140
certain things in the world.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.230
We're just going to call them,
like, shmagnet and shmetal.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.646
Because I don't
want to confuse it

00:06:32.646 --> 00:06:34.872
with actual magnets
and actual metals.

00:06:34.872 --> 00:06:36.080
But she comes up with a name.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.050
She says there are several
things in the world.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.133
And how do these things
interact with one another?

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.070
Well, let's just
hypothesize some rules.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.170
And we can talk about how does
she come up with these rules.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.461
How does she know that there's
two things in the world?

00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:48.359
Let's say for some
reason by dumb luck

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:49.900
she hits upon this,
which is actually

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.280
a really good theory
for explaining

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.500
that, which is to say there
are two things in the world.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.541
And the way they interact
is through these rules.

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:57.880
If something is a magnet and
another thing is a magnet,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.230
if X is a magnet
and Y is the magnet,

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.313
they're going to interact.

00:07:00.313 --> 00:07:01.660
They're going to stick.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.540
If X is a magnet and Y in the
metal they're going to stick.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.351
And interactions are symmetric.

00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:06.850
OK.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.040
So metals don't stick to metals,
but metals stick to magnets.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.880
Magnets sticks to metals.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.230
And the interactions
are symmetric.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.460
And if you have
these rules, you need

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.160
to pay some overhead, obviously,
for remembering the rules.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.100
But you can compress this,
you know, n by n thing

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.600
into just the vectors
of remembering

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.510
what are the magnets,
what are the magnets.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.590
So you've achieved
some compression.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.798
And if I give you something
new and I tell you, look,

00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:29.200
this is X, X attracts A, and
you're like, wait a minute.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.230
A is a magnet.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.187
So this is either a
magnet or a metal.

00:07:32.187 --> 00:07:34.270
You can probably predict
a lot of different things

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.930
about this thing.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.763
You can go and design
your little experiment

00:07:36.763 --> 00:07:39.381
to figure out if this new thing
is itself a magnet or a metal.

00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:39.880
Great.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.602
So this is wonderful.

00:07:42.602 --> 00:07:43.810
I won't go through something.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.250
Like, there's this added
thing of finding out

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.329
which one are the actual
shmagnets and shmetals.

00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:49.120
And then you can predict
the observed data.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.690
OK.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.390
So now, what we've done is
we've set up this sort of space

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.710
of possible theories, right?

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.660
Imagine like all the
possible logical theories

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.534
that you could have
written out, of all

00:07:57.534 --> 00:07:59.200
the possible logical
predicates, there's

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.490
an infinite amount of them.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.050
But now we've turned this into
a rational inference problem,

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.550
right?

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.530
The problem for
you as the learner

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.870
is out of the space of all
possible theories, just

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.710
find the one that best explains
the observed data, right?

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.360
Where, by best we mean something
like Bayes' law, right?

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.126
Try to find the best
theory to predict the data,

00:08:16.126 --> 00:08:17.500
whereby we mean
the theory that's

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.854
sort of the shortest and most
compressed in itself a priori.

00:08:21.854 --> 00:08:23.020
You've all seen Bayes' rule.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.311
You've all heard Josh talk
about this and other people.

00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:27.730
But it also explains the
data itself the best.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.810
That's the problem.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.570
Go figure it out.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.700
We formalize it for you.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.750
We've solved it.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.880
And, of course, you know,
this elides a lot of things.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.540
It doesn't really
solve anything.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.480
But we'll get to
that in a second.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.240
So you might wonder
like how do we

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.330
build a good space
for possible theories.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.280
And one way to do
then is to say, well,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.110
how do you generate
all possible theories?

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.127
How do you define a space
of all possible theories?

00:08:50.127 --> 00:08:52.210
In this case, we're just
going to go with grammar.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.209
But you could imagine
something like a generator

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:56.830
for all possible
programs, right?

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.089
So a grammar, to put it
very, very, very shortly,

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:01.630
is something that
you can run forward

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.680
and will generate a sentence.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.680
Or it's a way of sort of
looking at the sentence

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.897
and figuring out what
its underlying rules are.

00:09:07.897 --> 00:09:08.980
Let's put it this way, OK?

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.135
So in a grammar, you would start
with a sort of a sentence node.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.510
And then you know
that a sentence

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.510
can go into several other
nodes in some probability.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.080
For example, a sentence
node can go into something

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.730
like a verb phrase
and a noun phrase.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.855
The noun phrase goes into
a noun and another thing.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.720
And you sort generate
through this grammar

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.162
until you end up
with a sentence.

00:09:27.162 --> 00:09:28.620
And it can be any
sort of sentence.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.840
It can be the clownfish ascended
the stairs darkly, right?

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.730
And you can run
this grammar forward

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.010
and generate whole new
sentences that you've never

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.044
thought of it before.

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:38.710
And you could then
also use that grammar

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:39.709
to figure out sentences.

00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:42.400
So if you see the sentence, the
clownfish ascended the stairs

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.858
darkly, you can use something
like a grammar to figure out,

00:09:44.858 --> 00:09:47.350
well, you know, how is
this sentence constructed.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.430
This is a grammar for
logical predicates.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.550
It just means that
if we run it forward,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.160
it starts out with some sort of
abstract thing like, you know,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.170
it's going to be a law
or some sort of set

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.274
of logical predicates.

00:09:57.274 --> 00:09:58.690
You run it forward,
and it ends up

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.260
not with a sentence, like the
clownfish blah, blah, blah.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.990
It ends up with a
particular law that's

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.100
relating a few particular
predicates like, you know--

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.400
sorry-- like X and Y interact
symmetrically, right?

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.900
Like, there are
things in the world.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.910
There are X and Y. If
X interacts with Y,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.020
Y interacts with
X. That's a law.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.930
We run through the
grammar, we generate that.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.070
We could run through
the grammar again,

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.028
and it will say something
completely different.

00:10:22.028 --> 00:10:23.825
Like, of all the things
that I've related,

00:10:23.825 --> 00:10:25.200
there are such
things as magnets.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.140
There are metals.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.290
And they should interact
in this way or that way.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.490
Once we define a
grammar like that,

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.781
you can predict all sorts of
different theories, right?

00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:33.900
I gave simplified magnetism,
but you could also

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.000
capture kinship
with a set of four

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.350
laws and several predicates.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.900
You could capture taxonomy.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.500
You could capture very,
very simplified psychology

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.921
of preference.

00:10:44.921 --> 00:10:45.420
OK.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.630
So as I said, this is another
view of theory search.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.512
I haven't yet gotten to
the algorithmic level

00:10:50.512 --> 00:10:52.470
of how do you actually
search for these things.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.820
But I did want to
set up the grammar,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.240
because it's going to be a
little bit important later on.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.500
The grammar is just a
way of saying, you know,

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.541
you start with something.

00:10:58.541 --> 00:11:00.510
You generate it forward
until you end up

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.570
with a particular
set of logical rules.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:09.300
So, again, to phrase the
problem in a particular way

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.670
of logical inference is to say
we have the space of theories.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.130
It's an infinite space, right?

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.200
And before I've
seen any data, there

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.510
is some probability
of the right theory

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.372
is to explain my data,
where the data can

00:11:20.372 --> 00:11:22.830
be something like-- play with
these blogs, figure them out.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.492
Before I've even
seen the blocks,

00:11:24.492 --> 00:11:26.700
before I've seen anything
that I need to explain yet,

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.650
I have some sort of space
of all possible theories.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.108
It can be all the
logical theories,

00:11:30.108 --> 00:11:32.261
all the possible
programs in the world.

00:11:32.261 --> 00:11:34.260
And I have some sort of
probability distribution

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.426
over which one of these are
more likely than others,

00:11:36.426 --> 00:11:38.326
which comes from the prior.

00:11:38.326 --> 00:11:40.200
And the prior can be
something on simplicity,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.980
like shorter programs are
more likely, or the less free

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.045
parameters the better.

00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:46.170
Something like that, right?

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.344
So before I've seen any data, I
can already score some programs

00:11:49.344 --> 00:11:50.760
as being unlikely,
because they're

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.710
too long and too ungainly.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.160
Does that make
sense to everyone?

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.792
OK.

00:11:54.792 --> 00:11:57.000
And that's just a representation
of that in 2D space.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.874
It's saying, like, over
here is theory space.

00:11:58.874 --> 00:12:01.170
And the size of the
hills over 2D space

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.890
is how likely each point,
each point in theory space,

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.950
is a theory, where
theory can be,

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.880
as I said, a set of logical
laws or program or anything.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.380
And the height of
the hill over that

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.610
is the amount of
probability you should

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.985
assign to that theory, how
much you should believe in it.

00:12:13.985 --> 00:12:16.410
And as data comes
in, what happens

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.080
is you become more or less
certain of certain programs.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.401
Like, suddenly you shift
probability distributions

00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:21.900
around.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.525
You say, oh, these things that
I didn't think were that likely,

00:12:24.525 --> 00:12:27.840
well, the data's really pushing
me to accepting these theories.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.380
OK?

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.970
And that's what
learning is, right?

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.136
That's the view of learning.

00:12:31.136 --> 00:12:33.210
You just start with
particular probabilities.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.470
You get some data.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.870
And then you shift
that around, and you

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.980
get other probabilities.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.830
And that's sort of a
very beautiful picture.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.682
And the only problem with it
is that it is clearly false.

00:12:43.682 --> 00:12:45.390
And the reason it's
false is because this

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.265
is an infinite space.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.139
And there's no way that
you could have scored

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:49.237
the entire infinite space.

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:51.570
There's no way that what
children are doing, what adults

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.310
are doing, what
computers are doing

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.460
is to instantly shift
probability mass

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.960
over this entire space, right?

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.800
New data comes in.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.660
They're holding in
this infinite space

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.390
and shifting exactly the
probabilities around, right?

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.270
This view of learning is
ridiculous, because, well, it's

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.350
patently absurd.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.040
And also, people have
taken issue with it

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.980
even though it was never meant
to be the story of learning

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.792
that is happening
in the real-- well,

00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:17.500
how should I put this,
in the real world?

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.125
Do you guys know the difference
between the computational level

00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:23.010
and the algorithmic level when
I say something like that?

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.680
Show of hands-- who knows
about Marr's three levels?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.190
OK.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.880
Who doesn't know about Marr's
three levels of explanation?

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.550
OK.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.100
The point is to say when you
try to explain the phenomenon,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.350
you're going to give it
several levels of explanation.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.360
You're going to give it sort
of the functional level, what

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.944
we might call the
computational level.

00:13:37.944 --> 00:13:39.484
And then you're
going to actually say

00:13:39.484 --> 00:13:41.130
how does this actually
get implemented

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.292
in an actual machine.

00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:44.250
And there are many ways
of implementing things.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.070
Like you might say, well, look,
the general problem for vision

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.170
is this, or this thing needs
to be in addition function.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.360
These are the sort of
things I wanted to do.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.735
But there are many
different ways

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:55.390
to implement that function.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.950
Some of them are
better than others.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.180
That's the algorithmic level.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.440
How does this actually get
implemented in an algorithm?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.940
Then you can implement
the algorithm

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.754
in many different
mechanistic ways.

00:14:04.754 --> 00:14:07.170
You can go and implement it
in neurons or in silicon chips

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:07.830
or things like that.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.705
There are many different
ways of implementing

00:14:09.705 --> 00:14:10.950
a particular algorithm.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.914
This view of, you know,
you have some theories,

00:14:13.914 --> 00:14:15.330
you have some prior
over theories,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.360
you shift the probabilities
around as data comes in--

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.170
that's an explanation on
the computational level.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.970
That's not an explanation of how
we actually shift them around,

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.640
how we actually search
for these theories.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.010
And really the
computational level

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.417
sometimes gets grief,
because people say, well,

00:14:31.417 --> 00:14:32.250
what are you saying?

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.750
Are you saying that
Einstein somehow

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.490
had the theory of
relativity, we all

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.470
had the theory of
relativity, in our head?

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.080
And his process of
discovery was just

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.920
to say, well, I believe
in Newton's theory.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.070
And I had some low
prior on relativity.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.160
But then the data came in,
and I shifted my probability

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.780
to the theory of relativity.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.826
That sounds not the way
people actually learn.

00:14:50.826 --> 00:14:52.950
That doesn't sound like
the way we discover things.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.260
That doesn't sound like the way
we come up with new theories.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.420
That doesn't sound like the
way that children learn.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.290
And as I said, that's not
exactly what we think.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.290
And that's not what happens
in computers either.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.090
That's not the
algorithmic level.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.880
So what happens in
the algorithm level

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.285
is you actually have to
search for your theories, OK?

00:15:08.285 --> 00:15:10.160
And this is what happens
in stochastic search

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.900
in particular.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.080
What how does in
stochastic search--

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.240
those of you who are in
tutorial remember this--

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.780
you have some space of theories.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.540
OK, I'm still giving you the
space of possible theories.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.740
Each dot in theory space
is, let's say, a program.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.177
Or in this case, it's something
like a theory in the sense

00:15:24.177 --> 00:15:25.010
I defined it before.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.370
It's a set of logical laws
relating these predicates

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.890
together.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:29.390
OK.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.142
So let me use--

00:15:31.142 --> 00:15:32.600
I'm not sure you
can follow my hand

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.790
like this, right-- gaze
detection or whatever.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.630
So theory A is, let's
say, a theory that

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.910
has three possible laws.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.460
It says if X has a
P, P can be anything.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.160
And Y is a P. It's the
same sort of thing.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.520
Then they're going to interact.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.069
The second law says if
X is P and Y is a Q,

00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.860
they will interact.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.490
It doesn't matter.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.960
You don't have to figure
this theory out, right?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.501
I'm just trying to give you an
example of what a theory could

00:15:56.501 --> 00:15:58.670
be theoretically.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.490
And they interact symmetrically.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:02.270
That's one dot.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.710
Let's call that dot number one.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.010
That's theory A. Here is dot
number two, theory B. OK?

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.689
You as the learner, as the
stochastic search learner

00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:11.480
in the algorithmic
level, don't have access

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.521
to the full theory space.

00:16:12.521 --> 00:16:14.870
All you have is A. That's
where you are right now.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.250
That's all you
have of the world.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:16.750
OK.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.707
That's how you can try
to explain the world.

00:16:18.707 --> 00:16:20.540
And what you can do is
you can try proposing

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.550
certain changes to your theory.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.740
You can try taking out a
law or putting in a law

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.080
or taking out a predicate,
somehow sort of messing

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.160
with your theory,
hacking with your theory

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.790
somehow, coming up
with a new theory that

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.310
gives you theory B.
It's a different point

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.511
in theory space.

00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:37.760
And what you do then is you
compare your two theories.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.454
You say, how well does
this predict the data?

00:16:40.454 --> 00:16:41.870
So and so, you
give it some score.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.080
You say, how well does this
theory predict the data?

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.496
So and so, you
give it some score.

00:16:45.496 --> 00:16:48.140
You say, how likely is
the theory a priori?

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.040
How short is it?

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.110
How simple is it?

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.690
OK.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.310
How short is this
theory a priori?

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.550
OK.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.110
So you get some score
for this theory that's

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.514
based on the data in the prior.

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:56.930
You get some score
for this theory

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.220
based on the data in the prior.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.553
And you basically decide which
one of these two theories

00:17:00.553 --> 00:17:01.310
to accept.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.590
You could either stay
with your old theory

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.124
before you proposed any changes.

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.790
Or you could decide
that, wait a minute,

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.960
that theory that I just
proposed, the new one,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.102
is actually a bit better.

00:17:10.102 --> 00:17:12.560
Or even if it's not better,
it's not doing that much worse,

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.450
so I'll jump to it.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:13.950
OK.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.970
That's the stochastic
part in stochastic search

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.770
or in like these
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.770
This way of sort of
jumping around in the space

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.599
is the stochastic search
I'm talking about.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.099
You're here in theory space.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.720
You have one theory.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.339
You propose a change
to that theory.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:29.840
And we'll get in a
second to how you propose

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.839
a change to that theory.

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:31.885
You propose a change.

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:32.510
On end up here.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.010
You say, should I move here?

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.610
Let's check.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.050
Is this theory doing any better?

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.880
If it's doing
better, move there.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.690
If it's doing worse, well,
maybe still move there

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.940
depending on how much
worse it's doing.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.940
And this process is sort of
jumping around in theory space.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.550
Probabilistically proposing
theories and accepting them

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:55.240
is not that far from what
MCMC is doing or optimization

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.900
through MCMC.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.670
Oh, sorry.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:17:59.970
I'm clicking on this.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:00.470
OK.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.570
And you can notice that this
sort of search is somewhat

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.986
different from-- this is the
picture that Josh was showing

00:18:04.986 --> 00:18:06.080
before--

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.294
gradient descent or
convex optimization,

00:18:08.294 --> 00:18:10.460
the sort of thing that you
might do neural networks.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.680
I'm not trying to suggest that
this is exactly what happens

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.430
in neural networks.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.513
I mean, the more complicated
neural network stuff,

00:18:15.513 --> 00:18:18.620
the energy landscape,
can be quite complicated.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.990
And they still need to do
stochastic gradient descent.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.870
But it doesn't look as fully
connected and as horrible

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.230
as these sort of theories
on top look like.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.765
Because the space
there is much more--

00:18:29.765 --> 00:18:31.140
I don't want to
say well-defined.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.100
They're both well-defined.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.370
But it's sort of much easier
to search through, right?

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.800
It's sort of easy to get
in these neural networks

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.990
to know where you're going
to sort of differentiate

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:40.840
and quickly get to your target.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.320
You're not so much
doing this sort

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.247
of hard laborious
stochastic search.

00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:45.830
You sort of have
this notion of, well,

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.420
it's immediately
going to be the best

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.210
direction to go in is this.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.049
OK?

00:18:50.049 --> 00:18:51.590
I'm just going to
do gradient decent.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.060
I'm going to roll downhill.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.540
And then that's some sort of
good point in neural network

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.190
land.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.895
OK.

00:18:57.895 --> 00:19:00.020
So how do we actually
propose alternative theories?

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.970
Well, you say, look, I have
some sort of, let's say--

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.150
let's do this.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.720
OK.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.310
You have some sort
of particular rule.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.809
And then what you
do-- remember when

00:19:08.809 --> 00:19:10.934
I said you have some sort
of grammar over theories,

00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:13.058
kind of like a grammar in
language for those of you

00:19:13.058 --> 00:19:13.700
who know?

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.790
The grammar describes
a particular tree

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.990
that you walk through to
end up with your theory.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.120
What you do to propose a
change to it-- and this

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.786
is true for both these
logical theories,

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.120
but also for programs.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.410
You go to any [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.160
You go to any sort of
node in that tree that

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.450
generated your program
or generated your theory,

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.200
and you change it.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.020
You sort of re-sample from
it or, you know, cut it

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.380
and regenerate.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.040
And then what that ends up doing
is it ends up, for example,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.470
adding a new rule
or, for example,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.490
changing the predicate, or
adding a new rule again,

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.920
or deleting a rule, or
deleting a predicate,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.140
or changing a predicate,
deleting a predicate by sort

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.640
of changing predicates, deleting
rules, adding rules, adding

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.650
predicates.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.490
I wasn't covering
the full space.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.740
You jump around in theory land.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.240
OK.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:04.150
And this sort of dynamic of
moving around in theory land

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.440
stochastically--

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.074
one step forward,
two steps back, you

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:10.990
know, you don't know the
target ahead of time,

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.490
when you actually
propose something,

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.810
you proposed something new--

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.450
different learners might
take different paths

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.460
to get to the same target
ultimately starting

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.296
from an equal
state of ignorance.

00:20:20.296 --> 00:20:21.920
You sort of propose
different theories.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.780
You end up in different ways.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.405
But usually, if you
get the right data,

00:20:24.405 --> 00:20:26.560
eventually you end
up in the same spot.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.541
These discrete moments
of sort of, you

00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:30.415
know, faffing about and
sort of saying, well,

00:20:30.415 --> 00:20:31.910
this rule, that rule,
that doesn't explain it.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:32.890
This explains it,
doesn't explain it.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.410
Suddenly, you propose something
that sort of clicks into place.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:36.790
You say, ah, it's
not that there's

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:37.789
two things in the world.

00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:39.550
There's three things
in the world, right?

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.580
It's not just
metals and plastics.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.760
There's actually metals
and magnets and plastics.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.260
Ah.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.530
And suddenly, you rearrange
the data and things like that,

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.030
right?

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.690
All these things,
all these dynamics,

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.090
have something of the flavor
of children's learning.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.920
And I didn't give
you the full spiel.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.204
And you can go and read
some of our papers.

00:20:56.204 --> 00:20:57.620
There's also been
other people who

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.995
have been very
interested in sort

00:20:58.995 --> 00:21:01.360
of looking at the dynamics
of stochastic search,

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.670
how well it predicts
what children are doing.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.410
Among them, I'll
just mention people

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.690
like Liz Bonawitz and
Stephanie Denison,

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.840
and also Tom Griffiths,
and finally Alison Gopnik.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.200
So I also have TED
speaker on my side.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.380
And not just any TED speaker--
it's Laura's former advisor.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.990
So at that point, it's a good
point to hand it off to Laura

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.900
and see what she has
to say about this.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.752
But a midpoint summary is to
say theories are useful, right?

00:21:27.752 --> 00:21:29.710
I think Josh has already
convinced you of that.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.090
We want theories.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.340
The problem is that they
define these rich structured

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.530
complicated landscapes
much more rich, much more

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.850
complicated than
anything that you might

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:37.974
find in the neural network.

00:21:37.974 --> 00:21:39.840
Well, yes.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.030
And it's hard to search for
these rich, complicated, fully

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.850
connected landscapes, like
the space of all programs

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.975
or the space of all
possible logic theories.

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:50.350
And the way to
sort through it is

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.320
stochastic search, which can
be horribly slow and wrong

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.760
and things like that.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.610
But the claim is something
like, what are you

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.660
going to do, right?

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.220
I mean, we want
these rich theories.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.780
Rich theories define
rich landscapes.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.520
And you just have to
get away right now

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.710
with stochastic search.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.670
Our algorithm solution
for these spaces

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.680
are stochastic search
in that rich landscape.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.020
And, well, why
shouldn't that apply

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.480
to what children are doing?

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.880
So here with a why not is Laura.

00:22:19.065 --> 00:22:20.786
LAURA SCHULZ: I
think I have one.

00:22:20.786 --> 00:22:22.340
I'm hooked up, right?

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.230
OK.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.350
So when I first
engaged in this debate

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.890
with Tomer, I was stuck
on this kind of a thought

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.860
that what's going to
happen here is-- in which,

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.190
following an eloquent
exposition of a former model,

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.650
attendant experiments,
and quantitative data,

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.490
Laura proceeds to
wave her hands around.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.490
Someone was asking
about intuitions.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.660
And I just had this strong
compelling intuition

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.460
this was completely wrong.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.380
But mainly, I was
puzzled as to why I was

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.880
stuck on this archaic locution.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.574
What was I doing with
this "in which" situation?

00:22:55.574 --> 00:22:56.990
And it occurred
to me the reason I

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:02.750
was stuck on this particular
locution is that I was thinking

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.960
of a particular story
that nicely illustrates

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.920
exactly what I think the problem
is with stochastic search.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.260
It's from a classic in
developmental literature,

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.360
the stories, of course, A.
A. Milne and Winnie the Pooh.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.270
And this is the particular
problem of "in which"

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.170
Christopher Robin and Pooh
and all go on an expedition

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.820
to the North Pole.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.410
And so they're
organizing a search.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.740
And like Tomer's algorithms,
they don't actually

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.510
know where the North Pole is.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.365
And it turns out, as Christopher
Robin confides in a moment

00:23:33.365 --> 00:23:36.230
to rabbit, they also don't know
what the North Pole is, also

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.864
like Tomer's algorithms.

00:23:37.864 --> 00:23:39.530
But they do something
about the terrain.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.071
And they know
something about search.

00:23:41.071 --> 00:23:43.100
You gather all the
friends and relations.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.350
And you engage in an iterative
process over and over

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.760
and over again
until you succeed,

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.650
and you find yourself
at the North Pole.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.320
And Eeyore is a little
bit skeptical about this.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.370
He says, well, you can
call this you know,

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.650
expo-whatever or
gathering nuts in May.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.815
It's all the same to him.

00:23:59.815 --> 00:24:01.190
And at the of the
day, I actually

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.200
think Christopher Robin
and colleagues here

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.890
have a certain set of advantages
over Tomer and colleagues.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.930
And that is that it is
a Hundred Acre Wood.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.620
And so if the North
Pole's really there,

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.840
and they engage in
that process, and they

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.590
have all of rabbits
friends and relations,

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.650
they probably will find it.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:20.000
But it also turns out that,
unlike Tomer and colleagues,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.360
they do know something about
what they're searching for.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.230
Now, they're wrong about this.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.280
But nonetheless, I think they
access an important constraint

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.786
on the search
process and actually

00:24:30.786 --> 00:24:31.910
helps them out quite a lot.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:37.200
So that's what I'm going to
try to talk to you about today.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.350
So here are the issues
with stochastic search.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.600
I think there are two big ones.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.580
Grant everything--
grant grammar,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.530
grant prior knowledge,
grant templates,

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.810
grant a bias towards simplicity.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.270
The problem with an
infinite search space

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.650
is infinite is a very, very,
very big space to search.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.640
It's a very big space to search.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.200
And children seem to do
remarkably well with it.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.040
So I'm going to, I guess, give
you a toy fictional example.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:09.140
I'm going to give you
a non-fiction example

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.830
from my child.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.930
We were riding on an airplane.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.000
She was about 3 and
1/2 at the time.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.210
And she knows a lot
about airplanes.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.650
She has a lot of folk
physics, prior knowledge

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.540
about airplanes.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.330
And she also knows
a lot about phones.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.996
She's had a lot of
experience of phones.

00:25:23.996 --> 00:25:25.520
But nothing in her
prior knowledge

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.780
predicted the
announcement that you

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.330
have to turn off your cell phone
when you fly a plane, right?

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.440
So this was surprising.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.523
And she immediately said,
well, I know the answer.

00:25:32.523 --> 00:25:34.440
I know why you have to do that.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.170
And I know that she
doesn't know anything

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.315
about radio transmission
or government bureaucracy.

00:25:38.315 --> 00:25:40.340
So I said, how do you know?

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.240
Why do you think?

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.300
And she said, well, because
when the plane takes off,

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.790
it's too noisy to hear.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.680
You know, that example
is not especially clever

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.050
or especially adorable.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.994
But what is really, really
interesting about that answer

00:25:56.994 --> 00:25:58.910
is that although it is
wrong-- it's even wrong

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.520
as to the causal direction--

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.040
it is a good wrong
answer compared

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.960
to all of the other
things that are

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.240
consistent with her prior
knowledge and the grammar

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.630
of her intuitive theories
that she didn't say.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.890
She didn't say, because
airplanes are made of metal

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:14.889
and so are phones.

00:26:14.889 --> 00:26:16.430
Because airplanes
fly over the Earth,

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:17.510
and the Earth has phones.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.550
Because airplanes are
big and phones are small.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.592
Because airplanes-- her
grandfather lives in Ohio

00:26:21.592 --> 00:26:24.050
and has led her to believe that
everything is made in Ohio.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.200
Because airplanes and phones
are both made in Ohio.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.610
Infinite is a very big space.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.080
There are a lot
of things that you

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.864
could say consistent
with prior knowledge

00:26:32.864 --> 00:26:34.280
where you're making
random changes

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.330
in your intuitive theories
that are not even wrong.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.860
They're not even wrong.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.900
And so the real
question is, how did she

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.260
converge at a good wrong
answer, at an answer

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.130
that, although it is
wrong, makes sense?

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:53.420
It isn't just, I
think, a toy problem.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.130
But here is the problem.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.110
There are innumerable
logical constitutive

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.900
causal and relational hypotheses
consistent with the grammar

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.200
of intuitive theories.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.650
How do we so rapidly, literally
between the announcement

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.191
and the next thing
out of our mouths,

00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:08.240
converge on ones that,
if they were true,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.542
might explain the data?

00:27:09.542 --> 00:27:10.500
They might not be true.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.710
But if they were,
they could work.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.300
They could solve problems.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.300
And that I think is the
really hard mystery.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.830
And again, it's not
just a toy problem.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:24.380
Modeling even relatively
simple well-understood problems

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:24.920
takes time.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.977
I would often come
across Josh's students

00:27:26.977 --> 00:27:28.060
wandering in the hallways.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:28.930
And I say, what are you doing?

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.175
They're like, oh, I'm
waiting for my model to run.

00:27:31.175 --> 00:27:32.550
I'm like, waiting
for your model?

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.930
Computers are really fast.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.810
They're fast
information processing.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:37.016
What is it doing?

00:27:37.016 --> 00:27:39.140
Well, it turns out it's
generating a lot of answers

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.460
that aren't even wrong.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.970
That's what it's doing, right?

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.360
It's spending a
lot of time sitting

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:48.140
around sifting through things
that aren't even right.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.859
Iterations are spent
searching in hopeless places.

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:53.150
And this is true of some of
the best and the brightest.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.920
This was like a fantastic
NIPS paper, a major advance.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.110
It's a probabilistic
graphics program.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.005
And it's solving the really
deep theory problem of CAPTCHAs.

00:28:04.005 --> 00:28:05.920
So it's trying to figure
out in this case--

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.814
but it doesn't just
do-- in fairness-- well,

00:28:07.814 --> 00:28:08.730
let me return to that.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:09.950
Let me show you what it does do.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.241
There's a rectangle over there.

00:28:11.241 --> 00:28:14.300
It wants to be able to figure
out what is in that space.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.890
And it wants to model it.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.320
It wants to find a rectangle
in the lower left-hand corner

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.950
of a scene.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:19.580
So what does it do?

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.110
It generates pixels
all over the map

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.318
until it finds the rectangle.

00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:24.450
And I saw this in [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.164
And I said, why is
it looking all--

00:28:26.164 --> 00:28:27.580
can it at least
confine its search

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.790
to the lower left-hand corner?

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.540
But, of course, the
algorithm doesn't know

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.820
from lower left-hand corners.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.266
It's a powerful algorithm.

00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:34.640
If you wanted to
solve a CAPTCHA,

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.140
you could do-- see look at it.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.140
It's all over the place.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.530
Now, this is a virtue.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:40.680
And, yeah, it converges.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.200
And that's just great, right?

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.092
But why doesn't it search
in lower left-hand corner?

00:28:45.092 --> 00:28:46.550
Well, the answer
is it doesn't know

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.440
from lower left-hand corners.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.000
And it's a feature, not a bug,
that it doesn't know from this.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.140
Because that means
it doesn't just

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.348
solve CAPTCHAs, which you
can do with edge detection.

00:28:53.348 --> 00:28:55.370
It can find, you know,
objects in the road.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.152
And it can do all
kinds of other things

00:28:57.152 --> 00:28:58.610
that I'm sure Josh
and Vikash would

00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:59.859
be happy to talk to you about.

00:28:59.859 --> 00:29:01.250
It's a pretty general thing.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.420
But it's not constrained.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.050
And that's a feature.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:04.500
But the interesting
thing about humans,

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.041
including human
children, is they are

00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:07.524
both flexible and constrained.

00:29:07.524 --> 00:29:09.440
They can both solve a
whole bunch of problems,

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.900
and they can converge on
them very quickly, right?

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.930
Whereas, here, it trades off.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.870
And, again, that is
a simpler problem.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.670
That is a square and
a bunch of pixels.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.230
The kind of learning we're
talking about when we're

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.396
trying to talk about theory
generation or real world

00:29:29.396 --> 00:29:32.480
learning is a really, really,
really, really big space.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.190
So one problem is
just how are you

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.310
going to get at least to
answers that, if they were true,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.960
might work?

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.230
But if one problem is that the
theory space is really big,

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:45.440
the other problem is that human
learners are not that dumb.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.780
We have a lot of knowledge.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.280
And we have a lot of knowledge
that these algorithms are not

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.230
making use of.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.170
And the question is, why not?

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.920
And is there any way
that we could develop

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.200
models that did make use of it?

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.650
In particular, we know a
lot about our problems.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.420
Our problems are
actually our friends.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.190
We know about our
problems and our goals.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.220
And we know about our
problems well before we

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.250
can solve those problems.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.670
An abstract representation
of what the solution might

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.160
look like, what it
ought to do, what

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.560
the criteria it's
trying to satisfy are,

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.960
could help constrain
and guide the search.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.520
It matters about
it though, not just

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.860
that she had prior knowledge
about airplanes and about

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.050
phones, but that she
had prior knowledge

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.890
that the problem
she was solving was

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:32.390
an unpredicted incompatibility
between airplanes and phones.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.060
You have to turn one off
when the other is going on.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.475
That's information that's
not in her general background

00:30:37.475 --> 00:30:37.975
knowledge.

00:30:37.975 --> 00:30:41.066
It's about the particular
problem that she has.

00:30:41.066 --> 00:30:42.440
And the question
is how could you

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:49.820
use that to make good proposals
and make better proposals?

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:53.300
So the proposal I
have is that when

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.359
you know something about
what you're looking for,

00:30:56.359 --> 00:30:57.650
then that can help you find it.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:58.640
And this is the
kind of knowledge

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.900
that Christopher
Robin and colleagues

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.490
had that Tomer and
colleagues did not.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.730
They at least eventually decided
that what they were looking for

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.810
was, of course, a pole.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:06.980
They know what poles are.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.090
Therefore, when
they find a pole,

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.048
they can be quite confident
that here they are.

00:31:10.048 --> 00:31:12.500
And this is a good candidate
solution to their problem.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.830
That solution is wrong,
but at least it's wrong.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.320
OK.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.780
So the argument
here, which I'm going

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.880
to try to get
slightly more precise,

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.940
is that the form of the problem
as an input to the algorithm

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.630
should increase the probability
that proposes useful ideas.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:38.790
And you can consider this
even in the simplest form

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.385
in the kind of information that
is contained in our question

00:31:41.385 --> 00:31:41.885
words.

00:31:41.885 --> 00:31:44.550
So I think it's an interesting
feature about human cognition

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.740
that we have a very, very
small handful of question

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.941
words, which we use to
query the entire universe.

00:31:50.941 --> 00:31:51.690
And you know what?

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.670
Those question words do
a lot of work for us.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:58.410
When I tell you I'm asking
a question about who,

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:01.274
you might propose that
we ought to be looking

00:32:01.274 --> 00:32:02.940
for some kind of
answer that's something

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:03.890
like a social network.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.210
And a social network might
be more likely as an answer

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.560
than a 2D map.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.500
Whereas, if I ask you a question
about where, well, you really

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.150
do want to consider 2D maps.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.670
If I'm asking when, you're
talking about a time line

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:15.390
answer.

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:19.350
If I ask you a why question,
maybe it's a causal network.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.180
And if I'm asking
you a how question,

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.037
maybe it's a circuit
diagram, right?

00:32:24.037 --> 00:32:26.370
You don't know anything about
the content at this point.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:27.900
I could be asking you anything.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.690
But I ask you who was
Christopher Columbus,

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.120
and you answer 1492.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.730
That's the kind of thing that
our algorithms are doing.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.190
That's not even wrong, right?

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.110
It's consistent with
your prior knowledge.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.270
And it's the kind
of thing Watson does

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.400
as good [INAUDIBLE] solutions.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.420
But it's not what children do.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.290
It's not what children do.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:53.310
I think that the issue
is that this is actually

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.830
a friendly amendment, right?

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.500
Because in what we have
shown time and again--

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.460
by we I mean not me, but
computational modeling folks--

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.310
is that we can use
lots of information

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.670
out there for hypothesis
evaluation, right?

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.620
Once we have a theory
and we have the data,

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.320
we can select and use this
information and say, well,

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.600
does it answer the
problem or not, right?

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.710
Does it improve?

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.490
Does it make better predictions?

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:22.720
So we use this kind of
information that we have.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.840
Even formally, we can
say that we can use

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.912
it to select among hypotheses.

00:33:26.912 --> 00:33:29.370
We can use information about
the structural form of problem

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.360
to represent them.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.470
The question is, can we use
the same kind of information

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.970
to constrain the search space?

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.136
And it's easy for me to say.

00:33:37.136 --> 00:33:38.790
I don't have to do that, right?

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:43.710
But it's the kind of proposal
that I think is missing.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.890
Because we have rich constraints
that go far, far, far

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.930
beyond our question words.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.370
The kinds of
problems that we have

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.170
and the criteria
for solving them

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.640
derive from all
kinds of sources.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.610
We try to solve different
kinds of problems--

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:01.939
navigation in some cases,
explanation in other cases.

00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:03.480
And some of those
are epistemic ends.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.620
I want to persuade
you of something.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.300
I want to instruct
you in something.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.420
I want to deceive
you in some ways.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.520
But we also have all kinds
of non-epistemic goals.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.440
I want to impress you.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.315
I want to soothe you.

00:34:13.315 --> 00:34:14.370
I want to entertain you.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:17.639
Each of these goals is
actually a constraint

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:21.026
on what is going to
count as the solution.

00:34:21.026 --> 00:34:24.210
Our goals are innumerable.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:25.980
But there are only
a small handful

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.500
of ways you can
solve any given goal.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.139
So when you're dealing with
an infinite search space,

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:34.139
having a goal, having
a problem, actually

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.199
could act as a constraint on
how you search for the solution.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:39.810
And it is an interesting
feature of human cognition

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:43.710
that our goals can
be noble or venial.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.199
They can be
impressive or trivial.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:49.080
And it may not
matter with respect

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.850
to the solution we have.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:54.090
We have analytic logic,
because the medieval monks

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:58.530
wanted to find incontrovertible
proof for the existence of God.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.480
We don't hold onto
their goal, but we

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.280
hold onto their solution.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:07.590
We are here in the East
Coast of Massachusetts,

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:11.550
because of the search for
the West Indies, right?

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:15.010
So our goals act as
constraints on the solution

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.560
and on the search process.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.070
And the importance
of our goals may

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.600
be that they do exactly
that, that they help leverage

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:27.330
some new search in a way that
at least helps us make progress.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.630
So the argument here is
instead of stochastic search,

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.221
that we have--

00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:32.470
I don't call it goal oriented.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:36.690
I call it goal constrained now--
goal-constrained hypothesis

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.790
generation.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.940
And the idea here
is that at least we

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.345
know something about
where we want to go.

00:35:44.345 --> 00:35:45.720
Now, this is not
a total argument

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.100
against stochastic search.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.500
It's just a way of getting
stochastic search into a much

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.390
smaller search space, right?

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:53.970
Once you know what things count,
then you can do everything

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:54.720
Tomer says you do.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.804
I actually agree with him.

00:35:55.804 --> 00:35:57.928
But you don't want to do
it over all possibilities,

00:35:57.928 --> 00:35:59.910
because you know a lot
more than that, right?

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.480
You know what kinds of
things are going to count.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.540
You should do it over that
space, not over-- should

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.740
look in the left-hand corner.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.360
Then you can iterate
all the pixels you want.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.151
But if the thing's on
the left-hand corner,

00:36:08.151 --> 00:36:11.400
that's where you
ought to be looking.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.120
I'm going to give you a
corollary to this, which

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.930
is if you don't have any idea
what the search space is,

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:19.820
you are going to
resort to an extremely

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.064
inefficient, extremely
frustrating search

00:36:22.064 --> 00:36:24.230
and, actually, the kinds
of conditions under which I

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.670
think human beings quit.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:29.150
So I will give you an example
from my personal experience,

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:30.380
as Jessica Sommerville knows.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.186
Because we were trying to
get my child's booster seat--

00:36:33.186 --> 00:36:35.060
because children now
need booster seats until

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.660
they're 14--

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.510
re-attached from
my plane flight.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.530
Couldn't do it, right?

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.113
One thing goes down,
two things go up.

00:36:41.113 --> 00:36:42.260
It's a spatial problem.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.470
We spent 10 minutes,
two PhDs, on it--

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:46.777
threw the thing out
and just had her ride

00:36:46.777 --> 00:36:48.860
in the bottom of the booster
seat without the top.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.730
If I have 1,000 piece puzzle and
I have to find a puzzle piece,

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.280
people who are good
at puzzles know

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.360
before they find that
piece something about what

00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.360
it's going to look like.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.526
Like, OK, well, the edge
has to be angled like this.

00:37:01.526 --> 00:37:03.980
It has to have a concavity
here and a convexity there.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.380
And that's what I'm looking for.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.070
Me-- soon as I look
away from the piece,

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.690
I have no idea what
I'm looking for.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.034
And so I do what Tomer would do.

00:37:11.034 --> 00:37:12.950
I do a stochastic search
over all the puzzles,

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.140
And with 1,000 pieces
and many permutations,

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.970
that is not a good
way to solve a puzzle.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.820
As a result, I never
do puzzles, right?

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.770
As entertainment, I
just don't understand.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.846
But if you do know, it's
very satisfying, right?

00:37:24.846 --> 00:37:26.220
You know what
you're looking for.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.011
And now you can constrain
your search space

00:37:28.011 --> 00:37:31.250
much more effectively to
those kinds of things.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.320
Indeed, when I say we
are smarter than that,

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.490
human beings know.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:37.170
We have metacognitive principles
around these kinds of things,

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:37.670
right?

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.740
This knowledge is
in human minds,

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.390
what it might mean
for us to think

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:43.520
that a problem is tractable.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.110
What does that word mean, right?

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.910
Sometimes it means we have
the financial resources

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:48.326
or the technology
to carry it off.

00:37:48.326 --> 00:37:50.690
But often, it means we
have a well-posed problem.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.280
We don't know the
answer, but we know

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.609
what the answer needs to do.

00:37:53.609 --> 00:37:55.400
We know what the answer
needs to look like.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.120
We have criteria for
what would count.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.060
At least we have a precise
enough representation

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.880
of the problem to effectively
and efficiently guide

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.380
the search.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.880
And I think that's
the kind of thing

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.517
we would ideally like our
models and algorithms to have.

00:38:09.517 --> 00:38:11.600
At that point, we may have
to bounce around a lot.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:16.470
But we're bouncing in a
pretty well-defined space.

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.620
So to the degree
that this is true,

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.980
it actually explains a lot of
otherwise peculiar features

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.440
of human cognition.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.080
For instance, we
had this weird sense

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.900
that we're on the
right track, right?

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.450
Well, what does it mean
to be on the right track?

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:32.750
It surely doesn't mean you're
better at explaining the data,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.250
right?

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.905
You may be nowhere
close to having

00:38:34.905 --> 00:38:37.280
an answer that makes better
predictions or gets it right.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.350
But you're like, oh, that's
a really good idea, you know?

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.040
You get excited.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.540
Or you're like, no,
that's a non-answer.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.289
What does it mean?

00:38:42.289 --> 00:38:44.240
It might mean that
at least it fits

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.770
the abstract form of solution.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.540
If it were true, it might work.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.427
We can tell our students
in an undergraduate class

00:38:52.427 --> 00:38:54.260
that that was a great
idea even when we know

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.642
it's been disproven, right?

00:38:55.642 --> 00:38:56.600
So it's actually false.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.480
It doesn't explain.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.936
It's just not true.

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:01.060
We still think it's a great
idea in virtue of what?

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.590
Not it's fit to the data, right?

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.120
Not how well it's
predicting things.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.460
It's actually false
and still good.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.580
What could that
possibly mean, right?

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.780
It must mean there's
some other constraint

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:16.100
on hypothesis generation
that we are sensitive to.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.620
So I want to suggest that
there are actually two

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.587
constraints for our hypotheses.

00:39:20.587 --> 00:39:22.670
One is how well they fit
prior knowledge and data.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:23.960
That's the one we
know something about.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.400
That is, for instance, truth.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.900
But Stephen Colbert
in his infinite wisdom

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900
proposed something else.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.233
He said, well, we're also
sensitive to this thing called

00:39:32.233 --> 00:39:34.642
truthiness, right?

00:39:34.642 --> 00:39:36.350
You know, like how
good the story sounds,

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.266
how good the argument.

00:39:37.266 --> 00:39:39.290
And of course, in
politics, you know,

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:41.900
he makes massive and
effective fun of this.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.530
But I think this is a feature
of human cognition, not a bug.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.470
I think it is extremely
important that we can generate

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.930
ideas that are truthy, right?

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.730
Because they're plausible.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:53.600
They're interesting.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.570
They're informative.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.445
They tell good story.

00:39:55.445 --> 00:39:58.470
They may be false, but it
could be worse than false.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.912
It could be not even false.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:07.780
So I want to make an
important point here.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:12.400
Generating new ideas is not just
about Einstein versus Newton.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:19.810
And it's not about going from
an undifferentiated concept

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.420
of heat and temperature to
a modern scientific one.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.140
It's just about radical
conceptual change.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.800
This is the stuff of
ordinary everyday thought.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.900
It is our ability
to reliably make up

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:37.780
new relevant answers to
basically any ad hoc question.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.010
The answers may be trivial.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:40.510
They may be false.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.771
But they are genuinely new.

00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:44.020
And that we didn't have them
until we thought of them,

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.430
they're genuinely made up.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.552
We didn't learn them from
evidence or testimony.

00:40:47.552 --> 00:40:48.760
And they answer the question.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.230
They're not non-sequiturs.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.712
And I think this is important.

00:40:51.712 --> 00:40:53.170
And this is only
possible if we can

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:56.000
use the form of our
problems to guide search.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.430
So let me give you
a few examples.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:00.290
What's a good name
for a theater company?

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:01.210
None of you know.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.650
You haven't thought about
that problem before.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.025
But now you're
thinking about it.

00:41:04.025 --> 00:41:06.230
Well, what's a good name
for a theater company?

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.175
How do you get stripes
on peppermints?

00:41:08.175 --> 00:41:10.300
This is not a problem you
walked in thinking about.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.799
None of you are working on this
as your independent project.

00:41:12.799 --> 00:41:13.960
But you can think about it.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.880
And you already know
enough, knowing nothing

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.540
about theater and nothing about
peppermints maybe, to know what

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.310
the constraints,
what counts, right?

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.160
That's the kind of
information you already have.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.590
It's not prior knowledge
about theater companies

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:27.220
or peppermints.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.803
It's part knowledge about what's
going to work for a solution.

00:41:29.803 --> 00:41:32.910
So for instance, you know that
McDonald's is a nonstarter.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:36.340
And [INAUDIBLE] or whatever
is also not a good name

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.870
for a theater company.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:39.820
You know that getting
strips on peppermints

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.160
you don't want to do it
with a spatter [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.290
You don't want to just
spray things at it, right?

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:45.930
Because that wouldn't
even count as a solution.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.980
That's not the kind of
thing you're looking for.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.650
You're looking for something
more like fresh ink.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:51.160
It's new.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.730
It's novel.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:52.090
It's familiar.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:53.050
It makes some reference.

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.508
You're looking for something
more like a pendulum approach,

00:41:55.508 --> 00:41:58.599
which at least could
generate periodicity.

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:00.640
I'm sure they don't use
a pendulum to spray paint

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.600
peppermints.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.600
So are you.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.340
But it's not a
bad answer, right?

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.590
So is there any evidence
that kids can do this,

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:10.030
that information
contained in only

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:11.696
that strict form of
the problem can help

00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:13.824
learners converge on solutions?

00:42:13.824 --> 00:42:14.740
We wanted to find out.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.420
So I'm going to show a
little baby attempt to start

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.010
getting at this problem.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:22.390
We gave kids a machine.

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:26.890
And we gave kids some things
that could work the machine.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:31.390
And the machine had
two visual effects.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:34.520
You could make a ball appear to
flow up and down on that screen

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.020
there.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.340
Or you could make the
ball appear at the bottom

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.810
and then flash up
at the top, right?

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:39.502
Because we put a
computer behind, right?

00:42:39.502 --> 00:42:41.168
So woo, the ball is
moving continuously,

00:42:41.168 --> 00:42:42.820
or the ball is
moving discretely.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.410
And the affordance,
as you might note,

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.990
are also continuous
or discrete, right?

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:48.760
There's a rolly
ball, or there's this

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.042
peg that you can move back
and forth continuously.

00:42:51.042 --> 00:42:52.750
Or there's a peg you
can pull in and out,

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.180
or a drawer you can
pull in and out.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:59.860
So there's continuous and
discrete affordances and also

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.220
continuous and discrete effects.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:04.080
So we also had an auditory
tone that varied continuously

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.340
and an auditory tone that
went from high to low.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.600
Everyone got it?

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:14.301
And we just showed the
children all the parts

00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:15.550
that connected to the machine.

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.429
And then we showed
the kids the effects,

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:19.720
but we had hid the affordances.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.510
And we said, well, which
part made the ball go?

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.980
And we asked them either
about the visual or auditory

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.480
affordance?

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.140
They'd seen no covariation
data, prior knowledge- you know,

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.560
agnostic about all of this.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.270
And the question
is, well, would they

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:33.970
say, well, I'm trying
to solve a problem

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:36.980
about a continuous effect.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.430
I should use a
continuous affordance.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:42.010
I'm trying to solve a problem
about a discrete effect.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.201
I should use a
discrete affordance.

00:43:44.201 --> 00:43:46.450
Would they use something
about the form of the problem

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:52.280
to answer the solution if they
knew nothing else about it?

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.640
So there's no fact of
the matter here, right?

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.210
Because, obviously, we're not
using either of these really.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:00.880
But the prediction was
that they would indeed

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.190
make this kind of mapping.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.720
And they did so.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.349
Now, what you might worry
about was that, well,

00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:09.640
there is no fact of the matter.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.710
So they're just doing some kind
of cross-modal mapping, right?

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.330
If you don't have a way
to answer the problem,

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.430
they're just saying
something like, well, you

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.680
know, this has this
property, so does this.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.982
Let me go ahead and make a
mapping from one to the other.

00:44:20.982 --> 00:44:22.690
It's a weird kind of
cross-modal mapping.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.273
Because, usually,
you integrate things

00:44:24.273 --> 00:44:27.010
that are in a single stimulus
actually contained together,

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:28.485
like the sound of
a ball dropping

00:44:28.485 --> 00:44:29.860
and the sight of
a ball dropping,

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.950
not two different things.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:33.640
But maybe it's something
kind of like that.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.449
So if they're actually
using the form of a problem,

00:44:36.449 --> 00:44:37.990
then if you change
the problems, they

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.830
should generate
different solutions.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:45.170
So what we did in the second
experiment is we said--

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:46.550
oh.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.426
Yeah.

00:44:47.426 --> 00:44:49.300
So what we did here is
we showed the children

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.510
the continuous visual
stimuli, and then we

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:55.731
asked them to generate the
continuous auditory stimuli.

00:44:55.731 --> 00:44:56.230
OK.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:58.210
So all of these
are now continuous.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:00.770
They could still just go ahead
and make the continuous map.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:03.140
But if you represent the
problem as changing from visual

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.210
to audition, that feels like
a discrete problem, right?

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.040
You're completely
changing modalities.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.870
So now at this case,
you might expect

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.284
the kids to resist making
just the continuous mapping

00:45:13.284 --> 00:45:15.450
if they're using something
about the kind of problem

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:17.783
they have to constrain how
they search for the solution.

00:45:17.783 --> 00:45:20.200
Now, again, there's no
real right answer here.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.070
But what you see is the
kids shifted their responses

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.460
in response to this.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.300
So this is just a
tiny bit of suggestion

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.150
that when there's no
differentiating prior knowledge

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:32.362
and there's no
differentiating evidence,

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:34.320
children take into account
what kind of problem

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.980
they're trying to solve,
and what the information is,

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.280
and the problem itself that
can help constrain their search

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.756
for a solution.

00:45:42.756 --> 00:45:44.880
I'm going to give you
another example for some more

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.520
recent work by Pedro
Tsividis in our lab.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:54.060
He varied the
dynamics of a scene.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.550
He had here some bugs.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.530
And in one scene,
those bugs in green,

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.930
they varied periodically.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.990
So they just went from
having very few spots

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:05.730
to having a whole lot
of spots to having

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.670
a very few spots to having
a whole lot of spots, right?

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:10.590
That's what these green bugs do.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.980
And the other bugs just
got faster over time.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.480
So those longer
vectors are supposed

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.476
to be indicating the bugs are
getting faster continuously.

00:46:18.476 --> 00:46:19.850
And then he said,
well, you know,

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.330
here are some bugs
in these rooms.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.280
And I have two kinds
of lights in the room.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.410
One set of lights looks
like those on top.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:28.170
The other set of lights looks
like those on the bottom.

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.180
Can you tell me which lights
are responsible for the behavior

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:31.770
of which bugs?

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:34.540
Again, a sort of very
similar kind of problem.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:37.050
No fact to the matter that
if children can represent

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.150
something about the
abstract form of the problem

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.850
and use that to constrain
their search for the solution,

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.880
then the periodic lights should
reflect the periodic change

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.280
in the bug's behavior.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.690
The continuous light should
reflect the continuous change

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:49.410
in the bug's behavior.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.951
We are, of course, not using
the words periodic or continuous

00:46:51.951 --> 00:46:53.490
with us or anything like that.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.014
They have to pull
that out and say,

00:46:55.014 --> 00:46:56.430
this is the kind
of problem it is.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.860
This is a feature of
a possible solution.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.660
Let's go ahead and
make that mapping.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:06.864
And indeed, the kids are
doing that well above chance.

00:47:06.864 --> 00:47:08.280
And obviously, in
this case, we're

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.170
giving the kids some
possible solutions.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.880
They're not generating
it whole cloth.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.440
But minimally, it's
a different way

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.960
of thinking about
problems and search.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.660
They're not using most of
our sort of traditional ways

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:19.470
of figuring it out.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.719
They're just using something
about the kind of problem

00:47:21.719 --> 00:47:23.820
they have and what's
available in the problem

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.560
to help sort out the solution.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.290
So is this analogical
reasoning, right?

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.480
It feels kind of an analogy.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.520
But it's a funny
kind of analogy.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.290
Because what it
isn't is a mapping

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:38.190
between a known problem and a
known solution to a new problem

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.110
and a new solution.

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:43.170
It's rather a mapping
from the kind of problem

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:46.050
you have to the kind
of solution you have.

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:48.460
It's using, again, the
problem or the query itself

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.140
as your friend.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.860
It has information in it about
how it wants to be solved.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.610
How are you going to
use that to solve it?

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.620
And, again, the
virtue being that

00:47:55.620 --> 00:48:00.960
even if your answer is wrong,
if it were true, it would work.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.970
So the argument
also, of course, is

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:05.940
that this applies to any
possible goal we might have

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.640
including those cases where
it's just not at all obvious how

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.420
an analogy would apply.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.996
So what is a good name for
a theater company, right?

00:48:12.996 --> 00:48:14.370
You're using
something about what

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:17.255
would count as a solution to
constraint something about what

00:48:17.255 --> 00:48:18.630
you think would
be a good answer.

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.870
But there's not an easy
way to tell that story

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:24.720
as analogical reasoning.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.670
So their argument
is children seem

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:30.290
to have data independent
criteria for the evaluation

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:31.470
of hypotheses.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.110
And these criteria extend beyond
simplicity, grammaticality,

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.630
or compatibility
with prior knowledge.

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:40.440
They consider the extent to
which a hypothesis fulfills

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.900
the abstract goals of a
solution of a problem,

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.350
not just the degree to
which it fits the data.

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:49.920
And I will suggest that
this is maybe deeply part

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.055
of an important mystery
of human cognition, which

00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:54.806
is-- our most powerful learners
spend a lot of their time

00:48:54.806 --> 00:48:57.180
doing something that has defied
most of our best attempts

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.900
to explain it, which is
they've spent a lot of time,

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.060
many hours a day, just
pretending and making up

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.480
stories.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.580
Stories have some
interesting properties.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.590
They do not have
to be true, right?

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:13.010
They don't have to fit
the world or fit the data.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:16.370
But they do have to set up
a problem and a solution

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:18.110
that, if true, would
solve the problem.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:19.360
Most of play has that.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.220
It is not at all obvious why
you would think it was important

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:25.190
that you want to balance a
twisty on the top of the candle

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.220
stick in order to
shoot pee through it.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.575
But it's a problem.

00:49:29.575 --> 00:49:30.200
And guess what?

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.600
If you can set up the problem
and find the solution,

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.437
you've just accessed a
really important ability

00:49:35.437 --> 00:49:37.520
about setting up problems
and setting up solutions

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.730
that, if they worked, would
solve that kind of problem.

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:42.230
And, of course,
imagination, most

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:44.120
of our narratives,
most of our fictions,

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.800
have at least those
sets of properties.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.778
So I'm going to go
ahead and stop there.

00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:55.222
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:55.222 --> 00:49:55.930
TOMER ULLMAN: OK.

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.346
So if you remember the structure
we said at the beginning,

00:49:58.346 --> 00:50:00.280
there will now be
a short rebuttal.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.560
And then Laura will give
an even shorter summary,

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.020
and then the free for all.

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.610
So most of you are probably
thinking all sorts of ways

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:07.510
that Laura is wrong.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.250
But wait, let me get
through it first,

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:12.240
and then see if I
didn't cover something.

00:50:14.697 --> 00:50:16.780
But, actually, my response
to this, to all of what

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:21.280
Laura's said, is not you're
wrong, but you're right.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.689
So you're right, Laura.

00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:23.230
You're right.

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.771
Other people in the audience
who think that stochastic search

00:50:25.771 --> 00:50:26.315
by itself--

00:50:26.315 --> 00:50:28.440
if you have some sort of
infinite theory space that

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.481
was supposed to account
for all possible problems

00:50:30.481 --> 00:50:32.410
and for any new
problem what you did

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.630
was to just completely
at random try

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:38.020
to search through that space
anew, then that wouldn't work--

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:38.696
that's fine.

00:50:38.696 --> 00:50:40.570
And I agree that there's
something inherently

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.736
wrong about an algorithm
that can take some problem,

00:50:42.736 --> 00:50:44.950
like why these two blocks
are sticking together,

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.410
and say, well, maybe it's
because the moon is bigger

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:49.260
than a piece of cheese, right?

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:52.890
Like, as Laura said, it just
seems like it's not even wrong.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:55.420
Or maybe it's because people
have more than two children

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.140
on average.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:56.806
No.

00:50:56.806 --> 00:50:58.180
And there's also
something wrong.

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.942
Laura didn't quite get to this
or maybe not emphasize it.

00:51:00.942 --> 00:51:02.650
But she emphasizes it
sometimes, which is

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:04.222
there's something wrong about--

00:51:04.222 --> 00:51:06.180
well, she did a little,
but-- an algorithm that

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.035
makes sort of dumb proposals.

00:51:08.035 --> 00:51:10.120
Dumb proposals of
all sorts of things--

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.480
things like you try to explain
something in theory space,

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.290
and you say, well, maybe it's
because of X. And you check it,

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:19.000
and it's not X. And you
say, oh well, oh well.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.521
Maybe it's because of X, right?

00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:24.520
There's something wrong
about stochastic search.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.990
Although, I have to say, Laura,
you have an eight-year-old.

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:29.020
And, you know, when we gave this
first, I had a two-year-old.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:31.420
And I actually think maybe
it's X, maybe it's X,

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:35.192
maybe it's X is not such
a crazy way of describing

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:36.400
what two-year-olds are doing.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.396
LAURA SCHULZ: Well, [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:37.396 --> 00:51:39.390
So, you know, like,
what if there's noise?

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:40.181
TOMER ULLMAN: Yeah.

00:51:40.181 --> 00:51:41.850
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:42.580
OK.

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.980
But I do want to give
an actual response.

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:50.700
So, you know, I think I have
some responses for Laura.

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.200
And these are responses that,
importantly, you know, they'll

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.460
try to address what
Laura is saying.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.840
They'll try to take
it into account.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.390
They'll try to give new answers
to it that will importantly

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:00.160
leave her unhappy.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.400
So what I'm going to try
to do is take a page out

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.980
of Hannibal Barca at the Battle
of Cannae and try to envelop.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:12.652
So I'm going to highlight
of work by other people.

00:52:12.652 --> 00:52:14.860
From one direction is work
by Steve Piantadosi, which

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:17.020
is about making these, you
know, algorithmic search part

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.520
of the problem,
whether it's too slow,

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.990
students are wandering
around the halls

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:21.750
doing nothing waiting
for it to converge.

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:24.477
What if we just did it
really, really fast?

00:52:24.477 --> 00:52:26.060
Another way to address
this is to say,

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.580
what if we made
actually good proposals?

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:27.790
OK.

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:30.460
The problem of making proposals
that are just ridiculous-- what

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.085
if we made proposals
that actually take

00:52:32.085 --> 00:52:33.810
the data into
account a little bit

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:36.351
or the previous data, the stuff
that we're trying to explain?

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:41.782
Another way to address
what Laura is saying

00:52:41.782 --> 00:52:43.990
is to say, well, maybe we
can make better primitives.

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:46.840
And better primitives mean that
your search space is actually

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:51.580
more confined to the
right sort of things.

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.430
And finally, I'm going to
highlight some new thoughts

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:58.600
by myself about ad hoc spaces
and how we might construct them

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.690
to get at this
problem of this thing,

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:04.500
like how would you come up with
a new name for theater company

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.380
or a name for a new
theater company?

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:06.970
So I'll go through
these somewhat fast.

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.860
You're welcome to come and
talk about any of them.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.359
And I'll point you
to the people who

00:53:10.359 --> 00:53:13.540
are actually doing the work,
which I've said before.

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.610
So let's see.

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:16.030
This is just sort
of the rebuttal.

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:18.010
One of the rebuttals
is to say, well, here's

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:20.890
this work by Steve Piantadosi,
which is, you know,

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.560
introspection is really
actually a poor guide.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:27.610
So when [INAUDIBLE] was giving
that beautiful example of cell

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.744
phones, why you have to
shut them off on airplanes,

00:53:29.744 --> 00:53:31.660
you say, oh, and she
came up with this example

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.620
that it's not true.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.890
But if it were true,
it would be nice.

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:38.492
Well, maybe she went through
a billion other things

00:53:38.492 --> 00:53:39.700
before she came up with that?

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.350
Laura's like, she
did it like that.

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:43.960
But we don't have a good sense
for what is actually fast,

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.940
what is actually slow.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.330
And there might be a case where
we don't actually introspect

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:51.175
about a lot of things.

00:53:51.175 --> 00:53:53.110
The things that bubble
up into consciousness

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:54.970
that you might actually
accept or reject

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:56.920
rely on actually a
ton of other proposals

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.334
that they don't even bubble
up into introspection

00:53:59.334 --> 00:54:01.000
that you're making
very quickly and just

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.920
rejecting even before that.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.140
And Steve came up with this
really interesting way.

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.140
You guys have probably
heard about deep learning

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.650
and the sort of
the GPU revolution

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:11.000
for deep learning
and things like that.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.720
So the point is if
instead of we use

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.220
CPUs we would use
graphical processing units,

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.060
then we can make stochastic
search algorithms in parallel

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:19.890
in some cases.

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:21.514
And once you can make
them in parallel,

00:54:21.514 --> 00:54:22.810
then you can put them on a GPU.

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:24.400
And once you put
them on a GPU, a GPU

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.154
is sort of a way
of taking something

00:54:26.154 --> 00:54:27.320
that's supposed to be a CPU.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.900
And instead of
having a CPU that can

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.370
do something sort of
complicated on a sort of task,

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:34.630
you can do a lot of really
simple tasks in parallel

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:35.380
very fast.

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.110
So if you could
make that proposal,

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.007
that thing I said
before-- take a theory,

00:54:39.007 --> 00:54:40.840
make a change to it--
if you could make that

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.060
into the sort of thing that
you could put on a GPU,

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.920
then you can make a
ton of those proposals

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.530
very quickly in parallel.

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.280
And that's sort of
what he figured out how

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.750
to do for a bunch of spaces.

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:51.280
It's much faster than the CPU.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.530
And the main advantage is
that it's also much cheaper.

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:55.612
And you can cram a
whole bunch of together.

00:54:55.612 --> 00:54:57.070
And you can get to
something like--

00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:58.000
I forget the exact numbers.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.010
You can make like a million
of these theories proposals

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:00.550
a second.

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.090
And that's just with
today's technology, right?

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:04.210
We don't know what's
coming around the corner

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:06.100
a few years from now.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.242
You know, Steve plus
GPUs is awesome.

00:55:08.242 --> 00:55:10.450
And you could think of it
like these various problems

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.310
like you're trying to fit these
data points on the bottom.

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:13.264
Can people see that?

00:55:13.264 --> 00:55:14.680
This is sort of a
classic problem.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.430
You have some data points.

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:17.020
You're trying to fit
a polynomial to it.

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:19.240
And you're trying to say,
well, how will we do that?

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.970
The truth is there's a lot of
very clever ways of doing that.

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:23.344
But let's assume
that you're even

00:55:23.344 --> 00:55:25.469
doing random search
in polynomial space--

00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:27.010
not the sort of
thing you want to do.

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:28.340
Those of you who have
been to the tutorial,

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.227
I mentioned that if you
have an actual better

00:55:30.227 --> 00:55:32.560
way than stochastic search,
you should probably do that.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.730
But suppose you
didn't know and you

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.021
wanted to do stochastic search.

00:55:35.021 --> 00:55:37.330
You could still do a
million moves a second

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:39.800
and quickly converge on
something like that line

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.461
that you see.

00:55:40.461 --> 00:55:40.960
OK.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.876
And that line is actually
taken from, I think,

00:55:42.876 --> 00:55:45.430
Galileo Galilei's data for
how things slide on a hill.

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:47.810
I'm not Galileo Galilei
sat around and said,

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:49.976
maybe it's x to the square,
maybe it's x to the 2.1,

00:55:49.976 --> 00:55:51.900
maybe it's x to the 2.3,
maybe it's x to the 2.1,

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.170
maybe it's x to the
2, and then finally

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:55.044
converged like after a
million moves to that.

00:55:55.044 --> 00:55:56.960
That's not exactly
scientific discovery.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.420
But for a lot of
everyday thinking,

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.530
you might actually be
proposing things very fast

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:01.651
and rejecting them.

00:56:01.651 --> 00:56:02.150
OK.

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:03.240
That's Steve.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.610
Some things from Owen Lewis
about making maybe smarter

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:08.110
proposals-- and this gets at
that point of, like, maybe it's

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:09.000
an x, maybe not.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.620
So I suppose that I'm trying
to teach you a concept.

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:12.220
OK.

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.630
I'm trying to teach you
a particular concept.

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:15.280
I'm going to give you
some positive examples

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:15.920
of the concept.

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:16.170
OK?

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:17.710
This is the sort of thing
that psychologists really

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:18.580
like to study.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.120
OK?

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.190
So this is a room--

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.750
no, Roomba's an actual thing.

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.770
Blick gets overused.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:26.050
Can someone give
me a nonsense term?

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:26.960
This is a Jabberwock.

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.460
OK?

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:28.330
This is a Jabberwock.

00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:30.580
I'm going to give you another
example of a Jabberwock.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.500
Who thinks they know
what Jabberwocks are?

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.334
You have some sense of
what a Jabberwock is?

00:56:34.334 --> 00:56:34.833
OK.

00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:36.130
Huh, that's also a Jabberwock.

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:37.090
Wait a minute.

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:38.170
OK.

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:40.440
The sense that I had for
maybe what a Jabberwock is

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.717
is maybe not that great.

00:56:41.717 --> 00:56:42.550
That's a Jabberwock.

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:43.383
That's a Jabberwock.

00:56:43.383 --> 00:56:44.230
That's a Jabberwock.

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:45.130
That's a Jabberwock.

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:45.644
OK.

00:56:45.644 --> 00:56:47.560
And you might think at
this point, well, fine.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:51.100
Jabberwocks are either squares
of any color or red circles.

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.600
Or maybe they're
squares or circles.

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.474
I don't know exactly.

00:56:53.474 --> 00:56:55.300
You're building up
some sort of theory

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.040
for that concept,
which can be described

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:00.310
in something like a grammar
for your current hypothesis.

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:02.110
You might say it's
either a red circle,

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:03.770
or it's the square of any color.

00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:04.270
OK.

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.394
And that's sort of your
grammar for these concepts.

00:57:06.394 --> 00:57:09.897
And now you could sort of
change that grammar, right?

00:57:09.897 --> 00:57:11.980
You could sort of excise
these nodes and that tree

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.370
to come up with new things.

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:15.286
Why would you want to
come up with new things?

00:57:15.286 --> 00:57:16.820
Because, look,
that's a Jabberwock.

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:17.080
OK.

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.329
I just gave you a new example.

00:57:18.329 --> 00:57:19.970
It's something you
didn't know before.

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:21.280
It's sort of confounding
with your theory.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.350
You have to come up with
a new theory on the fly.

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:23.860
OK?

00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:26.489
Theory-- again, used in a
very, very minimal sense here.

00:57:26.489 --> 00:57:28.780
But if you accept that this
is something like a theory,

00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.640
you have to come up with a
new theory for explaining

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.800
why that's a Jabberwock and all
the other things that you've

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.790
seen are Jabberwocks.

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:34.615
What is a bad idea?

00:57:34.615 --> 00:57:39.477
A bad idea is to just cut
and generate randomly, right?

00:57:39.477 --> 00:57:41.685
You might come up with
something like it's a triangle

00:57:41.685 --> 00:57:42.643
or something like that.

00:57:42.643 --> 00:57:45.241
But you might come up with,
well, maybe it's a square.

00:57:45.241 --> 00:57:46.240
No, we already did that.

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.520
Well, maybe it's, you
know, just triangles.

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.870
Maybe it's just a square.

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:51.340
Like, you could
spend all this time

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:54.250
not taking into account your
previous theory and the fact

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:56.080
that your new
example had something

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.260
to do with triangles, something
to do with red triangles.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.450
You want to be able to
make proposals that take

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:04.520
into account this new data.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.610
Does everyone understand
what the problem

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:07.754
we're trying to get at is?

00:58:07.754 --> 00:58:10.420
So what Owen has done is to sort
of take these stochastic search

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.711
algorithms and say, if you
get a new piece of data that

00:58:12.711 --> 00:58:15.190
contradicts, that sort of
interferes with what you had

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:16.960
before, how would
you make proposals

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.390
that must take into
account this new data?

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:21.100
I'm going to recut and generate.

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.750
But I'm going to
identify the places

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:25.210
in my theory that would take
into account this new piece

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:25.750
of data.

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:27.970
And I'm going to make
smarter proposals.

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:29.200
They might still be wrong.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.492
And there's better and
worse ways of doing this.

00:58:31.492 --> 00:58:33.700
It's still going to be a
randomized search and theory

00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:34.199
space.

00:58:34.199 --> 00:58:37.140
But it's at least going to take
into account this new data.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.132
OK.

00:58:38.132 --> 00:58:40.090
And that's just-- I'm
afraid I don't have time.

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:40.860
But, look, it works.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.340
And it's much better
than just bouncing around

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.560
completely around random
as you might guess.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.850
Another response, this
work by Eyal Dechter.

00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:51.200
Let me skip over this
for a little bit.

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.290
This is work Eyal
Dechter, which is to say,

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:55.701
what if you wanted to use
better and better primitives?

00:58:55.701 --> 00:58:56.200
OK.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.699
So before we have this notion
of you're just bouncing around

00:58:58.699 --> 00:59:01.152
in theory space, you're
making all sorts of notions,

00:59:01.152 --> 00:59:02.110
let me put it this way.

00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:03.910
Suppose that you're searching
through the entire space

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:04.690
of programs.

00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:05.257
OK?

00:59:05.257 --> 00:59:07.090
And the only thing that
you had to work with

00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.381
is something like that lambda
expression before, right?

00:59:09.381 --> 00:59:12.340
You didn't have the notion of
plus, minus, multiplication,

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.741
sine waves, things like that.

00:59:13.741 --> 00:59:16.240
And you're trying to figure out
something about an equation.

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.260
And you work through it.

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:18.510
And there's a way of doing it.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:20.385
There's a way of, like,
generating functions

00:59:20.385 --> 00:59:21.760
that rely on other
functions that

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.093
rely on other functions in
the complicated way that will

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:25.510
give you the plus function.

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:26.140
OK?

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:26.840
And you do that.

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.690
And then you generate a lot.

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:30.070
And you somehow manage to
find out the sinus function.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:31.944
And you finally figure
out that this function

00:59:31.944 --> 00:59:35.841
you're trying to describe
is sinus x plus sinus y.

00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:37.090
Let's say something like that.

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:37.300
OK?

00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:38.480
The exact example
doesn't matter.

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.870
But you worked really hard,
and you figured that out.

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:42.319
Now, you get a new example.

00:59:42.319 --> 00:59:44.110
And underneath the
hood, it's actually just

00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:45.610
sinus x minus sinus y.

00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:48.855
Or let's say it's sinus y plus
sinus z or something like that.

00:59:48.855 --> 00:59:50.230
And now you start
all over again.

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.770
You're like, fine.

00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:52.630
OK, lambda something,
something, something.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:54.963
Like, if you could only use
the fact that you've already

00:59:54.963 --> 00:59:56.770
discovered the sign
function, you've

00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:59.170
already discovered plus and
minus and things like that,

00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:01.990
and now when you come to try
and explain a new problem,

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:04.250
you actually have a lot
of previous knowledge.

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:04.750
OK?

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:06.550
So when you're trying to
describe why airplanes take off

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:07.480
and how they do
that, you're actually

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.110
going to rely on
previous knowledge.

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.318
You're not going to search
through your entire theory

01:00:11.318 --> 01:00:12.820
space starting from nowhere.

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:14.530
You're going to
rely on primitives

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:16.146
before that have been useful.

01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:18.145
So you might notice that
actually plus and minus

01:00:18.145 --> 01:00:21.520
and sines and things like that
and cosine and exponentiation

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.690
are really useful.

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:24.580
Let's save those as primitives.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.010
So that next time that we make
random proposals in theory

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:29.530
space, you can think
of it of making

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:32.210
like a whole bunch of moves
at once that were useful.

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.710
OK.

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:34.210
Like, a whole bunch
of stuff at once

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:36.564
that was useful that
shows up all the time--

01:00:36.564 --> 01:00:37.730
you want to make that again.

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:38.230
OK?

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:40.300
So I try that, for example.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.269
And the examples that we
gave in theory space--

01:00:42.269 --> 01:00:44.560
like you might find out that
actually a lot of theories

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.710
use transitivity, or a lot of
theories use reflection, right?

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:50.320
In the particular magnet
case, if X attracts Y,

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.460
then Y will attract
X, in general,

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:55.210
the law of if X
blahs Y, then Y will

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:57.940
blah X, that turns out to be
useful in a lot of domains

01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.920
if only there was a way
of reusing them, right?

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.000
There is.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.130
And what Eyal was doing
was to basically use

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.990
an explanation compression
algorithm, the EC algorithm.

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:08.692
And what it does is it tries
to encapsulate useful concepts.

01:01:08.692 --> 01:01:10.400
And he used it on a
whole bunch of stuff.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.941
One of the nice
domains he used it on

01:01:11.941 --> 01:01:13.720
was these circuit diagrams.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.320
Have any of you actually had
to solve circuit diagrams?

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.080
This is the sort of stuff
that people at MIT do.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.737
You're given a particular
input-output function.

01:01:21.737 --> 01:01:23.320
And again, like I
said, under the hood

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.750
it might be something like
you're just told something

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:27.820
like here's X and Y, OK?

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.520
X and Y can each be 1 or 0.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.100
OK?

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.730
And now I'm going to give you
combinations of values of X

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:35.240
and Y and what that spits out.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:35.740
OK.

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.870
So X and Y are both 1--

01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:38.920
light turns on.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.270
X and Y are both 0--

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:41.050
light turns on.

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:43.580
X is 1, Y is 0--
light turns off.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.080
OK.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.930
And you're trying to find
out some sort of circuit that

01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:50.020
will explain this behavior,
some sort of combination logic

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.660
gates, like ANDs and ORs and
NANDs and things like that.

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:55.160
OK?

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.659
Do people sort of understand
the problem for these circuits?

01:01:57.659 --> 01:02:00.580
And you can get a long list of
things, X, Y, Z, T, some sort

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.610
of complicated behavior.

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:03.160
You might not even
get the full behavior.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.320
And you're trying to find
sort of the minimal set

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.830
of logical predicates, or
in this case circuits, that

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:09.380
will explain that behavior.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.620
And now suppose
that you only have

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:14.220
the gate NAND to work with.

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.083
Do people know what NAND is?

01:02:16.083 --> 01:02:16.927
OK.

01:02:16.927 --> 01:02:18.010
It's a sort of logic gate.

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:20.680
It's a very simple logic
gate that you can build up

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.300
all the other logic gates from.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.790
But it will take you a while
to build up AND from NAND or OR

01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:26.290
from NAND.

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:27.340
But you can do it.

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.620
And so what he did was,
and his colleagues, they

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.394
started out sort of
giving this algorithm

01:02:31.394 --> 01:02:32.560
a lot of different problems.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.184
Like, here's a bunch of circuit
diagrams that you need to solve

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:37.810
or circuit problems that you
need to find the diagram for.

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:40.120
What the algorithm was
doing was that each time it

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.850
solved a problem
or set of problems,

01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:44.350
it would go back and look,
huh, which parts of this

01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:46.120
can I encapsulate, right?

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.340
Which parts of this can
I sort of use again?

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.140
I can carve off a chunk of
something that was useful.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.640
And now, when I
make a new proposal,

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.230
I'm not going to say put a
NAND here or a NAND there.

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:58.750
Stochastically, I'm going to
sort of put in a whole chunk

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:00.140
that I've already used before.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:00.640
OK?

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.598
I'm going to sort of call
that a new primitive.

01:03:02.598 --> 01:03:04.500
Cut out this part of the space.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.000
Under the hood, it's actually
an AND or something like that.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.130
And discover-- so
discover is not an AND.

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:10.866
And discover is this
really useful thing

01:03:10.866 --> 01:03:13.240
that they called E2, which
doesn't appear in logic books.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.070
But it turns out to be really
useful for certain diagrams,

01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:18.910
which is take an input,
split it into two,

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:21.790
do something on this part,
do something on that part,

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:22.860
and recombine it.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.610
It turns out to be a
hugely useful concept

01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:25.540
for circuit diagrams.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:26.950
And this thing discovers it.

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.500
And once it discovers
it, it sort of reuses it.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.020
And what that does is it turns
an infinite and unmanageable

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.401
space into infinite, but
a bit more manageable.

01:03:34.401 --> 01:03:34.900
OK?

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.069
So your space is infinite.

01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:38.110
You're not going to search
the full length of it.

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:40.600
Imagine that this is a space
of all possible programs.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.610
As you go down, the
programs get way too long.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.090
You're never going
to reach them.

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:45.530
But some of them
are really good.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:46.720
Some of them are really
good explanations.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.250
And the only way
to get to them is

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:50.020
if you had some sort
of way of chunking

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:52.990
the problem, of saying, yes,
it looks like a long program.

01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:56.020
But actually half of it
I've already used before

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.310
to solve a different thing.

01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:00.511
And half of it is less
long than two times.

01:04:00.511 --> 01:04:02.260
So you might discover,
you know, you might

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.430
have an effective search area.

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:05.513
You find out all the
problems you can solve there.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:13.210
Yeah, this is an interesting
thing, choice color.

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:15.730
So imagine that of this
blue thing over here

01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:18.290
is describing, within the
space of all possible programs,

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:20.440
the sort of programs
that you want to find.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.870
So there's the
effective search area.

01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:25.030
They only cover part
of this blue thing.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:26.696
You can think of it
like the probability

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:27.860
is really high over there.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.680
You really want to
find all of them.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.480
But by searching
that small space

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.180
and, within that small space,
finding the right primitives

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.490
and encapsulating them,
you can now actually

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:38.652
search more efficiently
the rest of the space.

01:04:38.652 --> 01:04:41.110
And the rest of the space sort
of compresses and compresses

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.594
until it's all within your
effective search area.

01:04:43.594 --> 01:04:45.010
Do people sort of
understand that?

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:46.270
It's sort of there
were long programs

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:48.010
before that you never
would have gotten to.

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:49.480
But by searching
these small spaces

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.021
that you could search
through before,

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:52.840
discovering the
useful parts there,

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.369
these new things that
seem really long before

01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:56.160
are actually short.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.180
Because they can be described
by just a few chunks.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:00.024
OK?

01:05:00.024 --> 01:05:01.440
This is a really
interesting work.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.240
And I encourage you
all to read it, those

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.620
of you who find it interesting.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.370
The last thing I'm going to
do-- and then that'll leaves 10

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.184
minutes to discussion,
which is great--

01:05:08.184 --> 01:05:09.600
is this problem
that I guess maybe

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.160
it's really the heart of
what Laura is getting at.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.020
I think she was not satisfied
by any of these things.

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.790
And she was sort of pointing
out, well, fine, you

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:16.373
can do stochastic
search all you want.

01:05:16.373 --> 01:05:19.020
But the really hard problem is
constructing the space itself

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.750
on the fly.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.500
You're not going to
use one infinite space

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.583
for all possible problems.

01:05:23.583 --> 01:05:26.432
You're going to use the right
spaces for the right problem.

01:05:26.432 --> 01:05:27.390
And how do you do that?

01:05:30.234 --> 01:05:32.400
In this case, we're going
to do, give me a good name

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.211
for a romantic drama.

01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:34.710
All right.

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:37.270
And your search space is going
to be imagined that-- can

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:38.520
people see sort of the border?

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.656
Like, there's this whole
space of uselessness.

01:05:40.656 --> 01:05:42.030
And what you really
want to do is

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:44.460
focus in on that tiny
part of useful things.

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.920
If only there was a
way of just on the fly,

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.690
you know, zooming
in on that thing

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:50.485
and then bouncing
around in that.

01:05:50.485 --> 01:05:53.910
And the point is to say, well,
when we construct the space,

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:55.424
we can just use
previous examples.

01:05:55.424 --> 01:05:57.090
I don't think it's
the case that we just

01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:59.071
knew something
necessarily completely

01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:00.695
new in these sort of
everyday thinking.

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:01.280
Well, maybe.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.030
We can argue about
that in the discussion.

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:04.863
What you actually start
out with is actually

01:06:04.863 --> 01:06:07.800
taking a few examples that
you find relevant in some way

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.940
and using those examples
to then construct

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.564
your space on the fly, right?

01:06:12.564 --> 01:06:13.980
You might think
about things like,

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.950
what other romantic dramas
do I remember in the past?

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:18.220
What do they share in common?

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.670
What movie names do I
know of in the past--

01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:22.830
quickly finding the sort
of relevant thing for all

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:25.082
these things, and then
having the space for those,

01:06:25.082 --> 01:06:26.790
and then searching
around stochastically.

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:29.010
Because you're not going to do
better than stochastic search.

01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:31.385
There will come a point where
you're just bouncing around

01:06:31.385 --> 01:06:32.370
at random.

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:35.509
So I used this actually, forgive
me, a paper title for SRCD

01:06:35.509 --> 01:06:37.050
and came up with
some amusing things.

01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:39.460
You guys can play with
that online if you want.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:42.699
But let's do, give me a good
name for a new romantic drama.

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:45.240
So as I said, what you would do
is you would just think about

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.650
all the romantic dramas that
you know, like The Climbers,

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:51.150
Christine of The Big Tops,
Cupid's-- these are all actual

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:53.460
romantic dramas pulled
off of Wikipedia--

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.380
then use those to
construct your space.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.310
Don't care about all the things
that could happen in the world.

01:06:58.310 --> 01:06:58.830
OK?

01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:00.150
And what do we mean
construct your space?

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:01.600
Well, there's a bunch of
ways to look the space.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.660
What ideally we would
want and what I didn't do,

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.550
but what we're thinking
of, is to construct

01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:07.320
a very, very simple
grammar which

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.695
instead of all
possible sentences

01:07:08.695 --> 01:07:10.890
is a grammar for movie titles.

01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:14.260
And this grammar usually tends
to generate things like the,

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:14.760
right?

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.990
The something something.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.950
And [AUDIO OUT] long.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:17.940
And then it just stops.

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:18.540
OK?

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.831
And it turns out that something
like the adjective noun

01:07:20.831 --> 01:07:23.010
is a really good way of
generating names for pubs--

01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:26.490
The White Queen, The Blond
Tiger, The Bleeding Bottle,

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:29.470
I don't know, something.

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:30.040
Right?

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.500
That's really useful if
only it could do that.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.100
If it could construct
these tiny grammars,

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.183
it'll still give you an
infinite number of things.

01:07:35.183 --> 01:07:37.350
But, you know,
[AUDIO OUT] movie names.

01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:40.440
Or things like
verbing proper name

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.350
turns out to be a really good
thing for like, you know,

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:47.790
Amy Stopping,
Interrupting Timmy.

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:49.820
It's so bad.

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:52.170
And you could find that from
looking at these things.

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:54.150
And just to show
you how much I think

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:58.540
that this is, you know, actually
not that bad of a problem,

01:07:58.540 --> 01:07:59.850
I did not this grammar thing.

01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:01.890
I did something
even simpler, which

01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:04.530
is to take all the other names
that I could find on Wikipedia

01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:07.900
for different movie genres
throughout the ages,

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.940
and then I looked at things
like romantic dramas.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.770
And what I did was construct
a very simple n-gram which

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:16.020
just takes those words
and just sort of does

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.000
random walk on those words.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:18.810
OK?

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:21.233
And you could imagine
complicating this immediately

01:08:21.233 --> 01:08:22.649
by taking something
like embedding

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:24.120
those words in the
high-dimensional space

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.880
and actually picking words
that aren't close to that.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.750
So you could get new words that
were never in there before.

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:28.875
I'm not even doing that.

01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:30.500
I'm doing something
ridiculously simple

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.999
that I don't think
people are doing.

01:08:31.999 --> 01:08:34.710
But let me show you
how reasonable it is.

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:35.220
OK?

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.109
And what I'm going
to compare it to

01:08:37.109 --> 01:08:39.410
is some stuff that we ask
people on Mechanical Turk

01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:41.160
to give us names for
a new romantic drama.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.930
Ah, the only thing I
forgot was the right

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:47.040
labeling for these things.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.600
So Laura, what do you think?

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.380
Is this from Turk, or
is this my algorithm?

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.939
LAURA SCHULZ: I am
50/50 [AUDIO OUT]..

01:08:57.939 --> 01:09:00.592
TOMER ULLMAN: So how about we'll
have by, not show of hands,

01:09:00.592 --> 01:09:01.800
but people just shout it out.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.935
Like, if it's, I
don't know, Turk or--

01:09:05.935 --> 01:09:08.939
I'm looking for a short word
which is like a Turk or Tomer.

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:11.600
Let's do it that way, so Tomer
just standing in for Tomer'

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.392
simple silly algorithm.

01:09:13.392 --> 01:09:14.850
So who thinks that
this was created

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.102
by someone an actual
human on Mechanical Turk?

01:09:17.102 --> 01:09:19.560
And who thinks it was created
by Tomer mechanically running

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.460
through an algorithm?

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.090
OK.

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:24.560
So in 3, 2, 1 you're either
going to shout Turk or Tomer.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.142
3, 2, 1.

01:09:26.142 --> 01:09:27.750
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:28.500
TOMER ULLMAN: OK.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.140
That was actually someone
at Mechanical Turk.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.010
Let's do this again.

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:36.607
Girls In Ships for a
romantic drama, 3, 2, 1--

01:09:36.607 --> 01:09:38.399
AUDIENCE: Tomer.

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:39.960
TOMER ULLMAN: This
was an algorithm.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.270
Value Of Love, 3, 2, 1--

01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:43.870
AUDIENCE: Turk.

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:45.600
TOMER ULLMAN: That
was Turk, good.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.860
Endless Love, 3, 2, 1--

01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:48.540
AUDIENCE: Turk.

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.140
TOMER ULLMAN: Good.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:49.639
OK.

01:09:49.639 --> 01:09:51.279
How about Legend of Paris?

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:52.370
3, 2, 1--

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.935
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:09:53.935 --> 01:09:55.060
TOMER ULLMAN: Nobody knows.

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.050
This is actually me.

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.550
OK.

01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:00.730
Who's enjoying this and
wants to do a few more?

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.980
Land of Roses, 3, 2, 1--

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:03.904
AUDIENCE: Tomer.

01:10:03.904 --> 01:10:05.290
TOMER ULLMAN: Tomer.

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:07.960
And finally, Those We
Meet Again, 3, 2, 1--

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:08.790
AUDIENCE: Turk.

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:10.390
TOMER ULLMAN: No, it wasn't me.

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:11.290
Oh, sorry, one more.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:13.065
Love Lightly, 3, 2, 1--

01:10:13.065 --> 01:10:13.690
AUDIENCE: Turk.

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:14.740
TOMER ULLMAN: Yeah, Turk.

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.198
It seems like
Turkers were actually

01:10:16.198 --> 01:10:18.760
doing better than the algorithm,
which is romantic is love.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.218
And I'm just going
to put something

01:10:20.218 --> 01:10:22.210
with love in the title.

01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:24.490
So who wants to do this
action movies, and then

01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:26.580
we'll start stop?

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.269
OK.

01:10:27.269 --> 01:10:28.310
Let's do this for action.

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:29.830
How about The Chase?

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:30.760
3, 2, 1--

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.110
AUDIENCE: Turk.

01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:34.345
TOMER ULLMAN: Yes, how
about Who, The Annihilation?

01:10:34.345 --> 01:10:36.580
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.080
TOMER ULLMAN: OK, that's me.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.190
The Oversight?

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.330
Turk.

01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:41.450
The Edge.

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:42.250
AUDIENCE: Turk.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.070
TOMER ULLMAN: Turk.

01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:45.070
Jack Death?

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.910
Tomer.

01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:46.960
Among Heroes.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.892
AUDIENCE: Turk.

01:10:47.892 --> 01:10:49.760
TOMER ULLMAN: No, it was me.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.420
Swordmen in China Three?

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.348
AUDIENCE: Tomer

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:53.740
TOMER ULLMAN: Tomer.

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:54.306
And The Hit?

01:10:54.306 --> 01:10:54.930
AUDIENCE: Turk.

01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:55.620
TOMER ULLMAN: People on Turk.

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.710
You can probably [AUDIO OUT]
than four in each one.

01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:00.335
And, again, people are like, The
Oversight, The Hit, The Chase,

01:11:00.335 --> 01:11:00.879
The Edge.

01:11:00.879 --> 01:11:02.170
That's the only thing they did.

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:04.740
They actually came up with
some clever stuff as well.

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.272
But, you know, it's interesting.

01:11:06.272 --> 01:11:07.480
And, of course, I'm cheating.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.729
Because the algorithm did a
bunch of really dumb stuff

01:11:09.729 --> 01:11:13.250
that I didn't put in here,
like Hunchback of Monte Cristo,

01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:15.500
Get it Did, Bell
of a Lesser God,

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.010
Eagles Shooting
Heroes, Tomb Raider,

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:23.890
The Raging God Of Violence, and
Legend of Legend, my favorite.

01:11:23.890 --> 01:11:27.566
But my point is to say,
you know, in the same sense

01:11:27.566 --> 01:11:29.190
that Joshua's saying,
you know, imagine

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:30.981
that you could use
something like a ConvNet

01:11:30.981 --> 01:11:33.640
to quickly cede your proposals--
imagine if you could think

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.730
of like a random dumb algorithm
that could then [AUDIO OUT]

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:38.430
and say Legend of something.

01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:39.680
And then you start to say, no.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.930
That's not really a great idea.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:42.304
What you're trying
to get at here

01:11:42.304 --> 01:11:44.200
is not 100% accuracy
with these silly things,

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.740
but something like 1 in 5.

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:49.600
1 in 5 is better than 1
in 0, or 1 in a million

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:52.490
or something like that, which
is what Laura was pointing out.

01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.990
OK.

01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:55.570
So as I said, we still
have a long, long way

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:57.790
to go to model children
to meet Laura's critique.

01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:58.999
It's hard to say what's hard.

01:11:58.999 --> 01:12:01.248
I think that's what I was
trying to hint at with Steve

01:12:01.248 --> 01:12:02.050
Piantadosi's point.

01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:03.520
We don't really
know what's easy.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.200
We don't really
know what's hard.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.414
But people in development
and in computational land

01:12:07.414 --> 01:12:09.580
should continue to care
about stochastic algorithms.

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.205
And people in
computational land should

01:12:11.205 --> 01:12:14.440
continue to care about
children to everyone's benefit.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.170
And that's it-- so, Laura.

01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:18.062
LAURA SCHULZ: This
will be very short.

01:12:18.062 --> 01:12:21.850
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:23.310
So I didn't know.

01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:24.310
Or rather, I did know.

01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:25.250
But I didn't know
it was going to be

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.560
part of this debate
about Max Siegel's thing.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.390
So I'll say something
briefly about that.

01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:35.216
But you've had three really good
approaches to each of these.

01:12:35.216 --> 01:12:36.590
So I'll speak
briefly about them.

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:38.970
I think what Owen is
doing is totally great,

01:12:38.970 --> 01:12:41.390
but still driven in
some sense by the data,

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:43.790
not by the question, right?

01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:46.370
And I think the point that I'm
going to make just continually

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:49.580
here is that the way we
think is driven by the goals

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:52.100
that we have, right?

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.200
And each of these
solutions in some ways

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.100
is failing to use what is
most salient to it as humans,

01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.700
which is we have problems.

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.970
We have questions, right?

01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:04.850
And what I would like to
do is see us move to a case

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:07.700
where it's not just
the data that's causing

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.257
us to generate new ideas.

01:13:09.257 --> 01:13:11.090
And we're not just
trying to deal with that.

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:16.720
It is actually the information
in the problem itself.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.570
Similarly, I think what Eyal's
doing is totally beautiful.

01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:21.240
And the representational
compression

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.310
is really, really interesting.

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:26.050
But a lot of learning
problems can't be solved.

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:28.542
Most of the ones
I was gesturing at

01:13:28.542 --> 01:13:30.000
are not really
problems of changing

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.166
the representational format.

01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:33.630
It matters hugely that
we have an Arabic numeral

01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:35.430
system instead of a
Roman numeral system.

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:37.920
That changes the kinds of
problems that we can solve.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.100
And so that represents
a huge advancement.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.400
And for many kinds
of problems, it

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.160
will make search
much more efficient.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.390
But a lot of problems just
don't have that property.

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:50.940
So it's, in some
sense, an answer

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.970
to a different kind of problem.

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:57.840
Steve's proposal-- what
can you say, right?

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.699
It could be true.

01:13:58.699 --> 01:14:00.240
There are a billion,
billion neurons.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.614
You get more
synaptic connections

01:14:01.614 --> 01:14:03.450
than there are stars
in the known universe.

01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:06.310
Of course, it could be true.

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:08.760
That's what an expedition
means-- a long line

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.532
of everybody, says Pooh.

01:14:10.532 --> 01:14:13.550
But it's not as good
a story if it's true.

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:14.700
So it could be true.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.950
You could do a billion
things really really fast

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:19.130
and just think about the
ones that you arrive at.

01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:24.090
But I think the jury's
out on that one.

01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:26.750
Max and Tomer and this--

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.709
and while ago I think
Sam Gershman also, right?

01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:30.208
So Sam Gershman
came up to us and we

01:14:30.208 --> 01:14:32.490
spent a while talking about
how you would invent what

01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:35.700
we were affectionately calling a
bullshit generator, our ability

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.317
to [AUDIO OUT].

01:14:37.317 --> 01:14:39.150
Somebody asked me about
anything, you know--

01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:40.800
tell me about Ionic
and Doric columns,

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.510
you remember something
from sixth grade.

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:44.990
And you start talking, right?

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:46.760
So the question is,
what can you do?

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.510
And I think this is a
really nice attempt.

01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:50.790
And I think the idea of
seeding it from past examples

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:54.090
to help construct a search space
is a really beautiful idea.

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:58.140
Again, the question is,
how do you make that.

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:01.860
My feeling is still
we can do something

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.600
that works for those
kinds of problems

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.800
where we have past examples.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.880
We can do it for
any kind of problem.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.360
And so what I
really want to push

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.760
for is use the problem, right?

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.499
Use the information
and the problem.

01:15:13.499 --> 01:15:15.540
Because for those problems,
like romantic movies,

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.740
we have some existing examples.

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:17.640
We can the search space.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.150
We can do that.

01:15:18.150 --> 01:15:20.191
And for my theater company
example, it's perfect.

01:15:20.191 --> 01:15:22.620
But for the peppermint
example, not so much, right?

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.870
You're not going to see the
search space from examples

01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:27.210
of candies, or what you
know about the construction

01:15:27.210 --> 01:15:27.720
of candies.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.303
If you did, it wouldn't generate
the pendulum answer, which we

01:15:30.303 --> 01:15:32.010
think is a good wrong answer.

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:34.230
So it's not just that.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.600
It is I have a problem
of a particular kind.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.480
It is going to be satisfied by
some kind of an answer and not

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.050
others.

01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:43.662
How can I use that to
help my [INAUDIBLE]??

01:15:43.662 --> 01:15:47.850
So that's I think the end
of what I have to say.

01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:50.930
And we'll return to questions.
