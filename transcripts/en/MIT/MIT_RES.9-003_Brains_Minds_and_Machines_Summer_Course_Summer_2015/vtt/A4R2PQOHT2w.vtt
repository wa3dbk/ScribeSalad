00:00:22.427 --> 00:00:24.260
TOM MITCHELL: I want
to talk about some work

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.210
that we're doing to try to
study language in the brain.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.080
Actually, to be honest, this
is part of a grander plan.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.700
So here is what I'm really
doing with my research life.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.140
I'm interested in
language, and so I'm

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.390
involved in two different
research projects.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.950
One of them is to build a
computer to learn to read.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.730
And we have a project
which we call our Never

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.700
Ending Language Learner,
which is an attempt

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.550
to build a computer program
to learn to read the web.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.930
NELL, we call it, has been
running nonstop, 24 hours a day

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.370
since 2010.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.842
So it's now five years old.

00:01:07.842 --> 00:01:09.300
If you have very
good eyesight, you

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.466
can tell that everybody's
t-shirt there in the group

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:15.990
is wearing a NELL fifth
birthday party t-shirt.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.000
But it's an effort
to try to understand

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.120
what it would be like to
build a computer program that

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.280
runs forever and gets
better every day.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.930
In this case, its job is
to learn to read the web.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.530
It is getting better.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
It currently has about
100 million beliefs

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.540
that it has read from the web.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.590
It's learning to infer new
beliefs from old beliefs.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.440
It's a better reader today
than it was last year.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.240
It was better last year
than it was the year before.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.280
It's still not anything like
as competent as you and I,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.300
but it's one line
of research that you

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.410
can follow if you're interested
in understanding language

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.302
understanding.

00:02:00.302 --> 00:02:01.760
The other thread,
which is what I'm

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.440
going to talk about tonight,
which is in the bottom half

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.990
here, is to study how the
brain processes language

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.480
by putting people
in brain imaging

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.770
scanners of different types, and
showing them language stimuli,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.390
and getting them to read.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.550
So I'm going to focus
really on the bottom part.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.070
But I can't really talk
about this honestly

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.760
unless I fess up to the fact
that my goal is for these two

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.280
projects to collide in
a monstrous collision.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.980
They haven't yet, although
you'll see some signs,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.240
I hope, tonight, of some
of the cross-fertilisation

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.810
between the two areas.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.520
When it comes to the
brain imaging work,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.360
we have a very great
team of people.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.520
One of them, Nicole Rafidi,
is sitting right here.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.130
Some of you have already
met her this week.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.840
And so what I'm going to
present is really the group work

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.590
of quite a few people.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.570
And the idea is simple,
but here's the brainteaser.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.960
Suppose you're interested in how
the brain processes language,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.140
and you have access to some
scanning machines, then

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.910
what would you do?

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.300
And so we started
out by showing people

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.220
in a scanner stimuli like these.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.590
Maybe single words, initially
nouns like camera, and drill,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.630
and house, and saw.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.690
Sometimes pictures, sometimes
pictures with words under them.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.470
But just showing people
stimuli to get them

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.960
to think about some concept.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.990
And then we collect
a brain image,

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.060
like this one,
which we collected

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.032
when a person was looking
at this particular stimulus,

00:03:49.032 --> 00:03:51.480
a bottle.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.650
And this is posterior, this is
the back of the head on top.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.500
This is the front of the
head at the bottom here.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.530
And these four slices are
four out of about 22 slices

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.820
of the brain that make up
the three dimensional image.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.730
And so you can see here what
the brain activity looks like--

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.860
kind of blotchy-- when one
particular person thinks about,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.500
bottle.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.050
So you might ask, what
does it look like if they

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.419
think about something else?

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.710
Well, I can show you what it
looks like on the average.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.100
If we average over
60 different words,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.820
then here's the brain activity.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.080
And you can see that it
looks a lot like bottle,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.770
but maybe there are
some differences.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.220
And in fact if I subtract
out this mean activity

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.390
from the brain image
we get for bottle,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.390
then you can see
the residue here.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.670
There are in fact
some differences

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.800
in the activity we see
for bottle compared

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.300
to the mean activity
over many words.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.090
Whether that's
signal or noise, I

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.370
guess you can't tell by
looking at this picture.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.420
But that's the kind
of data that we have

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.190
if we use fMRI to capture
brain activity while people

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.194
read words.

00:05:14.194 --> 00:05:15.610
So the first thing
you might think

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.330
of doing if you had
this kind of data

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.050
would be to train a
machine learning program

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.410
to decode from these brain
images which word somebody is

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.080
thinking about it.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.510
And so we, in fact, began that
way by training classifiers

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.050
where we'd give
them a brain image.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.930
And during training
time we would tell them

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.350
which word that brain
image corresponds to.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.830
And then after training we
could test the classifier

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.040
to see whether
indeed it had learned

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.220
the right pattern of activity
by showing it new brain images

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.240
and having it tell us, for
example, is this person reading

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.630
the word hammer or bottle.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.610
And, in fact, that works
that works quite well.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.590
And, in fact, if you try it over
several different participants

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.090
in our study, you can see we
get classification accuracies

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.190
for a Boolean
classification problem.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:21.460
Are they reading a tool word
like hammer, saw, chisel,

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.560
or a building were like
house, palace, hotel.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.830
Then, depending on
the individual person,

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.570
we can get in the high 90%
accuracy or a little worse.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.970
In fact, if you ask why it's
not the same for all people,

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.510
it turns out the accuracy
that we get correlates

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.090
very well with measure of
head motion in the machine.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.680
So a lot of this is noise.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.090
But the bottom
line here is good.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.970
fMRI actually has
enough resolution

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.850
to resolve the differences in
neural activity between, say,

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.210
thinking about
house versus hammer.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:13.690
And machine learning methods
can discover those distinctions.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.760
So that's a good basis.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.310
And so given that, you
can start asking a number

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.540
of interesting questions.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.030
Like we could ask, well,
what about you and me?

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.240
Do we have the same
pattern of brain activity

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.380
to encode hammer, and house,
and all the other concepts?

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.350
Or do each of us do
something different?

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.726
And we can convert that into
a machine learning question,

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:39.225
right?

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.440
We could say, well, what
if we train on people

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.470
on that side of the room.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.830
We'll collect their brain
data and train our program.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.890
Then we'll collect
data from these people

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.860
and try to decode
which word they're

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.380
reading based on
the patterns that we

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.750
learned from those people.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.500
If that works, then that's
overwhelming evidence

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.150
that we have very similar neural
encodings of different word

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.640
meanings.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.490
So we tried that and,
in fact, it works.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.460
In fact, here you see in
black, the accuracies,

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.900
just like on the first slide,
of how well we can decode

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.010
which word a person
is reading in black,

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.630
If we train on data from the
same person we're testing on.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.520
But in white you
see the accuracies

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.200
we get if we train on no
data at all from this person,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.179
but instead train
on the data from all

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.270
the other participants.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.210
And you see on average
we do about as well

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.809
with the white bars as we
do with the black bars.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.730
In fact, in some cases
we do better training

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:46.990
on other people.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.860
That might be, for
example, because we get

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.660
to use more training examples.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.780
We get to use all the other
participants' data instead

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.310
of just one participant's data.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.920
But again, the
important thing here

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.030
is, this is very strong evidence
that, even though we're all

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.050
very different people,
we have remarkably

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:14.395
similar neural encodings when
we think about common nouns.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.970
Which is something that
really, say in the year 2000,

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.070
I don't think
anybody understood.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.860
So I want to kind of
wrap up this idea.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.630
So I want to go through
basically four ideas

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.650
in this talk.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.280
Idea number one
is, gee, we could

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:42.000
train classifiers to try to
decode from the neural activity

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.090
which word a person is reading.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.610
And if we do that,
then we can actually

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.860
ask some interesting
scientific questions,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.800
like are the patterns
similar across our brains?

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.650
Does it depend whether
it's a picture or a word?

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:01.030
And, in fact, we can think
of this technique of training

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.710
and classifier as--
the way I think of it

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.780
is it's a way of building a
virtual sensor of information

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.380
content in the neural signal.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.500
So I think that fMRI
was truly a revolution

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.290
in the study of the brain,
because for the first time

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.890
we could look inside
and see the activity.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.100
But I think these classifiers
give us a different thing.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.240
Now we can look inside and see
not just the neural activity,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.610
but the information encoded
in that neural activity.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.050
And so it's a different
kind of sensor.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.990
And you can design your
own and train it, and then

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.050
use it to study
information represented

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.835
in the neural
signal in the brain.

00:10:44.835 --> 00:10:48.780
So it kind of opens
up a very large set

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.430
of methods, and techniques,
and experiments that we can now

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.100
run with brain imaging.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.530
Where instead of looking
just at the activity,

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.450
we now can look at the
information content.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.130
OK, so that's idea number one.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.226
We were quite pleased
with ourselves

00:11:10.226 --> 00:11:11.350
and we are doing this work.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.590
But in the back of
back of our mind

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.820
was kind of a gnawing question
of, well, this is good,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.040
now maybe we've trained on
a couple of hundred words,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.640
so we have a couple hundred
different neural patterns

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.170
of activity.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.530
We have kind of a list
of the neural codes

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.260
for a couple of hundred
words, but that's not really

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.270
a theory of neural
encodings of meaning.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.960
It's a list.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.920
What would it mean
to have a theory?

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.340
Well, scientific theories
are logical systems

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.600
that can make predictions.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.300
And if they're
interesting theories,

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.500
they make experimentally
testable predictions.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.070
So in our case,
it would be nice,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.610
if we want to study
representations of meaning,

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.270
to have a theory where we
could input an arbitrary noun

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.090
and get it to
predict for us what

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.190
would be the neural
representation for that non.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.420
At least that would
be better than a list.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.810
That would be a generative
theory or model.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.330
And so we're interested in this.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.930
And we worked on this for
a while and came up with--

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.980
our first version of
this looked like this.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.420
It's a computational
model that was trained.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.980
And once it's
trained, it would make

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:38.480
a prediction for any input word,
like telephone, in two steps.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.710
Step one, if you gave it a word
like telephone, for example.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.490
Step one, it would look
up the word telephone

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.180
in a trillion words of
text collected from the web

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.660
and represent that word
by a set of statistics

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.150
about how telephone is used.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.340
In our case,
statistics about which

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.730
verbs co-occurred
with that noun.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.560
And then in the
second step, it would

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.130
use that vector
which approximates

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.300
the meaning of the input noun
as the basis for predicting

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.570
in each of 20,000
locations in the brain,

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.270
how much activity
will there be there.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.450
So let me push on
that a little bit.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:25.420
So I say in step one, we look
up for a word like celery which

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.690
verbs that occur with.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.740
Well, here are the
statistics that we get.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.360
This is normalized to
be a vector of length 1.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.550
But you can see for celery
the most common verb is eat.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.950
And taste is second most common.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.630
But celery doesn't occur
very often with ride.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.550
On the other hand,
airplane occurs a lot

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.510
with ride, and not very much
with manipulate and rub.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:55.420
So these are the verb statistics
extracted from the web

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.480
for two typical nouns.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.690
And step one of
the model was just

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.880
to collect statistics
for whatever now we

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.650
give it to make the prediction.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:11.140
Step two is then to predict
at each location in the brain

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.300
what the neural activity will
be there, the fMRI activity,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.350
as a function of those
statistics we just collected.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.740
So for the word
celery, now we know

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:30.340
it occurs 0.84 with eat and
0.35 with the verb taste.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.030
We're now going to make a
prediction of this voxel.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.030
In particular, the
prediction that voxel v

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.950
is the sum, over those 25
verbs that we're using,

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.860
of how frequently verb i
occurs with the input noun,

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.800
celery in this case, times
some coefficient that we

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.120
have to learn from training.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.580
And this coefficient tells
us how voxel v is influenced

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.390
by co-occurring with verb i.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:06.530
And we have 25
verbs, 20,000 voxels,

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:11.060
so we have 500,000 of these
coefficients to learn.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:18.460
We learn them by taking
nouns, collecting the brain--

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.100
the same data we use to
train those classifiers.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.610
So we have a collection of nouns
and the corresponding brain

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.990
images.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.890
For each of those nouns we can
look up the verbs statistics.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.740
And then we can
train on that data

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.880
to estimate all these
half million coefficients.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.700
When you put those coefficients
together, say, for eat,

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.980
this is actually a plot
of the coefficient values.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.550
Here's one of those
coefficients for the verb

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.360
eat in a particular
voxel right there.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.700
So you can think of the
coefficients associated

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:58.780
with each verb as forming a kind
of activity map for that verb.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:03.730
And a weighted linear sum of
those verb-associated activity

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.240
maps gives us a
prediction for celery.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.210
You could ask, how well
do these predictions work?

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.880
One way I could answer
that is to show you here,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.670
when we trained
on 58 other nouns,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.910
not including celery,
not including airplane.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.620
And then we had the system
predict these novel,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.470
to it, words.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.370
Celery, it predicted this image.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.470
Airplane, it
predicted this image.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.070
Unbeknownst to it, here are
the actual observed images

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.740
for celery and airplane.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.350
So you can see it
correctly predicts

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.870
some of this structure--

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.470
this is, by the way,
fusiform gyrus--

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.040
but not all the structure.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.290
So it captures some
of what's going on.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.710
I can, in a more
quantitative way,

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.290
tell you how well
it's working by--

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.510
we can test the
program this way.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.640
We can say, here are two
words you have not seen.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.920
Here are two images
you have not seen.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.319
One of them is celery,
one is airplane.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.800
You, the program, tell me which.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.690
If it was just
working at chance,

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.190
it would get an accuracy of 50%.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.990
If you just guess randomly,
you'll get half of those right

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.750
by chance.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.680
In its case, averaged over
nine different subjects

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.520
in the experiment,
we get 79% accuracy.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.760
So what does this mean?

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:38.360
What this means is, three
times out of four, 79%,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.290
we could give this trained model
two new nouns that it has never

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.030
seen, two fMRI images
for those nouns,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.960
and it could tell us three times
out of four which was which.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.610
So this model is
extrapolating beyond the words

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.850
on which it was trained.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.720
And it's extrapolating,
not perfectly, but somewhat

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.320
successfully to other nouns.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.340
Now, why?

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.610
What's the basis on which
it's doing that extrapolation?

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.610
What are the assumptions
built into this model?

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.290
Well, for one
thing, it's assuming

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.270
that you can predict the neural
representation of any word

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.630
based on corpus
statistics summarizing how

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.560
that word is used on the web.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:35.630
Furthermore, it's assuming
that any noun you can think of

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.660
has a neural
representation which

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.940
lives in a 25-dimensional
vector space, where

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.770
each dimension corresponds
to one of those 25 verbs.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:55.520
And every image is some point
in this 25-dimensional vector

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.780
space.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.710
That's what that
linear equation is

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:05.180
doing when it's combining
some weighted combination

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.270
of these 25 axes to
predict the image.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.470
So, I don't actually
believe that everything

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.990
you think lives in a
25-dimensional space

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.780
where the dimensions
are those verbs.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:22.280
But the interesting thing
is that the model works.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:29.950
And so it does mean that there
is some more primitive set

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.570
of meaning components out of
which these neural patterns are

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:35.620
being constructed.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.240
It's not just a big hash
code where every word

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.644
gets its own pattern.

00:19:42.644 --> 00:19:44.060
If that were the
case, we wouldn't

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.680
be able to extrapolate
and predict

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:54.120
new ones by adding together
these different 25 components.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.420
So patterns are
being built up out

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.410
of more primitive
semantic components.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:06.710
And this model is
crudely, only 79%,

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:11.660
capturing some of
that substructure that

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:17.940
gets combined when you
think about an entire word.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.140
And the substructure are the
different meaning components.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.080
The point here, I
think, is, here's

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.140
a model that's different
from training a classifier.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.040
This is actually a
generative model.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.750
It can make predictions that
extrapolate beyond the training

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.360
words on which it was trained.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:42.050
It is assuming that there is
a space of semantic primitives

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:46.520
out of which the patterns of
neural activity are built.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.550
And it is assuming that that
space is at least spanned

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:55.640
by the corpus
statistics of the noun.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:00.410
And since then, we've
extended this work,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.010
and we no longer use just
that list of 25 verbs.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:13.130
We actually use a very high
100-million-dimensional vector,

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.840
which is generally
very sparse, but where

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:22.070
every feature comes from a
much more precise parse of text

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.510
on the web.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:28.340
And for example,
when I say parse,

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.470
I mean if we have
a simple sentence

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.430
like, he booked a ticket, this
would be a dependency parse.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.020
It's showing, for
example, that booked

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.560
is a verb whose subject is
he and whose direct object

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.600
is ticket.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.480
And now each of these
edges in the parse

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.160
becomes a feature in our new
representation of the word.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.360
So instead of using verbs, we
use dependency parse features.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.280
And this actually increases
slightly the accuracy

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.840
of our former model
from 79 up a little bit.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.500
But importantly, it also lets us
work with all parts of speech.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.640
So now we're not restricted
to just using nouns.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.330
We can use these dependency
parse vectors for adjectives

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.200
and all parts of speech.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.150
So in terms of
broadening the model

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.100
to be able to handle
different types of words,

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.060
this is helpful.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.260
So at this point you
could say, well, this

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.260
is kind of interesting,
because what have we seen?

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:36.050
I think the main
points so far are, gee,

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.630
different people have
very similar patterns

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:43.760
of neural activity that their
brains use to encode meaning.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.420
Furthermore, those
patterns of neural activity

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.990
decompose into more primitive
semantic components.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:56.990
And we can train models that
extrapolate to new words

00:22:56.990 --> 00:23:02.360
on which they weren't trained
by learning those more

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.580
primitive semantic
components and how

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:10.290
to combine them for novel words
based on corpus statistics.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.540
So that's kind of interesting.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.130
But everything that
I've said so far

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.030
is really about the static
spatial distribution

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.690
of neural activity that
encodes these things.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:24.410
Now, in truth, your
neural activity

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.254
is not just one little snapshot.

00:23:27.254 --> 00:23:29.420
When you understand a word--
do you know how long it

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.711
takes you to understand a word?

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:36.290
About 400 milliseconds.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:40.930
It takes about 400 milliseconds
to understand a word.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.090
Well, it turns out there is
interesting brain activity

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:47.810
dynamics during those
400 milliseconds.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.960
And let me show you.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.020
So up till now, we were
looking at fMRI data.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.450
But here's some
magnetoencephalography data.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:01.700
And this data has a time
resolution of one millisecond.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.010
So I'll show you
this movie which

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:09.270
begins 20 milliseconds before
a word appears on the screen.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.410
In this case, the
word is the word hand.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.440
And this brain is about
to read the word hand.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.570
You'll see 550 milliseconds
of brain activity.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.440
I'll read out the
numbers so you can just

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.790
watch the activity over here.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:24.830
So here we go.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.890
20 milliseconds before the
word appears on the screen.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:51.520
0, 100, 200 milliseconds,
300, 400 milliseconds, 500.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.580
OK, so it wasn't a static
snapshot of activity.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.910
Your brain is doing
a lot of things.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.540
There's a lot of dynamism
during that 400 milliseconds

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.520
that you're reading the word.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:10.270
fMRI captures an image
about once a second,

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:14.380
but because of the
blood oxygen level

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:18.340
dependent mechanism that it
uses to capture that, it's

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.850
kind of smeared out over time.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:25.420
So we can't see this dynamics
with fMRI, but with MEG we can.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.020
And so now we can ask all
kinds of interesting questions,

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.390
like well, what was
the information encoded

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.590
in that movie that we just saw?

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.730
I just showed you a
movie of neural activity,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:42.270
but I want a movie of
data flow in the brain.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.350
I want the movie showing
me what information

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.750
is encoded over time.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.700
Given this data,
what could we do?

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.260
Well, here's one
thing we can do.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.670
In fact, Gus Sudre did
this for his PhD thesis.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.850
He said, I want to know
what information is flowing

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.560
around the brain
there, so I'm going

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.100
to train roughly a million
different classifiers.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.850
I'll train classifiers that
look at just 100 milliseconds

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.840
worth of that movie and
look at just one of 70

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.820
or so anatomically
defined brain regions.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.940
And I'll use a set
of features-- he

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.430
wasn't using our verbs anymore.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:26.410
He was using a set
of 229 features

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:32.740
that we had made up manually
and that were inspired

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.420
by the game 20 questions.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.520
These were features
of the word, not

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.640
like, how often does a court
does it co-occur with the verb

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.340
eat?

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.480
But instead, features
like, would you eat it?

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.660
Yes or no.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.940
Is it bigger than a bread box?

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.660
Yes or no.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.070
And so forth.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:52.000
He had a set of 218
questions like that.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.740
And every word
could be described

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:59.790
by a set of 218 answers
to those questions,

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.950
analogous to the verbs.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.100
And so what Gus did is, for
every one of those features,

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.860
every one of those
218 features like,

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.550
is it bigger than a breadbox,
he trained a classifier

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:15.100
to try to decode the
value of that for the word

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.790
that you're reading from
just 100 milliseconds

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.360
worth of this movie, and
looking at just one of 70

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.840
anatomically defined regions.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.250
And so when he did
that, he ended up

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.930
being able to make us a movie
of what information is coded,

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.900
in which part of
the brain, when.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.280
And he ran this--
every 50 milliseconds

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.550
he'd move forward and use a
100 millisecond window starting

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.510
there.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.660
So he found that during
the first 50 milliseconds

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.170
after the word
appears on the screen,

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:54.180
none of those classifiers
could reliably,

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.330
in a cross validated
way, produce

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:01.150
any reliable predictions.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.460
Meaning the neural
signals seems to not

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.860
encode any of those
semantic features

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.060
during the first
50 milliseconds.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.580
By timing out to
100 milliseconds,

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.100
there were no semantic features,
but you could decode things

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.650
like the number of letters
in the word, the word length.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.330
At 150 milliseconds,
at 200 milliseconds,

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.880
you got the first
semantic feature.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.510
Is it hairy?

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.210
I think this is actually a
stand-in for, is it alive?

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:40.230
But the feature he happened
to uncover was, is it hairy?

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.140
At 200 milliseconds.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.800
At 250, now we start to
see more semantic features.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.410
300, 350, 400, 450.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:29:04.310
So literally, these are the
semantic features trickling

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.610
in over time during
this 500 milliseconds--

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.740
that's the movie--

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.860
that corresponds to
the neural activity

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.800
that I showed you
in that first movie.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:23.090
So this is a kind of data flow
picture of what information

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:27.560
is flowing around in the
brain in that neural activity

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.700
during that 450
milliseconds so far.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.840
Here's the set.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.810
Out of those 218 questions,
here are the 20 most decodable

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.610
features.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.670
So the number one feature
that's most decodable,

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.670
is that bigger than
a loaf of bread?

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:49.740
But actually, if you
look at those questions,

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.440
you see many of the
most incredible ones

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.150
are really size.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.960
And many of the next
are manipulability.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.820
And many others are animacy.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.110
And some are shelter.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:10.380
In fact, we've across a
diverse set of experiments

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.390
keep seeing these
kind of features.

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:16.620
Size, manipulability,
animacy, shelter,

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:26.620
edibility are recurring as
features that have their own--

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.600
they seem to be kind
of naturally some

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.540
of the primitive components.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.460
And they have their
corresponding neural

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:40.740
signatures, out of which the
encoding of the full word

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.480
is built.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.340
So if you ask me
right now, what's

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.910
my best guess of what are
the semantic primitives out

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:50.280
of which the neural
codes are built, I'd say,

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.280
I don't really know.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.340
But these features plus
edibility, for example,

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.890
keep recurring in
what we're seeing.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.050
And they have their
own spatial regions

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:05.000
where the codes seem to live.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.410
OK, so I want to get to
the final part, which

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:14.790
is, so far we've talked
about just single words.

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.370
And there's plenty of
interesting questions

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.850
we can ask about single words.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.230
But really, language is
about multiple words.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.800
And so I want to show you a
couple of examples of some more

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.550
recent work where we've been
looking at semantic composition

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.590
with the adjective-noun phrases.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.500
This is the work of Alona Fyshe.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.690
And what she did is
she presented people

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:42.060
with just simple
adjective-noun sequences.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:47.190
She put an adjective on
the screen like tasty,

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.190
leave it there
for half a second,

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.730
then a noun like tomato.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:57.900
And she was interested
in the question of,

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:03.930
well, where and when is the
neural encoding of these two

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.500
words, and what does
that encoding look like?

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.270
So I'll show you a
couple of things.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:19.320
One is, here is a picture
of the classifier weights

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.370
that were learned to
decode the adjective.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.650
And you have to
think of it this way.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.540
Here's time.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:31.020
And this is the time, the
first 500 milliseconds

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.300
when the adjectives
on the screen.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.320
Then there's 300
milliseconds of dead air.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.690
Then 500 milliseconds when
the noun is on the screen.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.780
And then more dead air.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.290
This, the vertical axis,
are different locations

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:51.030
in the sensor helmet
of the MEG scanner.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:54.330
And there are
about 306 of those.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:01.590
The intensity here
is showing the weight

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.020
of a trained classifier
that was trained

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.180
to decode the adjective.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.370
And, in fact, this
is the pattern

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.960
of activity associated
with the adjective gentle.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.520
Like gentle bear.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:21.990
And so what you see here is
that there is neural activity

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.720
out here when the
noun is on the screen

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.020
long after the adjective has
disappeared from the screen.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.790
That's quite
relevant to decoding

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.070
what the adjective was.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:39.960
And so this is just
kind of a quick look.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:46.320
You can see that if I say
tasty tomato, even when

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:51.210
you're reading the word tomato,
there's neural activity here,

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.060
when you're looking at
that noun, that encodes

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.870
what the adjective had been.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.850
And we can see
that, in fact, it's

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.890
a different pattern
of neural activity

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:05.070
than was here when
the adjective was on.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:10.260
And in fact, one thing that
Alona got interested in

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.949
is, given that you
can decode across time

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.860
what that adjective
was, is your brain

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.949
using the same neural
encoding across time?

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:24.750
Or is it a different
neural encoding, maybe

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:29.100
for different
purposes across time.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.659
Let me explain what she did.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:37.260
She trained a
classifier at one time

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.080
in this time series
of adjective-noun,

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:47.580
and then she would test it
at some other time point.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.320
And if you could
train at this time,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.830
like let's say, right when the
adjective comes on the screen,

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:56.159
and use it successfully
to decode the adjective

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.860
way down here when the
noun is on the screen,

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.100
then we can know that it's
the same neural encoding,

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.220
because that's what it's doing.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.150
And then she made a plot,
a two-dimensional plot,

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:12.060
where you could plot, let's
say, the time at which you train

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.700
the classifier on
the vertical axis,

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.560
and the time at which you test
it on the horizontal axis.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.550
And then we could show at
each training test time

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.640
whether you could
train at this time

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.970
and then decode at this time.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.210
And that'll tell
us whether there's

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:34.845
a stable neural encoding of the
adjective meaning across time.

00:35:34.845 --> 00:35:36.720
When she did that, here's
what it looks like.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:44.390
OK, so here we have
on the vertical axis

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.250
the time at which she trained.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.130
This is when the adjective is
on the screen, the first 500

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:52.380
milliseconds, when the
noun's on the screen.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:57.500
Here's then using any of
these trained classifiers

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.780
for decoding the adjective.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.487
Here's a different time at
which she tried to use it.

00:36:02.487 --> 00:36:04.070
And again, here's
when the adjective's

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.170
on the screen, the noun.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.880
And so what you see--

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.780
all this intense stuff means
high decoding accuracy--

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:17.450
shows that if you train when
the adjective is on the screen,

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:21.170
you can use that to decode other
times at which the adjective's

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:22.450
on the screen.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.420
That's good.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.780
So we can decode adjectives.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.590
But if you try to use it to
decode the adjective when

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.810
the noun's on the
screen, it fails.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:36.380
Blue means failure.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.670
No statistically significant
decoding accuracy.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:43.190
On the other hand, when
the noun is on the screen

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.435
if you train using the
neural patterns when

00:36:46.435 --> 00:36:47.810
the nouns on the
screen, then you

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.420
can, in fact, decode
what the adjective

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.230
had been while the
noun is on the screen.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.600
So it's like there are
two different encodings

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.850
of the adjective
being used here.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.280
One when the adjective's
on the screen that lets you

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.190
successfully decode it when
the adjective's on the screen,

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.680
but it doesn't work when
the noun's on the screen.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:11.320
And then the second one that
works another neural encoding

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.060
that you can use to decode
what the adjective had been

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.920
when the noun is on the screen.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.970
And then interestingly, there's
also this other region here,

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.400
which says if you train when
the adjective was on the screen,

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.501
you can't use that to
successfully decode it

00:37:27.501 --> 00:37:28.750
when the noun's on the screen.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:34.840
But later on, when nothing is on
the screen, the phrase is gone,

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:38.860
your brain is still
thinking about the adjective

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:43.320
in a way that's using this
neural encoding, the very first

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.490
of those neural encodings.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:50.530
This is evidence that the neural
encoding of the adjective that

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.740
was present when you
saw the adjective

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:58.120
is re-emerging now a
couple seconds later,

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.780
after that thing
is off the screen.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.100
But the neural encoding
of the adjective

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:09.340
when the noun was on the screen
doesn't seem to get used again.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.770
Most recently, we've
also been looking

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.890
at stories and passages.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:18.610
And much of this,
not all of it, is

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:22.780
the work of Leila Wehbe,
another PhD student.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.820
And here's what she did.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:28.765
She put people in fMRI
and in MEG scanners,

00:38:28.765 --> 00:38:30.890
and she showed them the
following kind of stimulus.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.340
So this goes on for
about 40 minutes.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.010
One chapter of a
Harry Potter story.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.650
And word by word,
every 500 milliseconds,

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:57.020
we know exactly when
you've seen every word.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:01.060
So she collected this
data in fMRI and in MEG

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:05.746
to try to study the
jumble of activity that

00:39:05.746 --> 00:39:07.120
goes on in your
brain when you're

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.930
reading not an isolated
word, but a whole story.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:18.200
And so for her, with the fMRI we
get an image every two seconds.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.490
So four words go by and
we get an fMRI image.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:23.800
So here's the kind
of data that she had.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.000
She trained a model that's
very analogous to the very

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.970
first generative model I
talked about where we would

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.860
input a word, code
it with verbs,

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.560
and then use that to
predict neural activity.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:43.190
In her case, she took an
approach where for every word,

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:47.980
she would encode that word
with a big feature vector.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.640
And that vector could
summarize both the meaning

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.470
of the individual
word, but it also

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.380
could have other
features that capture

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:02.380
the context or the various
properties of the story

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.400
at that point in time.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.600
But the general framework
was to convert the time

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.060
series of words into a time
series of feature vectors

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.500
that capture individual
word meanings plus story

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:20.110
content at that time, and then
to use that to predict the fMRI

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.830
and MEG activity.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:27.210
So when she did
this, here are some

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:31.210
of the kind of features
that we ended up using.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:36.950
So some of there were like
motions of the characters,

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.550
like was there somebody flying--

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.780
this was the Harry Potter story.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.390
Somebody manipulating,
or moving,

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:45.300
or physically colliding.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.430
What were the emotions
being experienced

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.950
by the characters in the
story that you're focused

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.140
on at this point in time?

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.230
What were the parts of
speech of the different words

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:58.590
and other syntactic features.

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:00.310
What were the semantic content?

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.210
We also used the
dependency parse statistics

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:07.070
that I mentioned that capture
semantics of individual words.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:10.740
So altogether, she had a feature
vector with about 200 features.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:15.190
Some manually annotated, some
captured by corpus statistics.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.200
And for every word
in the story we

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.020
then had this feature vector.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.160
Then she trained this
model that literally

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:30.690
would take as input a sequence
of words, convert that

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:35.820
into the feature
sequence, and then,

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.100
using the trained
regression, predict

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.770
the time series
of brain activity

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.030
from those feature vectors.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:47.100
So this allowed
her to then test,

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.910
analogous to what we did with
our single word noun generative

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:55.710
model, to test to see, did the
model learn well enough that we

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.920
could give it to different
passages, and then

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.070
one real time series
of observed data,

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.800
and ask it to tell us
which passage this person

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.180
was reading.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.430
And these would be novel
passages that were not

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.200
part of the training data.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.990
And she found that it was, in
fact, possible, imperfectly,

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:20.250
but three times out of four,
to take a passage which

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:22.290
was not part of--

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.290
two passages which had
never been seen in training,

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.660
and a time series of
neural activity never seen

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.090
during training, and
three times out of four,

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:35.310
tell us which of those two
passages they correspond to.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.970
So capturing some of
the structure here.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:42.000
Interestingly, as a
side effect of that,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.590
you end up with a map of
different cortical regions

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:51.370
and which of these 200
features are encoded

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:54.400
in different cortical regions.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.930
So from one analysis
of people reading

00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:02.510
this very complicated, complex
story, in this analysis,

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:03.490
we end up--

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:06.890
you can go [AUDIO OUT]
features and color code.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.250
Some of them have to do
with syntax, like part

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.460
of speech and sentence length.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.810
Some have to do
with dialogue, some

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:18.760
have to do visual properties
or characters in the stories.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.480
And you can see here
is a map of where

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.160
those different
types of information

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:29.050
were decodable from
the neural activity.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:33.730
Interestingly, here is a
slightly earlier piece of work,

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:40.120
from Ev Fedorenko showing where
there is neural activity that's

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.937
selectively associated
with language processing.

00:43:43.937 --> 00:43:45.770
The difference here is
that in Leila's work,

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.700
she was also able to
indicate not just where

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:54.010
the activity was, but what
information is encoded there.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.260
And then again, you can
drill down on some of these.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.120
If you want know
more about syntax,

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.510
we could actually look at
the different syntax features

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.240
and see, well, where's the
part of speech encoded?

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.590
What about the length
of the sentence?

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.520
What about the specific
dependency role

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.680
in the parse of the
word that we're reading

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.120
right now, and so forth.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:19.600
So this gives us a
way then of starting

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.880
to look simultaneously at very
complex cognitive function,

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.380
right?

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.884
You're reading a story,
you're perceiving the words,

00:44:28.884 --> 00:44:30.550
you're figuring out
what part of speech,

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:31.907
you're parsing the sentence.

00:44:31.907 --> 00:44:33.490
You're thinking about
the plot, you're

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:35.200
fitting this into the plot.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.180
You're feeling sorry
for the hero who

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:40.090
just had their brooms stolen,
and all kinds of stuff

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.280
going on in your head.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.820
Here's the analysis that
attempts to simultaneously

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:52.990
analyze a diverse range
of these features,

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:56.570
and I think with some success.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:01.960
There still remain
problems of correlations

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.270
between different features.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:08.170
And so it might be hard
to know whether we're

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:11.350
decoding the fact that
somebody is being shouted at,

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:15.870
versus the fact that their
ears are hurting, so to speak.

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.385
But there could be two
different properties we thinking

00:45:18.385 --> 00:45:20.350
of that are highly correlated.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:24.670
And so it can still be
hard to tease those apart.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:28.510
But I think that, to me,
the interesting thing

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:33.820
about Leila's analysis here
is that it flips from a style

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.080
that I would call reductionist.

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.370
One way that people often
study language in the brain

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.620
is they pick one
phenomena, and then

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.260
run a carefully controlled
experiment to just vary

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.020
that one dimension.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.300
Like we'll use
words, and we'll use

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.950
letter strings that
are pronounceable

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:54.410
that are not words,
and then words.

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:57.770
And we'll just look at
what's different in those two

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:00.060
almost identical situations.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.620
Here, instead, we have
people doing natural reading,

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.710
doing a complex
cognitive function,

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:09.380
and try to use a
multivariate analysis

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:16.690
to simultaneously model all
of those different functions.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:22.130
And so I think this is an
interesting, methodologically,

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.600
position to take.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.610
And it also gives
us a chance to start

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:29.130
looking at some of these
phenomena in story reading.
