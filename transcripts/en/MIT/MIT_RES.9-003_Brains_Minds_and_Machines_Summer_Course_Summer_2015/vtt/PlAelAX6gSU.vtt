00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.540
JOSH MCDERMOTT: We're
going to get started again.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.450
So where we stopped,
I had just played you

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.030
some of the results of this
text, your synthesis algorithm.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.204
We all agreed that they
sounded pretty realistic.

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:34.620
And so the whole
point of this was

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.260
that this gives
plausibility to the notion

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.610
that you could be representing
these textures with these sorts

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.774
of statistics that you can
compute from a model of what we

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:46.440
think encapsulates
the signal processing

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.020
in the early auditory system.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.290
And, again, I'll just
underscore that the sort

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.940
of cool thing about
doing the synthesis

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.870
is that there's an
infinite number of ways

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.250
in which it can fail, right.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.340
And by listening to it
and convincing yourself

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.099
that those things actually
sound pretty realistic,

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.560
you actually get a
pretty powerful sense

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.204
that the representation
is sort of capturing

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:12.120
most of what you hear
when you actually listen

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.310
to that natural sound, right?

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.265
And for instance, we could
design a classification

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:20.140
algorithm that could
discriminate between all

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.390
these different things, right.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.514
But the point is
that they could--

00:01:23.514 --> 00:01:24.930
the representation
could still not

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.090
capture all kinds of different
things that you would hear.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.850
And by synthesizing,
because of the fact

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.921
that you can potentially fail
in any of the possible ways,

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:33.420
right.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.520
And then listen and observe
whether the failure occurs.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.730
You get a pretty
powerful method.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.390
All right.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.920
But one thing that you
might be concerned about.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.910
And this is sort
of something that

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.400
was annoying me, right, is
that what we've done here

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.860
is we've imposed a whole bunch
of statistical constraints,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.360
right.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.830
So we're measuring like this
really large set of statistics

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.214
from the model, right.

00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:55.380
And then generating things
that have the same values

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.010
of those statistics.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.750
So there's this question of
whether any set of statistics

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.914
will do.

00:02:01.914 --> 00:02:03.330
And so we wonder
what would happen

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.121
if we measured statistics
from a model that

00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:08.630
deviates from what we know
about the biology of the ear.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.100
So, in particular, you
remember that in this model

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.500
that we set out, there were
a bunch of different stages,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.000
right.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.774
So we've got this initial
stage of bandpass filtering.

00:02:17.774 --> 00:02:19.690
There's the process of
extracting the envelope

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.356
and then applying
amplitude compression.

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:23.520
And there's this
modulation filtering.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.110
And in each of
these cases, there

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.960
are particular characteristics
of the signal processing

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.560
of that's explicitly intended
to mimic what we see in biology.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.640
And so in particular as we
noted the kinds of filter banks

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.280
that you see in
biological systems

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.057
are better approximated
by something

00:02:40.057 --> 00:02:41.890
that's logarithmically
spaced than something

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.780
that's linearly spaced.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.710
So we remember--
remember that picture

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.001
I showed at the start, where
we saw that the filters up

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.586
here were a lot broader than the
filters down here, all right.

00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:49.960
OK, and so we can
ask, well, what

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.340
happens if we swap in a filter
bank that's linearly spaced.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.650
It's sort of more closely
analogous to like an FFT,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.017
for instance.

00:02:58.017 --> 00:03:00.600
Similarly we can ask, well, what
happens if we kind of get rid

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.340
of this nonlinear function
here that's applied

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.200
to the amplitude envelope.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.200
And we make the amplitude
respond to linear instead.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.210
And so we did this.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.790
So you can change
the auditory model

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.090
and play the exact same game.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.965
So you can measure
statistics from that model

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:20.040
and synthesize something
from those statistics.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.600
And then ask whether
they sound any different.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.360
And so we did an experiment.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.480
So we would play people
on the original sound.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.630
And from that original sound,
we have two synthetic versions.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.400
One that's generated
from the statistics

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.900
of the model that replicates
biology as best we know how.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.674
On the other of it that
is altered in some way.

00:03:39.674 --> 00:03:42.090
And we would ask people which
of the two synthetic version

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.140
sounds more realistic?

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.360
And so there's four
conditions in this experiment

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.970
because we could alter these
models in three different ways.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.310
So we could get rid of
amplitude compression--

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.450
that's the first bar.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.820
We could make the
cochlea linearly spaced.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.190
Or we could make the modulation
filters linearly spaced.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.523
Or we could do all three, and
that's the last condition.

00:03:58.523 --> 00:04:00.480
And so it's being
plotted on this axis--

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.250
whoops I gave it away--

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.560
is the proportion of
trials on which people

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.620
said that the synthesis from
the biologically plausible model

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.610
was more realistic.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.620
And so if it doesn't matter
what statistics you use,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.440
you should be right
here at this 50% mark

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.760
in each of these cases.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.380
And as you can
see in every case,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.600
people actually report
them, on average,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.959
the synthesis from the
biologically plausible model

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.300
is more realistic.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.290
And I'll give you a
couple of examples.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.920
So here's crowd
noise synthesized

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.770
from the biologically
plausible auditory model.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.380
[CROWD NOISE]

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.570
And here's the result of
doing the exact same thing

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.290
but from the altered model.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.140
And this is from this
condition here where

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.370
everything is different.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.680
And you, a little here, it
just kind of sounds weird.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.000
[CROWD NOISE]

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.550
It's kind of
garbled in some way.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.330
So here's a
helicopter synthesized

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.580
from the biologically
plausible model.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.481
[HELICOPTER NOISE]

00:05:02.481 --> 00:05:03.730
And here's from the other one.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.800
[HELICOPTER NOISE]

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.750
Sort of-- doesn't sound like
the modulations are quite as

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.510
precise.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.990
And so the notion here is that--

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.110
we're initializing this
procedure with noise.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.260
And so the output
is a different sound

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.850
in every case that
are sharing only

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.050
the statistical properties.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.140
And so the statistics
that we measure and used

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.070
to do the synthesis,
they define a class

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.440
of sounds that include
the original that,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.330
in fact, defines a set as well
as a whole bunch of others.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.340
And when you run the
synthesis, you're

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.970
generating one of
these other examples.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.120
And so the notion is that if
the statistics are measuring

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.550
what the brain is measuring,
well, then, these examples

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.966
ought to sound like another
example of the original sound.

00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:48.560
You ought to be generating
sort of an equivalence class.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.500
And the idea is that
when you are synthesizing

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.510
from statistics of this
non-biological model

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.010
where it's a
different set, right?

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.960
So, again, it's defined
by the original.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.617
But it contains
different things.

00:05:58.617 --> 00:06:00.200
And they don't sound
like the original

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.783
because they're
presumably not defined

00:06:01.783 --> 00:06:04.220
with the measurements
that the brain is making.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.460
I just mentioned to you
the fact that the procedure

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.010
will generate a different
signal in each of these cases.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.320
Here you can see the
result of synthesizing

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.622
from the statistics of a
particular recording of waves.

00:06:14.622 --> 00:06:16.080
These are three
different examples.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.150
And if you sort
of inspect these,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.520
you can kind of see that
they're all different, right?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.870
They sort of have
peaks and amplitude

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.120
in different places and stuff.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.990
But on the other
hand, they all kind of

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.670
look the same in
a sense that they

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.378
have the same textural
properties, right?

00:06:27.378 --> 00:06:29.650
And that's what's
supposed to happen.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.150
And so the fact that you have
all of these different signals

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.100
that have the same
statistical properties

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.000
raises this interesting
possibility,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.080
which is that if the brain is
just representing time average

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.050
statistics, we would predict
that different exemplars

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.590
of a texture ought to be
difficult to discriminate.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.385
And so this is the thing
that I'll show you about next

00:06:48.385 --> 00:06:50.510
is an experiment that
attempts to test whether this

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.330
is the case to try to
test whether, really, you

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.960
are, in fact, representing these
textures with statistics that

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.604
summarize their properties
by averaging over time.

00:06:59.604 --> 00:07:01.520
And in doing so, we're
going to take advantage

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.850
of a really simple
statistical phenomenon, which

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.280
is that statistics that are
measured from small samples

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.710
are more variable than
statistics measured

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.730
from large samples.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.600
And that's what is exemplified
by the graph that's

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.570
here on the bottom.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.430
So what this graph is
plotting is the results

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.030
of an exercise where we took
multiple excerpts of a given

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.890
texture of a
particular duration.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.635
So you're 40 milliseconds,
80, 160, 320.

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:29.510
So we get a whole bunch
of different excerpts

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.689
of that length.

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:33.230
And then we measure a particular
statistic from that excerpt.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.920
So in this case it's a
particular cross correlation

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.894
coefficient for the envelopes
of a pair of sub-bands.

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:42.560
So we're going to
measure that statistic

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.240
in those different excerpts.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.640
And then we're just going to
try to see how variable that

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.450
is across excerpts.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.982
And that's summarized
with a standard deviation

00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:50.690
of the statistic.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.170
And that's what's plotted
here on the y-axis.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.460
And so the point is that
when the excerpts are short,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.780
the statistics are variable.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.820
So you measure it in one excerpt
and then another and then

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.090
another.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.923
And you don't get the
same thing, all right.

00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:02.510
And so the standard
deviation is high.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.670
And as the excerpt
duration increases,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.650
the statistics become
more consistent.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.980
They converge to the true
values of the station underlying

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.220
stationary process.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.310
And so the standard
deviation kind of shrinks.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.851
All right, and so
we're going to take

00:08:14.851 --> 00:08:18.980
advantage of this in the
experiments that we'll do.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.069
All right, so first
to make sure that

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:25.610
or to give plausibility
to the notion

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.330
that people might
be able to base

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.120
judgments on
long-term statistics,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.330
we ask people to discriminate
different textures.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.980
So these are things that have
different long-term statistics.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.780
And so in the
experiment, people would

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.330
hear three sounds,
one of which would

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.253
be from a particular
texture like rain.

00:08:42.253 --> 00:08:43.669
And then two others
of which would

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.980
be different examples
of a different texture

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.060
like a stream.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.140
So you'd hear a rain--

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.060
stream one-- stream too.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.979
And the task was to
say which sound was

00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:53.270
produced by a different source.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.580
And so in this case, the
answer would be first--

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.310
all right.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.860
And so we gave people this task.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.470
And we manipulated the
duration of the excerpts.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.550
And so the notion here is that
while given this graph, what

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.260
happens is that the
statistics are very

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.210
variable for short excerpts.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.810
And then they become more
consistent as the excerpt

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.400
duration gets longer.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.480
And so if you're
basing your judgments

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.474
on the statistics computed
across the excerpt,

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.890
well, then you
ought to get better

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.390
at seeing whether
the statistics are

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.052
the same or different as the
excerpt duration gets longer.

00:09:23.052 --> 00:09:25.010
All right, and so what
we're going to plot here

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.259
is the proportion correct
that this task is a function

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:28.310
of the excerpt duration.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.710
And, indeed, we see
that people get better

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:31.880
as the duration gets longer.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.671
So they're not very
good when you give them

00:09:33.671 --> 00:09:34.790
a really short clip.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.980
But they get better and better
and as the duration increases.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.550
Now, of course, this is not
really a particularly exciting

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.776
result. When you
increase the duration,

00:09:42.776 --> 00:09:44.150
you give people
more information.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.800
And pretty much on
any story, people

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.216
ought to be getting
better, right?

00:09:47.216 --> 00:09:49.190
But it's at least
consistent with the notion

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.650
that you might be basing
your judgments on statistics.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.080
Now the really critical
experiment is the next one.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.950
And so in this experiment, we
gave people different excerpts

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.890
of the same texture.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.180
And we asked of them
to discriminate them.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.540
So again on each trial,
you hear three sounds.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.310
But they're all excerpts
from the same texture.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.620
But two of them are identical.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.080
So in this case,
the last two are

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.750
physically identical excerpts
of, for instance, rain.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.270
And the first one is a
different excerpt of rain.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.610
And so you just have
to say, which one is

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.320
different from the other two?

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.140
All right, now but maybe
the null hypothesis here

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.970
is what you might
expect if you gave this

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.950
to a computer algorithm that was
just limited by sensor noise.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.139
And so the notion is that as the
excerpt duration gets longer,

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:33.680
you're giving people
more information

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.035
with which to tell that this
one is different from this one.

00:10:37.035 --> 00:10:38.910
So maybe if you listen
to just the beginning,

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.618
it would be hard.

00:10:39.618 --> 00:10:43.649
But as you got more information,
it would get easier and easier.

00:10:43.649 --> 00:10:46.190
If in contrast you think that
what people represent when they

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.790
hear these sounds are statistics
that summarize the properties

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.780
over time.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.930
Well, I've just shown you
how the statistics converge

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.037
to fixed values as the
duration increases.

00:10:56.037 --> 00:10:57.620
And so if what people
are representing

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.930
are those statistics,
you might paradoxically

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.630
think that as the
duration increases,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.060
they would get
worse at this task--

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.269
all right.

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:08.060
And that's, in fact,
what we find happened.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.701
So people are good
at this task when

00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:13.950
the excerpts are very short
on the order of, like, 100

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.650
milliseconds.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.430
So they can very easily
tell you whether you're--

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.054
which of the two
excerpts is different.

00:11:18.054 --> 00:11:20.820
And then as the duration
gets longer and longer,

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.080
they get progressively
worse and worse.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.280
And so we think this is
consistent with the idea

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.310
that when you are hearing a
texture, once the texture is

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.980
a couple of seconds long, you're
predominantly representing

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.179
the statistical
properties averaging

00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:34.220
the properties over time.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.461
And you lose access to the
details that differentiate

00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:39.710
different examples of rain
so that the exact positions

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.168
of the rain drops or the clicks
of the fire, what have you.

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:44.866
Why should people be
unable to discriminate

00:11:44.866 --> 00:11:45.740
two examples of rain?

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.531
Well, you might think,
well, these textures

00:11:47.531 --> 00:11:48.980
are just homogeneous, right?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.530
There's just not enough stuff
there to differentiate them.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:52.905
And we know that
that's not true,

00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:55.580
because if you just chop out
a little section at random,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.930
people can very easily
tell you whether it's

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.138
the same or different, right.

00:11:58.138 --> 00:11:59.880
So at a local time
scale, the details

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.770
is very easily discriminable.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.650
You might also imagine
that what's happening

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:11.870
is that over time, maybe there's
some kind of masking in time.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.090
Or that the representation
kind of gets

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.815
blurred together in
some strange way.

00:12:16.815 --> 00:12:18.440
On the other hand,
when you give people

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.300
sounds that have
different statistics,

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.160
you find that they're
just great, right.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.937
So they get better and better
as the stimulus increases.

00:12:26.937 --> 00:12:29.270
And, in fact, the fact that
they continue to get better,

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.340
that seems to indicate
that the detail that

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.200
is streaming into
your ears is being

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.190
accrued into some representation
that you have access to.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.940
And so we think what
we think is happening

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.980
is that those details come in.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.500
They're incorporated into
your statistical estimates.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.160
But the fact that you can't tell
apart these different excerpts

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.660
means that there's these details
are not otherwise retained.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.700
All right, so they're
accrued into statistics,

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.850
but then you lose access to
the details on their own.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.220
The point is that the result
as it stands, I think,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.640
provides evidence for a
representation of time average

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.387
statistics.

00:12:58.387 --> 00:13:00.470
So that is that when the
statistics are different,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.900
you can tell things
are distinct.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.250
When they're the same,
you can't, and relates

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.500
to this phenomenon of the
variability of statistics

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.930
as a function of sample size.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.634
So a couple control experience
that are probably not

00:13:15.634 --> 00:13:17.300
exactly addressing
the question you just

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.910
raised but maybe are related.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.060
So one obvious possibility is
that the reason that people

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.740
are good at the
exemplar discrimination

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.840
here when the excerpts
are short and bad

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.980
here might be the fact
that maybe your memory is

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.030
decaying with time.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.640
All right, so the way that we
did this experiment originally

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.330
was that there was a fixed
inner stimulus interval,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.205
so that was the same.

00:13:37.205 --> 00:13:39.390
It was couple of hundred
milliseconds in every case.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.340
And so to tell that this is
different from this, the bits

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.010
that you would have to compare
are separated by a shorter time

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.510
interval than they
are in this case,

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.000
right, where they're separated
by a longer time interval.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.670
And if you might just imagine
that memory decays with time,

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.732
you might think that
would make people worse.

00:13:54.732 --> 00:13:56.690
So we did a control
experiment where we equated

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.262
the inner onset interval.

00:13:58.262 --> 00:13:59.720
All right, so that
the elapsed time

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.490
between the stuff that you
would have to compare in order

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.114
to tell whether
something was different

00:14:03.114 --> 00:14:04.580
was the same in the two cases.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.080
And that basically makes
no difference, right.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.090
You're still a lot better
when the things are

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.610
short than when they're long.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.980
And we went to
pretty great lengths

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.060
to try to help
people be able to do

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.310
this with these long excerpts.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.410
So you might also
wonder, well, given

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.330
that you can do this
with the short excerpts.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.746
With the short
excerpts are really

00:14:21.746 --> 00:14:24.200
just analogous to the very
beginning of these longer

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:24.700
excerpts.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.380
All right, so why can't you
just listen to the beginning?

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.730
And so we tried to help
people do just that.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.120
So in this condition
here, we put

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.855
a little gap between the
very beginning excerpt

00:14:34.855 --> 00:14:36.230
and the rest of
the thing, right?

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.120
And we just told
people, all right,

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.286
there's going to be this
little thing at the start--

00:14:40.286 --> 00:14:41.360
just listen for that.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.220
And people can't do that.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.200
So we also did it at the end--
so if at the gap at the end.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.620
So again, you get this little
thing of the same length

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.380
as you have in the
short condition.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.684
And this is performance,
in this case,

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.850
some people are good when
it's short and a lot worse

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.480
when it's longer.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.146
And the presence of
a gap doesn't really

00:14:58.146 --> 00:15:00.500
seem to make a
difference, right.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.900
So you have great trouble
accessing these things.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.970
Another thing that's sort
of relevant and related

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.172
was these experiments
that resulted

00:15:12.172 --> 00:15:14.630
from our thinking about the
fact that textures are normally

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.730
not generated from our
synthesis algorithm,

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.650
but rather from the
super position of lots

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.740
of different sources.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.310
And so we wondered what would
happen to this phenomenon

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.490
if we varied the number
of sources in a textures.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.130
So we actually
generated textures

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.990
by superimposing different
numbers of sources.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.290
So in one case we did
this with speakers.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.960
So we wanted to get rid
of linguistic effects.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.829
And so we used German
speech and people

00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:38.870
that didn't speak German.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.180
So it was like a
German cocktail party

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:40.990
that we're going to generate.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:42.550
So we have one person like this.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.280
[FEMALE VOICE 1]
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.300
And then 29--

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.282
[GROUP VOICE] [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:52.060
All right, room full of people
speaking German, all right?

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.400
And so we do the
exact same experiment

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.916
where we give people different
exemplars of these textures.

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:00.790
And we ask them to
discriminate between them.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.187
And so what's plotted here
is the proportion correct

00:16:03.187 --> 00:16:04.270
is a function of duration.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.186
Here, we've reduced it to just
two durations-- short and long.

00:16:07.186 --> 00:16:08.560
And there's four
different curves

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.780
corresponding to different
numbers of speakers

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.800
in that signal, right.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.560
So the cyan here is what
happens with a single speaker.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.310
And so with a single
speaker, you actually

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.490
get better at doing this
as the duration increases.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.370
All right, and so
that's, again, consistent

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.870
with the null hypothesis that
when there's more information,

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.286
you're actually
going to be better

00:16:24.286 --> 00:16:27.190
able to say whether something
is the same or different.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.130
But as you increase the number
of people at the cocktail

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:30.730
party--

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.540
the density of the
signal in some sense--

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.665
you can see that performance
for the short excerpts

00:16:34.665 --> 00:16:35.590
doesn't really change.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.720
So you retain the ability to
say whether these things are

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.800
the same or different.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.510
But there's this
huge interaction.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.630
And for the long excerpts, you
get kind of worse and worse.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.240
So impairment at
long durations is

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.280
really specific to
textures-- doesn't seem to be

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.840
present for single sources.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.423
To make sure that phenomenon is
not really specific to speech,

00:16:52.423 --> 00:16:55.780
we did the exact same thing
with synthetic drum hits.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.830
So we just varied the density
of a bunch of random drum hits.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.840
Like, here's five
hits per second.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.230
[DRUM SOUNDS]

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.900
Here's 50.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.588
[DRUM SOUNDS]

00:17:09.588 --> 00:17:12.319
All right, and you see
the exact same phenomenon.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.650
So for the very
sparsest case, you

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.619
get better as you go from the
short excerpts to the long.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.060
But then as the
density increases,

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.740
you see this big interaction.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.270
And you get
selectively worse here

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.099
for the long duration case.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:28.600
OK, so, again, it's
worth pointing out

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.360
that the high performance
with the short excerpts

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.819
indicate that all the stimuli
have discriminable variation.

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:35.776
So it's not the case that
these things are just

00:17:35.776 --> 00:17:37.000
like totally homogeneous.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.970
And that's why you can't do it.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.680
It seems to be a specific
problem with retaining

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.470
temporal detail when the signals
are both long and texture-like.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.130
OK, so what does this mean?

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.960
Well, go ahead.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.910
Here's the specular framework.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.600
And this sort of gets
back to these questions

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.058
about working
memory, and so forth.

00:17:54.058 --> 00:17:57.250
And so this the way that I
make sense of this stuff.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:01.030
And each one of these things
is pure speculation or almost

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:01.810
pure speculation.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.518
But I actually think
you need all of them

00:18:03.518 --> 00:18:05.380
to really totally make
sense of the results.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.088
It's at least interesting
to think about.

00:18:07.088 --> 00:18:10.690
So I think it's
plausible that sounds

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:14.800
are encoded both as sequences
of features and with statistics

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.450
that average
information over time.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.220
And I think that the features
with which we encode things

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:25.210
are engineered to be sparse for
typical natural sound sources.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.790
But they end up being
dense for textures.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.560
So the signal comes
in-- you're trying

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.809
to model that with a whole
bunch of different features

00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:34.070
that are in some dictionary
you have in your head.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.470
And for a signal like speech,
your dictionary features

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.470
include things that might
be related to phonemes

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.100
and so forth.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.320
And so for like a
single person talking,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.859
you end up with
this representation

00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:43.900
that's relatively sparse.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.180
It's got sort of a small
number of feature activations.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.380
But when you get a
texture, in order

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.859
to actually model
that signal, you

00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:51.025
need lots and lots and lots
of feature coefficients,

00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:53.590
all right, in order to
actually model the signal.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.440
And my hypothesis would
be that memory capacity

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.665
places limits on the number of
features that can be retained.

00:18:59.665 --> 00:19:01.300
All right, so it's
not really related

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.940
to the duration of signal
that you can encode, per se.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.410
It's on the number
of coefficients

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.490
that you can retain that you
need to encode that signal.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.620
And the additional thing
I would hypothesize

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.990
is that sound is continuously,
and this is critical

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.674
obligatorily encoded.

00:19:15.674 --> 00:19:17.590
All right, so this stuff
comes into your ears.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.964
You're continuously
projecting it

00:19:18.964 --> 00:19:21.790
onto this dictionary of features
that you have-- all right.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.459
And you've got
some memory buffer

00:19:23.459 --> 00:19:26.000
within which you can hang onto
some number of those features.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.020
But then once the memory
buffer gets exceeded,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.100
it gets overwritten.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.680
And so you just lose all
the stuff that came before.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.070
So when your memory capacity
for these future sequences

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.034
is reached, the
memory is overwritten

00:19:38.034 --> 00:19:38.950
by the incoming sound.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.650
And the only thing you're left
with are these statistics.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.610
So I'll give you one last
experiment in the texture

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.260
domain, and then we'll move on.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.580
So this is an experiment
where we presented people

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.240
with an original recording,
and then the synthetic version

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.520
that we generated from the
the synthesis algorithm.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.290
And we just ask them
to rate the realism

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:00.565
of the synthetic example.

00:20:00.565 --> 00:20:03.190
And so this is just a summary of
the results of that experiment

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:07.432
where we did this for
170 different sounds.

00:20:07.432 --> 00:20:09.640
And this is a histogram of
the average realism rating

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.990
for each of those 170 sounds.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.406
And there's just two points
to take away from this, right.

00:20:13.406 --> 00:20:15.744
The first that there's
a big peak up here.

00:20:15.744 --> 00:20:17.910
So they rate it as the
realism on a scale of 1 to 7.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.630
And so the big
peak looks centered

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.540
at 6 means that the synthesis
is working pretty well

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.745
most of the time.

00:20:23.745 --> 00:20:25.372
And that's sort of encouraging.

00:20:25.372 --> 00:20:27.080
But there's this other
interesting thing,

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.329
which is that there's this
long tail down here, right.

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:32.560
And what this means is
that people are telling us

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.350
that this synthetic signal
that is statistically

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.540
matched to this
original recording

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.320
doesn't sound anything like it.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.830
And that's really interesting
because it's statistically

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:42.830
matched to the original.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.205
So it's matched in all these
different dimensions, right.

00:20:45.205 --> 00:20:47.746
And, yet, there's still things
that are perceptually missing.

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.390
And that tells us
that there are things

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.210
that are important to the brain
that are not in our model.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.910
This is a list of the
15 or so sounds that

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.460
got the lowest realism ratings.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.912

things easy on you,

00:20:59.912 --> 00:21:01.120

tend to fall into sort

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.670
Her-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:44.762 --> 00:22:47.610
All right, OK, so
in some sense, this

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.890
is the most
informative thing that

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.887
comes out of this whole
effort, because, again, it

00:22:52.887 --> 00:22:55.220
makes it really clear what
you don't understand-- right.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.270
And in all these cases, it was
really not obvious, a priori,

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.689
that things would be this bad.

00:23:01.689 --> 00:23:03.480
I actually thought it
was sort of plausible

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.063
that we might be
able to capture pitch

00:23:05.063 --> 00:23:06.660
with some of these statistics.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.510
Same with reverb and certainly
some of these simple rhythms.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.670
I kind of thought that
some of the modulation

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.680
filters responses and
their correlations

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.887
would give this to you.

00:23:14.887 --> 00:23:17.220
And it's not until you actually
test this with synthesis

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.320
that you realize how
bad this is, right?

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.910
And so this really
kind of tells you

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.260
that there's something
very important

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.968
that your brain is
measuring that we just

00:23:23.968 --> 00:23:26.460
don't yet understand and hasn't
been built into our model.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.430
So it really sort of identifies
the things you need to work on.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.495
OK, so just take home
messages from this portion

00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:33.120
of the lecture.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.000
So I've argued that
sound synthesis is

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.940
a powerful tool that can help
us test and explore theories

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.210
of addition and that
the variables that

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.710
produce compelling synthesis
are things that could plausibly

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.720
underlie perception.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.766
And, conversely, that
synthesis failures

00:23:47.766 --> 00:23:49.890
are things that point the
way to new variables that

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:53.617
might be important for
the perceptual system.

00:23:53.617 --> 00:23:55.950
I've also argued that textures
are a nice point of entry

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.360
for a real world hearing.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.860
I think what's appealing about
them is that you can actually

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.940
work with actual real
world-like signals and all

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.360
of the complexity that at
least exists in that domain.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.710
And, yet, work with
them and generate things

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.880
that you feel like
you can understand.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.950
And I've argued that
many natural sounds may

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.110
be recognized with
relatively simple statistics

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.680
of early auditory
representation.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.667
So the very simplest kinds of
statistical representations

00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:22.500
that you might construct
that capture things

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.492
like the spectrum.

00:24:23.492 --> 00:24:25.700
Well, that on its own is
not really that informative.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.533
But if you just go a
little bit more complex

00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:29.940
and into the domain of marginal
moments and correlations,

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.550
you get representations
that are pretty powerful.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.890
And finally, I gave
you some evidence

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.510
that for textures
of moderate length,

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.911
statistics may be
all that we retain.

00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:41.910
So there are a lot of
interesting open questions

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.530
in this domain.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.200
So one of the big ones,
I think, is the locus

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.940
of the time-averaging.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.890
So I told you about how we've
got some evidence in the lab

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.982
that the time scale
of the integration

00:24:53.982 --> 00:24:55.440
process for computing
statistics is

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.670
on the order of several seconds.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.150
And that's a really
long time scale

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.662
relative to typical time
scales in the auditory system.

00:25:00.662 --> 00:25:02.620
And so where exactly that
happens in the brain,

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.484
I think, is very much an
open question and kind

00:25:05.484 --> 00:25:06.400
of an interesting one.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.816
And so we'd like
to sort of figure

00:25:07.816 --> 00:25:10.089
out how to get some
leverage on that.

00:25:10.089 --> 00:25:11.880
There's also a lot of
interesting questions

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.860
about the relationship
to scene analysis.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.080
So usually you're not hearing
a texture in isolation.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.760
It's sort of the
background to things

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.176
that, maybe, you're actually
more interested in-- somebody

00:25:20.176 --> 00:25:21.160
talking or what not.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.640
And so the relationship
between these statistical

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.904
representations and the
extraction of individual source

00:25:26.904 --> 00:25:28.570
signals is something
that's really open,

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.964
and, I think, kind
of interesting.

00:25:31.964 --> 00:25:34.380
And then these other questions
of what kinds of statistics

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.463
would you need to account
for some of these really

00:25:36.463 --> 00:25:39.670
profound failures of synthesis.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.760
OK, so actually one--

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.809
I think this might be
interesting to people.

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:46.350
So I'll just talk
briefly about this.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.340
And then we're going to
have to figure out what

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.590
to do for the last 20 minutes.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.869
But one of the
reasons, I think, I

00:25:50.869 --> 00:25:53.160
was requested to talk about
this is because of the fact

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.290
that there's been all
this work on texture

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.120
in the domain of vision.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.160
And so it's sort of an
interesting case where

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.860
we can kind of think about
similarities and differences

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.060
between sensory systems.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.914
And so back when we
were doing this work--

00:26:04.914 --> 00:26:07.080
as I said, this was joint
work with Eero Simoncelli.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.645
I was a post-doc
in his lab at NYU.

00:26:09.645 --> 00:26:11.520
And we thought it would
be interesting to try

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.510
to turn the kind of standard
model of visual texture, which

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:18.310
was done by Javier
Portia and Eero

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.686
a long time ago, into sort
of the same kind of diagram

00:26:20.686 --> 00:26:21.810
that I've been showing you.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.517
And so we actually
did this in our paper.

00:26:24.517 --> 00:26:26.850
And so this is the one that
you've been seeing all talk,

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:27.349
right.

00:26:27.349 --> 00:26:29.470
So you've got a
sound-wave form--

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:30.610
a stage of filtering.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.090
This non-linearity to extract
the envelope and compress it.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.530
And then another
stage of filtering.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.740
And then there are
statistical measurements

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.130
that kind of the last two
stages of representation.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.620
And this is an analogous
diagram that you

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.940
can make for this sort of
standard visual texture model.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.440
So we start out with
images like beans.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.730
There's centers surround
filtering of the sort

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.640
that you would find
in the retina or LGN

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.070
that filters things into
particular spatial frequency

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.670
bands.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.650
And so that's what you get here.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.929
So these are sub-bands again.

00:27:01.929 --> 00:27:03.720
Then there's oriented
filtering of the sort

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.960
that you might get via
simple cells and V1.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.390
So then you get the sub-bands
divided up even finer

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.000
into both spatial
frequency and orientation.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.380
And then there's
something that's

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.660
analogous to the extraction
of the envelope that

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.650
would give you something
like a complex cell.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.190
All right, and so this is
sort of local amplitude

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.500
in each of these different
sub-bands-- right.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.790
So you can see, here, the
contrast is very high.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.610
And so you get a high response
in this particular point

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:28.910
in the sub-band.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.891
So, again, this is in
the dimensions of space.

00:27:31.891 --> 00:27:33.890
So that's a difference,
right, so it's an image.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:37.902
So you got x and
y-coordinates instead of time.

00:27:37.902 --> 00:27:39.860
But, again, there are
statistical measurements,

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.480
and you can actually
relate a lot of them

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.020
to some of the same
functional form.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.500
So there's marginal
moments just like we

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.110
were computing from sound.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.110
In the visual texture model,
there's an auto correlation.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.150
So that's measuring
spatial correlations

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.000
which we don't actually
have in the auditory model.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.850
But then these correlations
across different frequency

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:02.370
channels.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.880
So this is across different
spatial frequencies

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.900
to things tuned to
the same orientation.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:15.026
And this is across orientations
and in the energy domain.

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:16.400
So a couple of
interesting points

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.320
to take from this
if you just sort of

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.350
look back and forth
between these two pictures.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.020
The first is that the
statistics that we ended up

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.760
using in the domain of sound
are kind of late in the game.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.450
All right, so they're sort of
after this non-linear stage

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.610
that extracts amplitude.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.140
Whereas in the
visual texture model,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.449
the nonlinearity happens here.

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:38.990
And there's all
these statistics that

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.250
are being measured at
these earlier stages

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.550
before you're extracting
local amplitude.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.240
And that's an
important difference,

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.140
I think, between
sounds and images

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.310
and that a lot of
the action and sound

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.167
is in the kind of the
local amplitude domain.

00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:54.500
Whereas there's a lot of
important structure and image--

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.834
images that has to do
with sort of local phase

00:28:56.834 --> 00:28:59.000
that you can't just get
from kind of local amplitude

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.610
measurements.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:05.900
But at sort of a coarse
scale, the big picture

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.600
is that we think
of visual texture

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.060
as being represented with
statistical measurements

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.140
that average across space.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.860
And we've been arguing
that sound texture consists

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.790
of statistical computations
that average across time.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.950
That said, as I was
alluding to earlier,

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.124
I think it's totally plausible
that we should really

00:29:24.124 --> 00:29:26.540
think about visual texture as
something that's potentially

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.080
dynamic if you're looking at
a sheet blowing in the wind

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.427
or much of people
moving in a crowd.

00:29:32.427 --> 00:29:34.760
And so there might well be
statistics in the time domain

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.410
as well that people just
haven't really thought about.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.949
OK, so auditory
scene analysis is,

00:29:42.949 --> 00:29:44.990
loosely speaking, the
process of inferring events

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.281
in the world from sound, right.

00:29:46.281 --> 00:29:49.780
So in almost any kind
of normal situation,

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.100
there is this sound signal
that comes into your ears.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.290
And that's the result of
multiple causal factors

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:54.980
in the world.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.830
And those can be different
things in the world that

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.456
are making sound.

00:29:59.456 --> 00:30:00.830
As we discussed,
the sound signal

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.390
also interacts with the
environment on the way

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.230
to your ear.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.720
And so both of those
things contribute.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.760
The classic
instantiation of this

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.410
is the cocktail
party problem where

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.820
the notion is that
there would be

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.120
multiple sources in the world
that the signals from the two

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.990
sources sum together into a
mixture that enters your ear.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:19.594
And as a listener,
you're usually

00:30:19.594 --> 00:30:21.260
interested in individual
sources, maybe,

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.509
one of those in particular
like what somebody that you

00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:24.920
care about is saying.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.400
And so your brain has to
take that mixed signal--

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.870
and from that to infer
the content of one or more

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.274
of the sources.

00:30:31.274 --> 00:30:32.690
And so this is the
classic example

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:35.430
of an ill-posed problem.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.690
And by that I mean
that it's ill-posed

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.959
because many sets
of possible sounds

00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:42.500
add up to equal the
observed mixture.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.960
So all you have access to
is this red guy here, right?

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.211
And you'd like to infer
that the blue signals,

00:30:47.211 --> 00:30:49.460
which are the true sources
that occurred in the world.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.440
And the problem is that there
are these green signals here,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.177
which also add up
to the red signal.

00:30:54.177 --> 00:30:56.510
In fact, there's lots and
lots and lots of these, right?

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.176
So your brain has to
take the red signal

00:30:58.176 --> 00:31:00.030
and somehow infer the blue ones.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.090
And so this is analogous
to me telling you,

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.890
x plus y equals 17--

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.060
please solve for x.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.720
And so, obviously, if you
got this on a math test,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.020
you would complain because
there is not a unique solution,

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.519
right.

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:12.970
That you could have 1 in 16,
and 2 in 15, and 3 in 14,

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.220
and so on and so forth, right?

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.136
But that's exactly the
problem that your brain

00:31:16.136 --> 00:31:17.990
is solving all the
time every day when

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.090
you get a mixture of sounds.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.670
And the only way that you can
solve problems of these sorts

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.832
is by making assumptions
about the sound sources.

00:31:24.832 --> 00:31:27.290
And the only way that you would
be able to make assumptions

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.390
about sound sources is if
real-world sound sources

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.436
have some degree of regularity.

00:31:31.436 --> 00:31:32.310
And in fact, they do.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.810
And one easy way to see
this is by generating sounds

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.420
that are fully random.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.200
And so the way that
you would do this

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.480
is you would have a
random number generator--

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.890
you would draw
numbers from that.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.080
And each of those numbers
would form a particular sample

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.012
and a sound signal.

00:31:47.012 --> 00:31:49.220
And then you could play that
and listen to it, right.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.750
And so if you did
that procedure,

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.875
this is what you would get.

[SPRAY SOUNDS]

00:31:55.756 --> 00:31:57.900
All right, so those are
fully random sound signals.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.450
And so we could generate
lots and lots of those.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.201
And the point is that
with that procedure,

00:32:02.201 --> 00:32:03.783
you would have to
sit there generating

00:32:03.783 --> 00:32:05.850
these random sounds for
a very, very long time

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.197
before you got something that
sounded like a real world

00:32:08.197 --> 00:32:08.780
sounds, right?

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.440
Real world sounds are like this.

[SCRUBBING SOUND]

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.405
All right, so the
point is that the set

00:32:22.405 --> 00:32:23.780
of sounds that
occur in the world

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.760
are a very, very,
very small portion

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.919
of the set of all physically
realizable sound-wave forms.

00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:31.460
And so the notion is that that's
what enables you to hear it.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.418
It's the fact that you've
instantiated the fact

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:36.192
that the structure of real
world tones is not random.

00:32:36.192 --> 00:32:38.150
And such that when you
get a mixture of sounds,

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.774
you can actually make
some good guesses

00:32:39.774 --> 00:32:41.170
as to what the sources are.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.760
All right, so we rely on these
regularities in order to hear.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.780
So one intuitive view of
inferring a target source

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.240
from a mixture like
this is that you have

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.160
to do at least a couple things.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.340
One is to determine the grouping
of the observed elements

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.670
and the sound signal.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.970
And so what I've
done here is for each

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:01.820
of these-- this is that cocktail
party problem demo that we

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.130
saw that we heard at the start.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:04.730
So we've got one speaker--

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.025
two, three, and then seven.

00:33:07.025 --> 00:33:12.030
And in the spectrograms,
I've coded the pixels

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:16.160
either red or green, where
the pixels are coded red

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.990
if they come from something
other than the target source,

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.490
right.

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:23.240
So this stuff up here is coming
from this additional speaker.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.470
And then the green bits are
the pixels in the target signal

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.030
that are masked by
the other signal.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:32.000
Or the other signal actually
has higher intensity.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.500
And so one notion
is that, well, you

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.666
have to be able to tell
that the red things actually

00:33:35.666 --> 00:33:38.120
don't go with the gray things.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.700
But then you also need to take
these parts that are green,

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.750
where the other
source is actually

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.040
swamping the thing
you're interested in,

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.440
and then estimate the
content of the target source.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.930
That's at least a very sort
of naive intuitive view

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:49.990
of what has to happen.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.640
And in both of these cases, the
only way that you can do this

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.130
is by taking advantage of
statistical regularities

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.660
in sounds.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.550
So one example of
irregularity that we

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.910
think might be used to group
sound is harmonic frequencies.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.740
So voices and instruments
and certain other sounds

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.800
produce frequencies that
are harmonics, i.e.,

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.000
multiples of a fundamental.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.620
So here's a schematic
power spectrum

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.469
of somebody of what might
come out of your vocal chords.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.260
So there's the fundamental
frequency here.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.320
And then all the
different harmonics.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.228
And they exhibit this
very regular structure.

00:34:21.228 --> 00:34:23.330
Here, similarly, this
is A440 on the oboe.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.320
[OBOE SOUND]

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.330
So the fundamental
frequency is 440 hertz.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.759
That's concert A.
But if you look

00:34:28.759 --> 00:34:30.300
at the power spectrum
of that signal,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:36.431
you get all of these integer
multiples of that fundamental.

00:34:36.431 --> 00:34:38.639
All right, and so the way
that this happens in speech

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.680
is that there are these--

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.940
your vocal chords,
which open and closed

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.469
in this periodic manner.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.396
They generate a series
of sound pulses.

00:34:45.396 --> 00:34:46.770
And in the frequency
domain, that

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:49.005
translates to
harmonic structure.

00:34:49.005 --> 00:34:50.880
Not going to go through
this in great detail.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.280
Hynek's going to tell
you about speech.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.460
All right, and so there's
some classic evidence

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.850
that your brain uses harmonicity
as a grouping cue, which

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:02.940
is that if you take a series
of harmonic frequencies

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.690
and you mistune one of
them, your brain typically

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.210
causes you to hear that
as a distinct sound source

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:10.860
once the mistuning
becomes sufficient.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.620

classic demo of that.

You are to listen for the third

played alone as a standard.

Then over a series
of repetitions,

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.170
it remains at a
constant frequency

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.200
while the rest of the
components are gradually lowered

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.904
as a group in steps of 1%.

[BEEPING SOUNDS]

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.480
[MALE VOICE 2] Now after two--

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.112
OK, and so what you
should have heard--

00:36:11.112 --> 00:36:13.320
and you can tell me whether
this is the case or not--

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.600
is that as this thing is
mistuned, at some point,

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.300
you actually start to
hear, kind of, two beeps.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.008
All right, there's
the main tone and then

00:36:19.008 --> 00:36:21.070
there's this other
little beep, right.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.880
And if you did it in
the other direction,

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.796
it would then reverse.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:32.190
OK, so one other consequence
of harmonicity is--

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.520
and somebody was asking
about this earlier--

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.610
is that your brain is able to
use the harmonics of the sound

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.350
in order to infer its pitch.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:43.630
So the pitch that you hear
when you hear somebody talking

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:46.470
is like a collective function
of all the different harmonics.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.140
And so one
interesting thing that

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.030
happens when you
mistune a harmonic

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.520
is that for very
small mistunings,

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.964
that initially causes a
bias in the perceived pitch.

00:36:56.964 --> 00:36:58.380
And so that's
what's plotted here.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:02.490
So this is a task where somebody
hears this complex tone that

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.600
has one of the harmonics
mistuned by a little bit.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.695
And then they hear
another complex tone.

00:37:05.695 --> 00:37:07.470
And they have to adjust
the pitch of the other one

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:08.610
until it sounds the same.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.160
All right, and so what's
being plotted on the y-axis

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.590
in this graph is
the average amount

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.160
of shift in the pitch match
as a function of the shift

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.810
in that particular harmonic.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.705
And for very small
mistunings of a few percent,

00:37:21.705 --> 00:37:23.580
you can see that there's
this linear increase

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.750
in the proceeded pitch.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.375
All right, so the
mistune that harmonic

00:37:26.375 --> 00:37:28.420
causes the pitch to change.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.960
But then once the mistuning
exceeds a certain amount,

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.210
you can actually see
that the effect reverses.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.040
And the pitch shift goes away.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.704
And so we think
what's happening here

00:37:36.704 --> 00:37:38.370
is that the mechanism
in your brain that

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.190
is computing pitch
from the harmonics

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:44.370
somehow realizes that one of
those harmonics is mistuned

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.120
and is not part
of the same thing.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.780
And so it's excluded from
the computation of pitch.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.410
So the fact that you segregated
those sources then somehow

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:55.600
happened prior to or
in at the same time

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.980
as the calculation of the pitch.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.360
Here's another
classic demonstration

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.770

related to harmonicity.

00:38:11.064 --> 00:38:12.480
and what's going
to happen here is

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.510
that the even harmonics-- two,
four, six, eight, et cetera,

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.690
will become frequency modulated
in a way that's coherent.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.947
And so, initially, you'll
hear this kind of one thing.

00:38:20.947 --> 00:38:23.280
And then it will sort of
separate into these two voices.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.080
And it's called the
oboe because the oboe

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.270
is an instrument that has a lot
of power at the odd harmonics.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.080
And so you'll hear
something that

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.330
sounds like an oboe along
with something that, maybe, is

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.580
like a voice that has vibrato.

00:38:34.215 --> 00:38:37.680
[OBOE AND VIBRATO SOUNDS]

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.780
Is that work for everybody?

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.070
So all these things
that are being affected

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.450
in kind of interesting ways by
the reverb in this auditorium,

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.760
which will--

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.870
yeah, but that mostly works.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.400
So we've done a
little bit of work

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.580
trying to test whether the brain
uses harmonicity to segregate

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.370
actual speech.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.430
And so very
recently, it's become

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.180
possible to manipulate speech
and change its harmonicity.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.670
And I'm not going to tell
you in detail how this works.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.610
But we can resynthesize
speech in ways that

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:16.900
are either harmonic like this.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.770
This sounds normal.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:19.630
[FEMALE VOICE 2] She
smiled and the teeth

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:23.080
gleamed in her beautifully
modeled olive face.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.640
But we can also resynthesize
it so as to make it inharmonic.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.740
And if you look at
the spectrium here,

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.281
you can see that the harmonic
spacing is no longer regular.

00:39:29.281 --> 00:39:31.030
All right, so we've
just added some jitter

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.740
to the frequencies
of the harmonics.

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.210
And it makes it sound weird.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.220
[FEMALE VOICE 2] She
smiled and the teeth

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.480
gleamed in her beautifully
modeled olive face.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.310
But it's still perfectly
intelligible, right.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.590
And that's because the
vocal tract filtering

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.089
that I think Hynek
is probably going

00:39:46.089 --> 00:39:48.600
to tell you about this
afternoon remains unchanged.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.641
And so the notion here is
that if you're actually

00:39:50.641 --> 00:39:53.770
using this harmonic
structure to kind of tell you

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.980
what parts of the sound
signal belong together-- well,

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.056
and if you've got a mixture
of two speakers that

00:39:59.056 --> 00:40:00.430
were in harmonic,
you might think

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:03.340
that it would be harder to
understand what was being said.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.594
So he gave people this
task where we played them

00:40:06.594 --> 00:40:09.010
words, either one word at a
time, or two concurrent words.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.200
And we just asked them to
type in what they heard.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.560
And then we just score
how much they got correct.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.909
And we did this with a bunch
of different conditions

00:40:16.909 --> 00:40:18.200
where we increased the jitters.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.615
So there's harmonic--

00:40:19.615 --> 00:40:21.460
[MALE VOICE 3]
Finally, he asked,

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.040
do you object to petting?

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.860
I don't know why my
Rh has this example.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.410
But, whatever-- it's
taken from a corpus

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:32.000
called TIMIT that has a
lot of weird sentences.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.540
[MALE VOICE 3]
Finally, he asked,

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.810
do you object to petting?

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:39.300
Finally, he asked, do
you object to petting?

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.240
Finally, he asked, do
you object to petting?

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.740
All right, so it kind of gets
stranger and stranger sounding

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:45.573
than a bottom's out.

00:40:45.573 --> 00:40:48.070
These are ratings of
how weird it sounds.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.530
And these are the results of
the recognition experiment.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.446
And so what's being
plotted is the mean number

00:40:52.446 --> 00:40:55.420
of correct words as a
function of the deviation

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.200
from harmonicity.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.557
So 0 here is perfectly harmonic,
and this is increasing jitter.

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.390
And so the interesting
thing is that there's

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.042
no effect on the recognition
of single words, which

00:41:04.042 --> 00:41:06.250
is below ceiling, because
these are single words that

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:07.450
are excised from sentences.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:10.580
And so they are actually
not that easy to understand.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.370
But when you give
people pairs of words,

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:15.750
you see that they get worse
at recognizing what was said.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.699
And then the effect
kind of bottoms out.

00:41:17.699 --> 00:41:19.240
So this is consistent
with the notion

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.520
that your brain is
actually relying, in part,

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.920
on the harmonic structure
of the speech in order

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.380
to pull, say, two
concurrent speakers apart.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.924
And the other thing
to note here, though,

00:41:31.924 --> 00:41:34.090
is that the effect is
actually pretty modest, right.

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.131
So you're going from, I
don't know, this is like,

00:41:36.131 --> 00:41:39.430
0.65 words correct on
a trial down to 0.5.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.020
So it's like a 20% reduction.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.155
And the mistuning thing
also works with speech.

00:41:43.155 --> 00:41:44.030
This is kind of cool.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.930
So here we've just
taken a single harmonic

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.160
and mistuned it.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.290
And if you listen to that,
I think this is this--

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:52.857
you'll basically-- you'll
hear the spoken utterance.

00:41:52.857 --> 00:41:54.940
And then it will sound
like there's some whistling

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.230
sound on top of it.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.834
Because that's what the
individual harmonic sounds

00:41:58.834 --> 00:41:59.500
like on its own.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.430
[FEMALE VOICE 3] Academic Act

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.363
So you might have
been able to hear--

00:42:05.363 --> 00:42:06.560
I think this is the--

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.962
[WHISTLING SOUND]

00:42:09.962 --> 00:42:12.750
That's a little quiet.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.196
But if you listen again.

00:42:15.196 --> 00:42:18.244
[FEMALE VOICE 3] Academic Act
2 guarantees your diploma.

00:42:18.244 --> 00:42:19.910
Yeah, so there's this
little other thing

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.535
kind of hiding there
in the background.

00:42:21.535 --> 00:42:22.850
But it's kind of hard to hear.

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.510
And that's probably because
it's particularly in speech

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.180
there's all these
other factors that

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.679
are telling you
that thing is speech

00:42:29.679 --> 00:42:32.390
and that belongs together.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.370
And, all right, let
me just wrap up here.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.190
So there's a bunch of other
demos of this character

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.740
that I could kind
of give you about--

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.217
I could tell you about.

00:42:41.217 --> 00:42:43.300
Another thing that actually
matters is repetition.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.447
So if there's something
that repeats in the signal,

00:42:45.447 --> 00:42:47.780
your brain is very strongly
biased to actually segregate

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.010
that from the background.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:52.529
So this is a demonstration
of that in action.

00:42:52.529 --> 00:42:54.320
So what I'm going to
be presenting you with

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.010
is a sequence of mixtures
of sounds that will

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.180
vary in how many there are.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.679
And then at the
end, you're actually

00:43:00.679 --> 00:43:03.110
going to hear the target sound.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:04.730
So if I just give you one--

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.550
[WHOPPING SOUND]

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.020
All right, it doesn't sound--

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.950
the sound at the end
doesn't sound like what

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.214
you heard in the first thing.

00:43:13.214 --> 00:43:15.380
But, here, you can probably
start to hear something.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.550
[WHOPPING SOUND]

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:19.010
And with here, you'll hear more.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.457
[WHOPPING SOUND]

00:43:21.457 --> 00:43:22.790
And with here, it's pretty easy.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:26.150
[WHOPPING SOUND]

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:29.060
All right, so each time you're
getting one of these mixtures--

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:29.960
and if you just get
a single mixture,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.430
you can't hear anything, right.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.800
But just by virtue of the
fact that there is this latent

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.270
repeating structure in there.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:36.800
Your brain is
actually able to tell

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.470
that there's a consistent
source and segregates that

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.420
from the background.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.910
I started off by telling you
that the only way that you

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.950
can actually solve
this problem is

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.500
by incorporating your knowledge
of the statistical structure

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.940
of the world.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.900
And, yet, so far the way that
the field has really moved

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.834
has been to basically
just use intuitions.

00:43:55.834 --> 00:43:57.500
And so people would
look at spectrograms

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.360
and they say, oh yeah,
there's harmonic structure.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.235
There's common onset.

00:44:00.235 --> 00:44:02.210
And so then you can do
an experiment and show

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.620
that has some effect.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.260
But what we'd really
like to understand

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.590
is how these so-called grouping
cues relate to natural sound

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:10.605
statistics.

00:44:10.605 --> 00:44:12.230
We'd like to know
whether we're optimal

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.360
given the nature of
real world sounds.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.740
We'd like to know whether
these things are actually

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.240
learned from
experience with sound--

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.396
whether you're born with them.

00:44:19.396 --> 00:44:21.020
The relative importance
of these things

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:24.370
relative to knowledge of
particular sounds like words.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.951
And so this-- I really regard
this stuff as in its infancy.

00:44:26.951 --> 00:44:28.700
But I think it's really
kind of wide open.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.100
And so the sort of
take-home messages

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.580
here are that there
are grouping cues

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.970
that the brain uses to
take the sound energy that

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:40.640
comes into your ears and assign
it to different sources that

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.890
are presumed to be related
to statistical regularities

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.000
of natural sounds.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.470
Some of the ones
that we know about

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:48.804
are, chiefly, harmonicity and
common onset and repetition.

00:44:48.804 --> 00:44:49.970
I didn't really get to this.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.730
But we also know that the brain
infers parts of source signals

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.800
that are masked
by other sources,

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.260
again, using prior assumptions.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.232
But we really need a proper
theory in this domain,

00:44:59.232 --> 00:45:01.190
I think, both to be able
to predict and explain

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:02.480
real world performance.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.480
And also, I think, to be able
to relate what humans are doing

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.190
this domain to the
machine algorithms

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.440
that we'd like to able to
develop to sort of replicate

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.880
this sort of competence.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.550
And the engineering-- there was
sort of a brief period of time

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:14.990
where there were some
people in engineering that

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:17.245
were kind of trying to
relate things to biology.

00:45:17.245 --> 00:45:19.370
But by and large, the fields
have sort of diverged.

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:21.360
And I think they really
need to come back together.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.985
And so this is going
to be a good place

00:45:22.985 --> 00:45:25.840
for bright young people to work.
