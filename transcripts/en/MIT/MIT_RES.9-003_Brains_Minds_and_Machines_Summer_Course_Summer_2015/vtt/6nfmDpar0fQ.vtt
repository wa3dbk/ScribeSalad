00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:23.465
LIZ SPELKE: I want
to talk about--

00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:27.506
you asked about development
of knowledge within infancy--

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:28.880
and I want to talk
about one case

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.088
where we've seen an interesting
developmental change.

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:33.687
One that I don't think we
really fully understand.

00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:35.270
I'm sure we don't
fully understand it.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.620
I'm not sure we
understand it at all.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.620
But it seems to be there.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.520
And it has to do with
effects of both, maybe,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.140
inertial properties
of object motion

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.200
and also effects of
gravity on object motion.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.090
Let me just tell you
the result first.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.850
These are studies that
were done by In-Kyeong Kim

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.770
a long time ago.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.020
But recently enough,
that video was

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.650
part of our toolkit, which
wasn't always the case,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.670
and involved showing
babies videotapes of events

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.980
in which an object
held by a hand

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.130
was placed on an inclined plane,
released, and started to move.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.870
And in one study,
babies either saw

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.110
a plane that was inclined
downward, the hand released it,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.250
and it rolled downward with
the natural acceleration,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.660
or the plane was inclined
upward, the hand released it,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.660
and it rolled
upward, decelerating.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.470
OK?

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.090
We studied this
in adults as well,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.490
and for adults, adults
reported that it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.107
looked like this hand
set the ball in motion.

00:01:37.107 --> 00:01:38.690
In fact, to control
the motion better,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.980
there was a sling shot apparatus
that actually set it in motion.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.250
But it underwent what looked
like a natural deceleration

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.959
from the point at which the hand
released it and as it rose up.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.750
Half the babies were
bored with this event,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.490
and half were bored with that.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.270
And then, at test, we
switched the direction

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.140
of the orientation
of the ramp so

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.140
that if babies had been seeing
something move downward, now

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.110
they were seeing events
in which it moved upward.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.889
And in one of those
two events, it

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.010
underwent the
natural acceleration

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.620
that adults would
expect, which is to say,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.670
a change in the motion that the
infants had previously seen.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.100
So these guys saw this
thing rolling downward

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.360
and accelerating.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.100
And here in the
natural event, they're

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.200
seeing something that's
being propelled upward,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.610
and it's decelerating.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.840
OK?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.080
In this event, they saw
the same motion pattern

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.160
that they saw before, so if
they saw speeding up here,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.720
they saw speeding up here,
contrary to effects of gravity

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.620
on object motion.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.160
OK.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.720
So the question
was, if the babies

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.550
were sensitive to
effects of gravity,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.280
they should look longer
when the thing accelerates,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.610
you know, speeds up
as it's moving upward

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.369
than they do when it slows
down as it's moving upward.

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.660
On the other hand, if they're
not sensitive to gravity,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.060
and they're just
representing these events

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.560
as speeding up or
slowing down, they

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.893
might show the opposite pattern.

00:03:01.893 --> 00:03:03.080
OK?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.960
And that's actually what
we found in both conditions

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.710
of that study.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.690
At five months of age, babies
showed the pattern opposite

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.440
to what adults would
expect, as if they thought

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.480
an object that speeds
up in the beginning

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.810
is going to continue speeding up
irrespective of the orientation

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.180
of that plane, with
respect to gravity, OK?

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.090
So failure at five months,
success at seven months.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.870
At seven months,
we get a reversal,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.930
and they flip in their
looking times here.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.470
Well, we thought,
maybe the 5-month-olds

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.720
will succeed at a simpler task.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.550
Suppose we start
out just showing

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.500
them a flat surface
and constant speed,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.850
so we're not engendering
any expectation

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.860
that this object is going
to speed up over time

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.090
or slow down over time.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.680
They're just seeing
a constant motion,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.040
and then they get
tested with events

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.260
in which the object is
placed either at the top

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.970
or at the bottom of this ramp.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.490
It's released, and it
speeds up in both cases.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.080
In that case, will they view
this motion as more natural

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.330
and look longer at that one?

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.060
Or, you might ask, would they
show the opposite pattern

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.060
[AUDIO OUT] if these events
are difficult for them,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.320
show the opposite pattern?

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.089
What they actually
showed was absolutely

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.180
no expectation, the
5-month-olds, in that case.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.170
OK?

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.770
They seemed utterly
uncommitted as to whether it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.020
was more natural for the
thing to be moving downward

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.270
than to be moving
upward after seeing

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.270
it move on this flat surface.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.850
Then, at seven months, kids
responded as adults would.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.280
Then we thought, maybe there's
just a problem with video.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.700
Maybe kids don't understand
that vertical in a video

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.082
corresponds to vertical
in the real world.

00:04:46.082 --> 00:04:47.540
So we just ran a
control experiment

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.000
to see if that was true,
by familiarizing kids

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.770
with downward motion
in the real world

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.070
and then presenting those
same two test events.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.237
And now they showed the
pattern that adults would show.

00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:59.570
That's not showing any knowledge
here, it's just saying,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.570
yeah, they can distinguish
downward from upward,

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.650
and they can relate
real events to video.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.280
But they don't seem to have any
prior expectation that objects

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.090
will move downward when they're
rolling on an inclined plane.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.790
And all these things seem to
develop between five and seven

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.200
months, which I
think provides us

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.625
with an interesting window for
asking what's developing here.

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:20.330
One possibility is
what's developing

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.800
is something very local.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.020
But I don't think
so, because there's

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.160
another change also occurring
between five and seven

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.967
months in what looks like
a very similar situation.

00:05:30.967 --> 00:05:33.050
These are experiments that
were conducted in Renée

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.620
Baillargeon's lab, where she did
these very simple studies where

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.600
you'd have a single
object in an array,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.060
and then a hand would come
in holding another object

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.740
and place it on that array.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.890
And in that top study, she
compares infants' reactions

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.820
when the hand places the object
on top of the box, releases it,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.890
and it stays there,
versus places

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.710
the object on the side
of the box, releases it,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.970
and it stays there.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.290
OK?

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.880
Now, if you're a
3-month-old infant,

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.800
you are equally happy
with those two events.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.690
You do not look
differentially at them.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.180
But by five months, infants do.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.710
They look longer when the object
seems to be stably supported

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.500
by the side of the box, than
when it's stably supported

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.160
by the top of the box.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.620
But then she goes on
and asks, do infants

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.950
make distinctions among
objects that are stably

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.100
supported from below?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.725
As, by the way, they were in all
those studies with the rolling

00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:26.319
on the ramps, right?

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.860
Do they make the
kind of distinctions

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.540
that we would make
based on the mass

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.610
of the object, the physical
force on the object,

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.180
and so forth?

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.382
And to get at that,
she did a second study

00:06:34.382 --> 00:06:35.840
where she has a
box, and she either

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.540
places it in the middle
of the top box or way

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.270
off to the side where we
would expect it to fall, OK,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.920
not to be stably supported.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.650
7-month-olds get that
right, 5-month-olds do not.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.622
So across these
different situations,

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:49.580
it looks like we have
this developmental change

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.230
in what infants know.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.320
I mean, I think these studies
raise a lot of questions

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.690
that they don't answer
about what infants are

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.887
learning over this time period.

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:01.470
I'm excited about
that because I think

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.080
they also give us a method for
addressing those questions.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.990
OK.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.475
And Tomer has been working
on chasing that [AUDIO OUT],,

00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:12.560
which would be great.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.170
OK.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.697
So I've been asked
already by a bunch of you,

00:07:15.697 --> 00:07:18.030
what happens at the very
beginning of visual experience?

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.304
I do have some slides on that.

00:07:19.304 --> 00:07:20.970
I do want us to take
a break, but let me

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.460
go through them very quickly.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.420
There's been a little bit
done with newborn infants,

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.870
and where they've been
studied under conditions where

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.620
we are confident that they're
able to see what they're

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.000
being presented with.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.840
It looks as if some of these--

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.476
there's evidence for these
abilities in newborns,

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:41.850
but most of the
things I told you

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.220
about have not been
tested in newborn infants

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.350
and would be really
hard to test in them.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.410
But fortunately, humans
aren't the only animals

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.190
that have to be able to
find the objects in a scene

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.690
and track them through time.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.030
Other animals do that as well.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.260
And many animals seem to
succeed at representing objects

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.840
under the conditions
where infants succeed.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.970
The big problem we
have with animal models

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.590
is that in many
cases, the animals

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.510
are way more competent
than the infants.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.940
And they succeed in cases
where infants would fail.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.540
OK?

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.081
But at least where
they succeed where

00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:15.750
infants succeed, we
can ask, what would

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.400
happen with controlled rearing?

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.110
And can we at least
get an existence proof

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.680
that in a mechanism of the
sort, that the abilities

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.930
that we see in infants
can be performed

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:29.040
by some nervous system
on first encounters

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.100
with visible objects
and types of events

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.620
that it's now being
asked to reason about?

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.510
So this has been done with
controlled reared experiments.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.590
I'm going to talk
about just a few,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.659
show you the results of
just a few experiments

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.250
that were done on chicks.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.140
Chicks are being
used a lot lately

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.580
because they grow up pretty
quickly, they're easy to raise,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.930
and they show this innate
behavior toward objects.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.610
That gives us a nice
indicator, which

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.010
is in some ways a little bit
like preferential looking,

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.470
though opposite in sign.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.532
They imprint if you show
them an object repeatedly,

00:09:04.532 --> 00:09:06.240
and a chick has been
isolated, so there's

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.930
no other chicks or hens
around in its environment.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.170
The object is the only
moving object they see.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:18.720
They will imprint to it,
treat it like another--

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.680
behave as they would with
their mom, were she there.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.080
And in particular, if
you then take the chick

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.180
and put them in a
novel environment

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.890
where they're a
little bit stressed,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.100
they will tend to
approach that object.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.130
So this has the same
logic as looking longer

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.910
at a novel thing.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.130
You have a selective
approach to a familiar thing,

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.580
and you can now run, on chicks,
the kinds of experiments that

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.190
have been run on human infants.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.724
So here is one
imprinted chick to a--

00:09:46.724 --> 00:09:48.390
these are experiments
that have actually

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.020
been done a while ago, in
some case they're much more

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.230
recent, imprint a
chick to a triangle,

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.230
and then present them with
a triangle whose center is

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.210
missing, either
because it's occluded

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.430
or because there's a gap there.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.946
Who's mom in this case?

00:10:03.946 --> 00:10:05.820
The one with the occluded
center, not the one

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.320
with the gap at the center.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.980
OK?

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.990
Consistent with
findings with infants

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.250
in one way, these chicks
are perceiving occlusion,

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.350
but they're doing
better than the infants.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.944
This works when the objects
move behind the occluder.

00:10:18.944 --> 00:10:20.610
If you move objects
behind the occluder,

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.260
you get all the same
kind of motion effects

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.880
that I was talking
about with infants.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.990
But it also works if the
object is stationary.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:30.160
So the chicks are better than
the infants in that case.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.800
What about object permanence?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.810
Here's a task that
babies can't solve

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.390
until they're 12 months old--

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.950
well, eight months in this
case, 12 months in this case--

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.420
that chicks solved
the first time

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.560
they're presented with an
imprinted object that moves out

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.060
of you.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.976
I should have said that
on the previous slide.

00:10:49.976 --> 00:10:53.730
The chicks never saw occlusion
until the imprinting test.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.750
Here, they're imprinted to mom
on the first two days of life,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.970
but there's no other
surfaces in the environment,

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.610
so they never see her
occluded by another surface.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.410
Maybe they see her occluded by
their own wing or something,

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.070
but not by other objects
in the environment.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.940
OK.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.050
There's two screens there.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.210
A chick is restrained
in a Plexiglas box

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.060
and sees mom disappear
behind one of the screens.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.350
They will go and search
behind that screen for her.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.570
Only at 12 months
do human infants

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.130
solve the following problem.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.380
Mom has disappeared
behind and been

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.440
found behind this screen
five times in a row.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.590
Now she goes there,
where will chicks search?

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.260
A baby, until 12 months, will
search behind the first place

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.254
where she was hidden, where
they found her in the past.

00:11:37.254 --> 00:11:40.770
A chick is more like
a 12-month-old baby,

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.101
shows the more mature pattern.

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:43.350
He goes where mom actually is.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.970
AUDIENCE: Are these
images or actual moms?

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.386
LIZ SPELKE: These
are actual moms.

00:11:46.386 --> 00:11:48.480
This is imprinting
to either a ping pong

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.620
ball in some of these studies
or a cylinder in other studies,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.600
dangles on a wire during
the imprinting period

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.190
so you can see that it moves.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.740
It moves here, and
it kind of dangles

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.061
and moves behind one
screen or another screen.

00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:02.060
And then the chick is
released, and the question

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.325
is where will the chick go?

00:12:03.325 --> 00:12:03.825
Yeah.

00:12:03.825 --> 00:12:06.249
AUDIENCE: Are
these other chicks?

00:12:06.249 --> 00:12:07.790
LIZ SPELKE: I think
they imprint them

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.470
for two days post hatching.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.970
So they're hatched
in an incubator.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.600
In the killer study I'm
going to tell you about,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.280
the incubator's in the dark.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.647
They spend two days in--

00:12:18.647 --> 00:12:20.480
I think they spend a
day in the dark getting

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.040
used to just walking around.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.080
And then starts the
visual experience,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.150
and it's controlled,
so no occlusion.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.080
But you do see this one object
that they get to imprint you,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.080
and then they later
go toward the object.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.630
OK?

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:39.080
So an existence proof that
such a capacity could exist

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.900
doesn't tell us that it does
exist in a young infant,

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.310
but it could.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.830
Here's the one that
was done recently,

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.850
that's my favorite study
in this series on solidity.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:55.130
OK, here's a study where the
chick is hatched in the dark

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.740
and spends most of the day
for the first three days

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.240
of its life in the dark.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.370
But during a certain
period each day,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.415
it's put in a Plexiglas
box with black walls,

00:13:04.415 --> 00:13:07.610
a black floor, black ceiling.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.430
And through the Plexiglas,
there is a single object that

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.550
dangles that they imprint to.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.160
OK?

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.740
Now, they can't
touch the object,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.230
so they never get evidence
whether this object is solid

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.730
or not.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.450
They can't peck at it, right?

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.270
They can peck, but
they can only peck

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.670
at this black surface
that they can't see

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.070
or at this transparent surface
that they also can't see.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.857
So they might learn there are
objects in the environment,

00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:34.190
but they're not going to have
any visual characteristics

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.200
like this guy does.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.670
OK?

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.210
All right.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:44.330
So then after this experience,
the chick stays in this box,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.090
and in that box, sees
a series of events

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.820
involving this object.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.530
In the first set of
experiments, the object

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.490
moves behind one screen
and then is revealed there,

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.600
or moves behind the other screen
and then is revealed there.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.940
In this particular
study, the chick

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.130
does not get to go out
to get to that object.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.280
They did a series of studies
before this one where they did,

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.738
but in this case
study, they don't.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.620
Then they see a second set
of events where all they see

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.940
is mom starts moving toward the
space between the two screens.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.120
Then there, a screen
comes down, so they

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.770
can't see what happens next.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.550
And then when the
screen comes up,

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.850
she is no longer
visible, but she then

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.310
emerges behind either
one screen or the other,

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.290
basically teaching
the chicks, in effect,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.290
mom can go behind each
of these two screens,

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.970
OK, either of these two screens.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.590
And then comes
the critical test.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.530
In the critical test, mom starts
moving toward the midpoint

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.550
of the two screens.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.980
The screen comes down, and
when the screen-- sorry,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.630
the big occluder--
vision is blocked,

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.537
and then when that
curtain raises again

00:14:55.537 --> 00:14:57.120
and the two screens
are again visible,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.860
they've been rotated backward.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.550
And across a series of studies,
they vary the size of mom

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.250
and the degree of
rotation of the screen.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.860
And the question is, will
the chick go to the side

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:12.000
where the screen's rotation is
consistent with a solid object?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.470
And they do.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.430
I want to argue from that that
knowledge of solidity-- well,

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.620
knowledge in some
sense-- representations

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.620
that accord with solidity
is innate in chicks.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.780
And what I mean by
innate is simply

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.330
that it's present and
functional on first encounters

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.497
with objects that
exhibit that property.

00:15:29.497 --> 00:15:31.080
This chick has not
had the opportunity

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.610
to peck at these
objects, or observe

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.350
them bumping into each
other, or anything like that.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.890
And the first time they see
this degree of rotation,

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.870
they make inferences that are
consistent with that principle.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.490
This doesn't tell us
that human infants do it.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.180
To be convinced
of that, I'd want

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.200
to see evidence for this
ability in an animal that's

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:55.210
a much better model for
human object cognition.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.519
Or I'd want to see more
evidence from the chicks

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.310
to convince me that,
actually, the chick is

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.374
a really good model of
human object cognition.

00:16:01.374 --> 00:16:02.790
But I do think it
should encourage

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.990
us to start thinking about how
nervous systems could be wired

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.610
to exhibit this property in the
absence of specific learning

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.830
and experiences with it.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:18.440
Here are some questions that
we could talk about in the Q&amp;A

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.365
later.

00:16:20.365 --> 00:16:23.640
I can give you the
one-liner on it.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.290
On the issue of
compositionality,

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.640
the question is, do babies
have a laundry list of rules

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.040
about how objects
are going to behave,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.830
or are they building some
kind of unitary model

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.790
of the world that accords with
certain general properties?

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.100
I think the evidence,
starting at least

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.330
at eight months of age--

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:43.860
lower than that, we don't know--

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.810
but starting at that
age, I think the evidence

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.820
favors the second possibility.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.830
It comes primarily from
these beautiful studies

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.580
that were conducted by
Susan Carey and her students

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.470
and collaborators where
they presented infants

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.740
with an event that
violated cohesion.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.400
So this could be a sand pile
that's poured onto a stage,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.790
or a cookie that's
broken into two pieces

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:13.440
before those pieces
are put in boxes,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:21.089
or a block that falls apart
when it's hit by another block.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:25.740
And then, she asks, having
seen that this object violated

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.410
this property, do they
expect it to accord

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.660
with the other properties?

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.120
And the answer is
no, they don't.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.690
OK?

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.620
So for example, if
you've seen, there's--

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.500
in that causality study where
an object moves behind a screen,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.330
and then another
thing starts to move--

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.270
if instead of starting
to move, it falls apart--

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.660
it violates cohesion,
falls apart--

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.890
infants no longer expect
the first object to hit it.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.250
OK?

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.086
Maybe it fell apart
on its own, OK?

00:17:55.086 --> 00:17:56.460
They don't assume
that it's going

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.650
to behave like an object
in other respects.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.680
They also don't assume that sand
piles will move continuously,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.650
that they won't pass
through surfaces,

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.280
that a cookie that is
broken in two-- if you have

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.980
two cookies in one box and one
cookie in the other, the babies

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.965
crawl to the two.

00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:14.340
But if you have one large
cookie, and you break it in two

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.840
and put it in one box, they're
neutral between those two

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.340
options.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.871
OK?

00:18:17.871 --> 00:18:20.370
So it looks like the system is
acting like an interconnected

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.310
whole.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.320
What the babies learn about one
aspect of an object's behavior

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.410
bears on the inferences they
make about other aspects

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.330
of its behavior.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.060
The final thing I want
to end with that I think

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.730
makes this point
is very recent work

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.370
that was conducted
by Lisa Feigenson--

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.070
that I think Laura Schulz
may talk about as well.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:45.510
Josh mentioned it last Friday,
but didn't really describe it--

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.660
that I think suggests that at
least at the end of infancy--

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.666
and again, we don't know
what's happening earlier--

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:54.040
infants' understanding
of objects

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.850
isn't only forming an
interconnected whole,

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.060
but it centers on abstract
notions about the causes

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.060
of object motions.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.560
So these are studies that
picked up on some old findings

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.390
from a variety of labs.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.680
Here's one that
Baillargeon had worked on,

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.920
and I did studies on it
as well, where infants

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:21.080
see an object that's moving in
an array that has two barriers,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.486
but the barriers are
mostly hidden by a screen,

00:19:24.486 --> 00:19:26.110
and the object moves
so that it's fully

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.160
hidden by the screen.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.590
The question is, where
will it come to rest?

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.365
Looking time studies
say babies expect

00:19:31.365 --> 00:19:34.240
it to come to rest at the
first barrier in its path.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.120
They look longer if they find
it when the screen is raised

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.440
behind the second barrier, as if
it passed through that surface

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.770
in its path, a
solidity violation.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.770
Here's another study that
Baillargeon and others

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.650
have studied showing that
by three months of age,

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.890
infants expect objects to fall
in the absence of support.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:54.340
If you push a
truck along a block

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.730
so that it stops, but under
conditions where it stops, when

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.000
it gets to the end of the block
or continues off the block

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.750
and doesn't fall, infants look
longer in the latter case.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.324
And what Feigenson
asked is, suppose

00:20:07.324 --> 00:20:09.490
we don't let look infants
look as long as they want.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.170
Suppose we limit
their looking time

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.020
to just a couple of seconds,
so they've looked equally

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.680
at these two outcomes.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.950
What is their internal state?

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.430
Are they just bewildered in
the case where the object did

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.380
something impossible?

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.310
Or are they seeking
to understand

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.750
what's happening in the world?

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.610
Is this a learning
signal for them?

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.719
So she did two experiments--

00:20:32.719 --> 00:20:33.760
actually, more than two--

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.460
but asked two questions
with experiments.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.820
One question was,
suppose after showing

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.390
this event, or this event,
or this, or this one,

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.790
after showing an event where
an object behaves naturally

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.880
versus apparently
unnaturally, you now

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.520
teach infants in effect, try
to teach infants in effect

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.210
some new property of the object.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.940
So you pick the object
up and squeak it.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.356
And the question
is, do the babies

00:20:56.356 --> 00:20:58.900
learn that the object
makes that sound?

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:04.150
And what she finds is that
the infants learn much more

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.750
consistently about the object
whose previous behavior was

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.600
unpredicted than about the
object whose previous behavior

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.550
was predictable.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.275
OK.

00:21:12.275 --> 00:21:14.650
I think this is both good news
and bad news about all the

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.811
looking time methods I've
been telling you about.

00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:18.310
The good news is
looking time really

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.040
does seem, when you let babies
look for as long as they want,

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.620
it really does look like
that's tracking what they're

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.850
seeking to learn about their
exploration and learning.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.580
The bad news is that when
you restrict looking time

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.396
to just a very short
amount of time,

00:21:32.396 --> 00:21:34.520
there are many, many things
that could be going on.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.710
They could be attending
a lot, or they

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.876
could be attending a little.

00:21:36.876 --> 00:21:39.680
It's a very crude measure
that's not telling us that.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.340
But here's a richer measure
suggesting differential

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.200
learning in these two cases.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.570
The other study, I
think, is even cooler.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.410
In the other studies, after
showing infants a violation

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.110
event, she handed
infants the object,

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.220
and allowed them to
explore it, and looked

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.730
to see what they would do.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.430
And what she found is that they
do different things depending

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.050
on the nature of violation.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.660
So when there was a
solidity violation,

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.780
they take the object, and
they bang it on the tray

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.500
in front of them.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.220
OK?

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.070
In the case of a
support violation,

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.990
they take the object,
and they release it.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.550
OK?

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.854
So if they're specifically
oriented at 11 months,

00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:18.520
and we don't know
what happened earlier,

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.590
they're specifically oriented
to expected properties

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.030
of the object that could be
relevant to understanding

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.940
the apparent violation
that they saw.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.530
To summarize, it
looks like there

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.280
is a system that is growing
over the course of infancy,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.380
as it's clear from
all the questions

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.630
that we can continue to discuss.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.930
There's a lot we don't
know about this system.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.210
But at no point
in development do

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.610
infants seem to
be perceiving just

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.920
a two-dimensional, disorganized
world of sensory experiences.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.220
At no point do they seem
oriented to events going on

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.830
in the visual field as
opposed to the real world

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.414
when you test them
in these situations

00:22:58.414 --> 00:22:59.830
where you're asking
them questions

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.210
about properties of the world.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.390
They seem to be oriented to
properties of the world itself.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.920
And to start out
already, as early

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.960
as we can test them,
in a few cases,

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.750
like the center-occluded
objects, that means newborns.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.420
To start out already
with a system which,

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.340
although it's radically
different from ours,

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.370
we see that most of the
things that we know about,

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.580
most of the information we can
get about objects from a scene,

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.050
they do not get.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:27.246
Nevertheless, we're seeing
core skeletal abilities

00:23:27.246 --> 00:23:28.870
that we continue to
use throughout life

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:33.250
and that seem to be present to
serve as a basis for learning.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.800
There have been lots of
studies in which infants

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:40.000
have been presented with people
or other self-propelled objects

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.610
that have used the same logic
as the studies for looking

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.800
at naive physics to get
at something like naive

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.150
psychology in infancy, what
they know about object motion.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.920
Most of them are
on babies that are

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.505
older than the babies
from the object studies.

00:23:53.505 --> 00:23:57.220
Those studies ran mostly up
to about four months of age.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.730
These studies are
starting later than that,

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.755
but they give us
a starting point.

00:24:02.755 --> 00:24:06.106
And here's one slide that
tries to capture just

00:24:06.106 --> 00:24:08.230
about everything that I
think we know about what 6-

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.910
to 12-month-old infants,
how they represent agents.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.970
First of all, they represent
people's actions on objects

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.840
as directed to goals.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.110
So this is a basic study
that was conducted--

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.180
a whole series of
studies, one of many--

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.280
conducted by Amanda
Woodward, who

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.170
was the advisor for
Jessica Sommerville, who

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.717
will be here giving a talk
on Thursday afternoon.

00:24:29.717 --> 00:24:32.050
They're very simple studies
in which she presents babies

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.600
with two objects side
by side, and then they

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.680
see a hand reach out and grasp
one of those two objects.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.070
And the question is, how do
babies represent that action?

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:45.610
Do they represent it as a motion
to a position on the left,

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.550
or do they represent
it as an action

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.130
with the goal of
obtaining the ball?

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.930
And to distinguish
those two possibilities,

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.810
she then reverses the
positions of the two objects,

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.640
presents the hand
in alternation,

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.190
taking a new trajectory
to the old object

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.410
versus the old trajectory
to a new object.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.720
And the babies look
longer when the hand goes

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.940
to the new object,
suggesting not

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.590
that they can't
represent trajectories,

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.380
but that they care more about--

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.990
bigger news is the agent's goal.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.180
When the goal changes,
that's a bigger change

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.460
for the infant than
when the motion simply

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.870
changes to a new path
and a new endpoint.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:25.150
That's at as young as
five months of age.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.880
Then there's been studies
showing that infants' goal

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.380
attribution depends on what is
visible from the perspective

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.950
of the agent.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.330
So if two objects are present,
and the agent consistently

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.990
reaches for one of them,
babies in some sense,

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.500
in some poorly-understood
sense, represent that agent

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.150
as having a preference
for the object

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.920
that they've chosen to go
for over the other object.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.910
But if the object they
didn't go for is occluded,

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.430
and there's no evidence
that that agent ever saw it,

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.710
they don't make that
preference, inference.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.120
OK?

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.030
Third, infants represent
agents as acting efficiently.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.030
And this is true whenever
they're given evidence

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.640
for self-propulsion,
whether the object that's

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.080
moving in a
self-propelled manner

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.160
has the features
of an agent or not.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.460
So with these classic
studies by Gergely

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.850
and his collaborators that
continue to the present day,

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.180
but started, now, I
guess 20 years ago,

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.220
they present infants
with two balls

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.650
that engage in self-propelled
motion and even

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.420
a little kind of interaction.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.910
And then one of the balls
jumps over a barrier

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:29.200
to get to the other ball.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.230
And across a series of
familiarization trials,

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.850
the barrier varies in height.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.100
The jump is appropriately
adapted to it.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.960
And the question
is, what do infants

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.980
infer this agent will do when
the barrier is taken away?

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.400
Will it engage in one of its
familiar patterns of motion,

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.530
or will it engage in a
new pattern of motion

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.682
that's more efficient
to get to the object?

00:26:49.682 --> 00:26:51.640
And the finding is, they
expect that new motion

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.070
and look longer at
the more superficially

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:59.950
familiar but inefficient
indirect action.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:01.720
Here are my favorite studies.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.640
This is one that Shimon talked
about yesterday afternoon.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.290
He talked about one
version of this.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:12.130
The original study was
conducted by Sabina Pauen,

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.921
and Rebecca Saxe and Susan
Carey did interesting extensions

00:27:15.921 --> 00:27:16.420
on it.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.500
It uses the simplest
imaginable method.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.600
They present babies first
with two objects, stationary,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.390
side by side, one
with animate features,

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.940
a face and sort of a fuzzy
body, tail-like body,

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.880
the other, an inanimate ball.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.997
They're both stationary,
and the objects

00:27:33.997 --> 00:27:35.830
were chosen to be about
equally interesting.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.320
The babies look about
half the time at each one.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.070
Then, they see a series of
events in which these two

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.620
objects are stuck together
and undergo this very

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.460
irregular pattern of motion.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.340
This was actually some
kind of parlor trick

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.810
toy that was sold for a while.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.610
They got them started
on this study.

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:54.250
There's a mechanism inside the
ball that's actually propelling

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.810
the two objects around.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.170
But the question is,
which of these two objects

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.290
does the baby attribute
the motion to?

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.290
And to find that out, they
subsequently separated the two

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.410
objects again, and ask again,
which one will the infant look

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:09.040
at more?

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.020
And after seeing this
motion, the infant

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.960
looks more at the one that
has the animate features.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.720
Although both objects
underwent the same motion,

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.170
they attribute that motion to
this guy, not the other guy.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.480
It follows then that
they're perceiving

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.630
this-- they're representing this
guy as causing the other guy's

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:26.200
motion.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:26.440
Right?

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.780
The other guy is not seen
as causing its own motion.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.610
The motion is being
caused by this guy.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.400
This is at seven months of age.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.766
Now, even stronger evidence
that infants infer causal agents

00:28:36.766 --> 00:28:38.140
come from these
beautiful studies

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.600
that Rebecca Saxe, and Susan
Carey, and Josh Tenenbaum

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.050
conducted 10 years ago
now, that went back

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.910
to this efficient
situation where

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.370
you see an object
efficiently going over

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.650
barriers of variable
heights to get

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.590
to a new position on the stage.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.570
The one thing they
added is that the object

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.100
is manifestly inanimate.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.064
It's a beanbag.

00:28:58.064 --> 00:29:00.730
And the kid had a chance to play
with it before the study began.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.530
They can feel that this
is not an animate object.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.610
So if this isn't
an animate object,

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.520
and infants are actively
trying to explain

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.560
the motions of
objects that they see,

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.750
they're going to need
another kind of explanation.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.210
And what Saxe, Tenenbaum,
and Carey showed

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.100
is that infants
infer that there is

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.920
an agent, off-screen, on
this side of the screen, that

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.690
set that object in motion.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:26.020
And they show that by
their relative looking time

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.460
to an event where a hand comes
in on that side of the screen,

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.880
which is consistent with that
causal attribution, versus

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.880
it comes in on the other side,
which is inconsistent with it.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.460
And really, a
pretty manipulation.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.790
If in fact babies are making
causal attributions here,

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.860
then you ought to be
able to screen them off.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.770
If you make a simple
change to the method,

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.880
you show evidence that actually,
this object is animate.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.642
If it is animate, then you don't
need to infer another cause.

00:29:54.642 --> 00:29:56.350
So they ran that study
as well and showed

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.224
that when you change
from an inanimate object

00:29:58.224 --> 00:30:00.740
to an animate one, you no
longer get this effect.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.240
OK?

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.865
So it really looks like they're
seeking to explain these events

00:30:03.865 --> 00:30:06.010
and doing so in accord
with the principle

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.110
that agents can cause not
only their own motion,

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.510
but also can make changes
in the world, cause motions

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.130
and other changes in objects.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.780
And a final study
that shows this,

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.500
I told you that if a truck goes
behind a screen toward a box,

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.020
and then the box
subsequently collapses,

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.690
babies do not infer that
the truck hit the box.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:24.190
OK?

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.636
Collapsing takes this
outside the domain

00:30:26.636 --> 00:30:28.510
of physical reasoning
for those young babies.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:29.110
OK?

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.510
But suppose instead of a
truck going behind that-- this

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.950
is work by Susan Carey as well.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.280
Sorry, I should have put it
on here, Muentener and Carey.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.700
If instead of a truck, a
hand goes behind that screen,

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.000
now they infer that the
hand did contact the object.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.570
OK?

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.192
So hands can make things
move, and they not only

00:30:46.192 --> 00:30:47.650
can make things
move, they can make

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.816
things do all sorts of
things that objects otherwise

00:30:49.816 --> 00:30:52.270
won't do, like fall apart, OK?

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:52.910
All right.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:56.320
So one problem, as I said,
with all these studies

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.810
is that they're all older
infants, many of them

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:03.520
much older infants like 8- and
10-month-olds, just about all

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.850
of them 6 months old or older.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.480
And when you test
younger infants,

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.550
you get failures on
some of these tasks.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.840
So these goal attribution tasks
work with 5-month-old infants,

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.350
but they fail with
3-month-old infants.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.940
3-month-old infants
seem uncommitted as

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.460
to where this hand is
going to go once the two

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.080
objects exchange locations.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.060
And that raises the question--

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.860
to me, the most
interesting question--

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.810
what kinds of representations
of agents, if any,

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:36.190
does a younger infant
have before they're

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.940
able to act on the
world by manipulating

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.360
things, which starts
around five months of age?

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.150
And tell you just quickly, two
kinds of studies that I think

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.400
get at this--

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.250
imperfectly, but
they're getting there.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.620
One is, again, going
back to studies

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.540
of controlled reared animals.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.814
Chicks, again, in particular.

00:31:57.814 --> 00:31:59.230
There have been
imprinting studies

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.510
done where chicks are
raised in the dark,

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.140
and all they get to
see are video screens

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:09.250
in which you get two objects
engaging in this simple causal

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.410
billiard ball type event.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.570
One object starts to move,
contacts a second object,

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.710
and at the point of
contact, it stops moving,

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:19.890
and the other object
starts to move.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:20.620
OK?

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.400
And they see that repeatedly.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.230
And now, OK, I told you that if
chicks are raised in isolation,

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.960
but there's a moving object
there, they'll imprint to it.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.790
I was treating the
imprinting object

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.650
as just an example of an object.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.800
But of course, the
imprinting object is mom,

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.770
and she's an agent.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.500
So it should be a self-propelled
object, really, right?

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:43.030
So given a choice
between these two,

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.850
do they selectively imprint
to one over the other?

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.550
And the finding is that they do.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.234
The two objects have
different features,

00:32:51.234 --> 00:32:53.650
I think, different colors,
maybe different shapes as well.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.140
If you now present one of
them at one end of their cage

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.790
and the other at the
other end, they'll

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.660
go to object A over object
B as if they saw that

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.480
as the object that set the
other object in motion.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.900
But now you could ask, is that
because they see A as causal,

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.670
as causing its own motion?

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.740
Or is it for other superficial
reasons like A moved first,

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.460
or A was moving at the
time of the collision,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.140
and B was stationary?

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.600
So they tested for all of
these things one by one,

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.520
but this is their killer
experiment, the test

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.110
for all of them at once.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.880
They present exactly
the same events.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:29.440
The only difference is you
don't see A initially at rest

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.041
and starting to move.

00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:31.540
OK?

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:32.910
You never get to see that.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.000
There are screens on the
two ends of the display,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.860
so all you see is that A enters
the display already in motion

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.170
and contacts B. So you have
no evidence as to whether A

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:44.470
is self-propelled
or not, but you

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:47.680
see the two objects interacting
otherwise in the same way.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.760
That makes the effect
completely go away.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.790
I think this is
logically a little

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.530
like the studies
with infants where

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.630
you show that the thing
is animate or not,

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.940
and it effects whether
they expect that there's

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.950
an agent there or not.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.680
It suggests that infants
are representing A

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.600
as causing its own motion.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.850
They're representing it
as causing B's motions,

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.420
so A is a better object
of imprinting than B is.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:15.824
And all of this can
be abolished if A

00:34:15.824 --> 00:34:17.699
isn't seen to have the
first causal property,

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.960
they're not
inferring the second.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.780
So it's, again, an existence
proof kind of argument saying,

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.540
you can get this kind of system
working in an animal that

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.469
hasn't had prior visual
experiences in which they've

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:32.854
seen objects in motion or in
which they themselves have

00:34:32.854 --> 00:34:35.270
been-- they haven't had any
other encounters with objects,

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.659
so they haven't been able
to move things around.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.360
So that's one way of trying to
get at early representations.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.250
Here's another way
that I hope Sommerville

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.850
will talk about
on Thursday night,

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.310
because she pioneered this
method with Amanda Woodward

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:51.130
and Amy Needham.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.130
You can give a 3-month-old
infant, who otherwise wouldn't

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.770
be reaching for things
for another two months,

00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:00.550
you can give them the
ability to pick up objects

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:03.894
by equipping them with mittens
that have Velcro on them

00:35:03.894 --> 00:35:05.560
and presenting them
with Velcro objects.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.020
So now they can
make things move.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.650
And when you do that, you
see interesting changes

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.940
in their representations
of these events.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.330
So an infant who has
played with an object

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:20.800
while wearing a sticky
mitten, who subsequently looks

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.800
at events in which another
person wearing that mitten

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.970
reaches for that object
or for another object,

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.910
now they look like a
5-month-old and represent

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.280
that reaching as goal-directed.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.950
But on the other hand, if
they saw those same events

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:39.080
without the mittens,
they failed.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.500
So that's saying that
the infant's own action

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:46.150
experience can elicit these
action representations.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.820
And it raises, I think, all
sorts of interesting questions

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.120
about, do infants have
to learn one by one

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.010
what the properties
of agents are?

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:57.100
Or is it possible that
once these representations

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.020
of goal-directed
actions are elicited,

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.559
we'll see other knowledge
of agents already present?

00:36:02.559 --> 00:36:04.600
So let me just give you
one finding that suggests

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.100
we might get the second.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:12.400
This is a study that Amy Skerry
performed rather recently.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.830
She was interested in
this representation

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.230
of efficient action
before babies

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.390
are able to reach for and
pick up objects themselves.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:24.800
Do they already represent
the actions of agents

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.380
as directed to
goals efficiently?

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.100
Did they already expect that
agents will move efficiently

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.270
to achieve their goals?

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:36.220
So to get at that, she gave
infants, 3-month-old infants,

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.410
sticky mittens experience
with an object where

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:44.830
they got to pick up the
object and then showed them

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:48.460
events in one-- split them
into two different conditions,

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.380
and in both conditions,
they see events

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.520
in which a person moves on an
indirect path to an object.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.670
In one of the series of events,
there's a barrier in the way,

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:01.270
so that motion is the best way
to get there, probably the only

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:02.709
obvious way to get there.

00:37:02.709 --> 00:37:04.750
In the other case, the
barrier is in the display,

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.320
but it's out of the way, so
this is not an efficient action.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.240
And then at test, the barrier
is gone in both conditions,

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.550
and the person either
moves efficiently or moves

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.690
inefficiently.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.820
Now, in this control
condition, the baby

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.760
does not expect
efficient action.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.510
But in the condition
where they previously

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.060
had the sticky mittens
experience, which presumably

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.000
told them that this is
actually the person's goal,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.340
that they're attempting
to get there, once

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.190
they have that, what seems
to follow immediately

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.856
from that is this
efficiency, this principle

00:37:35.856 --> 00:37:37.480
of efficient action,
right, that you'll

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.940
move to the goal on the
most direct path possible,

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.070
even though you've never
seen that direct path.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.660
And even though
when the infant was

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.420
playing with the
object with the mittens

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.360
on and picking up objects for
the first time in his life,

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.890
there were no barriers present.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.630
They never had to do
anything indirect.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.840
They could always get
that object directly.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.310
Yet they're expecting
direct action

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:02.890
only when they've seen efficient
action in another agent.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.180
OK.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.560
So in summary, it looks like
these abilities are all there

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.130
quite early.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.880
They're unlearned,
at least some of them

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.160
are unlearned, in chicks.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.500
And they can be
elicited before--

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.740
at least some of them can be
elicited before reaching--

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.075
develops in young infants.

00:38:22.075 --> 00:38:23.950
But infants-- and this
is important, I think,

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.900
for what Alia's going
to be talking about--

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.180
infants' understanding
of agents is limited.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.550
It's radically limited, just
like their understanding

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:34.120
of inanimate objects is.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.990
And here are a few, I think,
really interesting limits.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.450
Although infants are
sensitive to what's

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:45.190
perceptually
accessible to an agent,

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:49.120
they don't seem to represent
agents as seeing objects.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.570
What do I mean by that?

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:53.470
Well, here's a experiment
with exactly the structure

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.410
of the Woodward
reaching experiment.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:59.020
Two objects present, and
a person acts with respect

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.010
to one of them.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.780
But instead of reaching
for one object,

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.940
she looks at one
of the two objects.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.060
And now, you ask, after you
exchange the two objects'

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.790
positions, do babies
find that she's

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:13.129
doing something newer if she
looks at the other object?

00:39:13.129 --> 00:39:14.920
Or do they find she's
doing something newer

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.600
if she looks in a
different direction

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.850
than she looked in before?

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:18.580
OK?

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.630
At 12 months, infants view
looking as object-directed,

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.190
by this measure.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.320
Younger than 12
months, they do not.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.400
They don't seem to view the
orientation of the person

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.860
as a look that's directed
to one of these two objects,

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.950
by that measure.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.550
Now, the age at
which they succeeded,

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.070
this is also the
first age at which

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:41.560
infants start to show this
really interesting pattern

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.390
in their communication
with other people,

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.592
that Mike Tomasello has
written about a lot.

00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:47.050
It's the first age
at which they'll

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:51.280
start to alternately
look at objects,

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.050
and look at another
person, and attempt

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.020
to engage their attention to
the object, by checking back

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.170
and forth between looks at the
person and looks at the object,

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.080
or by pointing to the object,
or by following another person's

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.977
point to an object.

00:40:02.977 --> 00:40:05.060
All of that comes in at
the end of the first year.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.820
It's not there earlier.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.640
Younger infants, younger
than about 12 months of age,

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.841
don't even seem to expect
that if a person reaches

00:40:12.841 --> 00:40:15.340
for one of two objects, they'll
tend to reach for the object

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.670
that they were looking at.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:17.170
OK?

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.900
We thought for sure babies would
succeed at that task early.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.400
They don't reliably
succeed at it

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.250
until 12 or even
14 months of age.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:27.070
And finally, babies
attribute first order but not

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.170
second order goals to agents.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:32.050
So if they see an
agent pull on a rake

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.030
and then reach for
an object, they

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:36.697
perceive the agent's goal
as the rake, not the object

00:40:36.697 --> 00:40:37.780
that they're reaching for.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.570
So very limited representations.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:44.580
Also, as far as we know, none
of these are unique to humans.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.330
I think this raised
all sorts of questions

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.960
that we might want to talk
about in the Q&amp;A later.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.020
What's the relationship between
infants' representations

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.330
of agents and their
representations of the things

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:56.770
that agents act on?

00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:02.540
Clearly, these should be related
in some interesting ways.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.230
Although, agents can do
things that objects can't do,

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.420
like move on their own,
and formulate goals,

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.870
and act on things that are
visually accessible to them.

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.060
Agents also are objects, right?

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.680
And we're subject to all
the constraints on objects.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.911
We can't walk through walls.

00:41:16.911 --> 00:41:19.285
If we want to make something
move, we have to contact it.

00:41:19.285 --> 00:41:23.320
And babies are sensitive
to those constraints.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.270
And I think this raises
all sorts of questions

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.870
that to date, research on
infants hasn't really answered.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.060
Is there some hierarchy
of representations

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.340
where you've got all
objects, and then you've

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.820
got these especially talented
objects that are agents, right?

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.910
Or I think one way Tomer has put
it is maybe we're all agents,

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.980
but objects are just
really bad agents, right,

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:44.270
that can't do very much.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.917
That's one possibility.

00:41:45.917 --> 00:41:47.500
It's also possible
that these are just

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.916
separate systems
at the beginning,

00:41:48.916 --> 00:41:52.960
and they have to get
linked together over time.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.630
I think these are all
answerable questions.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:59.780
I said that babies don't see
looking as directed to objects,

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:06.230
but they do from birth respond
in a pro-social way to looking

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.640
that's directed to them.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.680
So an infant will
look longer at someone

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.440
whose eyes are directed
to them than someone

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.010
whose eyes are looking away.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.260
That's true for human infants.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.020
It's also true for
infant monkeys.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.352
If a monkey is presented
with this display,

00:42:20.352 --> 00:42:22.310
and they're over here,
they'll look longer than

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.660
if they're over here.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.190
Right?

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.130
When they're here, it looks like
that guy is looking at them.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.695
They also, human
and monkey infants

00:42:30.695 --> 00:42:39.110
engage in eye-to-eye contact
with adults from birth.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.390
They also, human infants
and monkey infants

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.490
tend to imitate the
gestures of other people,

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:46.430
interestingly, only when those
people are looking at them,

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:47.960
not when they close their eyes.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.160
Then they'll imitate them as
you saw in those beautiful films

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.150
that Winrich showed
from the Ferrari group,

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.000
attentive to the person and
then trying to reproduce

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.450
the person's action.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.020
This has been shown with baby
chimpanzees and baby monkeys

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.590
as well as with human
newborn infants.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:10.970
And finally, I said infants
don't follow gaze to objects.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.330
That's true, but it's also true
that if they see a person who's

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.370
looking directly
at them, and then

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.650
the person's gaze
shifts to the side,

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:20.870
they'll continue to
look at the person,

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.840
but their attention will
undergo a momentary shift

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.290
in the direction of the shift
of the other person's gaze.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.860
OK?

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.080
So this has been shown
at two months of age

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.460
and also with newborn infants.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.560
It's been shown with
photographs of real faces

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.840
and also with schematic faces.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.204
The way to show that
attention is shifting

00:43:38.204 --> 00:43:40.370
is to present infants with
an event that could never

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.780
happen in the real world.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.450
You have an image of a face,
the eyes shift to the side,

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:47.240
either left or right, and
then the face disappears,

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.820
and a probe appears either
on the left or on the right.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.890
They'll get to the
probe faster if it

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.980
appears on the side to which
the person shifted their gaze.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.230
And nice control studies
show that it's not

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.770
just any kind of low level
motion in that direction that

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.390
gets them there.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:05.210
So this could be a
sign of something

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.160
like infancy direct gaze.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.100
And it engages something like
a state of engagement with

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.880
another person in which evidence
about the other person's state

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.110
of attention-- possibly also
emotion if the questionable

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:21.320
literature on empathy
emerging early is right--

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.770
this can be automatically
spread from one person

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.110
to a social partner.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.510
So the hypothesis
is that infants

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:35.090
are finding other
potential social partners

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:38.780
from the beginning
of life, by looking

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.820
at things like gaze
direction, maybe also

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.610
infant-directed speech, as a
signal that someone else is

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:47.420
engaging with them, by
interpreting patterns

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.790
of imitation as a
communicative signal

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.890
that somebody is
tracking what they do,

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:56.990
and acting in kind with
them, and interpreting shifts

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:59.390
of attention as-- you're
responding to shifts

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:02.240
of attention by shifting
their own mental states

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.510
in the same direction.
