00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.910
MATT WILSON: Now, why are
we interested in sleep?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330
So, we kind of think about
this as two modes, online mode

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.038
and offline mode.

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:29.920
In the online mode, you're
taking information in.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.600
In the offline mode,
you're going back

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.737
and evaluating information.

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:35.570
What's the purpose of
evaluating information

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.445
that you've taken in?

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:38.528
Well, if we think about
the general problem that's

00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:40.400
being solved, the
problem of intelligence.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.602
The problem of intelligence is
trying to understand and infer

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:47.810
these sort of deep generalizable
relationships rules.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.210
You're trying to extract
rules from instances.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.190
And you'd like those
rules to be as generally

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.840
applicable as possible.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.800
And in order to do
that, presumably, one

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.030
has to go back and evaluate
the many individual instances

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.000
to try to extract some kind
of statistical regularity,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.210
and then perhaps evaluate
models that you have constructed

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.250
in terms of their consistency
with individual instances

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.500
that you've already collected.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.470
Or perhaps future instances
that you haven't yet.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.974
So you have the raw material,
you build a little model,

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:22.640
and then you continually
test that model

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.040
against new information
that comes in.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.790
And the question is,
when can you do that?

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.840
Now, you could do
that when you're

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.740
out and about in the world.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.780
As you saw and read in that
paper, when animals are sitting

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.580
quietly, they very
quickly can switch

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.160
into this kind of offline mode
that looks a lot like sleep.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.235
In fact, electrophysiologically,
sleep and quiet wakefulness

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.280
in the hippocampus are
nearly indistinguishable.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.870
It's the same kind
of offline mode.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.920
It says, OK, when the
hippocampus is not

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.380
being used to take
new information in,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.120
I quickly switch into this
offline evaluation mode.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.200
But during sleep, I no
longer have the constraint

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.500
of having to direct behavior.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.220
Behavior's shut off,
inputs are shut off,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.420
and now I can switch into this
purely internal introspective

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.930
mode.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.280
So what goes on during sleep.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.510
In this simple experiment,
we look at the activity

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.950
when the animal is
performing behavioral tasks.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.070
And then we examine
activity during sleep,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.810
both before and after,
and ask, is there

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.020
anything about
behavioral experience

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.530
that changes activity
during sleep?

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.514
And what we found was that
if you look at activity

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:35.930
during behavior
in which you think

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.120
about these spatial
sequences being expressed,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.620
and you look during
sleep afterward,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.953
you find that the spatial
sequences are expressed again.

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:48.320
So the hippocampus replays the
firing of these cell sequences.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.970
But it replays the firing
of these cell sequences

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.284
at a time scale that appears
to be compressed relative

00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:55.450
to the behavioral timescale.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.130
So these are eight place cells.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.200
Animals were walking
from left to right.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.790
The ticks indicate that's
the location of the peak.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.290
So these place cells will
fire one through eight

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.791
as the animal moves along the
track over about five seconds.

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:10.248
That's how long it
takes the animal

00:03:10.248 --> 00:03:11.450
to walk from left to right.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.180
The same sequence of
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.130
gets replayed during
sleep, but now

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.730
over about 150 milliseconds.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.390
Same sequence, so you're
preserving time order,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.330
not absolute time.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.150
And that when you ask, when
these sequences are expressed,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
what's going on in the
local field potential

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.450
in these oscillations?

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.910
And this is where you find
these sharp wave ripple events.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.730
This is this ripple-like event
that I was describing to you.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.820
So these sharp wave
ripples are when

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.850
these apparently compressed
sequences are being expressed.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.670
I could point out that a simple
model for these sharp wave

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.850
ripple reactivated sequences
is the same model that I like

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.280
to use to explain
phase precession

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.480
during the fade oscillation.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.380
That is, I give it an
input, I sweep inhibition

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.890
from high to low such that cells
that are getting the strongest

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.840
input fire earlier.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.990
And this will
reactivate a sequence.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.870
So the difference
between a theta sequence

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.220
and a reactivated
sequence is really just,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.529
where's the input coming from.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:25.160
If the input's coming from what
I'm actually experiencing right

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.800
now, now it's a theta sequence.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.590
And as I move, the input
changes systematically.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.400
And so, again, it looks like
it's encoding information

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.810
about space.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.990
If I'm now offline,
and this information

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.270
is being delivered
to the hippocampus

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.970
from some other
source, you can apply

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.570
exactly the same operation,
get the same kind of sequence.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.070
It's just now it's
on information

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.855
that is not tied to your
immediate context or location.

00:04:57.855 --> 00:04:58.980
That's the only difference.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.271
Where is the input coming from?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.160
Now further, if you
think about this model,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.579
you can imagine the
depth of disinhibition

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:12.620
could actually affect the
length of the sequence.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.120
But that's just sort
of a mechanistic thing.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.050
And if you actually look
at the mechanisms that

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.090
regulate sharp wave ripples
in the theta oscillation,

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.880
it basically comes from
the same structure.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.530
It's a structure that
regulates acetylcholine,

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.380
and it's a neuromodulator
that's associated

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.750
with attention and
memory, and the structure

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.800
called the medial septum.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.560
So the medial septum
provides the drive,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.330
the cholinergic drive,
of the hippocampus.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.260
Damage to the medial septum,
loss of cholinergic tone,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.500
was one of the dominant models
of neurodegenerative cognitive

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.530
and memory loss in
Alzheimer's disease.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.060
So what you find is
one of the earliest

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.890
indications of neurodegenerative
damage in Alzheimer's is

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.450
the loss of cholinergic tone.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.350
And the systems that
begin to break down

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.110
are the systems that
actually fall along

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.260
this limbic pathway starting
with hippocampus-entorhinal

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.760
cortex.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.320
So it's as though the
cholinergic system that

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.290
regulates the expression of this
oscillation in the hippocampus,

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.410
when it breaks down, it
leads to general memory

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.030
loss and disruption.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.460
And it turns out the
medial septum is also

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.460
involved in regulating the
expression of these sharp wave

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.100
ripples.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.950
So, same system,
different modes.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.460
One quite active, online.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.290
One inactive, offline.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.680
Same kind of modulation
of excitability

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.940
through inhibition.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.620
But that's the idea.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.040
Simple model, sweep inhibition,
that gives you the sequences.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.860
And then if you can
control the input,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.150
you control the input
to control the content,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.710
you control the
inhibition to control

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.030
the structure of the timing.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.330
Those are the two things.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.496
So the question is, how
could you control the input?

00:07:05.284 --> 00:07:06.950
Well, you're kind of
thinking about what

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.886
is the input into
the hippocampus

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:10.010
under these two conditions.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.147
And as I mentioned,
hippocampus, you've

00:07:12.147 --> 00:07:13.230
got the entorhinal cortex.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.396
Entorhinal cortex gets
information across the brain.

00:07:15.396 --> 00:07:17.840
It's sort of these
sensory association areas,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.460
visual cortex, auditory cortex.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.530
So all this information
about the world

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.120
converging on the hippocampus
and then getting modulated.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.110
And so let's look in, for
instance, the visual cortex.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.860
So if we simultaneous
record visual cortex

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.500
and the hippocampus, we could
see how these two structures

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.940
communicate.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.460
And when we do this
in a simple task--

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.450
this is like a little
figure eight task--

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.270
and I won't go into
a lot of the details.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.895
But one interesting
thing that came out

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:44.436
from doing this
experiment, recording

00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:46.070
the visual cortex
and the hippocampus,

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.130
is that recording in the visual
cortex when an animal is moving

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.810
in space, what you find is
cells in the visual cortex

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.850
have spatial-like
receptive fields.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.460
Similar to the hippocampus,
though not as spatially tuned.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.980
But here, for instance, are
eight visual cortical cells.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.381
And you can see that
they fire in a sequence.

00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:10.380
They'll have different
spatial receptive fields.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.121
This shows where this one visual
cortical cell likes to fire.

00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:15.620
Different visual
cortical cells will

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.460
fire at different locations.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.250
So when animals are
moving in space,

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.560
you actually see
sequential activation

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.230
of these visual
cortical responses.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.590
And so if you have visual
perceptual sequences

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.900
in hippocampal
spatial sequences,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.830
one question is, how
do those sequences

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.409
relate offline when the animal,
for instance, during sleep.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.220
So you have sequences
during sleep

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.970
in the hippocampus,
sequences during sleep

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.650
in the visual cortex.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:49.250
And it turns out that those two
things are actually correlated.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:54.300
So when hippocampus plays
out a spatial sequence,

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.950
the visual cortex plays
out a visual sequence

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:02.500
that corresponds to the visual
responses at those locations.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.880
So hippocampus
plays out a sequence

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.970
of where it was,
visual cortex expresses

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.350
the visual stimuli that were
present along that sequence.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.660
One thing about
these sequences when

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.230
we're looking at hippocampal
neocortical interactions

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.590
is that the sequences are now
at a much longer time scale.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.760
And in fact this
time scale, which

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.950
here is on the order of about
half a second to a second,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.260
corresponds to
another oscillation

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.540
that is characteristic of sleep
known as the slow oscillation.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.620
So when you go to
sleep, brain rhythm,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.250
the oscillations, the dominant
frequencies start to slow down.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.700
And you'll get this
oscillation in this one

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.960
hertz or so frequency range.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.030
If you record activity
from a bunch of cells,

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.840
it looks like this.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.400
This is the activity
of a whole bunch

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.010
of cells in the visual
cortex in the hippocampus.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:58.250
And you see that the activity is
flipping between lots of cells

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.380
active, no cells active.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.900
These are the
so-called up and down

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.220
states of cells during sleep.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.850
That every half a second to
a second or so many cells

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.950
will become active, then
they'll all be shut off,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.324
then they'll become
active again.

00:10:13.324 --> 00:10:16.759
So you are flipping between
these up and down-like states.

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:18.550
And if you look at
these up and down states

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.590
in the visual
cortex, and you look

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.390
at similar activity
in the hippocampus,

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.730
you see these up and down-like
states in the hippocampus

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:25.229
as well.

00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:28.480
But you'll notice that the
up state in the neocortex

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.890
leads up state in
the hippocampus.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.070
So neocortex first, then
hippocampus, neocortex,

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.630
hippocampus.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.490
Neocortex seems to lead.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.000
So again, this question of,
who's providing the input?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.030
That simple model where
I'm sweeping inhibition

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.870
during the theta, during active
behavior, that information

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.247
is coming in from perception,
is what I'm saying.

00:10:49.247 --> 00:10:51.580
During sleep, the question
is, where is that information

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.670
coming from?

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.310
Well, this would say, this
is where it's coming from.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.920
It's coming from
these cortical areas.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.975
Let's say sensory, visual
cortical areas turn on.

00:11:00.975 --> 00:11:02.975
They provide the information
to the hippocampus.

00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:05.500
Now the hippocampus turns
on, and the hippocampus

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.175
responding to input coming
in from the sensory cortex.

00:11:09.175 --> 00:11:11.950
Now, if that's
the case, could we

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.260
manipulate hippocampal
activity by manipulating

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.550
the sensory cortex?

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.550
And so this experiment, simple
experiment, answer was yes.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.716
In this case we use
the auditory system.

00:11:21.716 --> 00:11:23.590
One of the reasons to
use the auditory system

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.006
is that, unlike
the visual system,

00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:28.400
the auditory system remains in
a state of persistent vigilance,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.257
even during sleep.

00:11:29.257 --> 00:11:30.840
Auditory cortical
responses, even when

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.540
the animal goes
to sleep, measure

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.740
auditory cortical responses
same as when it's awake.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.680
So essentially the
auditory cortex

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.490
stays vigilant
during sleep, which

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.510
has clear evolutionary value.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.890
Animal's asleep, it's
trying to minimize arousal

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.390
by shutting off visual input,
which may be of limited value

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.140
anyway, given the
circadian nocturnal nature

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.012
of visual stimuli.

00:11:59.012 --> 00:12:00.970
So if you can't see
anything, you might as well

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.011
actually close your eyes.

00:12:02.011 --> 00:12:03.460
But you can still hear things.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.640
So you and other
animals are still

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.786
listening to pick up
threats that might require

00:12:09.786 --> 00:12:10.910
that they actually wake up.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.880
So anyway, taking
advantage of that.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.690
Auditory system on, so
train an animal on task

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.520
where it learns to associate
auditory cues with locations.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.700
Right sound means go
over here to get food,

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.540
left sound means go
over there to get food.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.856
Very simple task.

00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:28.480
Then animal goes to
sleep, and you just

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.710
continue to play the sounds.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.360
So it's learned something.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.040
And now you try to bias cortical
activity during sleep and ask,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.161
what does that do?

00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:39.160
And so this is the idea.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.659
When the animal is
actually running,

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:42.179
we can decode
hippocampal activity.

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:44.470
So we can tell, oh, here's
the hippocampal pattern that

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.920
corresponds to the left
side or the right side.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.850
And in this case, when the
animal's performing the task,

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.410
play the right-hand
sound, animal

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.014
goes to the right-hand
side, see this

00:12:55.014 --> 00:12:56.180
in the hippocampal response.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.000
Play the left-hand sound, animal
goes to the left-hand side.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.702
Again, the left-hand
place fields

00:13:01.702 --> 00:13:03.660
when the animal's on the
left, right-hand place

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.493
fields on the right.

00:13:04.493 --> 00:13:07.120
So this is what the
experiment and the behavior

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.730
looks like from the
standpoint of the hippocampus.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.830
Very clear, right?

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.410
Right sound, right
hippocampus, right place cells.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.730
Left sound, left place cells.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.480
But now the animal's
going to go to sleep,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.840
and we're going to
do the same thing.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.880
Continue to play the right
sounds and the left sounds.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.200
It's just that now the
animal is not actually

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.070
moving on the track.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.540
And so we ask,
does that-- can we

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:32.260
bias the reactivated
sequences that you get?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.967
So there's the same thing now.

00:13:33.967 --> 00:13:36.050
Animal's awake, but now
it's going to go to sleep,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.370
and we just keep
playing the sounds.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.578
The little tics there indicate
the delivery of sounds

00:13:39.578 --> 00:13:41.540
every 10 seconds or so.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.690
So we play a sound, and now
we look at the response.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.570
The difference here is that
the animal's not running,

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.330
it's not behaving.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.180
Sound, response.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.160
Now we'll decode the activity.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.330
So here, for instance, we take
a little short window here,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.620
about half a second.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.710
And what you see is this
is this up-like state.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.050
Multi-unit activity,
lots of cells firing.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.340
Decode activity.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.980
Now ask when you
play the left sound,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.540
what does activity decode to?

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.350
And here you see it's going to
decode into the left-hand side.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.510
So that's the basic hypothesis.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.670
Play the left sound,
you get the replay

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.730
of the left side of the track.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.770
You play the right sound,
you get reactivation

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.360
of the right side of the track.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.800
And that's what you get.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.170
So when you play
the left-hand sound,

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.230
left sound bias activates
place cells on the left side.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:40.044
Right side bias biases
place cells on the right.

00:14:40.044 --> 00:14:42.460
And you can do the same kind
of psychophysical experiments

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.480
which has been done in humans,
either with different sensor

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.550
modalities-- it's been
done in olfaction.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.380
It's also been done in audition.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.930
So the equivalent
experiment, using auditory

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.510
cueing in humans, where you have
people learn the simple task.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.310
And this was done
in Ken Paller's lab

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.780
where they do the simple
spatial matching game.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.860
It's like, you know,
where's the cat card,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.037
where's the teapot card?

00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:06.370
The variant here is when they
flipped over the cat card,

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.985
they would play the
cat sound, a meow.

00:15:07.985 --> 00:15:09.526
When they flip over
the teapot sound,

00:15:09.526 --> 00:15:16.240
they play a little associated
auditory cue, teapot whistle.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.700
And then people go to sleep.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.490
And during sleep, they would
play either the cat sound

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:22.549
or the teapot sound.

00:15:22.549 --> 00:15:24.340
And they found that
when they would wake up

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.460
and now they do the task,
if they played the cat

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.320
sound during sleep,
they were better

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.320
at remembering the location
of the cats than the whistle.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.970
So this says not only does sleep
actually contribute to memory,

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.120
but it's selective.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.080
And not only is it selective,
but it can be influenced.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.010
It can be biased.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.967
You can direct the
nature memory processing.

00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:47.800
And then our experiments
suggest that, well,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.060
one of the consequences of
this kind of sleep manipulation

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.630
would be to bias the
memory reactivation

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.580
in the hippocampus.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.520
And so the idea is simple.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:06.037
That is that cortex
biases the state

00:16:06.037 --> 00:16:07.120
that the hippocampus gets.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.250
And then the hippocampus takes
that state, sweeps inhibition,

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.820
replays a sequence,
and that sequence then

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.550
gets played back to the cortex.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:21.190
So the cortex, it
sort of knows--

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.130
it has these sort
of discrete states

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.310
that doesn't necessarily know
what the causal correlations

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.060
might be.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.354
What happens next?

00:16:29.354 --> 00:16:31.270
It doesn't necessarily
know what happens next.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.228
It knows what happened.

00:16:32.228 --> 00:16:34.860
Hippocampus knows
what happened next.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.835
It has lots of instances
of that though.

00:16:36.835 --> 00:16:42.320
Well, I saw a red light,
what happens next?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.970
You say, oh, you
know, I saw red light,

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.700
and all the cars stopped.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.600
OK, that's great.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.180
If I'm just the cortex,
that's what I learned.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.340
All the car stop.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.798
If I'm the hippocampus, I'm a
little bit smarter than that.

00:16:52.798 --> 00:16:57.580
I say, you know, last Tuesday I
was there, there's a red light,

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.460
and all the cars, except
for these cyclists.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.780
Man, they didn't stop,
they just kept on going.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.859
So wait a minute,
there's a rule.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:09.670
Red light, cars stop,
bicycles don't stop.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:15.640
So you have to refine what
appear to be simple rules.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.190
Often that's actually
used in an example.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.109
How do you use the
prefrontal cortex?

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:23.500
Oh, red light means stop,
green light means go.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.619
That's great, except in the real
world, that rule is too simple.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:31.340
It has to be refined based upon
your particular experience.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.600
In fact, if you're
really sophisticated,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.940
red light means cars, except
for cabbies, will stop, right?

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.600
If I see a cabbie, guaranteed
that guy's not going to stop,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.310
he's going to accelerate, right?

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.809
And that's the kind of
information-- that's

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:45.850
what the hippocampus has.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.230
And so you imagine
that's what's going on.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.340
Neocortex, in each one of
these slow oscillations,

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.720
is saying red light.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.340
And the hippocampus says,
oh, yeah, OK, cars stop.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.120
Red light again.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.910
Well, there was that bicycle
thing, bicycles continue to go.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:58.420
Red light.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.950
Well, that was the
cabbie incident.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.720
So now you have all these
sort of causal sequences

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.970
that are being expressed
back to the neocortex,

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:12.370
presumably in order to establish
this more comprehensive,

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:17.740
consolidated model of
real world traffic lights,

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.870
rather than the
cartoon traffic lights.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:25.460
And so that would be the idea
of what's going on during sleep.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.200
Now, during quiet
wakefulness you

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.490
can think of the
same sort of idea.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.600
And that is that you're
kind of evaluating

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.940
multiple casual contingencies.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.030
Each of which might be
expressible as a simple rule,

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:47.240
but might also be experienced
as distinct variations

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.930
of that rule.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.110
And the idea is, OK,
do we use the rule,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.310
or do we use the exceptions,
or how do we actually

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.507
refine the rule based upon
these different instances

00:18:58.507 --> 00:18:59.090
or exceptions?

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.880
And so you can think about
that as refining the rule,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.860
that's like the learning side.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.700
Applying the rule, that's the
memory or decision making side.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.690
So you can think about,
during quiet wakefulness,

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:14.870
this reactivation being used in
the service of actual learning

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.090
or in decision making.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.540
And so again, you
read the paper,

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.000
and one of the things that we
had discovered interestingly

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.910
about reactivation
during quiet wakefulness

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.610
was that when animals stop
after running on a track,

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.230
they do reactivate sequences.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.090
This is raw data, animal
running from left to right

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.929
and then stopping for
a long period of time.

00:19:36.929 --> 00:19:37.970
And you can see activity.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.560
There are these
bursts of activity.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.101
You blow these things up, these
are these sharp wave ripples.

00:19:42.101 --> 00:19:43.820
They last about
half a second or so.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.560
So you see a burst
of activity, you

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.964
see these place cell sequences.

00:19:46.964 --> 00:19:48.380
In this case the
sequence actually

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.940
runs in time reversed fashion.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.000
So in this case--

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.770
time reversed fashion-- this
doesn't seem like planning

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.330
or decision making.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.230
It may be evaluation of
temporal correlations

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.236
that might be relevant
to behavior and learning.

00:20:06.236 --> 00:20:07.610
But what would a
reverse sequence

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:12.500
actually have to do with
spatial learning and memory?

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.990
The insight into how
this might be used

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.820
came from computational models.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.400
In fact, computational models
that the post-doc in this case,

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.280
Dave Foster, who
made this discovery,

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.297
had used in his doctoral work.

00:20:28.297 --> 00:20:29.880
Where he was actually
building models,

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.670
reinforcement learning
models of spatial navigation.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.430
And one of the problems
in reinforcement learning

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.560
is that reinforcement
often comes

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.040
after you've actually
carried out the steps that

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.103
lead up to it.

00:20:42.103 --> 00:20:44.220
In other words, you
walk from left to right,

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.044
you get rewarded
when you get here.

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:47.460
What you want to
know is not just,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.630
this is where the reward is.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.604
What you really want
to know is, what

00:20:50.604 --> 00:20:52.520
were the things that
actually lead up to that?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.310
In other words, I want to
take credit, reward value,

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.680
and I want to spread
it backward in time

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.490
to place value on the
things that predict

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.110
or lead up to reward.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.259
The so-called temporal
credit assignment problem.

00:21:07.259 --> 00:21:09.550
How do I give credit to things
that actually lead up to

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.040
or predict reward?

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.490
And thinking about how you
might solve the temporal credit

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.580
assignment problem, this
reverse reactivation

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.060
actually has the capacity to
solve that problem in one step.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.930
If you imagine when the
animal gets to the end,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.000
gets some reward,
and if now at that

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.060
point I pair the delivery
of reward signal,

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.590
which I will indicate here as--

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.040
this is a cartoon
suggesting this is dopamine,

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.610
a reward signal.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:39.910
And I'm going to pair that
with the reverse sequence.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.210
And now you can think
of the association.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.410
This is my current location.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.930
This is way back
where I started from.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:50.970
Current location gets
paired with strong reward.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:55.580
Remote location gets
paired with low reward.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.630
So this association
will essentially solve,

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:05.270
will convolve this discrete
reward impulse function,

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.950
will turn it into
this continuous graded

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.130
monotonic reward
gradient function.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.860
Translating this into this
essentially in one step.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.870
So the thinking is, hey,
animals are actually

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.790
using this to learn,
and they're using

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.190
this to solve the
temporal credit assignment

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.460
problem in a way that
would be important for

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.800
general reinforcement learning.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.342
Now, I won't go into--

00:22:29.342 --> 00:22:30.800
so, we actually
did this experiment

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.210
recorded from the reward area,
the VTA, and the hippocampus.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.580
And, indeed, during these
reactivation events,

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:46.100
you see the pairing of
this reward signaling.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.680
And not only do
you see the pairing

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.660
of the reward
signaling, but you find

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.610
pairing of the reward
signaling in which

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:57.610
the precise firing
of reward signals

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.200
map onto the delivery of
rewards at goal locations.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.980
So it's not just certain
sequences are good,

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.210
others are bad.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.800
It's that there are
certain locations

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.620
along the sequence that have
differential reward value.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.020
So there's a mapping of
relative reward to location.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:21.050
And that if you look at this
while animals are actually

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:25.400
performing a task you can see
biases in these sequences that

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.900
correspond to planning.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.217
So both of these
elements of sequence

00:23:29.217 --> 00:23:31.467
reactivation-- this was some
work by Dave Foster where

00:23:31.467 --> 00:23:33.758
he looked at an animal that
has to just forage and find

00:23:33.758 --> 00:23:35.270
a location space.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.117
When animals are
searching for a location,

00:23:37.117 --> 00:23:38.950
and you look at these
reactivated sequences,

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.570
it turns out that
reactivated sequences

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:44.410
tend to be directed
toward the locations

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.160
where the animal thinks
the goal might be.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.470
So it's sort of
thinking about things

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.760
that would lead to reward.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.240
So both sides of this kind
of sequential computation

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.540
seem to be expressed
in the hippocampus.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.510
Co-expression with reward
during evaluation or learning.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.480
The expression during
reward directed behavior

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.150
in the service of planning
and decision making.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:11.650
And then finally, this is
the paper that you had read.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.580
It's just looking at the
structure of these reward

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.180
sequences on long tracks.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.700
And the most salient point
that came out of this paper

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.930
is that the phenomena of
sharp wave ripple sequential

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.100
activation that correspond
to these theta sequences,

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:34.040
when animals are sitting quietly
over the course of these longer

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.550
up state like events, takes the
form of bursts of sharp wave

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.790
ripples, or sequences of
these short sequences.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.730
So there's this
compositional notion

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.464
that you form long sequences
out of little short sequences.

00:24:46.464 --> 00:24:48.380
And the other question
is, how do you actually

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.270
put these short
sequences together,

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:55.700
and why would you have
a representation that

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.730
has this kind of
compositional structure?

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.690
It's the Lego
block kind of idea,

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:04.700
where I can put together
sequences from these more

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.440
elemental sequential units.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.630
I won't show the movie,
but if I actually

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.256
zoom in on one of
those sequences

00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:15.380
in that particular instance
where the animals stop,

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.900
you can see there's
a longer reactivated

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.320
sequence that actually takes the
form of four shorter sequences.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.340
That's how long sequences
are being evaluated.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.130
And one interesting
thing about this

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.171
was that if you look at
these different sequences

00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:37.580
of different length, shorter
sequences, longer sequences,

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.430
they all seem to have
a fixed velocity.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.132
And that is, there's this kind
of a fixed-- what I've heard

00:25:41.132 --> 00:25:42.132
is the speed of thought.

00:25:42.132 --> 00:25:43.890
So there is some
fixed constraint

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:48.920
that evaluating further
out in the future

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.785
simply takes more time.

00:25:50.785 --> 00:25:52.160
And so that suggests
that there's

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.090
an interesting
constraint in capacity

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.670
for extended
evaluation that comes

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:05.420
in the form of these oscillatory
modes of the slow oscillation.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.390
Longer, or slower, frequencies
give you, essentially,

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.700
more time, longer sequences.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.547
And that, potentially, if
you want to go even longer,

00:26:14.547 --> 00:26:16.130
you might actually
even link sequences

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.570
across subsequent cycles.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.264
Just as you could do across
successive sharp wave ripples,

00:26:20.264 --> 00:26:22.680
you might be able to do that
across successive slow waves.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.520
So the idea that you have these
oscillations that you can link

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.309
or couple sequences
across different cycles

00:26:28.309 --> 00:26:30.350
of these oscillations,
that you have oscillations

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.420
at different
frequencies, suggests

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.670
that this is the mechanism.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.310
It's the compositional
mechanism for sequences that

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.160
are nested within oscillations.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.500
By combining these
oscillations you

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.950
can construct these sequences in
ways that presumably contribute

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.850
to cognition.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.449
So we now kind of see how
things are structured,

00:26:50.449 --> 00:26:52.740
and now the question is, can
we actually manipulate it?

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.000
And so that's really
the challenge.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.290
Seeing the
compositional structure,

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.050
having demonstrated potential
access, the ability to bias

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:00.830
content.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:06.150
To coord, to bias the
structure of when things occur,

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.650
what actually occurs.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:12.680
Now I think the capacity
exists to essentially engineer

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.970
the sequences themselves.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.980
And that is that, during the
sleep or quiet wakeful states,

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.230
get animals to think about
things that they have not

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:22.280
actually experienced, and
test the hypothesis that this

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.490
is what animals are using
to construct these models,

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.660
to essentially tinker with the
blocks of memory and cognition.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.170
And then finally, just
pointing out, it's interesting.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.885
These ripple sequences,
same space and time scale

00:27:35.885 --> 00:27:36.909
as theta sequences.

00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:39.200
So again, it's suggesting
this is the fundamental unit.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.240
It's not unique to
the hippocampus.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.130
Essentially any
brain system could

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:47.420
express this kind of structure
using that simple model.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.400
Where you see ramps and
you see oscillations,

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.000
you're going to get sequences.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.740
And this capacity is something
that probably is broadly

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.910
expressed and enjoyed by
different brain areas.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.100
So, there you go.
