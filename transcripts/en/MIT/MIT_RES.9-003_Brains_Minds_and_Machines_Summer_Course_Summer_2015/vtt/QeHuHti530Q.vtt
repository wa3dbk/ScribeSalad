HAIM SOMPOLINSKY:
My topic today is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.170
discussing sensory
representations

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.950
in deep cortex-like
architectures.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.430
I should say the
topic is perhaps

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.300
toward a theory of
sensory representations

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.930
in deep networks.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.540
As you will see, our
attempt is to develop

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.680
a systematic theoretical
understanding of the capacity

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.420
and limitations of
architectures of that type.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.530
The general context
is well known.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.160
In many sensory systems,
we see information

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.770
is propagating from the
periphery, like the retina,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.060
to primary visual cortex, and
then, of course, many stages up

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.250
to a very high level, or maybe
the hippocampal structure.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.450
It's not purely feedforward.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.130
There are backward, massive
backward or top-down

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.200
connections, the
recurrent connections,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.410
and some of those extra
features I'll talk about.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.790
But the most intuitive
feature of that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.000
is simply a transformation
or filtering

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.910
of data across multiple stages.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.540
Similarly in auditory pathway.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.380
In other systems, we see a
similar structure or aspect

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.042
of similar structure as well.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:53.280
A well-known and a
classical formative system

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.550
for computational
science is cerebellum,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.300
where you have information
coming from the mossy fiber

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.920
layer, then expand enormously
into a granule layer,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.590
and then converge
to a Purkinje cell.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.889
So if you look at
a single Purkinje

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.190
cell, the output of the
cerebellum, as a unit,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.030
then you see there is,
first, an expansion

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.570
from 1,000 to two
orders of magnitude

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.760
higher in the granule layer.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.330
And then convergence of
200,000 or so parallel fibers

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.350
onto a single Purkinje cell.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.350
And there are, those type
of modules, many, many

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.250
across the cerebellum.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.170
So, again, a transformation
which involves, in this case,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.710
expansion and then convergence.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.490
In the basal ganglia, which
I wouldn't categorize it

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.194
as a sensory system.

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:51.110
More related to motor.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.540
Nevertheless, you see
cortex converging first

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.300
to various stages of
the basal ganglia,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.680
and then expanding
again to cortex.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.220
Hippocampus has also multiple
pathways, but some of them

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.380
include a convergence.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.810
For instance, convergence
to a CA3, and then expansion

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.110
again to cortex.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.680
But there are other
multiple pathways as well,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.790
different stages of sensory
information propagating,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.600
of course, across them.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.900
And, finally, the
artificial network story

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.816
of deep neural networks,
all of you may have heard.

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:38.780
Input layer, then
sequence of stages.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.440
Purely feedforward.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.800
And at least the
canonical leading network

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.720
is one that the output layer
has object recognition, object

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.990
classification task.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.860
And the whole network
is studied by backprop,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.100
supervised learning for that.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.140
What I'll talk about is more
in the spirit of the idea

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.540
that the first stages
are more general purpose

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.060
than the specific classic
task in the output layer.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.550
So there are many issues.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.630
Number of stages that are
required, the size of them,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.520
why compression or expansion.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.120
In many systems, you'll see that
the fraction of active neurons

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.330
is small in the expanded layer.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.660
That's what we call sparseness.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.010
So high sparseness
means small number

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.340
of neurons active at
any given stimulus.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.180
It's just the terminology
is somewhat confusing.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.110
So high sparseness is small
number of active neurons.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.990
One important and crucial
question is how to transform.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.910
What are the
filters, the weights

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.200
that are good for transforming
sensory information from one

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.560
layer to another?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.440
And, in particular,
whether random weights

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.380
is good enough, or maybe
even optimal in some sense.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.345
Or one needs more
structure, the more

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:16.080
learned type of synaptic way.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.620
This is a crucial question,
perhaps not for machine

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.920
learning but for computational
neuroscience, because there

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.500
is some experimental
evidence, for at least

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.560
of some of the systems
that are studied,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.180
that the mapping from
the compressed, original

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.600
representation to the
sparse representation

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.440
is actually done by
randomly connected weights.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.560
So one example is
olfactory cortex.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.710
The mapping of
olfactory representation

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.040
from the olfactory bulb,
so from glomerulus layer,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.486
to the piriform cortex
seems to be random,

00:05:57.486 --> 00:05:59.370
as far as one can say.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.710
Similarly, in the
cerebellum, the example

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.200
that I mentioned
before, when one

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.840
looks at the mapping
from the mossy fiber

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.500
to the granule cell,
again enormous expansion

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.000
by a few orders of magnitude.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.580
Nevertheless, they
seem to be random.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.370
Now, of course, one cannot
say exclusively that they are

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.690
random and there are no subtle
correlations or structures.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.780
But, nevertheless, there
is a strong motivation

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.620
to ask whether random
projections are good enough.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.330
And if not, what does
it mean structured?

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.820
What kind of structure is
appropriate for this task?

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.950
Question of top-down
and feedback loops,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.660
recurrent connections,
and so on.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.720
So that's all I hope to,
at least briefly, mention

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.430
later on in my talk.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.640
So before I continue, most of,
or a large part of the talk

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.660
will be based on published
and unpublished work

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.050
with Baktash Babadi,
who was, until recently,

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.320
a postdoctoral, a Swartz
Fellow at Harvard University.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.370
Went to practice medicine.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.990
Elia Frankin, a master student
at the Hebrew University.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.440
SueYeon, who all you
know here, at Harvard.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.060
Uri Cohen, a PhD student
at the Hebrew University.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.740
And Dan Lee from
Penn University.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.160
So here is our formalization
of the problem.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.350
We have an input
layer, denoted 0.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.750
Typically, it's a small,
it's a compressed layer

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.350
with dense representation.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.240
So here, every input
will generate maybe half

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.990
of the population, on average,

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.600
Then there is a
feedforward layer

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.140
of synaptic weights,
which expand

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.530
to a higher-dimension layer,
which we call cortical layer.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.460
It's expanded in terms
of the number of neurons.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.760
So this will be S1.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.600
It is sparse because the
f, the fraction of neurons

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.790
that are active for each given
input vector, will be small.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.110
So it is expanded and sparse.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.710
That will be the first part
of my talk, discussing this.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:28.830
Then, later on, I'll talk
about staging, cascading

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.400
this transformation
to several stages.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.190
And ultimately
there is a readout,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.750
will be some
classification task.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.210
1 will be one classification.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.500
2 will be another
classification rule, et cetera,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.460
each one of them
with synaptic weights

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.330
which are learned to
perform that task.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.960
So we call that a
supervised layer, and that's

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.300
the unsupervised layer.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.710
So that's a formalization
of the problem.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.230
And, as you will see, we'll
make enormously simplifying

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.490
abstraction of the
real biological system

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.010
in order to try to
gain some insight

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.240
about the computational
capacity of such systems.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.640
So the first
important question is

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.540
what is the statistics,
the statistical structure

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.360
of the input?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.570
So the input is kind of
n-dimensional vector,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.360
where n, or n0, when n is
the number of units here.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.430
So each sensory event evokes
a pattern of activity here.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.440
But what is the structure,
the statistical structure,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.750
that we are working with?

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.390
And the simplest one that
we are going to discuss

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.160
is the following.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.580
So we assume, basically,
that the inputs

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.700
are coming from a
mixture of, so to speak,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.450
a mixture of
Gaussian statistics.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.120
It's not going to be Gaussian
because, for simplicity, we'll

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.590
assume they are binary.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.320
But this doesn't
matter actually.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.850
So imagine that this is kind
of a graphical represent--

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.940
a caricature of
high-dimensional space.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.690
And imagine the inputs,
the sensory inputs,

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.375
imagine that they are clustered
around templates or cluster

00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:16.875
centers.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.590
So these will be the
centers of these balls.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:30.080
And the input itself is
coming from the neighborhoods

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.590
of those templates.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.870
So each input will be
one point in this space,

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:41.090
and it will be originating from
one of those ensembles of one

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.720
of those states.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.280
So that's a simple architecture.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.930
And we are going--

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.850
in real space, it
will be mapping

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.780
from one of those states
into another state

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.030
in the next layer.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.590
And then, finally, the
task will be to take--

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:07.370
imagine that some of those
balls are classified as plus.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:12.140
Let's say the olfactory factory
stimuli, and some of them

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.630
are classified as appetitive,
some of them as aversive.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.335
So the output layer,
the readout unit,

00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:26.360
has to classify some of
those spheres as a plus,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.100
and some of them are minus.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.680
And, of course,
depending on how many of

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.850
them are in a dimensionality,
and their location,

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.560
this may or may not
be an easy problem.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.125
So, for instance,
here it's fine.

00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:45.740
There is-- a linear classifier
on the input space can do it.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.850
Here, I think there are, there
should be some mistakes here.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.250
Yeah, here.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:59.150
So here is a case where the
linear classifier at the input

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.020
layer cannot do it.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:06.350
And that's our--
that's a theme which

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:12.890
is very popular, both in
computation neural science

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:19.070
and system neural science
studies in machine learning.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.280
And the following
question comes up.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.310
Suppose we see that there
is a transformation of data

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:34.790
from, let's say, a photoreceptor
layer in vision to the ganglion

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.950
cells at the output
of the retina,

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.040
then to cortex in
several stages.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:47.111
How do we gauge,
how do we assess

00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:52.610
what is the advantage for the
brain to transform information

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:57.600
from one, let's say, from retina
to V1, and so on and so forth.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.640
After all, in this
feedforward's architecture,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.660
no net information is
generated at the next layer.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.950
So if no net information
is generated,

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:15.090
the question is, what did we
gain by these transformations?

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:22.520
And one possible answer is that
it is reformatted, reformatting

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.480
the sensory representation into
different representation which

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.020
will make subsequent
computations simpler.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.520
So what does it mean, subsequent
computation is simpler?

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:40.130
One notion of simplicity is
whether subsequent computation

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:45.320
can be realized by a
simple linear readout.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:53.180
So that's the strategy that
we are going to adopt here.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.510
And this is to ask,
as the information,

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.760
as the representation
is changing

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.130
as you go from one
layer to another,

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:06.890
how well a linear readout will
be able to perform the task.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.710
So that's the input.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.710
That's the story.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.760
And then, as I said,
there is an input,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.526
unsupervised representations,
and supervised at the end.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.960
I need to introduce notations.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.560
Bear with me.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.680
This is a computational talk.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.580
I cannot just talk about ideas,
because the whole thing is

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.710
to be able to actually come up
with a quantitative theory that

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.150
tests ideas.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.150
So let me introduce notations.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.780
So at the centers,
at each layer,

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.020
you can ask what is the
representation of the centers

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.000
of these stimuli?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.060
And I'll denote the
center by a bar.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.050
And mu is index of the patterns.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.900
So mu goes from 1 to P. P Is
the number of those balls,

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.870
number of those spheres, or
number of those clusters,

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.580
if you think about
clustering some sensory data.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.920
So P would be the
number of clusters.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.622
i, from 1 to N, is simply the
neuron or the unit activation

00:15:11.622 --> 00:15:13.720
at each mu.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.830
And L is the layer.

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.270
So 0 is the input layer.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.680
It's up to L layer.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.060
So this would be 0, 1.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:29.670
The mean activation
at each layer from 1

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.890
on will just have
to be a constant

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.500
to be f. f goes from 0 to 1.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.040
The smaller f is, the sparser
the representation is.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.800
We will assume that the input
representation is dense.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.900
So this is 0.5.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.860
N, again, we'll assume
to be, for simplicity,

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.820
a constant across layers, except
for the first layer, where

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.270
there is expansion.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.320
You can vary those parameters,
and actually the theory

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.210
accommodates
variations of those.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.880
But that's the
simplest architecture.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.730
You expend a dense
representation

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.460
into a sparse higher
dimension, and you

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.810
keep doing it as you go along.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.460
So that's notation.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:21.950
Now, how do we assess what
is the next stages doing

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.370
to those clusters.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.080
So, as I said, one measure
is take a linear classifier

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.380
and see how linear
classifier performs.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:36.720
But, actually, you can
also look at the statistics

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.330
of the injected sensory
stimuli at each layer

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.250
and learn something from it.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.250
And, basically, I'm
going to suggest

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:51.450
looking at two major
statistical aspects

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:55.470
of the data in each layer
of the transformation.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.310
One of them is noise, and
one of them is correlation.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.080
So what is noise?

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.960
So, again, noise will be
simply the radius, or measure

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.619
of the radius of the sphere.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:15.540
So if you had only the
templates as inputs,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.859
the problem would be simple.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:20.260
Problem would be easy as long
as we have enough dimension.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.390
You expand it.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.510
You can easily do
linear classifier

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.800
and solve the problem.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.800
So the problem, in
our case, is the fact

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.590
that the input is actually
the infinite number of inputs,

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.110
or exponentially large
number of possible inputs,

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:42.870
because they all come from a
Gaussian or a binarized version

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.960
of a Gaussian noise
around the templates.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.700
And I'll denote
the noise by delta.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.240
0 means no noise.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.930
The normalization is such that
1 means that they are random.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:18:00.360
So delta equals to 1 means that,
basically, you cannot tell,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.540
the input, whether it's coming
from here or from any other

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.920
points in the input space.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.980
The other thing,
correlations, is more subtle.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.820
So I'm going to assume
that those balls are

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.730
coming from kind of
uniform distribution.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.097
Imagine you take
a template here.

00:18:20.097 --> 00:18:21.180
You draw a ball around it.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.013
You take a template.

00:18:22.013 --> 00:18:23.080
Here, you draw a ball.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.400
Everything is kind of
uniformly distributed.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.590
The only structure
is the fact that data

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.440
comes from this
mixture of Gaussians

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:38.940
or noisy patterns
around those centers.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:39.840
So that's fine.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:48.150
But as you project those
clusters into the next stage,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.530
I claim that those
centers, those templates,

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.205
get new representation, which
can actually have structure

00:18:56.205 --> 00:19:01.260
in them, simply by the fact
that you put all of them

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.400
into this common synaptic
weights into the next layer.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.850
And I'm going to measure this
by Q. And, basically, low Q or 0

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.550
Q is basically a kind of
randomly uniformly distributed

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.650
centers.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:20.100
And I'll always start from
that at the input layer.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.490
But then there is
a danger, or it

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.370
might happen that,
as you propagate

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.940
this information or
this representation

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.725
through the next layer, the
centers will look like that,

00:19:32.725 --> 00:19:35.350
or the data, structure of
the data, looks like that.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.450
So, on average, the distance
between two centers,

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.340
on average, is the same as here.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.080
But they are clumped together.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.010
It's kind of random
clustering of the clusters.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.150
And that can be
induced by the fact

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:58.080
that the data is feedforwarded
from this representation.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.660
That can pose a problem.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.550
If there is no noise, then
there is, again, no problem.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.500
You can differentiate
between them, and so on.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.250
But if there is noise, this
can aggravate the situation,

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:14.410
because some of the clusters
become dangerously close

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.060
to each other.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.140
And we will come to it.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.750
But, anyway, so we have
this delta, the noise,

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.800
the size of the clusters, and
we have Q, the correlations,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.280
how they are clumped
in each representation.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.970
And now we can ask
how delta evolve

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.500
when you go from
one presentation

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.340
to another, how Q evolve from
one presentation to another,

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.800
and how linear classifier
performance will

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.510
change from one
representation to another.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:48.820
So the simplicity
of this assumption

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:56.540
allows for a kind of systematic,
analytical exploration or study

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.040
of this.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.290
These are definitions.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.340
Let's go on.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.490
So what will be the
ideal situation?

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.560
So the ideal situation
will be that I

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:14.971
start from some level
of noise, which is

00:21:14.971 --> 00:21:18.100
my spheres at the input layer.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.890
I may or may not start
with some correlation.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.120
The simplest case would be
that I start from randomly

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.480
distributed centers.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.270
So this would be 0.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.920
And the best situation
will be that,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.920
as I propagate the sensory
stimuli, delta, the noise,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.560
will go to 0.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.180
As I said, if the
noise goes to 0,

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.580
you are left with
basically points.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.670
And those points, if there
is enough dimensionality,

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.470
those points would be
easily classifiable.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.580
It would also be
good, if the noise

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:57.110
doesn't go to 0, to have
also kind of uniformly spread

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.660
clusters.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.340
So it will be good to
keep Q to be small.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.514
So let's look at one layer.

00:22:06.514 --> 00:22:07.430
So let's look at this.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.730
We have the input layer,
the output layer here,

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.690
and the readout.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:19.340
The first question is what to
choose for this input layer.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.170
So the simplest answer
would be choose random.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.410
So what we do, we
just take Gaussian.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.660
The Gaussian weights in
this layer are very simple.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.140
0 mean, with some normalization.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.990
It doesn't matter.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.130
Then we project them into
each one of these guys here.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:44.971
And then we add threshold
to enforce the sparsity

00:22:44.971 --> 00:22:46.120
that we want.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:54.790
So whatever the activation here
is, whatever the input here is,

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.130
the threshold makes
sure that only

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:01.900
the f with the largest
input will be active,

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.347
and the rest will be 0.

00:23:03.347 --> 00:23:05.680
So there is a nonlinearity,
which is of course extremely

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.280
important.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.350
If you map one layer to another
with a linear transformation,

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.320
you don't gain anything in
terms of classification.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.560
So there is a nonlinearity,
simply a threshold nonlinearity

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.730
after an input projection.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:25.360
All right.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.460
So how we are going to do this?

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.270
So it's straightforward to
actually compute analytically

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.890
what will happen to a noise.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.820
So imagine you take two input
vectors with some Hamming

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.860
distance apart from each other.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:46.120
You map them by convolving
them, so to speak,

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.030
with Gaussian weights,
and then thresholding

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.620
them to get some sparsity.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.420
So f is the sparsity.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.120
The smaller the f is,
the sparser it is.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.835
So this is the noise level,
the normalized Gaussian--

00:23:59.835 --> 00:24:04.570
I'm sorry-- sphere radius
or Hamming distance

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.950
in the output layer, and
also the input layer.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.870
Well if 0 at start, then of
course you start at the origin.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.300
If you are random at the input,
you will be random there.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.790
So these points are fine.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.960
But, as you see,
immediately there

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.210
is an amplification of the
noise as you go from the input

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.660
to the output.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:29.080
So you start from 0.2, but you
get actually, after one layer,

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.480
to 0.6.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.610
And, actually, the
sparser it is--

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.820
so this is a relatively
high sparsity,

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.690
or at least you go from here
to here by increasing sparsity,

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.670
namely f becomes smaller.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.010
And as f becomes
smaller, this curve

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.150
is actually steeper and steeper.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.460
So not only you
amplify noise, but you

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.245
also-- the amplification
becomes worse the sparser

00:24:58.245 --> 00:25:00.510
the representation is.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:06.710
So that is the kind
of negative result.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:13.300
The idea that you can gain
by expanding data to a higher

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.290
dimension and make
them more separable

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:23.290
later on dates back to David
Marr's classical theory

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:24.940
of the cerebellum.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.090
But what we show here is
that, if you think not about

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:31.510
clean data, a set of points
that you want to separate,

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.795
but you think about the
more realistic case of you

00:25:34.795 --> 00:25:40.362
have noisy data, or
data with high variance,

00:25:40.362 --> 00:25:43.400
then the situation
is very different.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.130
So a random expansion
actually amplifies those.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.200
And that's a theme that will--

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.170
actually, we will live
with it as we go along.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:58.910
Random expansion is doing the
separation of the templates.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.720
But the problem is it also
separates two nearby points

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.140
within a cluster.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.480
It also separates them.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.480
So everything becomes
separated from each other.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.580
And this is why
noise is amplified.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.090
Now, what about the most subtle
thing, which is the kind of

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.065
overlap between the centers?

00:26:19.065 --> 00:26:23.780
So, on average, the centers are
as far apart as random things.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.480
But if you look, not
on average, but you

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.630
look at the
individual pairs, you

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.680
see that there is an
excess correlations

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.690
or overlap between them.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.600
So this is overlap
between the centers.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.900
Again, on average, it is 0,
but the variance is not 0.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.820
On average it's like
random, but the variance

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.330
is different, is
larger than random.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:46.730
And there is an amplification.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:51.250
There is a generation
of this excess overlap,

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.710
although it's nicely
controlled by sparsity.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:59.080
So as sparsity goes down,
these correlations go down.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.160
So that's not a
tremendous problem.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.990
The major problem, as
I said, is the noise.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:12.740
By the way, you can nicely do
an exercise where you generate,

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.930
you look at this cortical
layer representation,

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.140
and you do SVM, or
PCA, and you look

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.950
at the eigenvalue spectrum.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:27.710
So if you just look at random
sparse points, and you look

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:32.360
at the SVD this is the
eigenvalues number ranked--

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.690
then that's what you find.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:39.020
It's the famous
Marchenko-Pastur distribution.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.800
But, in our case, you see
there is an extra power.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.220
In this case, the
input layer is 100,

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.010
so the extra power
in the input layer,

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.890
in the first input eigenvalue.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.640
Now, why is it so?

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.490
What Q is telling
us, what nonzero Q

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.470
is telling us is the following.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.730
You take a set of random
points, and you project them

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.070
into higher dimensions.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.700
You start with 100 dimensions,
and you project them

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.820
in 1,000 dimensions.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.870
On average, they are random.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.395
But actually-- so
you would imagine

00:28:16.395 --> 00:28:17.990
that it's a perfect thing.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.870
You project them
with random weights.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.490
Then you would
imagine that you just

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:28.240
created a set of random points
in the expanded dimension

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.030
representation.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:34.160
If this was so, then
if you do SVM or PCA

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.830
on this representation,
you will find

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:40.190
what you expect from a PCA
of a set of random points.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.050
And this is this one.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:50.250
In fact, there is a trace of
low dimensionality in the data.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.620
So I think that's an
important point, which

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.930
I would like to explain.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.450
You start from a set of points.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:00.410
If you don't threshold
them and you just map them

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:06.710
into 1,000-dimensional space,
those 100-dimensional input

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.600
will remain 100-dimensional.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.820
Just be rotated, and
so on, but everything

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.970
will live in
100-dimensional space.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:20.300
Now you add thresholding,
high thresholding by sparsity.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:24.770
So those 100-dimensional
subspace becomes now

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.900
1,000-dimensional sparsity
because of the nonlinearity.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.740
But this nonlinearity, although
it takes 100-dimensional input

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.560
and makes them
1,000-dimensional,

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.040
it's still not like random.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:45.230
This 1,000-dimensional
cloud is still elongated.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.630
It's not simply
uniformly distributed.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:52.400
And this is the signature
that you see here.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.130
In the first largest
100 eigenvalues,

00:29:55.130 --> 00:30:02.870
there is extra power
relative to the random.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.040
The rest is not 0.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.220
So if you look here,
this goes up to 1,000.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.860
The rest is not 0.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.580
So the system is,
strictly speaking,

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.370
1,000-dimensional space,
but it's not random.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:22.370
It has increased
power in 100 channels.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:26.460
If you do a readout,
a linear classifier

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.880
readout, what you find in this--

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:39.860
again, when you expand
with random weights,

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:45.120
you find that there is
an optimal sparsity.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.920
So this is the readout error.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.326
For a classifier, the
output is a function

00:30:51.326 --> 00:30:54.920
of the sparsity for
different levels of noise.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.960
And you see that, in the
case of random weights,

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:05.470
there is a very high
sparsity, is bad.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.270
There Is an optimal
sparsity or sparseness,

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.820
and then there is
a shallow increase

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:14.900
in the error when you go
to a denser representation.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.530
One important point
which I want to emphasize

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.000
coming from the analysis--
let me skip equations--

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.580
and this is what you see here.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:28.070
The question is, can I do better
by further increase the layer?

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:32.090
So here I plot the readout
error as a function

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.400
of the size of cortical layer.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.410
Can I do better?

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.830
If I make the kernel
dimensionality infinite,

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.690
can I do better?

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.760
Well, it can do better if
you start with 0 noise.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:52.265
But if you have noisy
inputs, then basically,

00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:54.140
the performance saturates.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.490
And that's kind of surprising.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.890
We were expecting
that, if you go

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.382
to a larger and larger
representation, eventually

00:32:04.382 --> 00:32:05.780
the error will go to 0.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.920
But it doesn't go to 0.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.980
And that actually
happens even for what we

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.590
call structured representation.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.560
And that's the same for
different types of readout--

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.830
perceptual, and
pseudo-inverse, SVM.

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.040
All of them show this
saturation as you increase

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.120
the size of cortical layer.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:29.110
And that's one of the very
important outcome of our study.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.740
That when you talk
about noisy inputs,

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.590
you can think about it as kind
of more generalization task.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:40.580
Then there is a limit
about what you gain

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.105
by expanding representation.

00:32:43.105 --> 00:32:46.120
Even if you expand in a
nonlinear fashion and you

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.440
increase the dimensionality,
you cannot combat the noise,

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.040
at least up to some level.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.340
Beyond some level, there is
no point of further expansion,

00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:02.190
because basically
the error saturates

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.220
Let me, since time
goes fast, let

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.540
me talk about the alternatives.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.167
So if random weights
are not doing so well,

00:33:09.167 --> 00:33:10.250
what are the alternatives?

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.760
The alternative is to do some
kind of unsupervised learning.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.300
Here we are doing it
in a kind of a shortcut

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.230
of unsupervised learning.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:21.120
What is the shortcut?

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.810
We say the following.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:26.880
Imagine that these
layers, the learner

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.130
knows about the representation
of the clusters.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.350
It doesn't know the labels.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.475
In other words, whether
those are pluses and those

00:33:35.475 --> 00:33:38.130
are minuses, which one
are pluses and minuses.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.860
But he does know about
the statistical structure

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.740
of the input, and
this is this S bar.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.900
These are the centers.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.860
So we want to encode the
statistical structure

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:54.660
of these input in this
expansion of the weights.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.840
And the way we do the simplest
way is the kind of Hebb rule.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.870
We do the following.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:05.150
We say let's first choose, or
recruit, or allocate a state,

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:10.530
a sparse state here, randomly
chosen, to associate,

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.120
to represent each
one of the clusters.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.150
So these are the R. R are the
randomly chosen patterns here.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:22.239
And then we associate
between those randomly chosen

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:27.090
representations and
the actual centers

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.560
of the clusters of the inputs.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.880
So this is S bar and R. And
then we do the association

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.440
by the simple, what's
called Hebb rule.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.380
So this Hebbian rule
associates cluster

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:43.920
center with a randomly
assigned state

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:49.860
in the cortical layer in
a kind of simple summation

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.630
or outer product
for the Hebb rule.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.580
There are more
sophisticated ways to do it,

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.280
but that's the simplest
one of doing it.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:03.090
So it turns out that this simple
rule has enormous potential

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.820
for suppressing noise.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.830
So, again, this is the input
noise and the output noise.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.830
The Hamming distance of
the input and the output

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.240
properly normalized.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.740
And you see that, as you go to
higher and higher sparseness,

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.555
to lower and lower
f, this is basically

00:35:20.555 --> 00:35:24.930
the input noise is completely
quenched when f is large.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.700
When f is 0.01, for instance,
this is this already.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.120
Sub-linear when f 0.05 is
here, and so and so forth.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.195
So sparse representation,
in particular,

00:35:36.195 --> 00:35:39.580
are very effective
in suppressing noise,

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:45.210
but provided the inputs have
kind of unsupervised learning

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.750
encoded into them
which embed into them

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.361
the cluster structure
of the inputs.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.170
The same or similar
thing is true for Q

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.910
for these correlations.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.630
If you look at the-- this
was a random correlation.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:08.520
This is a function of f, and
this is Q, the correlation.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.840
It's extremely suppressed
for sparse representation.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.540
Basically, it's
exponentially small with 1/f,

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.660
so it's basically 0 for
sparse representation.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.780
Which means that those
centers look like randomly

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.200
distributed, essentially,
and with very small noise.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.700
So you took these
spheres and you basically

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.570
map them into random points
with a very small radius.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:36.610
So it's not surprising
that, in this case,

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:42.670
the error for small f-- the
error, even for large noise

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:46.700
values, the error is
basically small, 0.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.750
Nevertheless, it
is still saturating

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.500
as a function of the network
size, of the cortical size.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.520
So the saturation of performance
as a function of cortical size

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.910
is a general property
of such systems.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:05.400
Nevertheless, the performance
itself for any given size

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:13.830
is extremely impressive, I would
say, when the system is sparse

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.852
and the noise level
is kind of moderate.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.530
OK, let me skip this
because I don't have time.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:27.570
Let me briefly talk about
extension of this story

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.650
to multi-layer.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.710
So we are now briefly
discussing what

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.800
happens if you take this story
and you just propagate it

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.662
as you go along
the architecture.

00:37:38.662 --> 00:37:40.120
So let's start with
random weights.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.140
So the idea is maybe
something is good happening.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.610
Although initially
performance was poor,

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.250
maybe we can improve
the performance

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.160
by cascading such layers.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.010
And the answer is no,
particularly the noise level.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:55.950
This is now the
number of layers.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.840
What we discussed
before is here.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.120
And you see the problem
becomes worse and worse.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:04.350
As you continue to
propagate those signals,

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.050
the noise is amplified
and essentially goes to 1.

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:12.000
So basically you will get
just random performance

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.420
if you keep doing it
with random weights.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:20.520
The reason-- where is it?

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.600
I missed a slide.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.520
The reason is,
basically, that if you

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:28.380
think about the mapping
from one layer of noise

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.620
to another layer of noise, there
are two fixed points, 0 and 1.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.570
The 0 fixed point is unstable.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.490
Everything goes eventually to 1.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.090
So it is a nice--

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.340
this system gives you
a nice perspective

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:48.390
about this deep network
by thinking about it

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:49.780
as a kind of dynamical system.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.680
For instance, what
is the level of noise

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:56.520
at one layer, how it's
related to the level of noise

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.480
at previous layer.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.610
So it's kind of iterative map.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:01.950
Delta n versus delta n minus 1.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:05.040
And what's good about it
is, once you kind of draw

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.100
this curve, one layer is
mapped to another layer,

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.200
you can know what happens
to a deep network.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.769
We could just iterate this.

00:39:11.769 --> 00:39:13.560
You have to find what
are the fixed points,

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.434
and which one is stable
and which one is not.

00:39:15.434 --> 00:39:18.970
In this case, the 1 is
stable, the 0 is unstable.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.120
So, unfortunately,
from any level of noise

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.390
that you will start,
you eventually go to 1.

00:39:27.582 --> 00:39:29.750
Correlations, is a
similar story, but--

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:33.370
and the error will go to 0.5.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.610
So that's very well.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:40.270
There are cases, by the way,
that you can find parameters

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.000
where initially you
improve, like here.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.290
But then eventually
it will go to 0.5.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:49.720
Now, if we do similar--

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.790
if we compare this
to what happened

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:53.800
to the structured
weights if you keep

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.490
doing the same kind of
unsupervised Hebbian

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.700
learning from one
layer to another--

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.970
and I'll skip the details--
you see the opposite.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:08.140
So here are parameter
value in which

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:14.470
one stage of the expansion
stage is actually

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.550
increasing the noise.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:21.580
And this is because f is not too
small, and the load is large,

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.540
and the noise is starting.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.360
So you can have such situation.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.390
But even in such situation,
eventually the system

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:34.855
goes into stages where the
noise basically goes to 0.

00:40:34.855 --> 00:40:38.380
And if you compare
the story why it

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.230
is so to kind of
iterative map picture,

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.210
you see that the picture
is very different.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:45.980
You have one fixed point at 0.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.740
You have one fixed point at 1.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.010
You have intermediate
fixed point at high value.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.550
But this is an unstable
fixed point, and both of them

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:54.550
are stable fixed points.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:58.540
So if you start from even
from large values of noise,

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.700
eventually you
will iterate to 0.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:05.290
So it does buy
you to actually go

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:10.120
into several stages of this
deep network to make sure

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.730
that the noise is
suppressed to 0.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.380
Similarly for the correlations.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.440
Even if the parameters are such
that initially correlations

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.350
are increased, and you can
find parameters like that,

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.720
eventually correlations
will go to almost 0.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.840
And this is comparison
of the readout error

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.370
as a function of the layers
with structured weights,

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.840
and I compare it with
the readout error

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.740
of infinitely wide
layer, kind of a kernel

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.710
with infinitely wide kernel.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:44.830
And you can see
that, at least for--

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:49.240
here I compare the same type of
unsupervised learning but two

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.290
different architectures.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:52.270
One is deep network
architecture,

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:57.180
and the another one is shallow
architecture, infinitely wide.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:01.720
I'm not claiming that we can
show that there is no kernel

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.940
or shallow architecture
which will do better,

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:08.650
but I'm saying if we compare
the same learning rule

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.050
but with the two
different architectures,

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:14.320
you'll find that
you do gain by going

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.980
into multiple stages
of nonlinearity

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.590
than by using an
infinitely wide layer.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:24.980
I'll skip this.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:31.070
I want to go briefly
to two more issues.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.460
One issue is the
recurrent networks.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.200
Why recurrent networks?

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.830
The primary reason
is that, in each one

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:43.860
of those stages that I refer
to, if you look at the biology,

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.590
on most of them--

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:48.795
not all of them but most
of them, and definitely

00:42:48.795 --> 00:42:50.150
in neocortex--

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.810
you find massive recurrent
or lateral interactions

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.400
between each one of the layers.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.700
So, again, we would
like to ask, what

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.560
is the computational advantage
of having this recurrent layer.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.090
Now, in our case, we had an
extra motivation, and this is--

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:16.140
remember that I started in
saying that, in some cases,

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.550
there is experimental evidence
that the initial projection is

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:21.710
random.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:24.170
So that we ask ourselves,
what happens if we do this.

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:26.466
If we start from
random projection,

00:43:26.466 --> 00:43:31.160
feedforward projection, and
then add recurrent connections.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.560
Think about it as from the
olfactory bulb, for instance,

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.470
to piriform cortex, perhaps
random feedforward projections.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:42.235
But then the association,
recurrent connections

00:43:42.235 --> 00:43:45.200
in piriform cortex
are structured.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.560
How do we do that?

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:51.020
We start, we imagine starting
from random projection,

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.290
generating initial
representation

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.110
by the random projection,
and then stabilizing

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:58.910
those representation
into attractors

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.590
by the recurrent connections.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:04.780
And that actually
works pretty well.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.680
It's not the optimal
architecture,

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.700
but it's pretty well.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.850
For instance, noise,
which is initially

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.010
increased by the
random projections,

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.510
were quenched by
convergence to attractors.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.900
And, similarly, Q
will not go to 0,

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.810
but will not continue
growing, but will

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.150
go to an intermediate layer.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.760
And the error is pretty well.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.260
So if you look at in this
case, the error really

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.730
goes down to very low values.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.190
But now it's not layers.

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.440
Now it is the
number of iterations

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.150
of the recurrent connections.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:44.000
So you start from just input
layer, or random projection,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.450
and then you iterate the
dynamics and it goes to 0.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:48.420
So it's not the layers.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:55.160
It's just the dynamics of
the convergence to attractor.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.570
My final point.

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:58.600
I have 3 or 4 minutes?

00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.300
OK.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:04.670
My final point before wrapping
up is the question of top-down.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:09.980
So recurrent, we
briefly talked about it.

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.790
But incorporating contextual
knowledge is a major question.

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:17.900
How can you improve
on deep networks

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:22.820
by incorporating, not simply
the feedforward sensory input,

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:28.400
but other sources of knowledge
about this particular stimulus?

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:33.080
And it's important that we are
not talking about knowledge

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.690
about the statistics
of the input which

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:37.730
can be incorporated
into the learning

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:39.200
of the feedforward one.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.450
But we're talking
about inputs which are,

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:47.330
or knowledge, which we have now
on the network which already

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.430
has learned whatever
it has learned.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.610
So we have a mature network,
whatever the architecture is.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:53.840
We have a sensory input.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.400
It goes feedforward.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.610
And now we have additional
information, about

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.170
context for instance,
that we want

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:03.140
to incorporate with
the sensory input

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.345
to improve the performance.

00:46:05.345 --> 00:46:09.260
So how do we do that?

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:13.460
It turns out to be non-trivial
computational problem.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.980
It is very straightforward to
do it in Bayesian framework,

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.550
where you simply
update the prior

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:29.070
of what the sensory input is
by this contextual information.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.210
But if you want to
implement it in the network,

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:36.910
you find that it's
not easy to find

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.960
the appropriate architecture.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.530
So I'll just briefly
talk about how we do it.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.670
So imagine you have, again,
these sensory inputs,

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:50.460
but now there is some
context, different contexts.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.840
And imagine you
have an information

00:46:53.840 --> 00:47:00.710
that the input is coming from
that particular part of state

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:02.040
space.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.030
So basically the question is
how to amplify selectively

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:08.630
a specific set of states in
a distributed representation.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:12.790
So usually when we talk
about attention, or gating,

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:15.020
or questions like that,
we think about, OK, we

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.640
have these neurons.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.650
We suppress those, or
maybe amplify other ones.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.310
Or we have a set of
axons, or pathways.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:26.890
We suppress those,
and amplify those.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:29.410
But what about a
representation which is more

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:33.040
distributed where you have
to really suppress states

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.730
rather than neural populations.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:42.850
So I just won't go-- again,
it's a complicated architecture.

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:48.010
But, basically, we're using some
sort of a mixed representation,

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:52.090
where we take the sensory
input and the category

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.510
or contextual input,
mix the nonlinearity,

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:58.614
use them to clean it,
and propagate this.

00:47:58.614 --> 00:48:00.280
So it's a more
complicated architecture,

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.960
but it works beautifully.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.150
Let me show you here an
example, and you'll have

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:05.770
a flavor of what we are doing.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:13.420
So now the input, we have
those 900 spheres or templates,

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:20.110
but they are organized
into 30 categories,

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:23.440
and 30 tokens per category.

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.400
Now, the tokens, which are
the actual sensory inputs,

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.880
are represented by,
let's say, 200 neurons.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.695
And you have a small
number of neurons

00:48:32.695 --> 00:48:34.230
representing a category.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:35.434
Maybe 20 is enough.

00:48:35.434 --> 00:48:36.850
So that's important,
and you don't

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.320
have to really
expand dramatically

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.430
the representation.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.140
So this is the input.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.340
And now we have
very noisy inputs.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:51.440
If you look at the readout,
this is layers here,

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.600
and there is readout error.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.140
If you do it on the input
layer, or any subsequent layer

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.290
here, but without
top-down information.

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:03.610
With structured interactions
and all that I told you,

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.420
this is such a noisy input where
the performance is basically

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.800
0.5.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.150
There is nothing that you can
do without top-down information

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.540
in this network.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.600
You can ask what will
be the performance.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:21.910
If you have an ideal observer
that looks at the noisy input

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:27.310
and makes maximum
likelihood categorization.

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:28.920
Well, then it will
do much better.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.390
Also not 0, so this
is at this level.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:38.650
This higher error is
in virtue of the fact

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:42.190
that this network
is still not doing

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:46.990
what an optimal maximum
likelihood observer will do.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.320
So this is the network.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:53.110
This is a maximum likelihood
readout, both of them

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:56.320
without extra
top-down information.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.950
And in the network that
I kind of hinted about,

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:04.570
if you add this top-down
information by generating

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:08.740
mixed representation, you get
a performance which is really

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.210
dramatically improved.

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:16.690
And as you keep doing it
one layer from another,

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:21.310
you really get a very
nice performance.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.010
So let me just summarize.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:31.735
There is one more
before summarizing.

00:50:31.735 --> 00:50:33.130
Yeah, OK.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:33.820
Before that.

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:34.320
OK.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:40.930
So two points to bear in mind.

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:44.790
One of them is that what
I discussed to you today

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:51.460
relies on assuming either
random, comparing random

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:56.410
projection, to unsupervised
learning of a very simple type,

00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:59.010
of a kind of Hebbian type.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:07.480
The output can be Hebbian, or
perceptron, or SVM, and so on.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.040
You could ask,
what happens if you

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.850
use learning rules, more
sophisticated learning rules

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:14.140
for the unsupervised weights?

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.280
Some of them we've studied.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.470
But, anyway, that's something
which is important to explore.

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:24.640
And another very important
issue for thinking

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:28.110
about object
recognition in vision

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:33.340
and in other real-life
problem is input statistics.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.070
Because what we assumed
is a very simple mixture

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:37.870
of Gaussian model.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:40.930
So you can think about
the task of the network

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:46.270
is to take the invariance,
which is the variation away

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:49.080
from the center of the
spherical variation,

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:52.870
and to generate representation
which is invariant to that.

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:55.510
But this is a very simple
invariance problem,

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:58.450
because the
invariance was simply

00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:03.790
restricted to these simple
geometric structures.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:12.070
More problems which are closer
to what real-life problems are

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:17.200
will have inputs which
are, essentially, have

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.240
some structure,
but the structure

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.860
can be of a variety of shapes.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:27.090
Each one of them correspond
to an object, or a cluster,

00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:31.850
or a manifold representing an
entity, a perceptual entity.

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:37.220
But how you go from this
nice, simple problem

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:43.100
of this spherical invariance
problem to those problems,

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.780
it's of course a
challenging problem.

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:50.300
And that's the work which we
are now, ongoing work, also

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.990
with SueYeon Chung and Dan Lee.

00:52:53.990 --> 00:53:00.130
But it's a story which is still
at the stage of unfolding.
