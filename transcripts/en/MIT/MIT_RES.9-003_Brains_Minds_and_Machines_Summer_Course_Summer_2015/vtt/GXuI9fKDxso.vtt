00:00:22.212 --> 00:00:23.920
LAURA SCHULZ: So what
you've heard by now

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.570
is that the hard problem
of cognitive science

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.810
turns out to be the problem
of commonsense reasoning.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.710
Our computers can drive.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.880
They can perform
fabulous calculations.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.480
They can beat us at Jeopardy!

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.900
But when it comes to all
of the really hard problems

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.530
of cognitive science, there's
only one organism that solves

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.267
them, and that's a human child.

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:49.850
And those are problems of face
recognition, scene recognition,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.000
motor planning, natural language
acquisition, causal reasoning,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.770
theory of mind, moral reasoning.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.500
All of those are solved in
largely unsupervised learning

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.320
by children by the age of five.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.930
And those are the things
our computers don't do well.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.900
And that is largely because the
problem of human intelligence,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.030
common sense
intelligence, is a problem

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.550
of drawing really rich
inferences that are massively

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.032
underdetermined by the data.

00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:13.490
So to make that
point really clear,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.580
I'm to give you all a pop
intelligence quiz, OK?

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.440
So here's the pop
intelligence quiz.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.940
Can I see a show
of hands, please--

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.210
how many of you think
that I have a spleen?

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.770
Can I see a show of hands?

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.770
Excellent.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.890
How many of you would care--

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.770
keep your hands down
if you're an M.D.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.700
But other than that,
how many of you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.470
would care to come
up here and diagram,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.900
for the class, a spleen,
and explain what it is,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.810
where it is, and what its exact
function is in the human body?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.970
Anyone?

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.320
How many of you
have met me before?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.060
A few of you.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.950
But most of you, without
knowing anything about spleens,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.490
and not knowing
anything about me,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.930
are nonetheless extremely
confident that I have one.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.970
So you have a lot of
abstract knowledge

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.480
in the absence of
really much in the way

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.791
of specific, concrete facts.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.290
OK, let me give you
another problem.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.810
Of course, it's a kind
of classic one from--

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.424
by the way, for those of you who
are curious, that's a spleen.

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:15.020
All right, classic--
these problems

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.964
crop up in every aspect of
human cognition, all right?

00:02:17.964 --> 00:02:19.130
What's behind the rectangle?

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.835
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:22.800
LAURA SCHULZ: Right.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.560
You all know.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.050
You can't articulate
it, but you know.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.450
And the fact that
there are infinitely

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.690
many other hypotheses
consistent with the data

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.390
doesn't trouble you at
all, doesn't stop you

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.787
from converging, collectively,
on a single answer, which

00:02:38.787 --> 00:02:41.120
means there has to be a lot
of constraints on how you're

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.589
interpreting this kind of data.

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.380
Here's another one.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.106
Complete the sentence.

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:46.420
AUDIENCE: Very long neck.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.770
LAURA SCHULZ: Very long neck--

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.650
could be, or temper,
or flight to Kenya.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.540
There are many things
that it could be.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.546
In this case, it looks
like a frequency issue.

00:02:54.546 --> 00:02:56.170
Oh, well, "neck" is
a very common word.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.950
Others aren't.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.610
But if I said, "giraffes are
really common on the African--"

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.760
you would say "savannah,"
not "television," OK?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.850
So you're using a lot
of rich information

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.600
to take a tiny bit of data
and draw rich inferences.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.672
And that is the problem,
and the hard problem,

00:03:11.672 --> 00:03:13.130
of common sense
intelligence, and I

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.760
think, a real dissociation
between what we do

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.140
and what our children do.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.200
Human intelligence uses abstract
structured representations

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.732
to constrain the
hypotheses and make

00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:24.190
these kind of
outrageous inferences

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.606
that we shouldn't
be able to make.

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:27.670
That's all well
and good, but where

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.640
do these abstract structured
representations come from?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.140
And there's only
two possibilities--

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.200
we're born with them,
or we learn them.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.390
Liz Spelke has already told
you a lot about the reasons

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.440
to think that we are
born with many of them,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.350
and so true for
anything that might

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.180
be stable over
evolutionary time, that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.231
might emerge early in ontogeny
and broadly in phylogeny.

00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.480
And that's true for many
aspects of folk physics, folk

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.220
psychology, causal reasoning,
navigation, number.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.319
But there's a lot of
other things you know.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.610
Shoes, ships, sealing wax--
basically everything else--

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.170
they are not plausibly innate.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.230
And so how do you learn them?

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.750
So Piaget, the
founder of our field

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.080
of developmental psychology,
says you build these up

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.370
from experience.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.760
You build them up starting with
sensory motor representations

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.140
very, very gradually.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.420
You progress through a lot
of concrete information

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.450
until finally, somewhere
around the age of 12,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.450
you get to abstract
representations of the world.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.820
But it turns out that just
like you and your spleens,

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.160
children have a lot
of abstract knowledge

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.150
before they have much of
this concrete information.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.740
They know, actually,
almost nothing--

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.364
even less than you
know, it turns out--

00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:38.650
about anatomy and biology.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.090
But they know all of
these kinds of things.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.080
Animals have insides.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.150
Similar kinds of animals
have similar insides.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.500
Plants and objects don't.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.050
Removing those insides
is a bad idea usually.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.530
They can go on and on without
really understanding anything

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.790
about anatomy or biology.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.560
And so for you.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.730
If I push you hard on
all kinds of things--

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.460
how does a scissors
really work--

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.160
you know, most of you would
be like, ahh, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.290
pretty quick, OK?

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.340
And we know this.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.877
So we have these
intuitive theories

00:05:06.877 --> 00:05:08.710
that seem to constrain
our hypothesis space.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.570
But it's a really hard
chicken and egg problem,

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.910
because we've said we need
these rich abstract theories

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.770
to constrain the
interpretation of data.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.270
But how do we learn
them if we don't

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.410
have concrete information?

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.172
And nonetheless, some
of them are learned.

00:05:19.172 --> 00:05:21.380
We're going to return to
that at the end of the talk.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.740
And really, I'm going to do that
to set up Josh and Tomer, who

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.070
are going to talk about that.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.695
But first, what I'm
going to talk about

00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:29.170
is-- you know, OK, why
am I talking about this

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.190
as an intuitive theory?

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.200
Where is this
argument coming from?

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.540
I'm interested in learning.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.350
And it's a research
program that emerged

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.870
against the backdrop
of two revolutions

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.970
in our understanding of
cognitive development.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.320
One was the infancy revolution.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.900
You've heard a lot about it, so
I'm going to go very quickly.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.441
Babies, it turns
out, know a lot more

00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:48.520
than we thought about
objects, and about number,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.600
and about agents, and their
goals, and their intentions.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.400
It's not just infants though.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.560
It turns out that very young
children, preschoolers, also

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.440
represent knowledge
that is not plausibly

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.780
innate in ways that are
abstract, that are coherent,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.560
that are causal, that support
prediction, and intervention,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.890
and explanation, and
counterfactual reasoning

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.290
in ways that seem
to justify referring

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.100
to them as intuitive theories.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.960
And together, these
two revolutions,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.134
the infancy revolution
and the revolution

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:26.800
in our understanding
of early childhood,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.330
dismantled Piagetian
stage theory.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.220
There was never a time--

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.980
there is never a
time-- in development

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.490
when babies are only
sensory motor learners.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.040
There is never a time
when there is not

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.780
some level of abstract
representation going on.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.380
But fundamentally, neither
of these revolutions

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.267
was about learning per se.

00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:51.100
And I think I can make
that point most clear

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.420
by pointing to a popular book
that came out at the time.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.669
The subtitle here is Minds,
Brains, and How Children Learn.

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.210
But in fact, if you
look in the book,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.418
this was a publisher's title.

00:07:01.418 --> 00:07:02.640
There's nothing about brains.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.390
And there's very
little about learning.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.660
The titles are what children
know about objects, what

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.080
children know about agents.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.850
And I can say this with great
reverence and some authority,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.160
because the first author's
my thesis advisor.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.810
And the book came
out in 1999, which

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.850
is the year I started
graduate school.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.760
So literally and metaphorically,
this is where I began.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.010
I began with this metaphor
of the child as scientist.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.020
And it's a really
problematic metaphor,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.440
because science is a
historically and culturally

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.290
specific practice
that is practiced

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.600
by a tiny minority
of the human species

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.000
and is difficult
even for us, right?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.190
So it seems a really
odd place to look

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.750
for a universal metaphor
for cognitive development.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.610
But science has this
peculiar property,

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.420
which is that it
gets the world right.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.570
And if you really want to
understand how new knowledge is

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.480
possible, how you could
get the world right,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.990
you might want to understand
how scientists do it,

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.420
what kinds of
epistemic practices

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.390
might support learning
and discovery.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.771
And the answer to that is both
that we do and do not know,

00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:12.520
which is to say we can
say a lot of things

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.720
about what scientists do.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.900
Here are some of them.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.410
They'll all be familiar to you.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.960
They would be familiar to
you if you were a physicist,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.690
if you were in aero-astro,
if you were in paleontology.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.700
These are the kinds of
scientific practices

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.150
that cut across content
domains and arguably define

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.947
what science is,
which is to say,

00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:33.280
if you did all of these things,
you couldn't necessarily

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.210
do science.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.940
Science requires bringing
these inferential processes

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.000
to bear on really
rich, specific,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.310
conceptual representations of
individual content domains.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.562
But arguably, if you had all
of that rich, specific content

00:08:47.562 --> 00:08:49.270
knowledge and you
didn't do these things,

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.040
you couldn't learn
anything at all.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.380
These are the kinds
of epistemic practices

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.220
that seem fundamental to
inquiry and discovery.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.480
And the argument that I've
made in my research program

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.521
is they are fundamental
not just in science, they

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:02.980
are fundamental in
cognitive development.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.030
These are the processes that
support learning and discovery.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.780
And there's good evidence that
each and every one of them

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.190
emerges in some form in the
first few years of life.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.800
And that is because these are
the only rational processes

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.090
we know of that can solve the
hard problem of learning, which

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.150
is exactly the
problem of how to draw

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.900
rich abstract entrances
rapidly and accurately

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.720
from sparse, noisy data.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.570
I said we could characterize
these practices both formally

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.380
and informally.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.115
And indeed, as you've
heard, I think,

00:09:38.115 --> 00:09:40.240
from some of our computational
modeling colleagues,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.167
for each and every one
of these practices,

00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:43.750
we can begin to
characterize something

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.290
about what it means
to distinguish

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.110
genuine causes from
spurious associations

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.160
or to optimize information gain.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.300
But with all due respect to
my computational modeling

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.270
colleagues, and much as we
want really simple models--

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.930
Hebb's rule,
Rescorla-Wagner, Bayes' law--

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.820
that would capture
it, none of these

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.100
do justice to what
children can do.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.340
Because children can
do all of these things.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.190
And we don't yet have
a full formal theory

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.160
of hypothesis, generation,
inquiry, and discovery.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.322
That remains a hard problem
of cognitive science.

00:10:21.322 --> 00:10:22.780
But it's a problem
to which I think

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.580
our theories should aspire.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.920
Because there is
good empirical data

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.440
that this is the kind of
learning that humans, including

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.740
even very young
children, engage in.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.650
So normally, at this point,
what I would do is I'd say,

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.650
and I'm going to show you
a few examples of this

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.355
from my research program.

00:10:41.355 --> 00:10:43.730
But the talk I'm giving here
is a sort of funny throwback

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.670
talk in some ways.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.920
What I was asked
to talk about today

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.044
was the child as scientist.

00:10:47.044 --> 00:10:50.450
And that was a research program
from a few, few years ago.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.700
And you know, at that point,
I was a junior professor.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.230
And you know, when you're
a junior professor,

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.230
like when you're a graduate
student or post-doc,

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.140
it's all idealistic science
for the sake of knowledge,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.960
pure science.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.000
And then you get tenure.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.210
And it's all grants, and
money, and administration,

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.370
and allocation of resources.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.340
And in the years
since, I have started

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.140
to think not just about the
pure science of learning,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.500
but about the cost associated
with gaining information

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.820
and the trade-offs between
those costs and rewards.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.680
So I'm going to take these same
practices now, and situate them

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.890
in a world, a real world, that
has certain kinds of trade-offs

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.380
in how you think about
information and talk,

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.210
along with the
child as scientist,

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.780
about what those costs
do and how they are also,

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.386
in themselves, a source of
information about the world.

00:11:38.386 --> 00:11:40.010
So I'm going to talk
about this as sort

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.200
of inferential economics.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.820
Children know
information is valuable.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.620
I'm going to show you
a couple of examples

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.630
of how they reason about it.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.120
And children selectively
explore in ways

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.371
that support information gain.

00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:52.994
So I'm going to show
you some old work,

00:11:52.994 --> 00:11:55.100
but I'm also going to
throw in a few new studies,

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.070
because I can't resist.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.310
But information is also costly.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.120
And the costs themselves
are informative in a variety

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.830
of ways.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.413
I'm not necessarily going to get
through all of these studies,

00:12:05.413 --> 00:12:07.620
although I might try to.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.970
But I want to give you a kind
of feel for the kinds of things

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.180
children can do.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.690
All right, so let's
start by talking

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.899
about a really basic problem.

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:17.523
It's a problem that's
basic to science,

00:12:17.523 --> 00:12:20.060
but it's also a problem basic
to human learning, which is

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.330
the problem of generalization.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.810
How do you generalize
from sparse data?

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.732
In science, we do
this all the time.

00:12:25.732 --> 00:12:26.690
We have a small sample.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.990
We want to make a claim about
the population as a whole.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.820
And of course, we can use
feature similarity and category

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.230
membership to say things
that look the same

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.960
or belong to the same kind are
likely to share properties.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.370
So if some of
these Martian rocks

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.860
have high concentrations of
silica, maybe they all do.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.130
If some of these needles
on Pacific silver fir trees

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.230
grow flat on the branch,
maybe they all do.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.520
But in science, we can also
do something a little more

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.140
fussy and suspicious.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.600
We can say, well,
you know, it kind of

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.155
depends on how you got that
sample of evidence, right?

00:13:02.155 --> 00:13:04.612
If you randomly sampled from
the population, yeah, sure,

00:13:04.612 --> 00:13:06.070
the properties,
you can generalize.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.620
But if you cherry-picked
that data in some way,

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.310
maybe the sample isn't going
to generalize quite as broadly.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.590
So do all Martian rocks have
high concentrations of silica

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:17.620
or just the dusty
ones on the surface?

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.620
Do all Pacific silver fir
needles lie flat or just

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.870
those low on the canopy, right?

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.950
These are the ones that
are easy to sample from.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.677
How do I know how
generalizable the property is?

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:30.760
And if I think that you
cherry-picked your sample,

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.970
I might constrain my inferences
only to things near the ground.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.470
So how far you're
going to extend

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.780
a generalization in
science depends on

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.940
whether you think that
the sampling process was

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.110
random or selective.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.360
And we wanted to know whether
this was true for babies

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.730
as well.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.820
So this is how we asked.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.950
We showed babies a
population, in this case,

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.350
of blue and yellow dog toys.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.330
They're in a box.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.920
The box is transparent, has
a false front so it stays

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.990
a less stable representation of
what looks like a lot of balls.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.900
And we're going to
reach into that box.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.739
And we're going to pull out--

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:03.280
there are many more blue balls
in this box than yellow balls.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.620
We're going to pull out three
blue balls one at a time

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.880
and squeak them--

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.896
and squeeze them-- and
they're going to squeak.

00:14:08.896 --> 00:14:11.020
And then we're going to
hand the baby a yellow ball

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.980
from the same box.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.170
And the question is, does
the baby squeeze the ball

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.335
and expect it to squeak?

00:14:16.335 --> 00:14:18.460
Well, there's nothing very
suspicious about pulling

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.180
three blue balls from a
box of mostly blue balls.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.160
And this has a lot of
feature properties in common.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.729
So it looks like the others.

00:14:26.729 --> 00:14:28.520
We predict that children
should generalize.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.330
They should try squeezing this
ball and should squeeze often.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.704
And the question
is, what happens

00:14:32.704 --> 00:14:36.490
if you do exactly the same
sample in exactly the same way

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.054
from a different population?

00:14:39.054 --> 00:14:41.470
Now, it is very unlikely that
you sampled three blue balls

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.140
from a population of
mostly yellow balls.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.610
In this case, it's
much more likely

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.800
that you were
sampling selectively.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.350
So maybe only the blue
balls had the property.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.850
Yeah?

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.920
AUDIENCE: And they can
see the population?

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.419
LAURA SCHULZ: They can see the
population-- transparent box,

00:14:55.419 --> 00:14:56.670
transparent front.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.160
So they can see the population.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.670
And if children
understand that it's

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.210
not just about the
property similarity

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.120
but something about how that
evidence was generated, then,

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.125
in this case, children
should say, well look,

00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:11.500
you just looked like you were
cherry-picking your sample.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.270
Maybe it doesn't
generalize predictions

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.340
that fewer children
should try squeaking

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.234
and children should
squeeze less often.

00:15:17.234 --> 00:15:19.150
So I'm going to show you
what this looks like.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.680
By the way, the yellow one has
that funny thing at the end

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.230
so that children could do
something else with the ball,

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.730
right?

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.170
So they can bang it,
or throw it around,

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.290
or other things like that.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.961
So let me show you
what it looks like.

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:31.210
Kids are always going to see
three squeaky blue balls.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.918
They're always going
to get a yellow one.

00:15:32.918 --> 00:15:35.200
But you'll see that they do
different things depending

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.010
on whether they think--

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.370
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.930
LAURA SCHULZ: --the evidence
was randomly sampled

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.460
and possibly
generalizable or not.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.740
So the child at the
top is squeezing,

00:15:48.740 --> 00:16:04.992
and squeezing, and
squeezing, and squeezing.

00:16:12.864 --> 00:16:14.360
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.970
So these were-- this was
true both of the mean number

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.077
of squeezes and the number
of individual children

00:16:19.077 --> 00:16:19.910
who squeezed at all.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.760
I'm just going to show you
the mean number of squeezes.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.843
But what you'll see is
that children are much more

00:16:23.843 --> 00:16:26.000
likely to squeeze, and
squeeze persistently,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.830
in the condition where
the evidence looks

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.202
like it was randomly sampled
than selectively sampled.

00:16:31.202 --> 00:16:32.660
But what you could
worry about here

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.130
is children are
sensitive to something

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.230
about the relationship of the
sample and the population.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.700
But maybe they will
just generalize

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.770
from a majority object to a
minority, but not the reverse.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.990
Maybe they won't generalize
from a minority object

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.107
to the majority.

00:16:46.107 --> 00:16:48.440
So they don't really care
about whether the evidence was

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.120
randomly sampled
or not, they just

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.060
care about that aspect of
the sample and population.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.730
So we ran a replication of
the yellow ball condition.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.520
Again, we're going to pull an
unlikely sample from that box,

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.900
three blue balls in a row.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.420
And we're going to compare
it with a sample that's

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.470
not that improbable.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.579
You could easily randomly
sample just one blue ball

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:07.710
from the box.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.369
So in this case,
children are going

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.038
to see much less
squeezing, right?

00:17:12.038 --> 00:17:14.079
They're only going to see
one blue ball squeezed.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.020
And we squeeze it both
once and three times,

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.944
but it's only one blue ball
in two different conditions.

00:17:18.944 --> 00:17:21.319
And the prediction there is
that even though the children

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.169
themselves are seeing
much less squeezing,

00:17:23.169 --> 00:17:25.460
they should say, well, that's
not an improbable sample.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.940
And they, themselves,
should squeeze more.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:34.040
And that's exactly what we found
in both of those conditions.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.220
It's graded, by the way.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.440
If you do two balls,
they're intermediate.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.464
And if it's a model--

00:17:37.464 --> 00:17:39.380
well, not going to talk
about-- but yeah, what

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.227
happens if you just pour them
upside down and drop them?

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.810
Now this is a really
improbable sample

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.601
I said, three blue
balls from a yellow box.

00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:47.360
But you've just given
positive evidence

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.340
that you shook the ball, and
it just happened to fall out.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.881
And they don't know
we're MIT, and we

00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:54.460
can do sneaky technological
things like have a trap door.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.510
So in this case, it's
an improbable sample,

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.920
but it was randomly generated.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.660
And the prediction
is, in this case,

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.960
the babies themselves
should squeeze more.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.460
Because as I say, if you can
pour out any balls that squeak,

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.080
probably everything squeaks.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.137
And indeed, they do.

00:18:07.137 --> 00:18:08.420
Indeed, they do.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.260
All right?

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.950
So 15-month-old
babies' generalizations

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.230
take into account more
than category membership

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.180
and the perceptual
similarity of objects.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.160
They make graded inferences
that are sensitive

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.410
both to the amount of
evidence they observe

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.140
and to the process by which
that evidence is sampled.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.081
Is that clear?

00:18:26.081 --> 00:18:27.830
All right, let me show
you another example

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.110
of sort of child as scientist.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.610
It's going to start with a
hard problem of confounding

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.985
that we all have, which is
that we are part of the world.

00:18:33.985 --> 00:18:35.760
So in one-offs, when
things go wrong,

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.580
we may not know if
we were responsible

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.110
or the world was
responsible, right?

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.280
This is a chronic problem
in relationships, right--

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.730
you or me?

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.710
So it's a hard problem
of confounding,

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.842
and you might need some
data to disambiguate it.

00:18:47.842 --> 00:18:50.300
So here we're going to give
babies a case where they cannot

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.630
do something.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.570
And the question
is, can we give them

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.332
a little bit of data to
unconfound that problem

00:18:57.332 --> 00:18:59.540
and convince them either
that the problem is probably

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.219
with the toy or the
problem is with themselves?

00:19:02.219 --> 00:19:04.510
And the argument is, if they
think that it's themselves

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.343
that's the problem--

00:19:05.343 --> 00:19:07.670
it's the agent state and
not the environment state--

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.730
they should hold the toy
constant and change the agent.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.760
But if they think it's
the toy, then they

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.830
should just go ahead and
reach for another toy.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.746
So in both cases, they're
going to have access

00:19:17.746 --> 00:19:19.560
to another person, their mom.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.980
And they're going to have
access to another toy.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.070
And so the question
is, what do they

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:29.280
do if we give them
minimal statistical data

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.880
to disambiguate these, OK?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.430
So this is the setup.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.340
We're going to show
the babies two agents.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:43.220
In one condition, I am going
to succeed one time at making

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.805
that toy go and fail one time.

00:19:45.305 --> 00:19:48.770
And Hyowon Gweon, my
collaborator on this project,

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.490
is also going to fail
and succeed once.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.419
So this looks like this
toy has maybe faulty wiring

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:53.960
or something.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.793
It works some of the
time, not all the time.

00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:57.480
It's just not a great toy.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.240
The babies can have another toy.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.710
The parents are
going to be there.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.420
If they think it's the toy,
they should change the object.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.410
In the other condition, Hyowon
is always going to succeed,

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.050
which is generally
true in my experience.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.490
And as is always true of my
experience in technology,

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.690
I am always going to fail.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.030
And in this case,
the children should

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.000
conclude that there's something
wrong with the person.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.850
And if that's the case, they
should hold the object constant

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:23.735
and change the agent.

00:20:23.735 --> 00:20:24.860
This is what it looks like.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.245

00:20:32.969 --> 00:20:34.260
LAURA SCHULZ: We've lost sound.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.210
Well there's an audio
here, but [INAUDIBLE] we

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.434
are going to want that later.

00:20:47.434 --> 00:20:49.469
- Cool What happened to my toys?

00:20:49.469 --> 00:20:51.510
LAURA SCHULZ: In any case,
were just showing them

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.470
the data at this point.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.120
And the babies are going to
get the toy in each condition.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.334
One toy is on the mat.

00:20:56.334 --> 00:20:58.500
By the way, there are lots
of individual differences

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.620
in any two sets of clips
between the exact positioning

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.810
of the parent, the
child, the toy.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.750
All of these were
coded blind conditions

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.520
for all of these other
variables to make

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.870
sure those were evenly
matched across conditions,

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:11.820
and they were.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.120
So what you're going
to see now though is

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.950
that in the condition where
the babies think it is probably

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:23.730
the toy, they engage in
a very different behavior

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:30.190
than when they think
it is probably agent.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.615

[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:42.756 --> 00:21:44.130
And that's what
we found overall.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.410
The distribution, overall,
of children's tendency

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.190
to perform one
action versus another

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.420
differed across conditions
depending on the pattern

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.140
of data that they observed.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.900
So 16-month-olds track
the statistical dependence

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.490
between agents,
objects, and outcomes.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.440
They can use minimal data
to make attributions.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.830
And they help them choose
between seeking help

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:10.920
from others or
exploring on their own.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.624
Clear?

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:15.560
OK.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.900
I've just shown you kids'
sensitivity to the data

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.680
that they see.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.990
But of course, data isn't
handed out all the time.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.950
At least disambiguating
data isn't handed out.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.964
One of the really
important, hard things

00:22:24.964 --> 00:22:26.630
that you have to do
if you want to learn

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.940
is sometimes actually
figure out what data would

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.320
be informative and go get it.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.230
And that is a really
characteristic thing

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.860
about science.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.760
And the question is,
is it, in some sense,

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.755
a characteristic thing
about common sense.

00:22:37.755 --> 00:22:39.380
So that's what we're
going to ask here.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.530
We're going to jump to
much older children here.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.110
These are four and
five-year-olds.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.660
And we're going to give
them a problem where

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.910
instead of showing them
the disambiguating data,

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.277
we're going to ask if the
kids themselves will find it.

00:22:52.277 --> 00:22:54.360
So what we showed children--
when you were little,

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.700
you possibly played
with some beads

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.430
that snapped together
and pulled apart.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.960
These are like toddler toys.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.710
So we gave them these
snap together beads.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.120
They're each uniquely colored.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.220
We place each bead, one
at a time, on a toy.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.110
And in one condition, every
bead makes the toy play music

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.610
to each bead you put on.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.615
And the other condition,
only half the beads did.

00:23:16.615 --> 00:23:18.740
So the only difference
between these two conditions

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.990
is basically the base rate
of the candidate causes.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.060
One works for every bead,
the other only works

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.880
for some of the beads.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.084
And then we took all
these training toys away,

00:23:28.084 --> 00:23:29.750
and we showed the
children either a pair

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.460
that we had epoxied
together-- it was stuck.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.290
We tried to pull it apart,
we showed we couldn't.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.700
The children tried to pull
it apart, they couldn't.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.230
It's a stuck pair
of beads, or it's

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.810
an ordinary, separable
pair of beads.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.240
And then, as a pair, we placed
each pair, one at a time,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.120
on the toy, and the
toy played music.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.400
In principle, this evidence
is always confounded.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.580
One bead in each pair might
be the responsible party

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.267
activating the toy.

00:23:51.267 --> 00:23:52.850
But as a practical
matter, if you just

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.529
learn the base rate is that
every single bead activates

00:23:55.529 --> 00:23:58.070
this toy, there's not a lot of
information to be gained here.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.980
You should just assume that
all of these beads work.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.870
And in that
condition, we expected

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.060
that kids would play
indiscriminately

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.352
with the two toys.

00:24:06.352 --> 00:24:09.350
But in the condition where
only some of the beads work,

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.830
there's genuine uncertainty.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:11.330
Right?

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.900
Maybe only one of
these beads work.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.480
Maybe they both did.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.980
And if that's true,
and if kids are

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.440
sensitive to the possibility
of information gain,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.360
only one of these beads affords
the possibility of finding out.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.330
On only one can you
isolate the variables.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.820
And that's with
the separable pair.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.070
So we thought on this condition,
the kids should selectively

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.278
play with the separable pair.

00:24:29.278 --> 00:24:32.120
And in particular, they should
place each bead, one at a time,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.220
on the toy.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.657
So that's, in
fact, what we find.

00:24:35.657 --> 00:24:37.490
In the obvious condition,
the kids basically

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.164
never separated the pair.

00:24:39.164 --> 00:24:41.330
And in the some beads
condition, about half the kids

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:46.280
did it and performed the
exhaustive intervention.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.620
That was cool, but my graduate
student at the time said,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.370
they're doing something
really interesting

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.610
even with the stuck
pair of beads.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.129
We should look at
the stuck pair.

00:24:54.129 --> 00:24:56.170
And I said, what can they
do with the stuck pair?

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.730
There's nothing to be
done with the stuck pair.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.230
It's stuck.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.021
And she said, well,
let's just try it again

00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:00.869
with the stuck pair.

00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:01.910
So we did the same thing.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.980
They got introduced the fact
that either every bead worked,

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.000
or only some of
the beads worked.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.190
And this time we introduced
just the stuck pair,

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.180
and we placed it on the
toy, and the toy made music.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.930
And let me show you
what the children did.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:12.200
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.156
- All right, I'm
going to do this one,

00:25:14.156 --> 00:25:16.112
and then it'll be your
turn a little later.

00:25:16.112 --> 00:25:19.140
But now, can you just watch
and see watch happens?

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:19.895
All right.

00:25:24.178 --> 00:25:27.154
This one makes the machine go.

00:25:27.154 --> 00:25:30.240
How about this one?

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.350
This one doesn't
make the machine go.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.130
What about this one?

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.634
This one doesn't
make the machine go.

00:25:39.634 --> 00:25:42.898
Let's try this one.

00:25:42.898 --> 00:25:44.182
This one makes the machine go.

00:25:44.182 --> 00:25:46.140
LAURA SCHULZ: She goes
over that a second time,

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.750
and then she hands
the child the toy.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.690
- Just a minute.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.557
- Look at that.

00:25:54.557 --> 00:25:55.140
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.639
LAURA SCHULZ: The child plays
around, does just what we did.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.651
And then she does
something we'd never done.

00:26:07.651 --> 00:26:09.150
She rotates the
position of the bead

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.158
so that only one makes contact
with the toy at a time.

00:26:13.158 --> 00:26:17.898
And if you have a folk
theory of contact causality,

00:26:17.898 --> 00:26:21.400
that is a pretty good way
to isolate your variables.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.420
And not one that had
occurred to, say, the PI

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.657
on this investigation.

00:26:24.657 --> 00:26:26.240
But in fact, it
occurred to about half

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.370
the kids again,
in that condition.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.010
In the some beads condition,
where there was uncertainty,

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.960
the kids were more likely to
design their own intervention

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.950
to try to isolate the variables
than in the condition where

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.951
all the beads worked.

00:26:38.951 --> 00:26:40.910
So preschoolers are
using information

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.680
about the base rate
of candidate causes

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.732
to distinguish the
ambiguity of the evidence,

00:26:44.732 --> 00:26:46.190
and they're selecting
and designing

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.740
potentially informative
interventions to isolate

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.350
these causal variables.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.200
All right.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.750
I'm going to show
you some new work

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.010
now, kind of on the same theme.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.010
One way that investigations
can be uninformative

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.691
is because evidence
is confounded.

00:27:02.691 --> 00:27:04.190
We're all familiar
with that, right?

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.960
We think we did the perfect
experiment, then we're like,

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.580
oh, well, it really could have
been because of this really

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.140
silly, boring reason.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.760
And that's disappointing.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.150
And we have to run it again.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.240
But another reason
that investigations

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.060
can be uninformative is because
they generate outcomes that

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.120
are super hard to distinguish.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.460
So if I have a
handkerchief in one pocket,

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.704
and a candy cane in
the other, then a child

00:27:24.704 --> 00:27:26.120
who wants that
candy cane is going

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.670
to have no trouble patting
you down and finding the candy

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:29.240
cane.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.550
But if I have a
pen in one pocket

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.770
and a candy cane in
the other, that's

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.082
going to be a harder problem.

00:27:35.082 --> 00:27:37.040
And this might be more
salient to you if I say,

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.860
you're going to go in and have
a lab test for a fatal disease,

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.792
or potentially a benign disease.

00:27:41.792 --> 00:27:44.000
And you know what the results
are going to look like?

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.860
One is going to
be reddish maroon,

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.620
and the other is going
to be maroonish red.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.330
OK, that's not the
kind of test you want.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.470
You want yellow, blue, right?

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.420
So this is important.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.040
We care about how
much uncertainty there

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.230
is over interpreting
the outcome as well.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:06.230
So if children are sensitive
to how useful actions are

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.910
for information gain,
then they should

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.610
prefer interventions that
generate distinctive patterns

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:12.260
of evidence.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:17.510
So Max Siegel in my lab has
been running some experiments

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.455
like this.

00:28:18.455 --> 00:28:20.390
He started with a very
simple one, basically

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.950
the equivalent of the
handkerchief and the candy

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:22.450
cane.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.680
He said, OK, there's either
a bean bag in this box

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.971
that I'm going to put in
here, or a pencil in this box.

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:29.150
It is a shiny, cool,
hologram, sparkly pencil.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.632
You'll want it.

00:28:30.632 --> 00:28:32.340
That's going to go in
this box over here.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.890
And in this box,
either the really cool,

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.970
shiny hologram pencil, or the
really boring yellow pencil

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:36.690
is going to go in this box.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:37.790
And guess what I'm going to do?

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.890
I'm going to take each box,
and I'm going to shake it.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:40.580
So he does that.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.070
And you know what
you hear both times?

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.270
Ka-thunk, ka-thunk, ka-thunk.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.478
Ka-thunk, ka-thunk, ka-thunk.

00:28:44.478 --> 00:28:46.100
Indistinguishable sounds.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.100
And now the question is,
which box do you want to open?

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.710
Which box you want to open?

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:51.290
Right?

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.850
And if you're sensitive
to the ambiguity,

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.710
you should say, well,
listen, if it were a beanbag,

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.160
I would really know, so that
must be the sparkly pencil,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.410
right?

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:58.820
But I'm never going
to know in this box,

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.736
because both pencils are
going to sound alike,

00:29:00.736 --> 00:29:03.280
so I really better
choose this box.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.100
And then he's going to
do a harder problem.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.884
He's going to say, there are
eight shiny, colorful marbles--

00:29:11.884 --> 00:29:12.800
you really want them--

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.400
in this box, or two
really boring white ones.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.800
Or there are eight colorful,
shiny marbles in this box,

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.130
or six really boring white ones.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.980
In each case, they
each get hidden, you're

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.627
going to hear the box.

00:29:26.627 --> 00:29:29.210
In each case, it's going to make
exactly the same sound, which

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.220
is actually the sound of
eight marbles in a box.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.420
And the question is, which
box do you want to open?

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.400
So let me show you
how that works.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.296

Well, you see these marbles
right here, the white ones?

00:29:40.622 --> 00:29:42.068
These are Bunny's.

of different colors, those

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.840

going to hide either

your marbles or Bunny's
marbles inside of this box.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.850
And then I'm going
to hide either

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.570
your or Bunny's marbles
inside of this box.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.769

get another sticker.

to put Bunny's right here,

LAURA SCHULZ: We'll skip
the one more time, but--

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.261
oops.

00:31:15.261 --> 00:31:15.760
Sorry.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.220
You can at the
general principle.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.700
The children are overwhelmingly
good at this kind of task,

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.590
it turns out, in
both of these cases

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.110
and in many, many other
iterations they went.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:35.347
They're very confident
about which box

00:31:35.347 --> 00:31:37.430
they should pick, which
means they're representing

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.950
to themselves something about
the ambiguity of the evidence,

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.870
and their own
ability to perceive

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.760
these kinds of distinctions.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.570
So with Max, we've
been talking about this

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.590
as a kind of intuitive
psychophysics,

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.690
where they can represent
their own discrimination

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:54.770
threshold to make these
kinds of distinctions.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.570
And they prefer
interventions that

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:58.640
generate distinctive
patterns of evidence

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.790
and maximize the possibility
of information gain.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.440
Is that clear?

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.920
OK.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.740
So there's a lot of
ways in which children

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.530
seem to be using intuitive
theories, some kind

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.800
of abstract, higher
order of knowledge,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:19.130
to make inferences from data.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.600
But information is also
costly to generate.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.890
And the costs themselves
are informative.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.920
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about that piece now.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.440
It's costly both
for the learner,

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.390
who cannot learn everything.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:35.582
And in a cultural context,
where you're not just

00:32:35.582 --> 00:32:37.040
learning and
exploring on your own,

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.500
but you're actually getting
information from other people,

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:47.220
it's costly also for the
teacher or for the informant.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.989
And these kinds
of costs, and how

00:32:48.989 --> 00:32:50.780
we negotiate these
kinds of costs, I think,

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.750
are really fundamental
to a lot of hard problems

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.920
in communication and language.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.540
Lots of the field of
pragmatics deals with problems

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.869
of underdetermination.

00:33:00.869 --> 00:33:02.910
We say these sentences,
we understand each other.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.690
We understand each other in all
kinds of ambiguous contexts.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.000
We use a lot of social
cues and other information

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.140
to disambiguate.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.960
But part of what we do
is, we make inferences

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.790
about how much this
person is going

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.150
to communicate in
this context, given

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.820
how much I need to understand.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.505
And we use this to resolve
these kinds of ambiguities.

00:33:22.505 --> 00:33:26.431
I'm going to give you a
few examples of that here.

00:33:26.431 --> 00:33:28.430
Now, again, I'm going to
start with the study we

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.929
did a while ago then show you
a little bit more recent work.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.920
I'm going to skip
over some of this just

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.489
to be able to cover
all of this and say,

00:33:42.489 --> 00:33:44.780
Because there's a cost of
information for both teachers

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.150
and learners, it
predicts some trade-offs

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.260
in the kinds of inferences
you should make.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.650
So for instance, if a
knowledgeable informant

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:55.530
shows you a toy and says, here,
this toy has a single function.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.240
Then if you, the learner, think
that that teacher is trying

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.295
to generate a true sample
from the hypothesis

00:34:01.295 --> 00:34:02.690
based on what actually
is going to get

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.314
the right idea to
your head, you should

00:34:04.314 --> 00:34:07.850
assume that there is only
one function and not two,

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:08.976
or three, or four, or five.

00:34:08.976 --> 00:34:11.600
Because if there were more, they
should have shown them to you,

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.109
right?

00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:13.564
Because if they know
the true hypothesis,

00:34:13.564 --> 00:34:15.105
and they could just
demonstrate that,

00:34:15.105 --> 00:34:18.110
they can rule out
all of that for you.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.860
But if you just stumble upon
a single function of a toy,

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.860
or a not knowledgeable teacher
generates it accidentally,

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.739
or if the teacher, as
Liz Spelke pointed out,

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:33.800
is interrupted in the middle
of that demonstration,

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.560
then you shouldn't assume that
that evidence is exhaustive.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.620
It suspends that
inference, right?

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.010
Now, OK, well,
you showed me one,

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.935
but maybe there are
two, three, or four.

00:34:41.935 --> 00:34:43.310
So it's only in
a condition where

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.920
I think you are a fully
informed, freely acting

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.560
teacher that I should assume,
well, look, if you are helpful,

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.850
knowledgeable teacher,
then the information

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:53.969
you give me should not only
be true of the hypothesis,

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:56.300
it should help me
distinguish that hypothesis

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.190
from available alternatives.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.670
And what that means is,
there's a specific trade-off

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.860
between instruction
and exploration.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.540
Because if I'm
instructed that there's

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.462
one function of the toy, I don't
need to explore any further.

00:35:08.462 --> 00:35:10.670
But if I just happen to find
one function of the toy,

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.500
maybe I do.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.930
So let me show you what
we did to test this.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.890
We had a novel toy.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.620
It actually had four interesting
properties, a squeaker,

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.930
a light, a mirror, and music.

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:23.120
And we demonstrated
a single function

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:27.686
of the toy, the squeaker,
in three conditions.

00:35:27.686 --> 00:35:28.810
And we also had a baseline.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.320
In the pedagogical condition,
we said, watch this,

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.290
I'm going to show you--

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.510
sorry, the alignment's off--

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.580
but watch this, I'm
going to show you my toy.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.250
They pulled the toy and
then said, wow, see that.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:42.080
OK, the accidental
condition was,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.030
look at this neat
toy I found here,

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:47.446
accidentally pulled this tube
in the same way, wow see that.

00:35:47.446 --> 00:35:49.820
The baseline was, just look
at this neat toy I have here,

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.170
with no demonstration.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.970
And the interrupted
condition was identical

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:55.460
to the pedagogical condition,
except the teacher was

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.160
interrupted immediately
after pulling the tube,

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.122
and then she said,
wow, see that.

00:36:00.122 --> 00:36:00.830
So is that clear?

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:04.490
I'm sorry for the
slide misalignment.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:08.030
And the prediction is that
in the first condition,

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.520
children should constrain their
exploration relative to all

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.464
the other conditions.

00:36:11.464 --> 00:36:13.130
So let me show you
what that looks like.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.710
Or not.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:26.209
Which is too bad, because this
is a really super cute slide.

00:36:26.209 --> 00:36:27.650
But it's not going to work.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.870
In this condition,
what we found was this.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.180
We found a child in the
children's' museum with a toy

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.888
with all of these kind
of wow properties.

00:36:33.888 --> 00:36:35.049
We say, wow, see this.

00:36:35.049 --> 00:36:36.590
We show them the
property of the toy,

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:41.210
and the child spends 90 seconds
pulling only the squeaker.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.481
He then says, I'm very
smart for a five-year-old.

00:36:43.481 --> 00:36:45.980
And when she asks for all of
the other functions of the toy,

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.771
he doesn't know any of
the other functions,

00:36:47.771 --> 00:36:48.922
because he hasn't explored.

00:36:48.922 --> 00:36:51.380
And what we think is, he is
very smart for a five-year-old.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.180
Because it's a completely
rational inference that,

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.980
if there were more
functions of the toy,

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.650
then they should have
been demonstrated.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.960
And so what we find
overall is, in fact,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.330
that children do fewer
actions, and they discover

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:04.490
fewer functions of this toy.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.430
This isn't just true, it
turns out, we now know,

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.890
because we live in a
hyperpedagogical culture.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.010
Because Laura Shneidman
and Amanda Woodward

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.490
just replicated this
study with Yucatec Mayan

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:19.394
toddlers and found the same
kind of effect, constraints

00:37:19.394 --> 00:37:20.810
in the pedagogical
condition, even

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.268
though it's a
culture that's pretty

00:37:22.268 --> 00:37:26.460
limited in their pedagogy.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.810
So information is costly,
and pedagogical contexts

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:33.200
strengthen the inference that
the absence of evidence--

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.050
a teacher's failure to go on
and teach you more information--

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.308
is, in fact, evidence
of its absence.

00:37:39.308 --> 00:37:41.300
Is that clear?

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.030
And this is a very
sensible inductive bias,

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:47.355
but it predicts that instruction
will, for better or worse,

00:37:47.355 --> 00:37:48.230
constrain expression.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.220
Because that's what
it's supposed to do.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.850
It's supposed to constrain
the hypotheses you consider.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.399
And indeed, it works quite well.

00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:56.690
And that's good if you're
right about the world, right?

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.956
And it constrains it
to efficient learning.

00:37:58.956 --> 00:38:00.830
But it's bad if you're
wrong about the world.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.350
Because the unknown unknowns,
the things you don't know

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.020
are true that you
failed to teach,

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:09.440
are going to potentially
mislead a learner.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.820
How much is enough information?

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.320
Well, there are
lots of good reasons

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.794
why teachers ought to provide
very limited information.

00:38:14.794 --> 00:38:17.210
First of all, as I showed you
in the first set of studies,

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:19.090
evidence often supports
generalization.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:19.590
Right?

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.173
One dog toy squeaks,
probably they all

00:38:21.173 --> 00:38:25.356
squeak, barring how
generalizable that sample is.

00:38:25.356 --> 00:38:27.230
So I don't need to show
you every single toy.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:28.760
I don't need to
show a child, this

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.170
is a cup, and that's a
cup, and this a cup too,

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.970
and that's a cup,
and that's a cup.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.650
Once the child has
a cup, I can assume

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.870
that that child herself
will be able to make

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:37.282
the rational generalization.

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:39.740
Or sometimes I know you're not
going to be able to make it,

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.630
but the additional information
is just too costly.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.338
I'm working on teaching
you two plus two,

00:38:43.338 --> 00:38:46.280
I'm not going to teach you
linear algebra right now.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.667
It's a waste of our time.

00:38:47.667 --> 00:38:49.250
So that's another
reason why you might

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.270
provide limited information.

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:57.890
So what are the contexts in
which omitting information is

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:01.010
a reasonable thing to do,
and when is it misleading?

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.020
When is this a real problem?

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.680
And the answer turns out to
be, if I'm the informant,

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.080
and I know I'm
providing information

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.184
that is going to lead you
to the wrong hypothesis,

00:39:12.184 --> 00:39:13.850
then we consider that
a sin of omission.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:15.020
Right?

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.390
If I'm omitting information,
and I'm not doing that,

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.014
then maybe that's not a problem.

00:39:20.014 --> 00:39:21.680
So one of the questions
is, can children

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.210
distinguish these contexts?

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.810
Can they tell when the
teacher is providing

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:30.560
too little information, and it
is going to cost the learner

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.970
something in terms of what they
can gain, and when they're not.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:36.470
So to test this--

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.780
this is again,
Hyowon Gweon's work--

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.310
we introduced a toy.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.462
And it had one function,
this wind up mechanism.

00:39:42.462 --> 00:39:44.420
And the kids got to
explore, and they found out

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.000
the toy did one thing.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.330
In the other condition,
the toy looked the same.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.420
But in fact, the toy
had lots of functions,

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.460
and the children knew that.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.420
So the children always
knew the ground truth.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.290
The toy either had
one function or four.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.910
And then there was a
teacher who taught Elmo.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.520
The teacher always
did the same thing.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.970
The teacher always
taught just one function.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.830
And the first question
was, the teacher's always

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.370
doing the same thing with
an identical looking toy.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:11.229
Do the kids penalize
the teacher?

00:40:11.229 --> 00:40:13.020
Do they think he's a
bad teacher if he only

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.080
teaches one function when
there are really four,

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.960
compared to when he teaches one
function and there's only one.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.840
So the first thing we did was,
ask kids to rate that teacher.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.640
And indeed, they think
that this teacher

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.520
is a terrible teacher when
there's four functions

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.520
and he only teaches one.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.890
They think he's a good teacher
when he teaches one of one.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:33.380
But the really interesting
question was, what would

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.300
the children do to
compensate if they

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.800
knew they had a bad teacher?

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.960
So we ran exactly
the same set up

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.750
where the teacher shows Elmo
the toy in the one function case

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.000
and the four function case.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.209
And for reasons that
will become clear,

00:40:46.209 --> 00:40:47.750
we also ran a control
condition where

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.670
there were four
active functions,

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:53.030
and the teacher taught all four.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.890
In all cases, the
teacher then goes on

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:56.780
and runs that experiment
I just showed you.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.490
The teacher shows
just the squeaker toy

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.832
here of this single function.

00:41:00.832 --> 00:41:02.540
The question is, what
should the kids do?

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.456
So it's a complicated
set up, so I'll walk you

00:41:04.456 --> 00:41:06.630
through it a little bit.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.199
When you teach one
of one function,

00:41:09.199 --> 00:41:11.240
you should infer the toy
probably does one thing,

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.470
it's a good teacher.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.910
And so when they show
you one function of this,

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.570
you should constrain
your exploration,

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.987
say that was a
sensible inference.

00:41:17.987 --> 00:41:19.820
When they teach one of
four, you should say,

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.720
that's a bad teacher.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.920
The toy probably does
more than one thing,

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.170
the new toy probably does too.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.954
I'm going to explore
more broadly.

00:41:24.954 --> 00:41:27.120
But we don't know, in that
case, if they're doing it

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.607
because they just saw a
toy with one function,

00:41:29.607 --> 00:41:31.440
and so they think this
toy has one function.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.820
And they just saw a toy
with four functions,

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.570
so they think this toy
has four functions.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.930
So we can disambiguate
those with this condition.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.970
Now if they're just
generalizing from the toy,

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:40.230
this toy has four
functions, well,

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.970
then they should think this
toy has four functions.

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.100
But if they're generalizing
from the teacher,

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.234
this is a good teacher.

00:41:45.234 --> 00:41:47.400
So when the teacher now
tells you about the new toy,

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.220
that it has one
function, the kids

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.700
should constrain
their exploration.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:55.260
So does everyone understand
the logic of the design here?

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:59.430
And in fact, that's
exactly what we find.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.346
The children compensated
with additional exploration

00:42:02.346 --> 00:42:03.720
when they thought
the teacher had

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.227
provided insufficient
information to the learner.

00:42:07.227 --> 00:42:07.810
Is that clear?

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.520
OK.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.820
So information is costly
to teachers and learners.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.440
If teachers minimize
their own costs

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.330
and provide too
little information,

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:20.200
children think
they're poor teachers.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.200
They suspend the inference
that that information

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.160
is representative.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:27.900
They compensate with
additional exploration.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:32.580
I'm going to go ahead and
show you just a couple

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.600
more examples here.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.160
There's too little information.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.940
But because
information is costly,

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.820
you can also provide
too much information.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.890
I might be doing that right now.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:46.810
Too much information is costly.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.600
It's taking a toll on the
learner to absorb all of that.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.058
And you have to
know, well, are you

00:42:51.058 --> 00:42:53.420
providing me too much
information, or just the right

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:53.920
amount?

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.961
And at the risk of falling
into this trap myself,

00:42:55.961 --> 00:42:58.600
I am going to show you
quickly this study.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.620
Because how much
information is too much

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.620
information depends on a
hard question which is,

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.940
how much do you already know?

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.587
Right?

00:43:04.587 --> 00:43:05.920
You've all been here all summer.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.090
You know a lot of things.

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.160
I'm not a very good
estimate of what you know

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.240
or how much this
information is going,

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.040
so it's a little
hard for me titrate

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.750
what's the right amount of
information to give you.

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:18.340
And the question
is, can children

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.200
take these kinds of
theory of mind problems

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.110
into account in order to
estimate what information they

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:24.670
should be getting?

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:27.580
To test this, we give
kids a 20-button toy.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.850
If I push a single button and
it makes music, how many of you

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.839
think that all the other
buttons make music?

00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:35.380
Because you can
generalize from data,

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.970
and that is a really good
inductive inference there.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:38.261
They look the same, it's a toy.

00:43:38.261 --> 00:43:40.090
One makes music,
they probably all do.

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:41.880
But suppose I go on
now to show you--

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.400
so that's your prior
expectation, they all work.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.750
But that one doesn't work,
and that one doesn't work,

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.958
and that one doesn't work,
and that one doesn't work,

00:43:48.958 --> 00:43:51.562
and that one doesn't work,
and that-- oh, that one works.

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:53.770
And that one doesn't work,
and that one doesn't work,

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:55.450
and that one doesn't work,
and that one doesn't work.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.440
I'm doing this for a reason.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.648
I know this is really boring.

00:43:57.648 --> 00:44:00.790
It's partly to give you a
break, but it is also-- oh,

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.200
that one works.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.370
OK, so now what you have
learned about this toy

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:10.350
is that actually, only
three of these buttons work.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:13.019
And suppose I show you this
across a couple of toys.

00:44:13.019 --> 00:44:14.560
You've just changed
your expectation.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.854
Now if I show you
that one button works,

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:18.270
you don't think
all the rest work.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.830
You think probably two
others work, right?

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:25.410
So if I bring out a brand new
toy, and I push this button,

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.300
you'll probably be
relieved if I just go ahead

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.934
and push these three, right?

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:32.350
And I don't go
around and show you

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.660
all of the inert
buttons on the toy.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.400
Because information is costly.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.820
You have to sit there through
all those demonstrations.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:44.110
In this experiment, I'll
show you Gweon's work.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:46.210
We gave kids a common
ground condition

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:49.420
where everybody shared prior
knowledge, this abstract theory

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.810
you can use to constrain your
interpretation of this data.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:56.519
In this condition, there
were two toy makers,

00:44:56.519 --> 00:44:58.810
who are the informants, and
there's two naive learners,

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.520
Ernie and Bert.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.410
And in the common
ground condition,

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:04.450
Ernie, and Bert,
and the toy makers

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:07.330
are all there while the
child explores and finds out

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.870
that only three buttons
work on these toys.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:10.750
OK.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:14.980
And then one teacher
shows of a brand new toy

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.550
just like this every single
button, the inert ones

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:18.620
and the non-inert ones.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:22.010
And the other teacher shows
just the three working buttons.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.566
Right?

00:45:22.566 --> 00:45:24.190
And then we say, hey,
kids, guess what?

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:25.810
We have a whole closet
full of more of those toys.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.601
One of these teachers
can show them to you.

00:45:27.601 --> 00:45:29.440
Which one do you want?

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.480
Which one do you want, OK?

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:35.080
The other condition is almost
the same, but guess what?

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:39.100
The child explores
on their own, right?

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.910
And so there's no common ground
about what these toys do.

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.920
And then the teachers
do the same thing.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.680
One teacher shows
exhaustive information,

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.970
and the other teacher pushes
only the three working buttons.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:55.960
So in this case, that efficient
information, that less costly

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.330
simple demonstration
could mislead the learners

00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:59.890
about what the
true hypothesis is.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.940
They have a prior that all
these buttons ought to work.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:05.680
Which toy maker would
you rather learn

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.800
from depends on whether
the learners share

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.120
that prior background
information or not.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.690
And that was true not only
when the children were

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.950
judging the informants, but when
they were teaching themselves.

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:23.650
So again, these are
four and five-year-olds.

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:27.320
The children had
a condition where

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.350
Elmo got to see that only three
buttons worked on the toy,

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.920
and the condition
where Elmo didn't

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.220
get to see how many of those
buttons worked on the toy.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:40.210
And then the children got
to teach Elmo the toy.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.840
And the children were much more
likely to press more buttons

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.269
and provide exhaustive evidence
in the no common ground

00:46:46.269 --> 00:46:48.060
condition than the
common ground condition.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.780
So children themselves
are adjusting

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.339
the cost of the
information they provide

00:46:52.339 --> 00:46:54.130
based on their prior
expectation about what

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.710
they think the learner is
going to learn from the data.

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:59.680
What did we do is, lastly,
tell you a little bit about how

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:05.500
the costs of information
are informative

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.184
not just in figuring out
what data to learn from

00:47:08.184 --> 00:47:09.975
and how you should
communicate information,

00:47:09.975 --> 00:47:12.310
but in actually figuring
out what people are doing,

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:14.650
and actually grounding out
ordinary, everyday theory

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.067
of mind.

00:47:16.067 --> 00:47:18.400
I'm going to start with an
example you're familiar with.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.850
I know you've seen this before.

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:23.710
This is an experiment by Gergely
and Csibra, a rational action.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:27.010
This little ball jumps over the
wall to get to the momma ball--

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:28.390
you've all seen this?

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:30.190
I think Josh was
presenting it maybe?

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.690
OK.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.314
And when you took
the wall away, babies

00:47:32.314 --> 00:47:34.150
expect that ball to
take an efficient route.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:37.210
So we think that rational agents
should take the most efficient

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:43.420
route to the goal, they should
maximize their overall utility.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.720
But there's a lot of reasons
why that ball might have jumped

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.690
over the wall, and they
all have to do with costs

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:50.590
of rewards of action.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:53.290
One might be, it was really
hard to get over the wall,

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.954
but really rewarding to do so.

00:47:55.954 --> 00:47:57.370
Another reason,
though, is that it

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.828
was really easy to get over
the wall, so she might as well,

00:47:59.828 --> 00:48:01.960
but she didn't care that
much about the reward.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.300
These could have the
same net utility,

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.806
but psychologically, you really
care about the difference.

00:48:06.806 --> 00:48:08.680
If we're talking about
the internal structure

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.600
of an agent's
motivations, you want

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.310
to decompose this
simple argument

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:15.460
about rational,
goal-directed action

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.670
into what the particular
costs and rewards are.

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:21.310
So Julian Jara-Ettinger
in our lab

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.200
has developed this
account he calls

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.650
the naive utility calculus,
which is our way of reasoning

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:28.030
about other peoples' actions.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:31.500
Which is, we assume other agents
are acting to maximize utility,

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.180
but we care about the
internal structure also.

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.760
There are agent invariant
rewards and costs.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.920
Two cookies is always
more than one cookie.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.175
Higher hills are always higher
than lower hills for all of us.

00:48:42.175 --> 00:48:44.505
But some of us are more
motivated to get cookies

00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:45.880
than others of
us, and some of us

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.910
find hills more costly
than others of us.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:50.980
So in addition to
these agents invariant

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.900
aspects of costs
and rewards, there's

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.420
also these internal
subjective things that

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:56.680
are harder to judge, right?

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.040
How competent you are,
what your values are,

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.600
and your preferences.

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.220
And so understanding how
all of these worked together

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.170
lets you take a very,
very simple analysis

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.420
and make surprisingly
powerful inferences about what

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.791
other agents are doing.

00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:14.290
I'm going to show
you a few examples

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:17.380
and actually connect
it back to how children

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.150
are scientists in this regard.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.340
So here is an
example experiment.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.810
Here is Grover, and there
is a cracker and a cookie

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:27.300
down on this low shelf.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:31.030
And Grover goes ahead,
and he chooses the cookie.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.580
And now there's a cracker
and a cookie and this shelf,

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.850
and Grover goes ahead
and chooses the cracker.

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:40.360
And the question is, what
does Grover like better?

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.526
Well, if your read
out of preferences,

00:49:42.526 --> 00:49:43.650
it's your actions you take.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:44.990
It's your goal-directed action.

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:46.130
You should be at chance--

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:48.350
you chose a cracker
once and a cookie once.

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:50.090
But if even young
children understand,

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.120
no, it's not that simple, right?

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.180
You're not just acting
to maximize reward,

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.710
you're acting to
maximize utility.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:58.480
You have to take the
costs into account.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.670
Then clearly his
preference is what

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:03.520
he chose when the costs
were matched, right?

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.200
Not when the costs
were mismatched.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.075
And the children should
say, no, no, no, it's

00:50:07.075 --> 00:50:08.890
what he chose on the low box.

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:10.960
Which treat does he like best?

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.530
Is that clear?

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:16.540
And indeed, that is
what children do.

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.050
You can also introduce
a couple of characters.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.390
Cookie Monster, who has a
strong preference for cookies,

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:25.170
and Grover, who is indifferent,
who likes them both.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.850
So for Cookie Monster, the
reward value of cookies

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:28.890
is much higher.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.980
For Grover, they're equivalent.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.440
And now you can
set up a situation

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.340
where there's crackers in a low
box and cookies at a high box.

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.680
And you say, guys, go on,
you can make a choice.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.510
And Grover chooses
the cracker and Cookie

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:43.140
Monster chooses the cracker.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:47.120
And you say to the kids,
which puppet can't climb?

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.000
Now, no puppet has climbed.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.380
No puppet has failed to climb.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.660
No puppet has even
thought about climbing.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:54.597
But the kids can know
the answer, right?

00:50:54.597 --> 00:50:56.180
Because if Cookie
Monster could climb,

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.540
and he had a high reward,
then who would do it.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.250
So you don't really
know about Grover,

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:03.220
but you can make an inference
that the costs were not

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.736
equivalent.

00:51:05.736 --> 00:51:08.110
And by the way, in case you're
worried that kids are just

00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:09.555
saying, well,
Cookie Monster, I've

00:51:09.555 --> 00:51:10.930
been listening to
Michelle Obama.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:13.210
You know, obesity and
fitness-- cookies aren't good,

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:14.160
I can't climb.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.170
We ran the same experiment
with Grover and clover,

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:19.690
and Grover really likes
clovers, and Cookie Monster

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.280
likes them both.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.830
And you now flip the
inference around.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:31.300
OK, so they can consider how
the costs affect the inferences

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.459
they make.

00:51:33.459 --> 00:51:35.500
All right, so let's bring
this all back together.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.640
I've thrown a lot
of information--

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.500
probably too much
information-- at you

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.300
about how kids can
reason from sparse data,

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.710
about how they use
their theories to make

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:43.918
these inferences, about how
they use this in teaching

00:51:43.918 --> 00:51:46.520
and learning in social context.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.760
But if kids are sensitive
to these utilities

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.100
and the trade-offs,
then the kinds of things

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.140
that I showed you them doing
with beads and with machines,

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.930
they should also be able
to do in social context.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:59.410
We believe psychology to
be something of a science,

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:01.049
as well as all of
these other sciences,

00:52:01.049 --> 00:52:02.590
and they should be
able to apply some

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.840
of the same principles--
holding some things constant,

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.060
manipulating others-- in
order to gain information.

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.330
So we basically ask that
question of the children here.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:13.270
Can they distinguish agents'
different competencies

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:17.280
and rewards by manipulating
the contexts that they see

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.100
and gaining information?

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.300
So here, we don't know if
Cookie Monster can climb.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.910
So let's put one
treat on each box.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:26.890
Where should we put
the treats to find out

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:28.720
if Cookie Monster can climb?

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.890
Now, only one of these
interventions is informative.

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.306
If the cookie is
down low, and you

00:52:32.306 --> 00:52:34.490
know Cookie Monster
prefers cookies,

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.420
then you're not going
to get any information.

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.260
But if the cookie
is up high, then you

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:40.360
are going to get
information, right?

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.460
And in fact, the kids are
overwhelmingly good at this.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.840
In case you think, well,
treats should be put up high--

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.798
and this is also true,
by the way, for clovers,

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:49.880
but it's all right.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.820
In case that you think they
just have a heuristic like,

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:52.810
oh, well, let's
put treats up high,

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:54.518
you can ask the question
a different way.

00:52:54.518 --> 00:52:57.430
You can say, both of our
friends can climb the short box.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:00.210
But only one of our friends
can climb the tall box,

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.870
and we don't know which one.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:04.492
So let's put the cookie up
here and the cracker down here.

00:53:04.492 --> 00:53:06.700
And if we want to figure
out which one of our friends

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.330
can climb, which friend
should we send in?

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:12.512
Well, Grover has no
particular incentive to climb.

00:53:12.512 --> 00:53:13.720
He could just do the cracker.

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.210
But Cookie Monster, he
has an incentive to climb.

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:18.820
You should probably
send in Cookie Monster.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.370
And again, these are
the kinds of inferences

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.723
that young children can make.

00:53:23.723 --> 00:53:24.569
Is that clear?

00:53:24.569 --> 00:53:25.840
All right.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:31.000
So, end of a long winded talk.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.890
I want to return it to this.

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:35.560
So I framed it in terms of
the way I've been increasingly

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.085
thinking, and the projects
that we're increasingly

00:53:38.085 --> 00:53:39.460
moving towards,
which is thinking

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:43.080
not just about the pure pursuit
of knowledge and information,

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.634
but how do you pursue
information in a complex world

00:53:45.634 --> 00:53:47.800
where it's not just your
own individual exploration.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.060
You get it in a
social context, you

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.351
get in interaction with others.

00:53:50.351 --> 00:53:55.120
The information is costly both
to deliver and to process.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.850
But that, those costs
themselves, are information,

00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:01.030
and you can use them to
make sense of the world.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:04.750
And so I want to sort of bring
these together and come back

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:08.620
to a problem that I posed a
bit earlier, which is, I think,

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:12.130
I hope I've made the case
that what kids are doing

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:15.700
is not reasoning about
huge sets of data.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:19.300
What kids are doing is, they're
taking some very abstract

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.480
structure knowledge and using
it to constrain their inferences

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.550
about tiny amounts of data.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:27.100
Cookie Monster this, a
couple of trials of evidence.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.560
And then they make
good inductive guesses,

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:34.420
which are sometimes
wrong, but they are good.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.380
And I said, these
abstract representations,

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.100
not all of them
are innate, right?

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.670
You've seen beautiful
evidence of the many that are,

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:44.020
but a lot of them aren't.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.130
A lot of them aren't.

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:47.588
A lot of the things that govern
your common sense knowledge

00:54:47.588 --> 00:54:49.210
every day, how do you get those?

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:52.610
And how do you get those
from tiny amounts of data?

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:57.320
This is a problem that bugged
me deeply for a very long time,

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:03.670
and I think there's been a real
leap and a very exciting ascent

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:07.210
of how it is actually possible
to use tiny amounts of data

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.154
to make really rich
abstract inferences, which

00:55:09.154 --> 00:55:10.570
then constrain
your interpretation

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:11.290
of subsequent data.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:13.000
I think that is a really
important problem.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.230
And with that, I'm
going to turn it over

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:16.490
to Josh and Tomer, who
maybe can tell you how

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:17.990
that is going to actually work.

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.830
So thanks to everyone
here at Woods Hole.
