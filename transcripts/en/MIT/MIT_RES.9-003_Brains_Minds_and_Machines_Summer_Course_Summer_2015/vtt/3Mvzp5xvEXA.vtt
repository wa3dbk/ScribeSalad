00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.760
NANCY KANWISHER: So
I'm going to talk today

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.572
about a couple of things.

00:00:25.572 --> 00:00:27.030
I had a hell of a
time constructing

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.890
a nice clean narrative arc to
everything I wanted to say.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.890
And so I finally just
decided, the hell with it.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.150
I'm just going to be honest.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.280
There's several
different pieces.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.613
They don't make a narrative arc.

00:00:35.613 --> 00:00:36.750
That's life.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.520
I want to address what I see
as a sort of macroscopic view

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.110
of the organization
of the human brain

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.704
is giving us a kind
of picture of what

00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:48.120
I'm going to call
the architecture

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.361
of human intelligence.

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:51.610
We're trying to understand
intelligence in this class.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.630
And so I think the overall
organization of the human

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.360
brain-- in which we've made a
lot of progress in the last 20

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.080
years--

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.260
gives us a kind of
macro picture of what

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.060
the pieces of the system are.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.180
So I'll talk about that.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.200
And then I'll also--
if I talk fast enough--

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.860
do a kind of whirlwind
introduction through the basic

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.550
methods of human cognitive
neuroscience using face

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.490
recognition as an example
to illustrate what each

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.270
of the methods
can and cannot do.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.781
So that's the agenda.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.030
It's going to be pretty basic.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.550
So if you've heard
me speak before,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.010
you've probably
heard a lot of this.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.600
Anyway, the key
question we're trying

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.970
to address in this course
is, how does the brain

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.250
produce intelligent behavior?

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.530
And how may we be
able to replicate that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.390
intelligence in machines?

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.090
So there's, of course,
a million different ways

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.090
to go at that question.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.660
And you can go at it from a
kind of computational angle,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.140
a coding perspective, from a
fine-grained neural circuit

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.740
perspective.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.380
But I'm going to do something
that's kind of in between.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.500
because those are the things we
can approach in human brains.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.180
And it's really
human intelligence

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.970
we want to understand.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.010
It's a sum of human
intelligences.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.020
A lot of it are things
that we share with animals,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.280
but some of it is not.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.120
And so I think it's important
to be able to approach this

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.310
not just from the perspectives
of animal research, magnificent

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.230
as those methods are,
but to also see what we

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.040
can learn about human brains.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.540
OK.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.870
So I'll talk a bit about the
overall functional architecture

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.810
of the human brain.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.476
What are the basic
pieces of the system?

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:27.960
And then I'll get into
some different methods

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.500
and what they tell us
about face perception.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.000
OK.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.590
So at the most general level,
we can ask whether human

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.230
intelligence-- as people have
been asking for centuries,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.340
actually--

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.590
whether human intelligence
is the product

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.980
of a bunch of very special
purpose components,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.640
each optimized to solve
a specific problem,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.010
kind of like this
device here, where

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.270
you have a saw for cutting wood,
scissors for cutting paper.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.010
Saws don't work
that well on paper,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.430
and scissors don't
work that well on wood.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.450
Or whether human intelligence
is a product of some more

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.080
generic, all-purpose
computational power

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.650
that makes us generically
smart without optimizing us

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.340
for any particular task.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.030
And just to
foreshadow the answer,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.240
as in all questions in
psychology, the answer is both.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.550
But we'll do that
in some detail.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.370
Before we get into
that, who cares?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.800
And I'd say, first of all,
this kind of macro level

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.380
question about functional
components of the human mind

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.155
and brain matters for
a bunch of reasons.

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.780
First of all, I just think it's
one of the most basic questions

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.890
we can ask about ourselves--
about who we are--

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.810
is to ask what the basic
pieces are of our minds.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.340
Second, more pragmatically,
this kind of divide and conquer

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.710
research strategy has
been effective in lots

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.270
of different fields
that are trying

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.950
to understand a complex system.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.537
What do you do with this
incredibly complex system,

00:03:55.537 --> 00:03:57.870
where you just can't even
figure out how to get started?

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.411
Well, one sensible
way to get started

00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:02.004
is first figure out what
its pieces are and then

00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:04.170
maybe try to figure out how
each of the pieces work.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.829
And then maybe some day,
maybe not in my lifetime,

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.370
figure out how they
all work together

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.300
in some coordinated fashion.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.750
And third, somewhat more
subtly, of course, we

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.640
want to know not just
what the pieces are,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.940
but what the computations
that are performed in each

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.250
of those pieces and what the
representations extracted

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.200
in each piece are.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.710
And I think even just a
functional characterization

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.399
of the scope of a
particular brain region

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:32.940
already gives us
some important clues

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.590
about the kinds of
computations that go on there.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.920
So if we find that there's
a part of the brain that's

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.200
primarily involved
in face recognition,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.660
not in reading visually
presented words,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.560
recognizing scenes, or
recognizing objects,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.700
that already gives us
some clues about the kinds

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.570
of computations that would
be appropriate for that scope

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.336
of task.

00:04:52.336 --> 00:04:54.210
So if you tried to write
the code to do that,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.760
you'd be writing very
different code if it only

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.430
had to do face recognition
versus if it also

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.110
had to be able to
recognize words and scenes

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.040
and objects presented visually.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.540
OK.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.750
So that's my list
of the main reasons.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.330
And of course, there are
heaps of different ways

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.760
to investigate this
question, and I'll

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.600
mention some of those
in the second half.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.890
But I want to start
with Spearman,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.740
who published a paper
in 1904 in the American

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.570
Journal of Psychology.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.510
This article was sandwiched
between a discussion

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.330
of the soul and an
article on the psychology

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.040
of the English sparrow.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.330
And in this article, Spearman
did the following low tech

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.760
but fascinating thing.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.060
He tested a whole bunch of
kids in two different schools

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.610
on a wide variety
of different tasks.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.550
And this included scholastic
achievement type things.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.560
He got exam grades
from each student

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.420
in a bunch of different classes.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.340
And he measured a whole
bunch of other kinds

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.740
of psychological
abilities, including

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.440
some very psychophysical
perceptual discrimination

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.310
abilities.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.740
How well could
people discriminate

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.540
the loudness of two
different tones,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.970
the brightness of two
different flashes of light,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.190
the weight of two
different pieces of stuff?

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.650
And what he found-- well,
before I tell you what he found,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.210
what would you expect with this?

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.300
Should we expect a correlation
between your ability

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.580
to discriminate two
different loudnesses

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.520
and, say, your math score in
grade five on a math exam?

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.480
Spearman's main result is
that most pairs of tasks

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.890
were correlated with each other.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.480
That is, if you
were good at one,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.710
you're good at the others--

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.690
even tasks that
seemingly had very little

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.220
to do with each other.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.290
And this is the basis
of the whole idea

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.690
of g, which is the
general factor, which

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.400
is what led to the whole
idea of IQ and IQ testing.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.297
And in America, we're very
uptight about the idea of IQ.

00:06:51.297 --> 00:06:53.380
Brits don't seem to have
a problem with this idea.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.620
They're very enthusiastic about
the idea and always have been.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.640
But aside from all the social
uses and misuses of IQ tests,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.610
the point is there's actually a
deep discovery about psychology

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.250
that Spearman made from the
fact that all of these tasks

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.810
were correlated with each other.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.750
He didn't know what it was, kind
of like Gregor Mendel inferring

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.750
genes without knowing anything
about molecular biology.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.570
Spearman just inferred
there's something general

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.700
about the human
intellect such that there

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.060
are these strong
correlations across tasks.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.060
OK, so that's g.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.980
But less well known
about Spearman's work

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.240
is he also talked about
the specific factor, s.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.960
And s was the fact that
although the broad result

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.985
of his experiments was that most
pairs of tasks were correlated,

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:43.360
there were some tasks that
weren't so strongly correlated

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.510
with others, and that you could
factor those out and discover

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.960
some mental abilities that
weren't just broadly shared

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.060
across subjects.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.550
And I think this kind of
foreshadows everything

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.860
that we see with functional MRI.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.135
There's a lot of specific
s's, and there's also some g.

00:08:00.135 --> 00:08:02.440
And you can see those in
different brain regions,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.540
as I will detail next.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.920
Another method was invented
by Franz Joseph Gall.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.560
And he argued that there are
distinct mental faculties that

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.990
live in different parts of
the brain, which I think

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.120
is more or less
right, as I'll argue.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.990
But Gall lived in the 1700s, and
he didn't have an MRI machine.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.290
So he did the best he
could, which wasn't so hot.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.450
He invented the infamous
method of phrenology.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.250
He felt the bumps on
the skull and tried

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.950
to relate those to
specific abilities

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.810
of different individuals,
and from this,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.950
inferred 27 mental faculties.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.549
My favorites are and
amativeness, filial piety,

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.919
and veneration.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.330
And so there's a kernel
of the right idea,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.680
but kind of the wrong method.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.750
And another method that
was a very early one

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.270
was the method of
studying the loss

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.030
of specific mental abilities
after brain damage.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.600
And so Flourens,
who's often credited

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.890
as being the first
experimental neuroscientist,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:11.196
went around making lesions
in pigeons and rabbits

00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:12.820
and then tested them
on various things.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.100
And he didn't really
find much difference

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.140
in what parts of the
brain he took out

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.310
for their mental abilities.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.590
Maybe that's because he wasn't
such a hot experimental--

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.150
he didn't have great
experimental methods.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.910
In any case, he argued that
all sensory and volitional

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.880
faculties exist in the
cerebral hemispheres

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.060
and must be regarded as
occupying concurrently

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.059
the same seat in
those structures.

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:38.350
In other words, everything
is on top of everything else

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.490
in the brain.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:44.770
So that was a sort of
dominant view for a while.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.260
People thought Gall
was kind of a crackpot,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.270
even though he wrote
very popular books

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.750
and went around Europe
giving popular lectures

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.640
that huge numbers
of people attended.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.830
The respectable
intellectual society

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.420
didn't take him seriously.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.730
In fact, the whole idea of
localization of function

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.090
wasn't taken seriously
until Paul Broca,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.750
a member of the French
Academy, stood up

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:14.399
in front of the Society of
Anthropology in Paris in 1861

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:16.190
and announced that the
left frontal lobe is

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.870
the seat of speech.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.090
And this was based
on his patient

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.210
Tan, whose brain is shown here.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.830
Tan was named Tan
because that was

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.240
all he could say after damage to
his left inferior frontal lobe.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.400
And Broca pointed
out that Tan had

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.690
lots of other mental
faculties preserved,

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.210
and it was simply speech
that was disrupted.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.020
And from this was one of
the first respectable people

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.860
to argue for
localization of function.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.360
OK.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.240
So this research
program goes on.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.810
And by the end of
the 20th century,

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.550
there's pretty much agreement
that basic sensory and motor

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.199
functions do
exhibit localization

00:10:55.199 --> 00:10:56.240
of function in the brain.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.210
There are different regions
for basic visual processing,

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.830
auditory processing,
and so forth.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.780
And that was no
longer controversial.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.810
But the whole question
of whether higher level

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.430
mental functions were localized
and distinct parts of the brain

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.450
was controversial then and
remains controversial now.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.700
And so the method I'll
focus on is functional MRI,

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.550
because I think it's played
a huge role in addressing

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.430
this question at this
macroscopic level.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.300
And I think you guys know
what an MRI machine is.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.326
In case anybody has been
on Mars for a while,

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:34.700
the important part
is its measure

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.450
is a very indirect measure
of neural activity by way

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.160
of a long causal chain.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.910
Neurons fire, you incur
metabolic cost, and blood flow

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.080
changes to that region.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.190
Blood flow increase more than
compensates for oxygen use,

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.210
producing a local
decrease rather than

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.270
the expected increase
in deoxyhemoglobin

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.059
relative to oxyhemoglobin.

00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:02.600
Those two are
magnetically different.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.060
That's what the MRI
machine detects.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.860
It's very indirect,
so it's remarkable it

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.990
works as well as it does.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.870
And it's currently the
best noninvasive method

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:18.380
we have in humans in terms
of spatial resolution, not

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.600
temporal resolution.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.600
OK.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:26.299
So many of you are already
diving into the details of some

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:27.340
of the data we collected.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.839
But in case you're
on other projects

00:12:28.839 --> 00:12:31.150
and are coming
from other fields,

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:35.000
the basic format of the data in
a typical functional MRI study

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.630
is you have tens of thousands
of three dimensional pixels

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.840
or voxels that you scan.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.520
And typically, you
sample the whole set

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.950
once every two seconds or so.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.140
You can push it and do
it every second or less

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.390
under special circumstances.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.000
You can have more voxels by
sampling at higher resolution,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.930
but that's a ballpark of the
format of the kind of movie

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.460
you can get of brain activity.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:02.960
OK.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.710
So a few things about the
method and its limitations,

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.470
because they're really important
in terms of what you can learn

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.690
from functional MRI
and what you can't.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.630
So first of all,
this is a timeline.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.760
My x-axis, even though it's
invisible, is time in seconds.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.280
And so if you imagine looking at
V1 and presenting a brief, say,

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.420
tenth of a second high contrast
flash of a checkerboard, what

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.290
we know from neurophysiology
is that neurons fire

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.230
within 100 milliseconds
of a visual onset.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.650
The information gets right
up there really fast.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.920
The BOLD, which stands for
Blood Oxygenation Level

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.530
Dependent, or
functional MRI response,

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.930
is way lagged behind this.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.890
So the neurons are firing
way over here in this graph,

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.380
essentially at time zero--

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.780
a tenth of a second.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.180
But the MRI response is
six seconds later, OK?

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.000
So it's really slow.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.670
And that has a bunch of
implications about what we can

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.680
and cannot learn from it.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.450
So first of all,
because it's so slow,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:14.060
we can't resolve the steps in
a computation for fast systems

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.660
like vision and hearing and
language understanding--

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.600
systems for which we have
dedicated machinery that's

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.230
highly efficient where you can
recognize the gist of a scene

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.730
within a quarter
of a second of one

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.290
it flashes on a screen
in front of you.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.900
And similarly, you understand
the meaning of a sentence

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.530
so rapidly that
you've already parsed

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.880
much of the sentence well
before the sentence is over.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.580
So these are extremely efficient
rapid mental processes.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.270
That means the component steps
in those mental processes

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:49.100
happen over a few
tens of milliseconds.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.430
And we're way off in temporal
resolution with functional MRI.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.920
All of those things are squashed
together on top of each other.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.570
That's a drag.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.290
That's just life.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.677
We can't see those
individual components steps

00:14:59.677 --> 00:15:00.510
with functional MRI.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.350
The second thing is that
the spatial resolution

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.770
is the best that we have in
humans noninvasively right now,

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.870
but it's absolutely
awful compared

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.950
to what you can do in animals.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.940
So I missed Jim
DiCarlo's talk yesterday,

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.130
but those methods
are spectacular.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.930
You can record from
individual neurons,

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.990
record their precise
activity with beautiful time

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.920
information.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.110
In contrast, functional
MRI is like the dark ages.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.420
We have, typically,
hundreds of thousands

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.880
of neurons in each voxel.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.850
So the real miracle
of functional MRI

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.060
is that we ever see anything at
all rather than just garbage,

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.120
because you're summing over
so many neurons at once.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.057
And it's just a lucky
fact of the organization

00:15:46.057 --> 00:15:47.890
of the human brain that
you have clusterings

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:51.400
of neurons with similar
responsal activities

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.040
and similar functions
at such a macro grain

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.950
that you can see some
stuff with functional MRI,

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.420
although you miss a lot as well.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.690
The third important limit of
functional MRI that comes out

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.800
of just a consideration of
what the method measures

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.910
is that you can only really see
differences between conditions

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.320
with functional MRI.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.410
The magnitude of the MRI
response in a voxel at a time

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.180
point is meaningless.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.190
It might be 563, and
that's all it means.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:23.852
Nothing, right?

00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:24.560
It means nothing.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.640
It's just the intensity
of the MRI signal.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.590
The only way to make
it mean something

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.510
is to compare it
to something else--

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.510
usually two different tasks
or two different stimuli.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.580
And so you can go far
with that, but it's

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.770
important to realize you
can't train translate it

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.950
into any kind of absolute
measure of neural activity.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.190
It's only a relative
measure of strength

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.520
of neural activity between two
or more different conditions.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.020
OK.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.070
And the final deep
limitation of functional MRI

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.880
is that we use this convenient
phrase "neural activity."

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.054
It's very convenient,
because it's extremely vague.

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.470
And fittingly so,
because we don't

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.300
know exactly what kind
of neural activity

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.099
is driving the BOLD response.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.500
It could be spikes
or action potentials.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.220
It could be synaptic activity
that doesn't lead to spikes.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.260
It could be tonic inhibition.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.270
It could be all kinds
of different things.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.640
Anything that's
metabolically expensive

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.540
is likely to increase
the blood flow response.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.329
In practice, when people
have looked at it,

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:28.230
it's very nicely correlated
with firing rate--

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.660
with some bumps and caveats, so
you can never be totally sure.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.667
But it's a pretty good
proxy for firing rate.

00:17:35.667 --> 00:17:37.750
You just need to remember
in the back of your mind

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.550
that it could be
other stuff too.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.630
The final, very important
caveat is that functional MRI--

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.720
like most other methods
where you're just

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.240
recording neural activity in
a variety of different ways--

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.860
you're just watching.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.520
You're not intervening.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.020
And that means you're not
measuring the causal role

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.260
of the things you measure.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.460
And that's very
important, because it

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.410
could be that everything
you measure is just

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.200
completely epiphenomenal and
has absolutely nothing to do

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.194
with behavior.

00:18:04.194 --> 00:18:05.860
So in practice, that's
unlikely that you

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.710
have all this systematic
stuff for no reason,

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:13.510
but you need to keep in mind
that functional MRI affords

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.150
no window at all into the causal
role of different regions.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.200
For that, you need to complement
it with other methods.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.450
So despite all
these limitations,

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.870
I think functional MRI has had
a huge impact on the field.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.281
And admittedly,
I'm biased, but I

00:18:27.281 --> 00:18:28.780
think it's one of
these things where

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.500
as it happens, we get so
used to a result the minute

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.370
it gets published.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.740
It was like, oh, yeah, right.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.446
One of these, one
of those, so what?

00:18:37.446 --> 00:18:39.190
But I think it's
important to step back,

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.460
so I made a bunch of
pictures to show you

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.720
why I think this is important.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.220
OK.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.710
Here is Penfield's functional
map of the human brain,

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.180
published in 1957, a
year before I was born.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.330
And he has six--

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.944
count them, six-- functional
regions labeled in there.

00:18:54.944 --> 00:18:56.110
You probably can't see them.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:00.430
But it's the basic sensory and
motor regions, visual cortex,

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:05.920
auditory cortex, motor cortex,
speech appear in Broca's area,

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.270
and then my favorite is this
word that says interpretive.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.870
Nice.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:11.590
OK.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.310
Anyway, this was based
on electrical recording

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:18.230
and stimulation in
patients with epilepsy who

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.950
were undergoing brain surgery.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.550
Actually a very powerful method,
but that's where it got him.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.870
He published this near
the end of his career.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.660
And that's nice, but
it's pretty rudimentary.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.170
OK, now, cut to
1990, immediately

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.810
before the advent
of functional MRI.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.510
And this is really
crude-- the black outlines

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.410
are the basic sensory
and motor regions.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.940
And I've added a couple
of big colored blobs

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.490
for regions that had been
identified by studying patients

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.940
with brain damage.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.240
So even from Broca
and Wernicke, it

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.605
was known that approximately
these regions were involved

00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:53.230
in language, because
people with damage

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.400
there lost their
language abilities.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.890
You get whacked in
your parietal lobe,

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.410
you have weird
attentional problems,

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:02.737
like neglecting the left half
of space and stuff like that.

00:20:02.737 --> 00:20:04.570
If you have damage
somewhere to the back end

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.986
of the right
hemisphere, you might

00:20:05.986 --> 00:20:07.350
lose face recognition ability.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.740
These things were known by
around 1990, not much else.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.890
That's basically the functional
map of the brain in 1990.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.350
That probably seems like
ancient history to a lot of you,

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.311
but not to me.

00:20:18.311 --> 00:20:18.810
OK.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.820
Here we are today.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.920
There's a lot of stuff
we've learned, right?

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:29.070
There a lot of particular
parts of the human brain

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.670
whose function has been
characterized quite precisely.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.300
Not in the sense that we know
the precise circuits in there

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.610
or that we can very
precisely characterize

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.930
the representations
or computations,

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.920
but to the sense that we know
that a region may be very

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.230
selectively involved,
for example,

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.140
in thinking about what
other people are thinking.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.062
A totally remarkable
result that Rebecca Saxe

00:20:52.062 --> 00:20:54.270
who discovered it will tell
you about when she's here

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.470
next week.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:59.920
So that was completely
unknown even 15 years ago,

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.010
let alone back in 1990.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.810
And likewise, most of
these other regions

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.630
were either known in
the blurriest sense

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.140
or not with this precision.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.860
So I think even though
this is very limited,

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.750
and it's kind of
step zero in trying

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.500
to understand the human brain,
I think it's important progress.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.500
And I think to push
a little farther,

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.630
I'd like to see this
as an admittedly very

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.690
blurry but still a picture
of the architecture

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.740
of human intelligence.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.390
What are the basic pieces?

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.150
What is it we have in here
to work with when we think?

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.500
We have these basic pieces--

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.530
a bunch more that haven't been
discovered yet, and a lot more

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.277
that we need to know
about each of these

00:21:36.277 --> 00:21:37.860
and how they interact
and all of that,

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.760
but a reasonable beginning.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.020
So that's my story here for fun.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.290
This is me with a bunch of
functional regions identified

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.010
in my brain.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.230
And so the argument
I'm making here

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.270
is that the human mind
and brain contains

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.880
a set of highly
specialized components,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.640
each solving a different
specific problem,

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.660
and that each of these regions
is present in essentially

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.800
every normal person.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.860
It's just part of the basic
architecture of the human mind

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.880
and brain.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.550
Now, this view is pretty simple.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.540
But nonetheless,
it's often confused

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.190
with a whole bunch
of other things

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.240
that people think
are the same thing

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.025
and that aren't, so it's
starting to drive me insane.

00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:23.400
So I'm going to
take five minutes

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.490
and go through the things
this does not mean.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.310
And I hope this doesn't
insult your intelligence,

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.210
but it's amazing how in the
current literature in the field

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.650
people conflate these things.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.500
So I'm talking about
functional specificity, which

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.260
is the question of whether this
particular region right here

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.570
is engaged in pretty
selectively in just

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.360
that particular
mental process and not

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.830
lots of other mental process.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.050
That's what I mean by
functional specificity.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.830
That's a different idea
than anatomical specificity.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.770
Anatomical specificity
would say it is only

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.500
this region that's involved,
and nothing else is involved.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.210
That's a different question.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.840
How specific is this region
versus are there other regions

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.340
that do something similar?

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.974
Also an interesting question,
but a different one.

00:23:08.974 --> 00:23:10.390
I'm going to go
through this fast.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.723
So if any of it doesn't make
sense, just raise your hand

00:23:12.723 --> 00:23:15.810
and I'll explain it more.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.760
Yet another idea
is the necessity

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.592
of a brain region for
a particular function.

00:23:20.592 --> 00:23:22.050
That's actually
what we really want

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.424
to know with the functional
specificity question-- is not

00:23:24.424 --> 00:23:26.430
just does it only
turn on when you do x,

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:29.760
but do you absolutely
need it for x?

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.860
And so that's actually
a central question

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.420
that's closely connected.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.470
It's really part of
functional specificities.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.840
It's the causal question.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.900
It's different from the
question of sufficiency.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.060
Is a given brain
region sufficient

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.334
for a mental process?

00:23:46.334 --> 00:23:48.750
Well, I think that's just kind
of a wrong headed question,

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.166
because nothing's
ever sufficient.

00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:52.115
It's just kind of
a confused idea.

00:23:52.115 --> 00:23:52.990
What would that mean?

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.670
That would mean we excise my
face area, we put it in a dish,

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.020
keep all the neurons alive.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.310
Let's pretend we can do that.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:00.768
I'm sure Ed Boyden
could figure out

00:24:00.768 --> 00:24:03.030
how to do that in a weekend.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.990
And so we have this
thing alive in a dish,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.310
can it do face recognition?

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.531
Well, of course not.

00:24:07.531 --> 00:24:10.030
You got to get the information
in there in the right format.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.904
And if information
doesn't get out and inform

00:24:11.904 --> 00:24:15.330
the rest of a brain, it doesn't
house a face percept, right?

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:19.417
So you need things
to be connected up,

00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:21.750
and you need lots of other
brain regions to be involved.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.170
So let's distinguish
whether this brain region is

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.696
functionally specific for
a process from whether it's

00:24:27.696 --> 00:24:29.070
sufficient for
the whole process.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.500
Of course it's not sufficient.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.100
All right.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.700
I know you guys would
never say anything so dumb.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.350
OK.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.610
A question of connectivity--

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:43.730
so people often say,
oh, well, this region

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.040
is part of a network, period.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.260
And my reaction is, duh.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.090
Of course it's
part of a network.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.530
Everything's part of a network.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.840
In no way does that
engage with the question

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.500
of whether that region
is functionally specific.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.380
A functionally specific region
of course is part of a network.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.130
It talks to other brain regions.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.500
Those other brain regions
may play an important role

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.430
in its processing, sure.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.430
At the very least, they're
necessary for getting

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.810
the information in
and out and using it.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:11.930
OK?

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.250
OK.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.690
All right.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.750
The final thing that
people confuse it

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.820
with functional
specificity is innateness.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.040
This is a very
different concept.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.840
Just because we have
some particular part

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.780
of the brain for which we
make it really strong evidence

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.750
that it's very specifically
involved in mental process x,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:31.470
that's cool.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.820
That's important.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.880
That's completely orthogonal
to how it got wired up

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.240
and whether it's innately
specified in the genome

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.290
that whole circuit--

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.780
or whether that
circuit is instructed

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.060
by experience over
development, or as

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.790
in the usual case, very
complicated combinations

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.200
of those two.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.810
So just to remind you that
functional specificity

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.270
is a different question
from innateness.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.970
And one way you can
see that very clearly

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.310
is to consider the case
of the visual word form

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.880
area, about which I'll show
you some data in a moment.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.880
The visual word form
area responds selectively

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.350
to words and letter strings
in an orthography you know,

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.630
not an orthography
you don't know.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.490
It's very anatomically
stereotyped.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.910
Mine is approximately
right there,

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.760
and so is yours in your brain.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.100
And it responds to
orthographies you know.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.020
If you can read
Arabic and Hebrew,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.640
yours also responds
when you look

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.230
at words in Arabic and Hebrew.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.500
If you can't, it doesn't, or
it responds a whole lot less.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.650
So that's a function of your
individual experience, not

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:36.240
your ancestor's experience.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.580
It has strong
functional specificity,

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.430
and yet, its functional
specificity is not innate.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.700
So this idea that
I'm staking out here

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.090
has become kind of unpopular.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.510
It's very trendy
to say, of course

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.390
we know the brain doesn't
have specialized components.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.150
So for example, here's
from a textbook.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.420
Scott Huettel-- unlike
the phrenologists

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.810
who believe this very stupid
idea that very complex traits

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.910
are associated with
discrete brain regions,

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.940
modern researchers recognize
that a single brain

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.234
region may participate in
more than one function.

00:27:05.234 --> 00:27:07.650
Well, he built in the hedge
word "may," so we can't really

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:08.191
have a fight.

00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:12.180
But he's trying to stake
out this different view .

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.490
Lisa Feldman Barrett--
I haven't met her,

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.430
but she's driving me
insane, most recently

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.370
by proclaiming all kinds of
things in The New York Times

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.510
just a few weeks ago.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.630
Quote, "in general, the
workings of the brain

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.400
are not one to one,
whereby a given

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.870
region has a distinct
psychological purpose."

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.691
Well, she's got hedge
words "in general."

00:27:32.691 --> 00:27:33.690
We all have hedge words.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.090
But basically, what
she's reasoning from

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:40.230
is the fact that her data
suggests that specific emotions

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.530
don't inhabit specific
brain regions from the idea

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.990
that the whole brain has no
localization of function.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.640
Well, that's idiotic.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.070
It's just idiotic, right?

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:53.610
So I hope that people will stop
these fast and lose arguments.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.110
But here's my favorite--

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.730
this old coot Uttal.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.440
I know this is going
to be on the web,

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.550
and here I am carrying on as
if we are-- anyway, whatever.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.045
This guy cracks me up.

00:28:04.045 --> 00:28:04.920
He's been publishing.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.440
Every year, he
publishes another book

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.120
going after functional MRI.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.010
Any studies using
brain images that

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.530
report single areas of
activation exclusively

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.960
associated with a
particular cognitive process

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.900
should be a priori considered
to be artifacts of the arbitrary

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.700
threshold set by
the investigators

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.540
and seriously questioned.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.970
You go.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.840
So anyway, that's fun.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.221
Anyway, my point is just that
we should engage in the data,

00:28:31.221 --> 00:28:31.720
right?

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.640
This isn't like an
ideology, where we can just

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.100
proclaim our opinions.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.840
There are data that speak to it.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.541
So let me show you some of mine.

00:28:40.541 --> 00:28:41.040
OK.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.152
So what would be evidence
of functional specificity?

00:28:44.152 --> 00:28:45.610
There are lots of
ways of doing it.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.810
The way I like to do it is
something called a functional

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.400
region of interest method.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.000
The problem is
that although there

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.450
are very systematic regularities
in the functional organization

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.210
of the brain, each of these
regions that I'm talking about

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.250
is in approximately
the same location

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.900
in each normal subject.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.260
Their actual location varies
a bit from subject to subject.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.930
So if you do the standard
thing of aligning brains

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.990
and averaging across them,
you get a lot of mush,

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.290
and yet there isn't much mush
in each subject individually.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.820
And so to deal
with that problem--

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.654
and to deal with a bunch
of other problems--

00:29:19.654 --> 00:29:21.153
we use something
called a functional

00:29:21.153 --> 00:29:22.290
region of interest method.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:25.290
And that means if you want
to study a given region,

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.660
you find it in that
subject individually.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.630
And then once you've found it
with a simple contrast-- you

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.520
want to find a face
region, you find a region

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.290
that responds more when
people look at faces

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.581
than when they look at objects.

00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:37.500
Now you found it
in that subject.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.420
It's these 85 voxels right
there in that subject.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.800
Now we run a new experiment to
test more interesting questions

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.590
about it, and we measure the
response in those voxels.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.580
OK?

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.430
That also has the advantage that
the data you plot and look at

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.070
is independent of the way
you found those voxels--

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.530
a very important problem
in a lot of functional

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.350
neuroimaging, where people have
non-independent statistical

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.250
problems with their
data analysis.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.370
If you have a functional region
of interest that's localized

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.740
independently of the
data you look at in it,

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.370
you get out of that problem.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.400
It's also a huge
benefit, because one

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.286
of the central problems with
functional brain imaging,

00:30:12.286 --> 00:30:13.660
which I think has
led to the fact

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.320
that a large percent of the
published neuroimaging findings

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.110
are probably noise,
is that there are just

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.520
too many degrees of freedom.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.230
You have tens of
thousands of voxels.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.380
You have loads of different
places to look and ways

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.844
to analyze your data.

00:30:27.844 --> 00:30:30.010
One of the things I love
dearly about the functional

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.760
region of interest method
is that you tie your hands

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.920
in a really good way, right?

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.870
So you specify in
advance exactly where

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.500
you're going to look, and you
specify exactly how you're

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.190
going to quantify the response.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.270
And so you have no
degrees of freedom,

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.720
and that gives you a huge
statistical advantage.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.860
And it means you're less likely
to be inadvertently publishing

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.080
papers on noise.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.900
OK.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.080
So that's the functional
region of interest method.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.790
We've done loads of
these experiments.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:00.010
Here's just from a current
experiment in my lab

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.406
being conducted
by Zeynep Saygin.

00:31:02.406 --> 00:31:04.780
She's actually looking at
connectivity of different brain

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.430
regions using a different
method I probably

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.660
won't have time to talk about.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.285
It's very cool.

00:31:08.285 --> 00:31:10.270
But in the process,
she's run a whole bunch

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.810
of functional localizers.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:15.100
And so we can look in her data
at the response of the fusiform

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.860
face area to a whole bunch
of different conditions.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.120
So these are a bunch of
auditory language conditions,

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.940
so, OK, not too surprising.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.040
It doesn't respond
very much to those.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.260
They're presented
auditorily, but these are all

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.490
visual stimuli here.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.530
The two yellow bars are faces.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.420
This is line drawings of faces.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.480
This is color video
clips of faces--

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.280
strong responses to both.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.970
And all of these
other conditions--

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.740
line drawings of objects, movies
of objects, movies of scenes,

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.480
scrambled objects, words,
scrambled words, bodies--

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.740
all produce much
lower responses.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.680
OK?

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.400
So I would say this is
pretty strong selectivity.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.150
It's been tested against
lots of alternatives,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.720
only a tiny percent of
which are shown here.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.024
As I mentioned before, it's
present in more or less

00:32:01.024 --> 00:32:03.190
the same place and pretty
much every normal subject.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.710
I think it's just a basic
piece of mental architecture.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:10.090
Now, this is a very
simple univariate measure.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.830
We're just measuring
the very crude thing

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.830
of the overall magnitude
of MRI response

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.590
in that region to
these conditions.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.510
There are legitimate
counter-arguments

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.420
to the simple-minded
view I'm putting forth,

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.680
and we should consider them.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.600
I think the most
important one comes

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.150
from pattern analysis methods,
which I will talk about

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.610
if I get there.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.790
And importantly, these
data don't tell us

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:37.470
about the causal
role of that region.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.900
We'll return to those.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.280
However, the point
is, before we blithely

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.640
say it's not fashionable to talk
about functional specificity,

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.844
we need counterarguments
to data like this.

00:32:48.844 --> 00:32:49.760
They're pretty strong.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.800
And that's just one example,
to show you just a few others

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.277
from Zeynep's paper.

00:32:57.277 --> 00:32:58.860
OK, so this is what
I just showed you,

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.090
but I'm in the same experiment.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.590
We can look at
other brain regions.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.090
OK.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:06.700
So this is a bottom
surface of the brain

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.660
there, so this is the occipital
pole, front of the head, bottom

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.710
of the temporal lobe.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.560
That face area is the region
in yellow in this subject.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.470
This purple region is
that visual word form area

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.900
that I mentioned, and here
is its response magnitude

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.400
across a whole
bunch of subjects,

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.890
localizing and then
independently testing.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.280
The purple bars are when
subjects are looking

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.986
at visually presented words.

00:33:28.986 --> 00:33:30.610
And again, all these
other conditions--

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:34.215
faces, objects, bodies,
scenes, listening to words,

00:33:34.215 --> 00:33:35.965
all of those things--
much lower response.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.550
In the same experiment, we can
also look at a set of regions

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.900
that respond to speech.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.120
I mentioned those very
briefly in my introduction

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.690
a few days ago.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.350
These are regions a number
of people have found.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.940
In this case, they're
immediately below

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.170
or lateral to primary
auditory cortex in humans,

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.490
interestingly situated right
between primary auditory cortex

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.840
and language sensitive regions.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.060
Right between is the set
of regions that respond

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.250
to the sounds of speech--

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:12.820
not to the content of language,
but the sounds of speech.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.800
And so this is when people
are saying stuff like,

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.909
"ba da ga ba da ga."

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.450
So they're just
lying in the scanner,

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:21.760
saying, "ba da ga ba da ga."

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.820
And here's when they're
tapping their fingers

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.040
in a systematic order.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.776
Here's when they're
listening to sentences.

00:34:29.776 --> 00:34:31.150
Importantly, this
is when they're

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:34.120
listening to
jabberwocky gobbledygook

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.469
that's meaningless.

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:37.420
So no meaning, but phonemes--

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.600
same response.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.960
That's what tells us that
this region is involved

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.520
in processing the
sounds of speech,

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.850
not the content of language,
and load everything else.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:50.080
So other things-- moving
outside of perceptual regions,

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.520
you might say, OK, fine.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.912
Perception is an
inherently modular process.

00:34:53.912 --> 00:34:55.870
There's different kinds
of perceptual problems,

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:57.220
that make sense.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.470
But high level cognition--
we wouldn't really

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:01.940
have functional
specificity for that.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.890
But oh, yes, we do.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.297
Here are some language regions.

00:35:06.297 --> 00:35:08.630
There's a bunch of them in
the temporal and frontal lobe

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.910
that have been known
since Wernicke and Broca.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.220
But now, with functional
MRI, we can identify them

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.460
in individual subjects and
go back and repeatedly query

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.770
them and say, are
they involved in all

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.730
of these other mental processes?

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:24.496
So this is now the response
in a language region--

00:35:24.496 --> 00:35:26.120
so identified, here's
the response when

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.950
you're listening to sentences.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:32.330
This is when you're listening
to jabberwocky nonsense strings.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.490
Here's when you're saying
"ba da ga ba da ga."

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.390
It's not just speech sounds.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:40.280
Here's when you're listening to
synthetically decomposed speech

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.690
sounds that are
acoustically very

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.002
similar to the
jabberwocky speech.

00:35:44.002 --> 00:35:45.710
It's just not interested
in those things.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.293
It seems to be
interested in something

00:35:47.293 --> 00:35:49.790
more like the meaning
of a sentence.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.415
And just to show you some
other data we have on this,

00:35:52.415 --> 00:35:57.310
this is data from Ev Fedorenko,
who has tested this region.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.950
Now, this is sort of
roughly Broca's area,

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:05.540
the main mental functions
that people have argued

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.347
overlap in the
brain with language.

00:36:08.347 --> 00:36:10.430
Namely-- sorry, this is
probably hard to see here,

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.270
but arithmetic, so we
have difficult and easy

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.070
mental arithmetic.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.190
Intact and scrambled
music in pink.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.130
A bunch of working
memory tasks--

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:23.660
spatial working memory and
verbal working memory--

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.954
and a bunch of cognitive
control tasks--

00:36:25.954 --> 00:36:27.620
just kind of an
attention demanding task

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.140
where you have to switch between
tasks and stuff like that.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.010
And here is the response
profile in that region.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.850
Reading sentences,
reading non-word strings.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:39.710
All of those other
tasks, both the difficult

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.390
and the easy version--

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.900
no response at all.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.510
That's extreme functional
specificity, right?

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.130
It's not that we've
tested everything,

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.640
there's more to be done.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:54.310
But the first pass querying
of do those language regions

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.650
engage in all of these other
things that people thought

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.120
might overlap with language?

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.420
The answer is no, they don't.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.880
And I think that's really
deep and interesting,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.540
because it means that this
basic question that we all

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.850
start asking ourselves
when we're young

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.480
is, what is the relationship
between language and thought?

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.749
I know Liz disagrees
with me somewhat on this.

00:37:15.749 --> 00:37:17.290
That's because she's
very articulate,

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:20.080
and she doesn't feel the
difference between an idea

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.460
and its articulation.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.510
I'm less articulate.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.442
It's very obvious to me
they're different things.

00:37:25.442 --> 00:37:26.650
No, it's not the only reason.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.200
She has data, too, and
it'd be fun to discuss.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.320
But I think there's a
vast gulf between the two

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.460
in that many different
aspects of cognition

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.580
can proceed just fine
without language regions.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.440
And actually, the
stronger evidence for that

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.720
comes not from these
functional MRI data,

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.500
striking as I think they
are, but from patient data.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.980
So Rosemary Varley in England
has been testing patients

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:51.990
with global aphasia.

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:53.800
This is this very
tragic, horrible thing

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.040
that happens in patients who
have massive left hemisphere

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.800
strokes that pretty
much take out

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.650
essentially all of their
language abilities.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:06.730
Those people she has shown
are intact in their navigation

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:10.390
abilities, their arithmetic
abilities, their ability

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.970
to solve logic
problems, their ability

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:15.670
to think about what other
people are thinking,

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:19.880
their ability to appreciate
music, and so on and so forth.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.810
So I think there's really
a very big difference

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.390
between a major
part of the system

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:28.000
that you need to understand
the meaning of a sentence

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.910
and all of those other
aspects of thought.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:32.470
This is just showing
you what I mean

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.540
by functional specificity--

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.247
what the basic first
order evidence is.

00:38:37.247 --> 00:38:38.830
And these are just
the regions that we

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.204
happen to have in this study
so I could make a new slide.

00:38:41.204 --> 00:38:45.280
But for lots of other perceptual
and cognitive functions,

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.620
people have found quite
specific brain regions

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.830
for perceiving bodies and
scenes, of course, motion.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:54.280
The area MT has been
studied for a long time--

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.140
regions that are
quite specifically

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.150
involved in processing shape.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.640
We've been studying color
processing regions recently.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.080
They're not as
selective for color

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.871
as some of these other
regions, but they're

00:39:03.871 --> 00:39:07.830
very anatomically consistent.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:12.460
And things I mentioned before in
my brief introduction-- regions

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.700
that are specifically involved
in processing pitch information

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.010
and music information,
and as you'll

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.950
hear next week from
Rebecca Saxe, theory

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.200
of mind or thinking about
other people's thoughts.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.870
And so there's quite a
litany of mental functions

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:31.570
that have brain regions that
are quite specifically engaged

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.860
to that mental function.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.030
And each of these--

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:37.840
to varying degrees, but to
some appreciable degree--

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.480
have corroborating
evidence from patients

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.670
who have that specific deficit.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.830
So that shows that
each of these is

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.260
likely to be not only
activated during,

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.610
but causally involved
in its mental function.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.157
And as I mentioned, there are
actually good counter-arguments

00:39:55.157 --> 00:39:56.740
to some of the things
I've been making

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.970
that are worth discussing.

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:02.880
I think the pattern analysis
data is the strongest.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.840
Oh, and I do need to
take a few more minutes.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.100
Just like five or something?

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.120
OK.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.610
So all of that's
to say, so here's

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:10.900
roughly where we are now.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.262
There are counter-arguments, but
loose talk about, oh, there's

00:40:14.262 --> 00:40:15.970
no localization of
function in the brain.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.386
You got to engage
with us at first

00:40:17.386 --> 00:40:20.620
and give me a serious
counter-argument.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.760
OK.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.730
Finally, I want to say that
it's not that the whole brain is

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.020
like this, right?

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.230
There are big gray patches
where we haven't figured

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:33.160
out what it's doing, but there
are also substantial patches

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.590
that have already
been shown to be,

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.240
in some sense, the
opposite of this.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.090
Regions that are engaged in
almost any difficult task

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:41.659
you do at all.

00:40:41.659 --> 00:40:43.450
And I think this is a
very interesting part

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.741
of the whole story of the
architecture of intelligence,

00:40:45.741 --> 00:40:48.130
so I'm going to take five
minutes and tell you about it.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.130
This work is primarily the
work of John Duncan in England.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.960
And he's been pointing
out for about 15 years

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.530
that there are regions in the
parietal and frontal lobe shown

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:04.270
here that are engaged in pretty
much any difficult task you do.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.850
Any time you increase the
difficulty of a task--

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:10.090
whether it's perceptual
or high level cognitive--

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.740
those regions turn
on differentially.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.740
And so that's why he calls
them multiple demand.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.864
They respond to multiple
different kinds of demand.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.140
Duncan argues that
these regions are

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.880
related to fluid intelligence.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.130
So remember Spearman,
who I started with,

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.930
who talks about the
general factor, g.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.070
Well, Duncan thinks
that basically, this

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.390
is the seat of g--

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:37.370
these regions here-- to
oversimplify his argument.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.130
There's multiple sources
of evidence for that.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.520
And one is, well,
they're strongly

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.846
activated when you do
classic g-loading tasks.

00:41:45.846 --> 00:41:46.970
That's not that surprising.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.053
They're activated in all
different kinds of tasks.

00:41:49.053 --> 00:41:52.640
More interestingly, he
did a large patient study,

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.840
where they found 80 or
so neuropsych patients

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.340
in their patient database.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.100
And they identified the
locus of the brain damage

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.810
in each of those patients.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.470
And what they did was they
measured post-injury IQ.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.920
They estimated from a variety
of sources pre-injury IQ.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.310
And they asked, how much
does your IQ go down

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:16.350
after brain damage
as a function of one,

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.970
the volume of tissue you
lost in the brain damage,

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.730
and two, the locus of tissue?

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.040
And basically, what
he finds is if you

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.850
lose tissue in these
regions, your IQ goes down.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.010
If you lose tissue
elsewhere, you

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:36.335
may become paralyzed or
aphasic or prosopagnosia.

00:42:36.335 --> 00:42:38.840
Your IQ does not go down.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.470
In fact, he made a kind
of ghoulish calculation

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.560
that you lose 6 and 1/2
IQ points for every 10

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.330
cubic centimeters of
this region of cortex,

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.900
and almost nothing for
the rest of the brain.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.700
So this is kind of crude.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.000
It's very imperfect what you
can get from patient study,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.870
but I think it's intriguing.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.070
And so his suggestion is that
in addition to these highly

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.690
specialized cortical
regions that we

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:08.690
use for these particular
important tasks,

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.290
we also have this kind of
general purpose machinery that

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.622
makes us generically smart.

00:43:14.622 --> 00:43:15.830
And I'm going to skip around.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.205
We've tested this
more seriously.

00:43:17.205 --> 00:43:19.790
He did group analyses,
which I don't like.

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.710
We did it in
collaboration with him

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.390
with individual
subject analyses,

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.760
the most precise measurements
we could make, and boy,

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.550
is he right.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.580
I mean, even to
the voxel you can

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.650
find that these
regions are engaged

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.530
in seven or eight very,
very different kinds

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.030
of cognitive demand--

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.750
all activate the same
voxel differentially.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.850
So the basic story I'm
putting forth here--

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:45.620
without the second half of my
talk, I'm sorry about that--

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.352
is that at a macro
scale, the architecture

00:43:48.352 --> 00:43:50.810
of human intelligence is that
we have these special purpose

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.280
bits for a smallish number of
important mental functions,

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.946
not all of them innate--
maybe some of them.

00:43:57.946 --> 00:44:00.290
In addition, we have some
general purpose machinery.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.930
There's loads more
that we don't know

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.830
from the precise computations
that go on in these things,

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:11.897
to their connectivity, to the
actual precise representations

00:44:11.897 --> 00:44:14.480
that you can see with the neural
code if you could measure it,

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.060
which we can't in
humans, to the timing

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.210
of these complex interactions,
which of them are uniquely

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:23.870
human, which of them are
also present in monkeys.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.680
And I don't have time
to go find the slide,

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.670
but one of the things
we've been doing recently

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.370
is looking in the
ventral visual pathway

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:36.320
at the organization of face,
place, and color selectivity.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.720
And what we see is that--

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:43.220
we is me and Bevil Conway
and Rosa Lafer-Sousa.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.260
Bevil and Rosa had
previously shown

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.510
that on the lateral
surface in the monkey,

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.150
you have three bands
of selectivity.

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:53.600
So it goes face selectivity,
color selectivity,

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.130
place selectivity,
and three bands

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:58.160
on the side of the
temporal lobe in monkeys.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.240
We find this in humans.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.870
You have exactly the same
organization in the same order,

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:05.360
but it's rolled around on the
ventral surface of the brain

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.440
in the same order--

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.560
face, color, place-- on
the bottom of the brain.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:13.010
So we think that whole
broad region is homologous

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.021
between monkeys and humans.

00:45:15.021 --> 00:45:16.520
It just rolled
around on the bottom.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.710
Maybe it got pushed over
[AUDIO OUT] something.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.590
And that's not exactly
a novel argument.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:24.956
Actually, Winrich wrote a paper
suggesting this a while back,

00:45:24.956 --> 00:45:27.080
and I think we're starting
to see those homologies.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.760
And the reason
that's important is

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.370
that it means that all these
questions we desperately

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:35.990
want to answer about the
causal role, connectivity,

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:40.650
population codes, [AUDIO OUT]
interactions between regions,

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:42.120
development-- all
of that that we

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.460
can't answer very
well in humans,

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.280
Winrich can answer in monkeys.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.490
And after a break, he will
tell you about all of that.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.240
