SHIMON ULLMAN: What I'm
going to talk about today

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.370
is very much related to this
general issue of using vision,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.950
but with sort of the final goal
of seeing and understanding,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.260
in a very deep and
complete manner, what's

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.900
going on around you.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.010
And let me start with
just one image we've all--

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.480
we see images all
the time, and we

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.760
know that we can get a lot
of meaning out of them.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.540
But just, you look at
one image, and you get

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.900
a lot of information out of it.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.380
You understand what
happened before, that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.970
was some kind of
a flood, and why

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.680
these people are hanging out up
there on the wires, and so on.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.090
So all of this, we
get very quickly.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.540
And what we do, usually, in
computational vision in much

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.390
of my own work is
to try to understand

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.760
computational schemes
that I can take

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.710
as an input, an image
like this, and get

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.970
all this information out.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.390
But what I want to talk
about in the first part--

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.210
I'm going to break the afternoon
into two different talks on two

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.700
different topics, but they
are all closely related

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.610
to this ultimate
goal which drives me,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.900
which is, as you will see--

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.810
I think it will become
apparent as we go along--

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.900
this sort of complete and full
understanding, and complicated

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.840
concepts, and complicated
notions that we

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.230
can derive from an image.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.300
But what I'm going to
discuss in the first part

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.550
is sort of how it all starts.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.010
And this combines vision
with another topic

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.311
which is very important in
cognition-- part of CBMM

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:02.810
as well.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.870
But it's not just this
particular center,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.180
it's part of
understanding cognition--

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.180
is infant learning
and how it all starts.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.790
And certainly for
vision, and for learning,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.360
this is a very interesting
and fascinating problem.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.970
Because here, you
think about babies,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.500
they open up their eyes.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.390
And they see-- they don't--

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.430
they cannot understand
the images that they see.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.677
You can think that
they see pixels.

00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:28.760
And they watch the pixels.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.550
And the pixels are transforming.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.800
And they look at the world
as things change around them

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.730
and so on.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.160
And what this short clip is
trying to make explicit is,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.930
somehow, these pixels,
over time, acquire meaning.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.750
And they understand the
world, what they see.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.980
The input changes from changing
pixels and light intensities

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.021
into other infants, and rooms,
and whatever they see around

00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:56.520
them.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.540
So we would like to be
able to understand this

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.190
and to do something similar.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.950
So to have a system,
imagine that we

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.580
have some kind of a
system that starts

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.610
without any specific world
knowledge wired into it.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.376
It watches movies
for, say, six months.

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:14.750
And at the end of
the six months,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.750
this system knows about the
world, about people, about

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.670
agents, about animals,
about objects,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.980
about actions,
social interactions

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.830
between agents the
way that infants do

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.640
during the first year of life.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.600
So the goal isn't-- for me
at least, it's not really--

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.080
the interest is not
necessarily to engineer,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.290
the engineering part of it to
really build such a system,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.270
but to think about and develop
schemes that will be able

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.240
to deal with it and
do something similar.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.880
I think it's also-- maybe
I'll mention it at the end--

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.500
it's also a very
interesting direction

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.210
for artificial
intelligence to think

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.660
about not generating
final complete systems,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.000
but generating baby
systems, if you want,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.510
that have some interesting
and useful initial capacities.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.390
But the rest is just,
they watch the world,

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.830
and they get intelligent
as time goes by.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.970
I'm going to talk initially
about two particular things

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.980
that we've been
working on and we

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.490
selected because we thought
it particularly interesting.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.470
And one has to do with
hands, and the other one

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.810
has to do with gaze.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.830
And the reason that we selected
them is, I'll show in a minute,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.420
visually, for computer vision,
being able to deal with hands

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.070
of people's in images and
dealing with direction of gaze

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.710
are a very difficult problem.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.910
And a lot of work has been
done in computer vision dealing

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.960
with issues related
to hands and to gaze.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.900
They're also very important
for cognition in general.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.389
Again, I will discuss
it a bit more later.

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.930
But understanding
hands and what they

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.080
are doing, interacting
with objects,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.910
manipulating objects,
action recognition--

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.200
so hands are a part of
understanding the full scheme,

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.850
the whole domain of actions.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.470
And social interactions
between agents is a part of it.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.780
Gaze is also very
important for understanding

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.760
intentions of
people, understanding

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.060
interactions between people.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.420
So these are two basic--

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.780
very basic type of
objects or concepts

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.750
that you want to acquire
that are very difficult.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.730
And the final
surprising thing is they

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:30.950
come very early in infant
vision, one of the first things

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.030
to be learned.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.520
So you can see here, when
I say hands are important,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.530
for example, for
action recognition,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.900
I don't know if you can
tell what this person is

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.740
doing, for example.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.635
Any guess?

00:05:42.635 --> 00:05:43.512
Yeah, you say what?

00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:44.220
What is he doing?

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.000
AUDIENCE: Talking on the phone.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.780
SHIMON ULLMAN:
Talking on the phone.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.238
And we cannot really
see the phone.

00:05:47.238 --> 00:05:50.590
But it's more where the hand is
relative to the ear and so on.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.610
And you know, we can see the
interactions between agents

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.110
and so on.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.790
A lot depends on understanding
the body posture,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.000
and in particular, the hands.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.870
So they are certainly
very important for us.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.880
I mentioned that they
are very difficult to be

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.610
able to automatically
be able to extract them

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.310
and localize them in the image.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.360
And there are two
reasons for this.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.660
One is that hands
are very flexible,

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.980
much more so than
most rigid objects we

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.180
encounter in the world.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.880
So a hand does not have
a typical appearance.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.310
It has so many
different appearances

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.250
that it's difficult
to handle all of them.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.100
And the other reason is that
hands in images, although they

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.220
are important, very often,
there is very little information

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.580
in the image showing the hand.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.780
Just because of resolution
size, partial occlusion,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.220
we know where the hands are.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.890
But we can see very
little of the hands.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.050
We have the impression
here, when we look at this,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.180
we know what this
person is doing, right?

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.419
He's holding a camera
and taking a picture.

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:54.960
But if you take the
image-- you know,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.382
where the hand and
the camera are--

00:06:57.382 --> 00:06:59.340
you know, this is the
camera, this is the hand,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.010
and so on-- it's really
not much information.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.350
But we can use it
very effectively,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.400
and similarly in the other
images that you see here.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.090
Children, or infants, do this
ability to deal with hands--

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.250
and later on, we'll
see, with gaze--

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.140
in a completely
unsupervised manner.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.930
Nobody teaches them,
look, this is a hand.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.980
Even it cannot be even
theoretically possible,

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.010
because this capacity
to deal with, say,

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.620
hands and gaze comes at
the age of three months,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.170
way before language
starts to develop.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.780
So all of this is
entirely unsupervised,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.260
just watching things happening
in an unstructured way

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.180
and mastering these concepts.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.980
And when you try to imitate
this in computer vision systems,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.000
there are not too many
computer vision system,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.500
learning system that can deal
well with unsupervised data.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.219
And I can tell you
without going--

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:54.510
I don't want to elaborate on
the different schemes that

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.170
exist and so on.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.560
But the kind of thing
that exists cannot--

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.370
nobody can help,
nobody can learn hands

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.080
in an unsupervised way.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.590
It may be interesting
to know, just

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.630
anecdotally, when we actually
started to work with this,

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.800
deep networks were not
exactly what they are today.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.180
If you go back in
the literature,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.030
and we see when the term "deep
networks" and the initial work

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.434
on deep networks started by--

00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:22.900
at least in the group
of Geoff Hinton.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.000
Yann LeCun was doing
independent things separately.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.500
But the goal was
to learn everything

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.830
in an unsupervised way.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.039
They were labeled as, that's
the goal of the project,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.409
to be able to build a machine.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.990
And the machine, you will
not need supervision.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.580
You just aim it at
the world, and it

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.850
will start to absorb
information from the world

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.900
and build a internal
representation in a completely

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.280
unsupervised way.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.560
And they demonstrated
it on simple examples--

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.280
for example, on MNIST
on digits, that you

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.630
don't tell the system that
there are 10 digits and so on.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.550
You just show it data, and
it builds a deep network

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.430
that automatically
divides the input

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.420
into 10 different classes.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.220
And in interesting ways,
it also divides subclasses.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.190
There is a closed 4, and an
open 4, and so on with something

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.210
very natural.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.950
And it was an example of
dealing with multiple classes

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.732
in an unsupervised manner.

00:09:21.732 --> 00:09:23.940
But when you try to do
something like hands, which we

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.560
tried, I mean, there is just--

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:34.740
it basically failed as
an unsupervised method.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.500
And the problem
remained difficult.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.410
Here is a quote for
Jitendra Malik, who is--

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.690
those of you who deal
with computer vision

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.550
would know the name.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.800
He's sort of a leading
person in computer vision.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.730
"They say that dealing with
body configuration in general,

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.380
and hands in
particular, is maybe

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.930
the most difficult recognition
problem in computer vision."

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.210
I think that's
probably going too far.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.780
But still, you can realize
that people took it

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.445
as a very difficult problem.

00:10:02.445 --> 00:10:09.420
On the unsupervised way, which
is still a big open problem,

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.960
the biggest effort so
far has been a paper--

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.920
it's already a few years ago--

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.640
a collaboration between
Google and Stanford

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.550
by Andrew Ng others in
which they took images

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.820
from 10 million YouTube movies.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.280
And they tried to
learn whatever they

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.880
could in an unsupervised way.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.440
And they designed a system that
was designed to get information

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.450
out in an unsupervised manner.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.480
And basically, they managed,
from all this information,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.070
to get out three concepts
what happened in the machine

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.540
that you-- it developed
units that were sensitive,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.060
specifically, to three
different categories.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.110
One was faces, the
other one was cats.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.370
That's from their paper.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.620
It's not easy to see the cat
here, but there is a cat.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.960
They found the cat.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.920
And there is a sort of a
torso, upper body from--

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.350
upper body.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.840
Three concepts-- after all of
this training, three concepts

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.660
sort of emerged.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.370
And in fact, only
one of them, faces,

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.230
was really there, that
there were units that

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.120
were very sensitive to faces.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.840
For the other cases, like
cats and upper bodies,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.147
it was not all that selective.

00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:21.980
And by the way, cats
is not very surprising.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.960
You know why cats came
out in these movies?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.540
If you watched YouTube
you would know,

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.840
literally, it's also
the most salient thing.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.620
After faces, it's
literally the case

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.200
that if you take random
movies, or millions

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.490
of movies from YouTube, many,
many of them will contain cats.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.870
So in the database, it was the
most-- after faces and bodies,

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.430
it was the third most
frequent category.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.520
So it wouldn't do,
hands or gaze and so on.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.340
It's really picking
up only things

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.340
which are very, very
salient and very, very

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.310
frequent in the input.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.280
And as I said, babies do it.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.560
And now people started to work
to look more closely at it.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.300
One technique was to put a
sort of webcam on infants.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.220
This is not an infant.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.720
This is a slightly
older person, a toddler.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.870
But they do it with
infants, and they look

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.860
at what the babies are looking.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.980
And what babies are looking
at the very initial stages

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.090
are faces and hands.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.900
They really like faces.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.526
And they really like hands.

00:12:34.526 --> 00:12:36.410
And they recognize hands.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.180
And they know sort of what--

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.730
they have, already, information
and expectation about hands

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.810
in a very early age.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:49.010
So it's not just even the visual
recognition that they group

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.830
together images
of hands, but they

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:56.750
know that hands, for example,
are the causal agents that are

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.560
moving objects in the world.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.315
And this is for an
experiment by Rebecca Saxe.

00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:06.035
There is a person here working
with Rebecca Saxe, right?

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:07.430
Did she talk already in the--

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.360
AUDIENCE: She will.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360
SHIMON ULLMAN: She will.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.620
And she's worth listening to.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:15.590
So this is from
one of her studies

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.970
in which they showed infant--

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.390
these are slightly
older infants.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:24.430
But they showed infants,
on the computer screen,

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.120
a hand moving an object.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.810
This is not taken from
the paper directly.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.040
This, I just drew-- but
a hand moving an object--

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.910
in this case, a cup or a glass.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.850
And the infant watches it for
a while and sort of gets bored.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.220
And after they do it,
they show the infant

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.120
either the hand moving alone on
the screen or the glass moving

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.560
alone on the screen.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.960
And the hand moving alone,
on itself, on the screen,

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.960
they are not--

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.550
still bored.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.949
They don't look at it much.

00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:52.490
When the cup is
moving on the screen,

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.170
they are very surprised
and interested.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.720
So they know it's the
hand moving the cup.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.940
It's not the cup moving the
hand or they have equal status,

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.710
it's the motion of
this configuration.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.600
The originator, or the actor,
or the mover is the hand.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.900
So this is at seven months.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:17.330
But it has been known that this
kind of motion that this one--

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.690
that an object can cause
another object to move,

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.470
this is something that babies
are sensitive to, not only

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.230
at the age of seven
months, but it's

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:31.280
something that appears in
infants as early as you

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.390
can imagine.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.235
And you can test.

00:14:34.235 --> 00:14:35.450
And this, for us--

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.220
I'll tell you what
they are sensitive to.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.940
And for us, this was sort of the
guideline, or sort of the door,

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.375
the open door, how to--

00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:47.000
what may be going on that
lets the infant speak up

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.290
specifically on hands
and quickly develop

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.190
a well-developed face detect--

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.370
hand detector.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.550
So infants are
known to-- have been

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.260
known to be sensitive-- they are
sensitive to motion in general.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.290
They are really
following moving objects.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.070
And they use motion a lot.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.260
But motion by itself
is not very helpful

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.700
if you want to recognize hands.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.950
It's true that hands are moving.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.990
But many other things
are moving as well.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:18.390
So if you take random videos
from children's perspective,

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.070
they see doors
opening and closing.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.800
They see people
moving back and forth,

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.050
coming by and disappearing.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.310
Hands are just one small
category of moving things.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.580
But they're also sensitive,
as I said, not just to motion

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.425
but to this particular situation
in which an object moves,

00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:40.340
comes in contact with another
object, and causes it to move.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.540
And this is not even at
the level of objects.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.215
At three months, they don't
even have a well-set notion of--

00:15:47.215 --> 00:15:52.480
they just begin to organize the
world into separate objects.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.460
But you can think of
just cloud of pixels

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.260
if you want, moving around.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.330
They come in contact
with stationary pixels

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.820
and causing them to move.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.090
Whenever this happens,
infants pay attention to this.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.220
They look at it preferentially.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.650
And it's known that they
are sensitive to this type

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.675
of motion, which
called a mover event.

00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:16.900
And a mover event is
this event that I just

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.970
described that
something is in motion,

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.580
comes in contact with
a stationary item,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.290
and causes it to move.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.380
So we started with developing
a very simple algorithm

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.400
that, all it does, it
simply looks on video,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.190
on changing images,
watching for, or waiting

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.890
for, mover events to occur.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.260
And the way it's defined,
it's very simple.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.790
In the algorithm, we
divide the visual field

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.290
into small regions.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.270
And we monitor each
one of these cells

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.250
in the grid for the
occurrence of a mover, which

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.740
means that there will be some
optical flow, some motion

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:59.080
coming into the cell, and
then leaving the cell,

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.200
and sort of carrying with
it the content of the cell.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.150
So this does require
some kind of optical flow

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.220
in change detection.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.410
And all of these
capacities are known

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:15.079
that they're in place
before three months of age.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:20.349
And now, look at an image of
a person manipulating objects

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.940
when all you do
is simply monitor

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.770
all locations in the
image for the occurrence

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.715
of this kind of a mover event.

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.090
What you should see, or what
you should pay attention to,

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.130
is the fact that
motion, by itself,

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.970
is not particularly--
is not doing anything.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.340
What the algorithm
is doing is, whenever

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:42.580
it detects a mover
event, it draws a square

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.860
around the mover
event and continues

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.190
to follow it to track
it for a little bit.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:52.810
So you can see, the minute
the hand is moving something,

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.790
it's detected as a hand
moving things on their own,

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.790
are not triggering
the system here.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.680
The hand is moving.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.790
So this, by itself,
is not the signal.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.720
But the interaction between
the hand and an object

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.550
is something that
it's detected based

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.920
on these very low-level cues.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.086
It doesn't know about hands.

00:18:09.086 --> 00:18:11.770
It doesn't know about objects.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.200
But you can create-- you can
see, here, a false alarm, which

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:15.910
was interesting.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.250
You can probably
understand why, and so on.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.210
So here's an example of
what if you just let it--

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.720
this scheme run on a large set
of hours and hours of videos.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.820
Some of these videos
do not contain anything

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.660
related to people.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.100
Some of them, there are people,
but just going back and forth,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.690
entering the room,
leaving the room,

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.490
but do not manipulate objects.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.590
Nothing specific
happens in these videos.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.980
The system that is looking for
these kinds of mover events

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.050
finds very rare
occasions in which

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.700
anything interesting happens.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.560
But you can see the
output that happened.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.480
This is just examples
of output of just,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.510
from these many videos,
the kind of images

00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:00.520
that it extracted by being tuned
specifically to the occurrence

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.440
of this specific event.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.630
You can see that you
get a lot of hand.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.800
These hands are
the continuation.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.580
The assumption here, which
we, again, took and modeled

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.680
after what--

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.530
when infancy, something
that starts to move,

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.490
they track it for about
one or two seconds.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.480
So we also tracked it for
about one or two seconds.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.180
And we show some images
from this tracking.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.737
These are some false alarms.

00:19:23.737 --> 00:19:25.070
There are not very many of them.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.190
But these are examples
of some false alarms,

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.200
that something happened
in the image that

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.170
caused the scheme for
the specific mover event

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.020
to be triggered.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.690
And it collected these images.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.910
But on the whole,
as it shows here,

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.200
you get very good performance.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.850
It's actually surprising that,
if you look at all the ima--

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:51.990
all the occurrences of
hands touching objects,

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.540
that 90% of them in all
these collection of videos

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.340
were captured by the image.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.630
And the accuracy was 65%.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.520
So there were some false alarms,
but the majority were fine.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.490
And what you will end up with
is a large collection which

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.140
is mostly composed of hands.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.970
So now you have,
without being supplied

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.892
with external supervision--
here is a hand, here is a hand,

00:20:15.892 --> 00:20:17.350
here is a hand--
suddenly, you have

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.500
a collection of 10,000 images.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.520
And most of them contain a hand.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.570
And now if you look at this,
and you apply completely

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:33.620
standard algorithms
for object recognition,

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.980
this is great for them--
this is sufficient for them--

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.720
in order to learn a new object.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.590
So if you do a deep network--

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.450
but you can do even simpler
algorithms of various sorts--

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.590
what you will end up using this
collection of images, which

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:53.620
were identified as belonging
to the same concept

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.010
by all triggering the same
special event of something

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:02.669
causing something to move,
you will get a hand example.

00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:03.460
So these are just--

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.418
I will not play them--
lots and lots of movies.

00:21:05.418 --> 00:21:07.900
Some of them can play
with for half an hour

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.780
without having a single
event of this kind.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.120
Others are pretty
dense with such events.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.034
And they are being detected.

00:21:15.034 --> 00:21:17.200
And what is shown here,
it's not the greatest image.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.550
But all these squares here,
the yellow squares, are--

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:25.030
having gone through this first
round of learning these events,

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.710
this is the output
of a detector.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.260
You take the images that
were labeled in this way.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:35.484
You give it to a standard
computer vision classifier

00:21:35.484 --> 00:21:37.150
that takes these
images and finds what's

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.740
common to these images.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.180
And then on completely new
images-- static images now--

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:48.040
this marks, in the
image, following

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.944
this learning, where the
hands will be-- the hands are.

00:21:51.944 --> 00:22:00.400
Now, this is a very
good start in terms

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.860
of being able to learn hands,
and not only learn hands.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.480
As I showed you before, very
early on, the notion of learn

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.620
is automatically a sort of--

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.030
in terms of the
cognitive system,

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.020
is closely associated with
moving objects, causing objects

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.290
to move, as we saw in the
Rebecca Saxe experiment.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.240
This also happens
in this system.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.620
But this continues to develop.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.680
Because eventually we can
learn hands not only in

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.070
this grasping configuration.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.170
Later on we want to
be able to recognize

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.822
any hand in any configuration.

00:22:35.822 --> 00:22:39.460
And so the system
needs to learn more.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.550
And this is accomplished
by something

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.880
that, again, the details, or
the specific application here,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.620
is less important
than the principle.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.010
And the principle is
sort of two subsystems

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.490
in the cognitive system
training each other.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.750
And together, by each
one advising the other,

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.820
they reach, together,
much more than what

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:06.460
any one of the systems would
be able to reach on its own.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.070
And the two subsystems
in this case, one

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.460
is the ability to recognize
hands by their appearance.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:17.600
I can show you just an image of
a hand without the rest of it,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.520
the rest of the body or
the rest of the image.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.360
And you know, by the
local appearance,

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.670
that this is a hand.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.580
You also know, here, you cannot
even see the hands of this

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.780
woman.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.360
But you know where
the hands are.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.180
So you can also use the
surrounding context in order

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.880
to get where the hands are.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.490
So these are two
different algorithms that

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.910
are known in computer vision.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.970
They are also known in infants.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.840
People have demonstrated, sort
of independently before we

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.460
have done our work, that infants
associate the body, and even

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.090
the face--

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.760
when they see a hand,
they immediately look up,

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.929
and they look for a face.

00:23:55.929 --> 00:23:57.970
And they are surprised if
there is no face there.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.900
So they know about the
association between body parts

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.410
surrounding the hand
and the hand itself.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:10.650
And you can think about it as--

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.330
we saw this image before.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.200
Here the hand itself
is not very clear.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.910
But you can get to the hand by--
if you know where the face is,

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.890
for example, that you
can go to the shoulder,

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:26.110
and to the upper arm, and lower
arm, and end up at the hand.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.390
So people have used
this in computer vision

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.240
as well, finding hands.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.570
They also use this idea of
finding the hands on their own

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.720
by their own appearance or
using the surrounding body

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.010
configuration.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.640
And the nice thing is,
instead of just thinking of,

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.730
here are two
methods, two schemes

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:50.590
that can both produce the same
final goal, they can also,

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.176
during learning, help each
other and guide each other.

00:24:53.176 --> 00:24:54.550
If you think about
it, the way it

00:24:54.550 --> 00:25:00.370
goes it is shown here, that,
sort of, the appearance can

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.640
help finding hands
by the body pose.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.390
And the body pose can
do the appearance.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.460
So if you think, for
example, that, initially,

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:17.380
I learned this particular hand
in this particular appearance

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.020
and pose, then I learn
it by appearance.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.670
I learn it by the pose.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.580
But then if, for example,
I keep the same pose

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.230
but change completely the
appearance of the hand,

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.890
I still have the pose guiding
me to the right location.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.100
And then I grab a new image
and say, OK, this is still

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.552
a hand, but a new appearance.

00:25:34.552 --> 00:25:36.010
Now that I have
the new appearance,

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.720
I can move the new
appearance to a new location.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.370
So now I can recognize
the hand by the appearance

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.730
that I already know.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.630
But then, this is a
new pose, so I say aha.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.370
So this is still a
new body configuration

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.920
that ends in a hand.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.840
And then I can change
the appearance again.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.870
So you can see that by
having enough images,

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.640
I can use the
appearance to learn

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.980
various poses that
end up in a hand using

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.510
the common appearance
and vice versa.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.440
If I know the pose, I
can use the same pose

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.170
and deduce from the different
appearances of the same hand.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.410
And this becomes--

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.060
I will not go into
the algorithms,

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.060
but this becomes very powerful.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:22.530
And just by going through this
iteration in which you start

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.460
from a small subset of
correct identification,

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.200
but then you let these two
schemes guide each other--

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:39.330
this kind of learning that
one system guides the other--

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.520
we see, here, graphs
of performance.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.720
Roughly speaking, the details
are not that important.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.280
This is called a
precision recall graph.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.340
But even without
explaining the details

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.010
of recall and precision,
the higher graphs

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.392
mean better performance
of the system.

00:26:55.392 --> 00:26:56.850
And this is the
initial performance

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.390
of what you get if you
just train it using hands

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.150
grabbing objects.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.220
Actually, the accuracy of
the system-- the system

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.740
is doing a good job
at recognizing hands,

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.610
but only in a limited domain
of hands touching objects.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.990
So other things, it does
not recognize very well.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.250
So this is shown here,
that it has high accuracy,

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.910
but does not cover all the
range of all possible hands

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.500
that you can learn.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.060
And then without
doing anything else,

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.120
we just continue
to watch movies.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:30.180
But you also integrate
these two systems.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.530
Each one is supplying internal
supervision to the other one.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.960
Everything grows, grows, grows.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.680
And after a while,
after training

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.780
with several hours of video,
we get up to the green curve.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.850
And the red curve is sort of the
absolute maximum you can get.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.690
This is using the best
classifier we can get.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.520
And everything is
completely supervised.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.550
So on every frame, in
10,000 frames or more,

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:03.240
you tell the system where
exactly the hand is.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.420
So this is what you can get with
a completely supervised scheme.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.920
And this, the green,
is what you can

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.660
get with reasonable training--

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.570
I mean, seven hours of training.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.750
Infants get more training--
completely unsupervised.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.314
It just happens on its own.

00:28:21.314 --> 00:28:22.980
It's interesting,
also, to think about--

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.146
if you think about infants--

00:28:24.146 --> 00:28:27.750
and actually, I wanted to--

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.840
I was planning to ask you
the question here let's see.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.550
What else could
help infants do--

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.525
if you can think of other
tricks in which infants somehow

00:28:39.525 --> 00:28:41.400
have to pick up, it's
very important for them

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.440
to pick up hands.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.950
What other signals, or
tricks, or guidelines

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.510
could help them pick up hands?

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.700
And OK, since I sort
of gave up own hands,

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.520
you can think about babies
sort of waving their hands.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.880
And babies do wave their
hands a lot in the air.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.330
And you can think of a scheme
in which the brain knows this.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.620
And you sort of wave hands.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:09.080
And then the images that are
generated by these motive

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.310
activities interpreted
by the system,

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:16.170
it already knows, grab this,
and somehow, use them in order

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.560
to build hand detectors.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.180
There is evidence that this
is, I think, interesting.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.405
And we know that infants are
interested in their own hands.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.107
But there are reasons to believe
that this is not the case.

00:29:31.107 --> 00:29:32.940
Because for example,
if you really try this,

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.850
and you try to learn hands from
waving your hands in this way,

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:42.870
imitating what infants
may see, a scheme

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:46.700
that learns hands in this way
is very bad at recognizing hands

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:47.830
manipulating objects.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.940
If, after waving the
hands, you test the system,

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.860
and there is a hand
coming in the image

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.350
and touching,
grabbing something,

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.900
the difference in
appearance in point

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.050
of view between
waving your own hands

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.240
and watching somebody
grabbing an object

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.690
is so large that it does
not allow to generalize well

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.870
at this stage.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.490
And we know, from
testing infants,

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.760
that the first thing
that they recognize well

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.200
is actually other
hands grabbing objects.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.980
So it's much more
consistent with the idea

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.870
that the guiding
internal signal that

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.570
helps them deal, in
an unsupervised way,

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:27.680
with this difficult task is
the special event of the hand

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.230
as the mover of objects.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.360
OK, I want to move
from hands to--

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.790
this will be shorter, but I want
to say something about gaze.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.710
Gaze is also, as I
said, interesting.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:41.410
It starts at about
three months of age.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:43.720
An infant has this capability.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.230
What happens at three months of
age is that an infant may look

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.110
at an adult-- at a
caregiver, the mother, say,

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.964
or look at another person--

00:30:51.964 --> 00:30:53.380
and if the other
person is looking

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.410
at an object over
there, then the infant

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.680
will look at the other person,
and then will follow the gaze,

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.550
and will look at the object that
the other person is looking at.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.150
So it's, first of all,
the identification

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.210
of the correct
direction of gaze,

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:16.150
but also then using it in
order to get joint attention.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.560
And all of these
things are known

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.310
to be very important in
early visual development.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.570
And psychologists,
child psychologists,

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.000
talk a lot about this
mechanism of joint attention

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.350
in which the parent, or the
caregiver, and the child

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.260
can get joint attention.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.240
And some people,
some infants, do not

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.910
have this mechanism
of joint attention,

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.890
being able to attend
to the same event

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.570
or object that the other
person is attending to.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.180
And this has developmental
consequences.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:54.940
So it's an important aspect
of communication and learning.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.130
So understanding direction
of gaze is very important.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:04.540
And here it's even perhaps more
surprising and unexpected even

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.440
compared to hands.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.390
Because gaze, in some
sense, doesn't really

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:10.780
exist objectively out
there in the scene.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.940
It's not an object, a
yellow object, that you see.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:17.020
It's some kind of an
imaginary vector, if you want,

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.090
pointing in a particular
direction based

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.800
on the face features.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.890
But it's very non-explicit.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.020
And you have, somehow, to
observe it, and see it,

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.630
and start extracting
it from what you see,

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.130
and all of this in a
completely unsupervised manner.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.090
So what would it
take for a system

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.620
to be able to watch
things, get no supervision,

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:45.630
and after a while, extract
correctly direction of gaze?

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.010
Direction of gaze
is actually depend

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.220
on two types of
sources of information,

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.920
one of the direction
of the head,

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.780
and the other is the direction
of the eyes in the orbit.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.670
And both of them are important.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.270
And you have to master both.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.184
There are more recent
studies of this,

00:33:08.184 --> 00:33:09.600
and more accurate
studies of this,

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.620
but I like this reference.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.990
Because this is from
a scientific paper

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.300
on the relative effect of hand--

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:21.150
of head orientation and eyes'
orientation in gaze perception.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:24.010
And it's a scientific
paper in 1824.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.410
So this problem was
studied with experiments,

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.780
and the good
judgment, and so on.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:35.080
The point here, by the
way, is that these people

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.630
look as if they are looking
at different directions.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.150
But in fact, the eyes
here are exactly the same.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:41.470
It's sort of cut and paste.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.570
It's literally the
same eye region,

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.400
and only the head is turning.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.030
And this is enough to cause
us to perceive these two

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:53.380
people as looking in two
different directions.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.980
In terms of inference and how
this learning comes about,

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.890
the head comes about first.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:02.920
And initially, if the
caregiver, as I said, is--

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.380
the head is pointing in
a particular direction

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.400
but the eyes are
not, the infants

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.909
will follow the head direction.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:11.920
Later on-- so this
is at three months.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.670
Later on, they combine the
information from the head

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:19.380
and from the eyes.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.520
And the eyes are
really subtle cues

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.360
which we use very
intuitively, very naturally.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.500
But although it's-- let
me hide this for a minute.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.199
This person-- it's a bad image.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:35.380
It's blurred, especially
those who sit in the back.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.388
But this person, is he looking,
basically, roughly at you,

00:34:38.388 --> 00:34:40.179
or is he looking at
the objects down there?

00:34:43.495 --> 00:34:43.995
Sorry?

00:34:43.995 --> 00:34:44.949
AUDIENCE: audience

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.069
SHIMON ULLMAN: Yeah,
basically at you, right?

00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:48.110
Now, if you look at the--

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.130
so it's from the eyes.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.549
And this is the--

00:34:51.549 --> 00:34:52.340
these are the eyes.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.506
This is all the information.

00:34:53.506 --> 00:34:56.374
This is the right pixels, the
same number of pixels that

00:34:56.374 --> 00:34:57.540
are in the image, and so on.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.380
So this is the
information in the eyes.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.350
It's not a lot.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.060
And we use it
effectively in order

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.940
to decide where the person
is-- we just look at it.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.730
And it's interesting that it's
so small and inconspicuous

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:08.970
in some objective terms.

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:16.230
But for us, we know that the
person is looking, roughly,

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.730
at us.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:21.200
Now, we have some computer
algorithms that do gaze.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.340
And gaze, again, it's
not an easy problem.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.830
And people have
worked quite a lot

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.330
on detection, detecting
direction of gaze.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.142
And all the schemes
are highly supervised.

00:35:32.142 --> 00:35:34.100
And once it's highly
supervised, you can do it.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.880
So by highly supervised, I
mean that you give the system

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.030
many, many images in
which you give the image,

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:45.410
but you also give
the learning system--

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.290
together with the input
image, you supply it

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:49.440
with the direction of gaze.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.250
So this is the image,
and this is the direction

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.710
the person is looking at.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:59.150
And there are ways of getting
this input information

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.880
of the appearance of the face
and the direction of gaze,

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.230
to associate them, and then when
you see a new face, to recover

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.200
the direction of gaze.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:14.940
But it really depends on a
large set of supervised images.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.500
So we need something to-- if
you want to go along the same

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:26.420
direction that happened before
with getting hands correctly,

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.760
we want-- instead of the
internal supervision, we want--

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.680
some kind of a signal that
somehow can tell the baby,

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.640
can tell the system--

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.860
without any explicit
supervision,

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.840
provide some kind of
an internal teaching

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.500
signal that will tell it where
is the direction of gaze.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.570
It's very close to
the hand and the mover

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:47.210
using the following
notion, that if I pick up

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.690
an object, which was very
close to the mover event,

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:54.480
once I picked up an object, I
can do whatever I want with it.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.120
I don't have to look at it.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.990
I can manipulate it and so on.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.160
But if it's placed somewhere
and I want to pick it up,

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.895
nobody picks up
objects like this.

00:37:02.895 --> 00:37:04.270
I mean, when you
look at objects,

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.520
when you pick them up, at the
moment of making the contact

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.000
to pick them up,
you look at them.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.590
And in fact, that's a
spontaneous behavior which

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:13.980
we checked psycho-physically.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.900
You just tell
people, pick objects.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.930
You don't tell them what
you are trying to do.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.290
And they're invariably
always-- at the instant

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:24.470
of grabbing the object, making
the contact, they look at it.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.200
So if we have, already,
a mover detector,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.320
or sort of a hand detector,
or a mover detector,

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.910
that hands that are
touching objects and causing

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:33.590
them to move, all
you have to do--

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.390
whenever you take
an event like this,

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.830
it's not only useful for hands.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:40.080
But once a hand is touching
the object, this kind of mover

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.590
event, you can freeze your
video, you can take the frame.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.130
And you can know
with high precision

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:49.400
that you can-- now
the direction of gaze

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.120
is directed toward the object.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.600
So we asked people to manipulate
objects on the table and so on.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:03.000
And what we did is we ran
our previous mover detector.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.180
And let me skip the movie.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:12.590
But whenever this kind of a
detection of a hand touching

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.220
an object, making initial
contact with an object

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.390
happened, we froze the image.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.500
Unfortunately, this is
not a very good slide,

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.750
so it may be difficult to see.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.460
Maybe you can see here.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.190
So we simply drew
a vector pointing

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:31.440
from the face in the direction
of the detected grabbing event.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.730
And we assumed-- we don't know--
that's an implicit, internal,

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:36.230
imaginary supervision.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.210
Nobody checked it.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:46.704
But we grabbed the image,
and we drew the vector

00:38:46.704 --> 00:38:48.437
to the contact point.

00:38:48.437 --> 00:38:49.520
So now you have a system--

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.040
on the one hand,
we have face images

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.310
at the point where
we took the contacts.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:56.150
So here is a face.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.430
And this is a
descriptor, some way

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.920
of describing the
appearance of the face based

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.770
on local gradients.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.270
Sorry?

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.130
AUDIENCE: How do
you find the face?

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:06.505
SHIMON ULLMAN:
You assume a face.

00:39:06.505 --> 00:39:08.085
The face detector, I just left--

00:39:08.085 --> 00:39:08.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.245
SHIMON ULLMAN: Right.

00:39:09.245 --> 00:39:09.900
Right.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.330
Faces come even before--

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:15.080
I didn't talk about faces, but
faces come even beforehand.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.220
As I mentioned, the first thing
that infants look at is faces.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.960
And this is even
before the three months

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.350
that they look at hands.

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:28.680
This is to-- the current
theory is that faces,

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.860
you're born with a primitive
initial face template.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.050
There are some discussions
where the face template is.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.460
There is some evidence that
it may not be in the cortex.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.930
It may be in the amygdala.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.790
But there is some
evidence for this face.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:49.530
For manipulation of these
patterns that infants look at,

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.020
it's a very simple
template, basically

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.020
the two eyes, or something
round, with two dark blobs.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:04.290
And this makes them fixate more
on faces in a very similar way

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.270
to the handling the hands.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.580
You just-- if you do
this, from time to time,

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.940
you will end up
focusing not on a face,

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.860
but on some random
texture that has

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.490
these two blobs or something.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:17.420
But if you really
run it, then you

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.260
will get lots and
lots of face images.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:23.290
And then you'll develop a
more refined face detector.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:27.300
So babies, from day one by the
way, the way we think that--

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:31.260
the way people think it's innate
is you can work-- it is done--

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.110
experiments have been done
with the first day when

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.140
babies were born, the day one.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.310
They keep their eyes
closed most of the time.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.110
But when they are
open, they fixate.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.550
You have to make big
stimuli, because it's

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:49.410
like close-up faces, because
the acuity is still not

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.270
fully developed.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:53.280
But you can test what
they're fixating on.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.070
And they fixate
specifically on faces.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.890
And once there is a
face, they fixate on it.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.170
And the face can move, and
they will even track it.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.160
So this is day one.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:10.050
So face seems to be innate
in a stronger sense.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.210
In the case of the hand,
for example, as I said,

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.930
you cannot even imagine
building a innate hand detector

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.970
because of all this
variability in appearance.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.520
For the face, it seems that
there is an initial face

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.340
detector which gets elaborated.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.370
So we assume that there is
some kind of-- in these images,

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:30.630
we assume that when we grab
an event of contact like this,

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:33.590
the face is known, the location
of the face, the location

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:34.590
of the contact is known.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.344
And you can draw a vector
from the first to the second.

00:41:37.344 --> 00:41:38.760
And this is the
direction of gaze.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.460
And when, now, you see a
new image in which there

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.080
is no contact, you
just have the face,

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.630
and you have to decide what
is the direction of gaze,

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:49.140
you look at similar faces that
you have stored in your memory.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:54.370
And from this stored
face in memory, for this,

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:56.670
you already know from
the learning phase

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.280
what is associated
direction of gaze.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.900
And you retrieve it.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.850
And this is the kind
of things that you do.

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.490
What we see here with
the yellow arrows

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:07.650
are collected
images, which, again,

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:11.100
the direction of gaze,
the supervised direction,

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.400
has been collected, or was
collected, automatically,

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.500
by just identifying the
direction to the contact point.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.580
These are some examples.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.800
And what this shows is just
doing some psychophysics

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.660
and comparing what
this algorithm-- which

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:33.140
is sort of this infant-related
algorithm which just has

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.570
no supervision, looking
images for hands touching

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.120
things, collecting
direction of gaze,

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.640
developing a gaze detector.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.770
So the red and the green, one
is the model, the other one

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.250
is human judgment on
a similar situation.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.060
And you get good agreement.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.275
I mean, it's not perfect.

00:42:53.275 --> 00:42:54.900
It's not the state
of the art, but it's

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.090
close to state of the art.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:00.080
And this is just training
with some videos.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:04.740
I mean, this certainly does
at least as well as infants.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.530
And it keeps developing,
getting from here

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:12.700
to a better and better gaze
detector with reduced error.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.050
Well, the error is
pretty small here too.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:17.730
But you can improve it.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:23.340
That's already-- that's more of
standard additional training.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.980
But making the
first jump of being

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.160
able to deal with
this nonexistent gaze,

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.920
collecting a lot of data
without any supervision, which

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:38.640
is quite accurate, about
where the gaze is and so on,

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.300
this is supplied by, again,
this internal teaching signal

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:47.940
that can come instead of
any external supervision

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:52.050
and make it unnecessary.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.260
And you can do it without
the outside supervision.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.650
It also has, I think, some--

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:01.260
the beginning of the more
cognitive correct association,

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.460
like the hand is
associated with moving

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.030
object, direction of gaze
and going to where the--

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:14.260
following it to see what is
the object at the other end

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:15.770
and so on, this is--

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.450
gaze is associated
with attention

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:20.964
of people, what they are
interested in at the moment.

00:44:20.964 --> 00:44:22.380
So it's not just
the fact that you

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.600
connect the face with the
target object and so on.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.920
It's a good way of creating
internal supervision.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.660
But it also starts to, I think,
create the right association

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.840
that hand is associated
with manipulation and goals

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.490
of manipulating objects.

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.730
And gaze is associated
with attention,

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:46.730
and what we are paying
attention to, and so on.

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:50.880
So you can see that
you start to have--

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.290
based on this, if you
have an image like this,

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.935
and you can detect hands,
and you know, what--

00:44:55.935 --> 00:44:58.500
there's a scheme that does it.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.850
You know about hands.

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:01.800
You know about
direction of gaze.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.510
You know about-- I
didn't talk about it,

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.677
but you also follow which
objects move around.

00:45:05.677 --> 00:45:07.260
And you know which
objects are movable

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.990
and which objects
are not movable--

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.130
so a very simple scheme
that follows the chains

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.890
of processing that I described.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:18.520
So it already starts to know--

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.820
you know, it's not quite
having this full representation

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:24.400
in itself.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.930
But it's thought quite along the
way that the two agents here.

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.252
The two agents are
manipulating objects.

00:45:30.252 --> 00:45:31.710
And the one of the
left is actually

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:34.320
interested in the object that
the other one is holding.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.820
So you have all
this, the building

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.620
blocks to start build--

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.140
to start having an
internal description

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.600
along this line following
the chain of processing

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.970
that I mentioned.

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.770
And by the way, this
internal training

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.200
that one thing can train
another, if you want,

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.240
simple mover can train the hand.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.810
Mover and a hand together
can train a gaze detector.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:00.840
It turns out that gaze is
important in learning language,

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.696
in disambiguating
nouns and verbs

00:46:03.696 --> 00:46:05.070
when you learn
language, when you

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:06.510
acquire your first language.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:15.210
So this is from verb learning
for a particular experiment.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.260
But let me ignore that.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:23.000
A simple example would be
acquiring a noun that I say.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.690
I say, suddenly, oh,
look at my new blicket.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:27.600
And people have done
experiments like this.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.150
And I can say,
look at my blicket,

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.040
looking at an object
on the right side

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.000
or looking at another
object on the left side,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.100
saying exactly the
same expression.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.950
And people have shown
that infants exposed

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:43.320
to this kind of situation,
they automatically

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.870
associate the term,
the noun "blicket,"

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.990
with the object that
has been attended to.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.730
Namely, the gaze
was used in order

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:54.340
to disambiguate the reference.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.920
So you can see a nice--

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.960
starting with very low-level
internal guiding signals

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.540
of, say, moving pixels that
can tell you about hands

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.120
and about direction of gaze--
and then direction of gaze

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.990
helps you to disambiguate
the reference of words--

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.960
so these kinds of trajectories
of internal supervision

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:17.460
that can help you learn
to deal with the work.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.210
This is, to me, a part of a
larger project, which we called

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.260
the digital baby, in which we--

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.400
it's an extension of this.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.840
We really want to
understand, what

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:29.820
are all these various
innate capacities that we

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.460
are born with cognitively?

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:38.400
And we mention, here, a number
of suggested ones-- the mover,

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.500
how the mover can train a gaze,
and the core training of two

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.125
systems.

00:47:42.125 --> 00:47:45.960
And some of the things we think
that are happening innately

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.320
before we begin to learn.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:53.370
And then we would like
to be able to watch

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.760
lots and lots of sensory
input, which could be visual.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.210
It can be, in
general, non-visual.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.310
And from this, to
generate, what will

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:04.740
happen is the automatic
generation and lots

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:09.300
of understanding of the
world, concepts like hands

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.490
and intention, direction
of looking, and eventually,

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:16.790
nouns, and verbs, and so on--
so how we'll be able to do it.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:23.010
Know that it's very different
from the less structured

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:27.090
direction of deep networks,
which are interesting and are

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:28.230
doing wonderful things.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:31.090
I think that they're
a very useful tool.

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.380
But I think that they are not
the answer to the digital baby.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:41.290
They do not have the capacity
to learn interesting concepts

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:44.550
in an unsupervised way.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:45.600
They do not distinguish.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.760
They go, as I showed you
at the very beginning,

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.970
with the cats, and the
upper body, and so on.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.100
They go only for
the salient things.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.590
Gaze is not a salient thing.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.280
I mean, we have
internal signals that

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.980
allow us to zoom in
on meaningful things.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.870
Even if they are
not very salient

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:06.060
objectively in the
statistical sense,

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.210
there is something inside
us that is tuned to it.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:10.470
We are born with it.

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.720
And it guides us
towards extracting

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.970
this meaningful
information, even

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.830
if it's not all that salient.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.390
So all of these
things are missing

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:25.050
from the unstructured
net-- or the networks which

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:28.200
do not have all of this
pre-concept and internal

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:28.710
guidance.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:31.770
And I don't think that they
could provide a good model

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:36.240
for cognitive learning in this
sense of the digital baby.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:41.970
Although I can see a very useful
role for them, for example,

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:43.210
as just--

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:48.820
in answer to Doreen's question,
that if you want to then get--

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.950
from all the data and
the internal supervision

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:55.350
that you provided, you want to
get an accurate gaze detector,

00:49:55.350 --> 00:50:00.550
then training, using
supervision training

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:07.030
in appropriate deep networks
can be a very good way to go.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.679
I wanted to also show you,
this is not directly related,

00:50:09.679 --> 00:50:12.220
but it's something impressive
about the use of hands in order

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:16.070
to understand the world, just to
show you how smart infants are.

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:19.660
I talked more about
detecting the hands.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.730
It was more the
visual aspect of,

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:24.760
here is an image,
show me the hand.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.630
But how they use
it-- and this is

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.590
at the age of about one
year-- maybe 13 months,

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:33.080
but one year of age.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.120
Here's the experiment.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.210
I think it's a really
nice experiment.

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.090
This experiment was
with a experimenter.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:43.774
This is the
experimenter, one image.

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:45.190
What happened in
the experiment is

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:48.910
that there was a sort of a
lamp that you can turn the lamp

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:50.740
on by pressing it from above.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.360
It sort of has this dome shape.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.040
That's the whites in here.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.170
You press it down,
and it turns on.

00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:59.740
It shines blue light,
and it's very nice.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.420
And babies like it.

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.280
And they smile at
it, and they jiggle,

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:07.290
and they like this turning
of the bright light.

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:08.920
And during the
experiment, what happens

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.760
is that the infant is
sitting on its parent's lap.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.910
And the experimenter is on the
other side, that experimenter.

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:17.260
And she turns on the light.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.350
But she turns on the light--
instead of pressing it,

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:23.830
as you'd expect,
with her hand, she's

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.870
pressing on it
with her forehead.

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:29.110
She leans forward,
and she presses

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:33.366
the lamp, this dome,
and the light comes on.

00:51:33.366 --> 00:51:35.990
And then, these are babies that
can already manipulate objects.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:37.910
So after they see it
three or four times,

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:40.990
and they are happy seeing
the light coming on,

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:44.170
they are handed
the lamp and asked

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.990
to turn it on on their own.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:55.030
And here is the
clever manipulation.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:58.660
For half the babies,
the experimenter

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.820
had her hands concealed.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.760
She didn't have her
hands here, you see?

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.290
No hands are under this poncho.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.140
Here it's the same,
very similar thing,

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.880
but the hands are visible.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.680
Now, it turns out
that the babies--

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.590
or the in-- these are
not babies anymore.

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:16.750
These are young infants--

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:18.940
some of them, when they
were handed the lamp,

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.920
they did exactly what
the experimenter did.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.590
They bent over, and pressed
the lamp with their forehead,

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:25.630
and turned it on.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:27.940
And other children, instead
of-- although that's

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:32.290
what they saw, when they got
the lamp over to their side,

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:35.830
they turned it on by
pressing it with their hand,

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:38.650
unlike what they saw
the experimenter do.

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:42.030
Any prediction on your
side what happened--

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:45.520
you see these two situations--
when which babies--

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.580
I mean, in this case or in
this case, in which case

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:52.840
do you think they actually
did it with their hands

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.410
rather than using
their forehead?

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:54.980
Any guess?

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:55.480
Yeah?

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.874
AUDIENCE: hands in
A and no hands in B

00:52:58.874 --> 00:53:00.040
SHIMON ULLMAN: That's right.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.123
And what's your reasoning?

00:53:01.123 --> 00:53:03.566
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:03.566 --> 00:53:05.440
SHIMON ULLMAN: But you
think about, you know,

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:11.350
baby, if you saw a baby, infant,
young one-year-old just moving

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:14.950
seemingly quasi-randomly and
so on, something like that

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:17.240
went on in their
head, that here, she

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:18.820
did it with her forehead.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.470
She would have used
her hands, but she

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:22.477
couldn't, because
they were concealed,

00:53:22.477 --> 00:53:23.560
and she couldn't use them.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.840
So she used her forehead,
but that's not the right way

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.830
to do it.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:28.770
I can do it
differently and so on.

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.249
That's sort of-- they
don't say it explicitly.

00:53:31.249 --> 00:53:32.290
They don't have language.

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:35.230
But that's the kind of
reasoning that went on.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:37.300
And indeed, a much larger
proportion-- so this

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:44.360
is the proportion of using their
hands where the green, I think,

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.900
was the hand occupied.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:48.971
Or when the hands of the
experimenter is free,

00:53:48.971 --> 00:53:51.220
you see that there is a big
difference between the two

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.160
groups.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.010
So they notice the hands.

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:58.224
They ran through some kind
of inference and reasoning.

00:53:58.224 --> 00:53:59.140
What hands are useful?

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.356
Why I should do?

00:54:00.356 --> 00:54:02.230
Should I do it in the
same way because that's

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:04.100
what other people are doing?

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:05.320
Should I do it differently?

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:09.350
So I find it impressive.

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:12.760
So some general comment is--

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.840
general thoughts on learning
and the combination of learning

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:22.540
and innate
structures, that there

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:28.970
is a big sort of
argument in the field,

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:31.810
has been going on since
philosophers in ancient times,

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:36.910
whether human
cognition is learned.

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:41.950
This is nativism against
empiricism, where nativism

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:43.570
proposed that things
are basically--

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:47.540
we are born with what is
needed in order to deal

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.680
with the world.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:51.030
And empiricism in
the extreme form

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:56.690
is that we are born with a blank
slate and just a big learning

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.400
machine, maybe like
a deep network.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.370
And we learn everything from
the contingencies in the world.

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:05.780
So this is the empiricism
versus nativism.

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:08.600
In these examples, in an
interesting way, I think,

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.200
that complex concepts were
neither learned on their own

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.590
nor innate-- so for example,
we didn't have an innate hand

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:18.080
detector, but also,
it couldn't emerge

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.600
in a purely empiricist way.

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.920
But we had enough structure
inside that would not

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.500
be the final solution, but
would be the right guidance,

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:34.100
or the right infrastructure,
to make learning possible.

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.530
And this is not just a
very generic learner.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:40.130
But in this case, the
learner was informed by--

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:46.100
you know, was looking for some
mover events or things like it.

00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.710
So it's not the hands,
it was the movers.

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:52.520
And this guides the system
without supervision,

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:55.610
not only making
supervision unnecessary,

00:55:55.610 --> 00:56:00.470
but also focusing the learner on
meaningful representations, not

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:03.800
necessarily just things which
are the first things that

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:09.370
jump at you statistically
from the visual input.

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.450
So there are these kinds
of learning trajectories

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:15.590
like the mover, hand, gaze, and
reference in language, of sort

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:19.370
of natural trajectories in
which one thing leads to another

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:21.380
and help us acquire
things which would be very

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:25.100
difficult to extract otherwise.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.720
As I mentioned at
the beginning, I

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.180
think that there are some
interesting possibilities

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:34.610
for AI, as I said, to build
intelligent machines by not

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:37.300
thinking about the final
intelligence system,

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.090
but thinking about baby
system with the right internal

00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:46.730
capacities which will make
it able to then learn.

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:49.670
So the use of
learning is sort of--

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:50.840
we all follow it.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:54.480
But the point is, probably just
a big learning machine is not

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:54.980
enough.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.050
It's really the
combination of, we

00:56:57.050 --> 00:56:59.420
have to understand the
kind of internal structures

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:05.335
that allow babies to
efficiently extract information

00:57:05.335 --> 00:57:05.960
from the world.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:11.450
If we manage to put something
like this into a baby system

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:13.196
and let it interact
with the world,

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:14.570
then we have a
much higher chance

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:19.854
of starting to develop
really intelligent systems.

00:57:19.854 --> 00:57:21.270
It's interesting,
by the way, that

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:25.040
in the regional paper by Turing,
when he discusses the Turing

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.720
test and how to build--

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.410
can machines think,
he discusses the issue

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:32.300
about building
intelligent machines

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:33.920
somewhere in the future.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.190
And he says that his hunch
is that the really good way

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:40.070
of building, eventually,
intelligent computers,

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:43.850
intelligent machines
would be to build a baby

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:45.540
computer, a digital
baby, and let

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:50.530
it learn rather than
thinking about the final one.
