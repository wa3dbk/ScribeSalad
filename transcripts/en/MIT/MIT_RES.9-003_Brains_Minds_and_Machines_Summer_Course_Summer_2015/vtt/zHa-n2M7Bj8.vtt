JOSHUA TENENBAUM: So
we saw in Laura's talk

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.690
this introduction to both this
idea of the child as scientist,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.300
all the different ways that
children's learning seems

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.120
to follow the many different
practices that scientists use

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.790
to learn about the world,
not just the data analysis,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.270
in a sense.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.810
As much as various kinds of
statistics on a grand scale,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.520
whether it's Hebbian
learning or backprop

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.340
important for learning, we
know that that's not all

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.370
that children do, just like
analyzing patterns of data

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.110
is not all that scientists do.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.870
And then Laura added this
other cool dimension,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.636
thinking about the costs
and rewards of information,

00:00:57.636 --> 00:00:58.760
when is it worth it or not.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.410
And you could say, maybe she
was suggesting that we should

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.170
develop the metaphor, expand
it a little bit from child

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.010
as scientist to maybe like the
child as-- oh, oops, sorry--

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.660
lab PI or maybe even
NSF center director.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.610
Because as everyone
knows, but Tommy certainly

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.120
can tell you, whether you're a
lab PI who's just gotten tenure

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.740
or the director
of an NSF Center,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.200
you have to make hard-nosed
pragmatic decisions

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.360
about what is achievable
given the costs

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.520
and which research
questions are really worth

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.420
going after and devoting your
time and other resources to.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.617
And that's a very
important part of science.

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:35.700
And it's an important part
of intuitive knowledge.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.790
I want to add another
practical dimension

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.200
to things, a way of
bringing out, fleshing out

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.020
this idea of the
child as scientist.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.300
You can think about all
these, these are metaphors.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.160
But they're things
that we can formalize.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.350
And if our goal is to make
computational models of

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.370
and ultimately to get some
kind of theoretical handle on,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.750
then these are helping us.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.910
By adding in the
costs and benefits,

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.227
you bring in utility calculus.

00:02:01.227 --> 00:02:03.060
And there's not just
naive utility calculus,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.610
there's a formal
mathematical utility calculus

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.110
of these kinds of decisions.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.914
Julian Jara-Ettinger,
who Laura mentioned,

00:02:09.914 --> 00:02:12.330
was driving a lot of the work
towards the end of the talk,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.450
has done some really
interesting actual mathematical

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.010
computational models
of these issues,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.070
as has [? Choi ?] and the other
students you talked about.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.320
So the direction I
want to push here

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.320
is what you might call
the child as hacker.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.360
This is trying to make
the connection back

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.590
to this idea of formalizing
common sense knowledge

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.230
and intuitive theories as
probabilistic programs.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.230
Or just more generally,
the idea of a program--

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.910
a structured
algorithm and a dat--

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.560
or some combination
of algorithms,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.780
data structures,
networks of functions

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.770
that can scribe interesting
causal processes in the world,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.950
like, for example
your intuitive physics

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.960
or your intuitive psychology.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.780
That's an idea that we
talked a lot about last week

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.480
or whenever it was, earlier
in the week or last week.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.590
And this idea that
if your knowledge is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.160
something like a program, or a
set of programs, that you can,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.250
say, for example, run
forward to simulate physics,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.530
like we had last
time, then learning

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.549
has to be something like
building a program or hacking.

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.840
And I think you could make--
this is, again, a research

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.722
program that I wish I had.

00:03:20.722 --> 00:03:22.680
Like Laura talked to the
end about the research

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.810
she wished she had.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.380
It's not really
just a wish for her.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.630
She actually is working
towards that research program.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.519
And this isn't just
an empty wish either.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.060
It's something that
we're working on,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.660
which is to try to take--

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.340
just as Laura had
that wonderful list

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.040
of all the things scientists
do in their practices

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.020
to learn about
the world, I think

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.210
you could make a similar
list of all the things

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.820
that you do in your
programming or hacking.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.550
By hacking I don't mean like
breaking into a secure system,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.660
but modifying your code
to make it more awesome.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.160
And I use awesome
very deliberately,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.440
because awesome is a
multi-dimensional term.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.190
It's just awesome.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.550
But it could be faster, more
accurate, more efficient,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.310
more elegant, more
generalizable,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.170
more easily communicated
to other people,

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.020
more easily modularly
combined with other code

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.989
to do something
even more awesome.

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.530
I think there's a
deep sense in which

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.430
that aesthetic behind hacking
and making awesome code,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.769
in both an individual and
a social setting, that's

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.597
a really powerful way
to think about many

00:04:18.597 --> 00:04:20.430
of the cognitive
activities behind learning.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.360
And it goes together with the
idea of the child as scientist

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.110
if the form of your,
quote, "intuitive science"

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.400
are computer programs or
something like programs.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.137
So we've been working
on a few projects

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:33.970
where we've been trying
to capture this idea

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.970
and to say, well, what
would it mean to describe

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.710
computationally this idea of
learning as either synthesizing

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.760
programs, or modifying
programs, or making more

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.410
awesome programs in your mind.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.360
And I'll just show you
a few examples of this.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.180
I'll show you our good, our
successful case studies,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.100
places where we've
made this idea work.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.020
But the bottom line
to foreshadow it

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.670
is that this is
really, really hard.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.030
And to get it to work for
the kinds of knowledge

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.150
that, say, Laura
was talking about

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.137
or that Liz was talking
about, the real stuff

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:07.220
of children's knowledge,
is still very, very open.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.770
And we want to,
basically, build up

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.770
to engaging why that
problem is so hard.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.290
From this to what Tomer and
then Laura will talk about later

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.960
on in the afternoon.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.700
But here's a few at least
early success stories

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.140
that we've worked on.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.090
One goes back to this idea
that I presented in my lectures

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.530
last week.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.120
And it connects to,
again, something

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.036
that Laura was saying.

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:31.820
Here, a very basic
kind of learning.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.950
It's just the
problem of learning

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.106
some generalizable concepts at
all from very sparse evidence.

00:05:38.106 --> 00:05:39.980
Like one-shot learning--
again, something you

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.630
heard from Tommy, a number
of the other speakers.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.796
We've all been trying to
wrap our heads around this.

00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:45.680
How can you learn,
say, any concept

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.050
at all from very,
very little data,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.660
maybe just one or
a few examples.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.120
So you saw this kind
of thing last time.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.870
And I briefly
mentioned how we had

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.100
tried to capture this problem
as something like this

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.590
by building this tree
structured hypothesis space.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.272
And you could think of this as
a kind of program induction.

00:06:03.272 --> 00:06:04.730
If you think that
there's something

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.460
like an evolutionary program
which generated these objects,

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.340
and you're trying to find
the sub procedure of it

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.790
that generated just
these kinds of objects.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.620
But that's not at all how
we were able to model this.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.360
We had a much simpler model.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.404
But let me show you briefly some
work that we did in our group

00:06:20.404 --> 00:06:21.320
a couple of years ago.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.050
It's really just getting
out into publication now.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.680
This is work that was
mostly done by two people--

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.881
Ruslan Salakhutdinov, who is
now a professor at Toronto,

00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:32.630
although about to move
to Carnegie Mellon,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.610
I think, and Brenden Lake.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.280
He's a machine learning
person, also very well known

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.226
for deep learning.

00:06:38.226 --> 00:06:40.100
And then Brenden Lake--
this is really mostly

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.320
what I'll talk about
is Brenden Lake's work,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.110
who is now a post-doc at NYU.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.310
And again, where we think
we're building up to

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.590
is trying to learn
something like the program

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.810
of an intuitive physics
or intuitive psychology.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.770
But here we're just talking
about learning object concepts.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.520
And we've been doing
this work with a data

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.360
set of handwritten characters,
the ones you see on the right

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.120
here.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.390
I'll just put it up in
contrast or by comparison

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.910
to, say, this other much
more famous data set

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.220
of handwritten characters,
the MNIST data set.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.710
How many people have seen
the MNIST data set, maybe

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.510
in some of the previous talks?

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.600
How many people have
actually used it?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.460
Yeah, it's a great
data set to use.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.890
It's driven a lot of basic
machine learning research,

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.590
including deep learning.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.470
Yann LeCun originally
collected this data

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.650
set and put this out there.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.140
And Geoffrey Hinton did
most of the development.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.450
The stuff that now wins
object recognition challenges

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.920
was done on this data set.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.760
But not only that.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.490
Also a lot of Bayesian
stuff and probabilistic

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.710
generative models.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.820
Now, the thing
about that data set,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.180
though, is it has a very
small number of classes, just

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.960
the digits 0 through 9, and
a huge number of examples,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.245
roughly 10,000
examples in each class

00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:50.289
or maybe 6,000 examples,
something like that.

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:51.830
But we wanted to
construct a data set

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.370
which was similar in some ways
in its complexity and scale,

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.260
but where we had many, many
more concepts and, perhaps, many

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.950
fewer examples.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.740
So here we got people to
write by hand characters in 50

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.747
different alphabets.

00:08:07.747 --> 00:08:09.080
And it's a really cool data set.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.129
So that total data set
has 1,623 concepts drawn.

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:15.920
You could call them
handwritten characters.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.210
You could just call them
simple visual concepts

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.890
as a sort of a warm
up for bigger problems

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.390
of, say, natural objects.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.180
And there's 20
examples per class.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.260
So there's roughly
30,000 total data points

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.590
in this data set,
very much like MNIST.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.373
You can see, just
to illustrate here,

00:08:36.373 --> 00:08:39.039
there's many different alphabets
that have very different forms.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.010
You can see both the
similarities and differences

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.732
between alphabets here.

00:08:45.732 --> 00:08:48.190
So in that sense, there's kind
of a hierarchical structure.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.480
Each one of these is a
character in an alphabet.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.370
But there's also the
higher level concept

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.560
of a sort of a Sanskrit
form, as distinct

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.571
from, say, to Gaelic,
or Hebrew, or Braille.

00:08:57.571 --> 00:08:58.820
There's some made-up alphabet.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.250
But one of the neat
things about this domain

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.980
is that you can make
up new concepts,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.590
and you can make up whole
concepts of concepts,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.990
like whole new alphabets.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.820
You can do one-shot
learning in it.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.670
So let's just try this
out here for a second.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.070
You remember the tufa demo.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.653
We can do the same
kind of thing here.

00:09:17.653 --> 00:09:19.820
Like let's take
these characters.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.440
Anybody know the
alphabet that this is?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.270
OK, that's good.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.010
Most of you have not
seen these before.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.600
That's good that you know.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.750
But we'll do this experiment
run on the rest of you.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.570
So here's one
example of a concept.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.760
Call it a tufa if you like.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.080
And I'll just run my mouse
over these other ones.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.830
And you just clap when I
get to the other example

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.170
of the same class, OK?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.450
[SOUND OF CLAPS]

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.570
OK, very good.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.140
Yeah, people are,
basically, perfect at this.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.940
It doesn't take--
I mean, again, it's

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.480
very fast and almost perfect.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.784
And again, you saw me talk a
little about this last time.

00:10:05.784 --> 00:10:07.450
Just like with natural
objects, not only

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.730
can you learn one of these
concepts from one example

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.230
and generalize it
to others, but you

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.630
can use that knowledge
in various other ways.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.080
So you can parse these
things into parts.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.830
We think that's part
of what you're doing.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.577
You can generate new examples.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.160
So here are three
different people all

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.600
drawing the same character.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.240
And in fact, the whole data
set was generated that way.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.370
You can also make higher
level generalizations,

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.040
recombining the parts
into totally new concepts,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.820
the way there's that weird
kind of like unicycle thing

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.010
over there, unimotorcycle.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.320
Here, I can show
you, as you'll see

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.510
10 characters in a
new alphabet, and you

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.610
can make up hypothetical,
if, perhaps,

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.505
incorrect examples in it.

00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:45.880
Again, I'm just
going to show you

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.260
a couple of case
studies of where

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.150
this idea of learning as
program synthesis might work.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.060
So the idea here is
that, as you might see,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.740
these are three characters
down on the bottom.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.460
And this is just a
very schematic diagram

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.920
of how our model tries to
represent these as simple kinds

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.150
of programs.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.500
Think about how you would
draw, say, that character down

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.083
to the bottom.

00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:13.270
Just try to draw it in midair.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.990
How would you draw that one
in the lower left there?

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.265
Are many of you doing
something like this?

00:11:19.265 --> 00:11:20.390
Is that what you are doing?

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:20.890
OK, yeah.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.780
So basically,
everyone does that.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.180
And you can describe
that as sort

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.469
of having two large
parts or two strokes,

00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:29.260
where you pick up your
pen between strokes.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.060
And one of the strokes
has two sub strokes,

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.410
where you stop your pen.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.250
And there's a
consistent relationship.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.400
The second stroke has
to begin somewhere

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.310
on a particular general
region of the first stroke.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.780
And basically, that's the
model's representation

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.800
of concepts-- part, subparts,
and simple relations-- which,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.720
you can see, it might
scale up, arguably,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.110
to more interesting
kinds of natural objects.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.630
And the basic idea is that
you represent that, though,

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.557
as a program.

00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:54.640
It's a generative program.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.532
It's kind of like
a motor program.

00:11:56.532 --> 00:11:57.490
But it's more abstract.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.650
We think that when you
see these characters

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.230
and many other concepts,
you represent something

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.792
about how you might create it.

00:12:03.792 --> 00:12:05.500
But it doesn't mean
it's in your muscles.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.180
You could use other hands.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.440
You could use your toe.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.350
Or you could even just think
about it in your imagination.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.350
So the model, basically,
tries to induce these simple--

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.810
think about them as maybe
simple hierarchical plans,

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.520
simple action programs.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.650
And it does it by having
a program generating

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.830
program that can
itself have parameters

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.400
that can be learned from data.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.410
So this right here, this is a
program called GenerateType.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.050
And what that does
is it's a program--

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.700
a type means a
character concept,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.070
like each of those three
things is a different type.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.620
This is a program which
generates a program that

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.690
generates the actual character.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.810
The second level of program
is called GenerateToken.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.030
That's a program which
draws a particular instance

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.110
of a character.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.470
And just like you can draw
many examples of any concept,

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.390
you can call that
function many times--

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.730
GenerateToken,
GenerateToken, GenerateToken.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.460
So your concept of a character
is a generative function.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.500
And in order to learn
this, you have, basically,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.380
a prior on those programs that
comes from a program generating

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.130
program.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.187
That's the GenerateType program.

00:13:05.187 --> 00:13:07.270
So there's a lot of details
behind how this works.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.240
But basically, the
model does a kind

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.330
of learning to learn up from
a held out unsupervised set

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.010
and learns the parameters
of this program generating

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.690
program, which
would characterize

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.690
how we draw things in
general, what characters look

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.650
like in general.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.005
And then, when you see a new
character, like this one,

00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:28.630
effectively, what
the model is doing is

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.930
it's both parsing this into
its parts, and subparts,

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:32.740
and relations.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.406
But that parsing is, basically,
the program synthesis.

00:13:36.406 --> 00:13:37.780
It is pretty much
the same thing.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.238
You're constructing,
you're looking

00:13:39.238 --> 00:13:41.320
at that output of some
program and saying, what

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.360
would be the best simple
set of parts, and subparts,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.330
and relations that
could draw that?

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.520
And then I'm going to
infer the most likely one,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.710
and then use that as a
generalizable template

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.640
or program I can then generate
other characters with.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.090
So here, maybe to just
illustrate really concretely,

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.300
if you were to see
this character here--

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.470
well, here's one
instance of one class.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.970
Here's an instance
of another class.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.790
Again, I have no idea
which alphabet this is.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.831
Now, what about this one?

00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:09.140
Is it class 1 or class 2?

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.790
What do you think?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.620
1, yeah.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.341
Anybody think it's class 2?

00:14:13.341 --> 00:14:13.840
OK.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.210
So how do we know it's class 1?

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.293
Well, at the pixel level,
it doesn't look anything

00:14:17.293 --> 00:14:18.280
like that.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.410
So this is, again, an
example of some of the issues

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.534
that Tommy was talking
about-- a really severe kind

00:14:22.534 --> 00:14:23.260
of invariance.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.762
But it's not just translation
or scale invariance,

00:14:25.762 --> 00:14:27.220
although it does
have some of that.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.440
But it also has this kind
of interesting within-class

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.261
invariance.

00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:31.510
It's a rather different shape.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.800
It's been distorted somewhat.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.450
For a program,
there's a powerful way

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.370
to capture that where
you can say, well

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.450
if you would do something
like the program

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.270
for generating this, which
is like one stroke like that

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.030
and then these other two things
shown with the red and green,

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.300
and here's a program that you
might induce to generate that.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.820
And then the question is,
which of these two programs,

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.920
simple hierarchical
motor programs,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.370
is most likely to
generate that character?

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.390
Now, it turns out that
it's incredibly unlikely

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.710
to generate any character
from one of these programs.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.900
These are the log scores,
the log probabilities.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.960
So this one is like 2
to the negative 758.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.110
And this one is like 2
to the negative 1,880.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.340
I don't know if it's base e.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.960
It's maybe 2 or e, but whatever.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.670
So each of these is very small.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.010
But this one is like
1,000 orders of magnitude

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.484
more likely than that one.

00:15:21.484 --> 00:15:22.650
And that makes sense, right?

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.780
It just is easier
to think intuitively

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.660
about generating this
shape from that distortion.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.060
So that's basically
what the system does.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.640
And it's able to do
this remarkable thing

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.030
that you were able to do
too-- this one-shot learning

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.672
of a concept.

00:15:35.672 --> 00:15:37.380
Here's just another
illustration of this.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.969
We show people one
example of a new character

00:15:39.969 --> 00:15:41.760
in an alphabet they
don't know and ask them

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.930
to pick out the other one.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.385
Everybody see where it is here?

00:15:44.385 --> 00:15:48.800
It's not that easy,
but it's doable.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.820
Down here, right.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.862
So people are better
than 95% correct at this.

00:15:53.862 --> 00:15:54.820
This is the error rate.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.540
So the error rate
is less than 5%

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.090
for humans and also
for this model.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:03.720
But for a range of more
standard deep learning models,

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.410
this one here is, basically,
like an image net or MNIST type

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.910
1.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.300
So this is the
kind of model that

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.710
was really sort of massive
convolutional classifier.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.406
The best deep learning
one is actually

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.530
something for this problem.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.600
It's what's called
a Siamese ConvNet.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.040
And that can do somewhat better.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.430
But it's still more than
twice as bad as people.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.290
So we think this
is one place where,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.340
at least in a hard
classification problem,

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.790
you can see that deep learning
still isn't quite there.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.090
Whereas this-- even
the best thing-- this

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.490
was a network that was,
basically, specifically worked

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.770
out by one of Ruslan's
students for about a year

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.740
to solve exactly this
problem on this data set.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.640
And it substantially improved
over a standard deep learning

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.210
classifier, which
substantially improved

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.920
over a different
deep learning model

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.030
that Ruslan and
I both worked on.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.071
So there's definitely been
some improvement here.

00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:53.930
And never bet against
deep learning.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.690
I can't guarantee that somebody
sets, spends their PhD.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.420
They could work out something
that could do this well.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.310
But still, it's a case which
still has some room to push,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.990
where, for example,
just a pure pattern

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.609
recognition approach might go.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.532
But maybe more
interesting is, again,

00:17:09.532 --> 00:17:11.990
going back to all the things
we use our knowledge for, kids

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.800
might use our knowledge for.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.300
As we don't just
classify the world.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.082
We understand it.

00:17:15.082 --> 00:17:16.040
We generate new things.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.579
We imagine new things.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:21.740
So here's a place where you
can use your generative program

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.430
that none of these networks
do, at least by nature.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.119
Maybe you could think of some
way to get them to do it.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.140
And this is to say,
not just classify,

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.056
but to produce,
imagine new examples.

00:17:33.056 --> 00:17:34.430
So here's an
illustration of this

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.840
where we gave people an example
of one of these new concepts.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.900
And then we said, draw another
example of the same concept.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.890
Don't just copy it.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.370
Make up another
example of the concept.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.160
And what you can see here
is a set of nine examples

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.920
that nine different people
did in response to that query.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.900
And then you can also
see on the other side

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.810
nine examples of our
program doing that.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.310
Can anybody tell
which is the people

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:01.040
and which is the program?

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.130
Let's try this out.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.269
So which is the machine for
this character, the left

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:05.810
or the right?

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:06.960
How many people say the left?

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.626
Raise your hand.

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:09.620
How many people say the right?

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.300
About 50-50, very good.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.260
How many people say this is
the machine for this one?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.900
How many people say
this is the machine?

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.240
May be slight preference there.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.080
How many people say
this is the machine?

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.210
How many people say
this is the machine?

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.535
How many people say
this is the machine?

00:18:25.535 --> 00:18:26.910
Some people really
like the left.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.535
How many people say
that's the machine?

00:18:28.535 --> 00:18:30.250
Basically, it's 50/50
for all of them.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.850
Here's the right answer.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.183
I don't know, you could decide
if you were right or not.

00:18:34.183 --> 00:18:34.849
I don't know,

00:18:34.849 --> 00:18:35.640
Here's another set.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.750
Again, I hope it's clear that
this is not an easy task.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.810
And in fact, people are,
basically, at chance.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.610
We've done a bunch
of studies of this.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:46.180
And most people just can't tell.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.220
People on average are
about 50% correct.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.970
You basically just can't tell.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.150
So it's an example of
a kind of Turing test

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.520
that a certain interesting
program learning

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.140
program is solving.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.720
At the level that's
confusable with humans,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.020
this system is able to
learn simple programs

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.010
for visual concepts.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.680
And not just classify but use
them to create new things.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.942
You can even create new
things at this higher level

00:19:07.942 --> 00:19:08.650
that I mentioned.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.960
So here, the task, which,
again, people and machines

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.240
are roughly similar on, is
to be given 10 examples each

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.070
of a different concept
in a higher level

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.530
concept, like an alphabet,
and then draw new characters

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.439
in that alphabet.

00:19:21.439 --> 00:19:23.480
And we give people only
a few seconds to do this.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.240
So they don't get too artistic.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.650
But again, you can see that
machine is able to do this.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.250
People are also kind of similar.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.430
So let me say,
that was a success

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.980
story, a place for the idea of
learning as program induction

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:36.580
kind of works.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.620
What about something more
like what we're really

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.060
most deeply interested in--

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.140
children's learning?

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.990
Like the ability, for
example, to, say, understand

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.370
goal-directed action.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.170
These cases we've
talked a lot about.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.820
Or intuitive physics-- again,
cases we've talked about.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.430
And it's part of
our research program

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.920
for this center, something
we'd love all of you guys,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.810
if you're interested,
to help work on.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.930
It's a very big problem.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.380
It's how do you characterize
the knowledge that kids

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.660
are learning over the first
few years and the learning

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.850
mechanisms that
build it, which we'd

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.010
like to think of in
some similar way.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.730
Like could we say there's
some intuitive physics program

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.760
and intuitive physics
program learning programs

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.120
that are building out knowledge
for these kinds of problems?

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.729
And we don't know how to do it.

00:20:17.729 --> 00:20:19.270
But again, here are
some of the steps

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.436
we've been starting to take.

00:20:20.436 --> 00:20:22.745
So this is work that Tomer
did as part of his PhD,

00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:24.370
and it's something
that he's continuing

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.270
to do with Liz and others
as part of his post-doc.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.680
So we're showing people--

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.450
again, it's much like what you
saw from me and from Laura.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.180
We're really interested in
learning from sparse data.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.330
Because all the data
is sparse in a sense.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.264
But in the lab, you push
things to the limit.

00:20:43.264 --> 00:20:44.680
So you study really
sparse things,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.930
like one-shot learning
of a visual concept.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.680
Or here, this is like we've
been interested in what can you

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.080
learn about the laws
of physics from just

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.190
watching that for five seconds.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.660
So we show people
videos like this.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.180
Think of this as like you're
watching hockey pucks on an air

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:01.750
hockey table.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.470
So it's like an overhead view
of some things bouncing around.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.830
And you can see
that they're kind

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.150
of Newtonian in some sense.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.710
They bounce off of each other.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.950
Looks like there's some
inertia, inertial collisions.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.492
But you might
notice that there's

00:21:16.492 --> 00:21:17.950
some other interesting
things going

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.226
on that are not
just F equals m a,

00:21:20.226 --> 00:21:21.850
like other interesting
kinds of forces.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.058
And I'll show you other ones.

00:21:23.058 --> 00:21:26.230
Tomer made a whole awesome
set of these movies.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.880
Hopefully, you've got some
idea of what's going on there.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.630
Like interesting forces of
attraction, and, repulsion,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.900
different kinds of things.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.552
So here, each of those can
be described as a program.

00:21:35.552 --> 00:21:37.760
And here's a program generating
program, if you like.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:43.109
So the same kind of idea, just
as in the handwritten character

00:21:43.109 --> 00:21:43.900
model I showed you.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.483
It's not like it's learning in
a blank slate way from scratch.

00:21:46.483 --> 00:21:49.120
It knows about objects,
parts, and subparts.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.532
What it has to learn
is, in this domain

00:21:51.532 --> 00:21:52.990
of handwritten
characters, what are

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.689
the parts and relations like.

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:56.230
And then for the
particular new thing

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.040
you're learning, like this
particular new concept,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.873
what are its particular
parts and relations.

00:21:59.873 --> 00:22:01.910
So there's these several
levels of learning

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.960
where the big picture of objects
and parts is not learned.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.780
And then the specifics
for this domain

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:13.450
of handwritten characters, the
idea of what strokes look like.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.336
That's learned from sort
of a background set.

00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:17.710
And then your ability to do
one-shot learning or learning

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.884
from very sparse
data of a new concept

00:22:19.884 --> 00:22:22.300
takes all that prior knowledge,
some of which is wired in,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.980
some of which is
previously learned,

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.690
and brings it to
bear to generate

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.090
a new program very sparsely.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.910
So you have the same
kind of thing here.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.970
We were wiring in,
in a sense, F equals

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.700
m a, the most general
laws of physics.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.190
And then we're also wiring
in sort of the possibility

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.580
that there could be kinds
of things and forces

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.920
that they exert on each
other, as some kinds of things

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.560
exert other kinds
of forces on others.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.310
And that there could
be latent properties,

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.990
things like mass and friction.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.090
And then what the
model is trying to do

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.966
is, basically, to learn about
these particular properties.

00:22:51.966 --> 00:22:53.590
What's the mass of
this kind of object?

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.720
What's the friction of
this kind of surface?

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.150
Which objects exert which
kind of forces on each other?

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.180
Is there something like
gravity blowing everything

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.680
to the left, or
the right, or down?

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.590
What this is showing
here is the same kind

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.150
of plots we saw
from me last time.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.400
It's a plot of
people versus model,

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.467
based on a whole bunch
of different conditions

00:23:12.467 --> 00:23:13.300
of the sort you saw.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.920
People are judging these
different physical properties.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.990
And they're making
greater judgments

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.240
of how likely it is,
basically, to have one

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.560
of these properties or another.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.180
And there's the model on the
x-axis, people on the y-axis.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.590
And what you can see is
a sort of OK decent fit.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:32.630
We characterize this experiment
as a kind of a mixed success.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.130
I mean, it's sort
of shocking people

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:35.060
can learn anything at all.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.800
Like how much could you learn
about the laws of physics

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.600
from five seconds
of observation?

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.550
Well, it's also kind
of shocking that Newton

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.784
could learn about the laws of
physics by just looking at,

00:23:43.784 --> 00:23:45.950
you know, in the history
of the universe, about five

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.692
seconds or less worth of data
that people had collected

00:23:49.692 --> 00:23:50.900
for the planets going around.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.930
So it is the nature of both
science and intuitive theory

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.590
building that you can get
so much from so little.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.992
But people are not Newton here.

00:23:58.992 --> 00:24:00.200
They're just using intuition.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.491
They're making quick responses.

00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:02.266
And they're OK.

00:24:02.266 --> 00:24:04.640
There's a correlation, but
it's not perfect by any means.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.140
One of the things that
we're working on right

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.850
now is looking at,
say, what happens

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.391
if you can, unlike, say, Newton,
go in and actually intervene

00:24:10.391 --> 00:24:11.900
and push these planets around.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.460
Hopefully you'll do better.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.050
But stay tuned for that.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.780
The basic thing here, though, is
that people can learn something

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.540
from this.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.280
But the way our model works is
it's not very satisfying for us

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.100
as a view of kind of
program induction or program

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:25.670
construction.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.860
Because we think it just
knows too much or has,

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.990
basically, all the
form of the program.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.790
And it's estimating
some parameters.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.126
It's like one of the things
you do as a hacker, as a coder,

00:24:35.126 --> 00:24:37.250
is you have your code and
you tune some parameters.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.770
Or you try to decide if this
function is the right one

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.470
to use or that one.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.160
And this is doing that.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.710
But nowhere is this like
actually writing new code,

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:46.575
in a sense.

00:24:46.575 --> 00:24:48.200
And that's just the
really hard problem

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.922
that I wanted to mostly
leave you with and set up

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:53.380
going what we're going to do
for the rest of the afternoon.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.990
Like if you wanted to not
just tune the parameters

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.000
and figure out the strength or
existence of different forces,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.260
but actually write the form of
laws, how would you do this?

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.100
What's the right
hypothesis space?

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.390
So you'd need programs that
don't just generate programs

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.336
but actually write the
code of them in a sense.

00:25:11.336 --> 00:25:12.710
And what's an
effective algorithm

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.197
for searching the space
of these theories?

00:25:15.197 --> 00:25:16.280
It's very, very difficult.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.170
I think, Tomer, are you going
to show this figure at all?

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.300
Yes, so mostly I'll
leave this to Tomer.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.410
But there's a very
striking contrast

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:28.580
between the nice optimization
landscapes for, say,

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.990
neural networks or most
any standard scalable

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.120
machine learning
algorithm, whether it's

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.980
trained by gradient
descent or convex

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.280
optimization, and the kinds
of landscapes for optimization

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.100
and search that you have if
you're trying to generate

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.110
a space of programs.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.350
If you want to see our early
attempts to try to do something

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.360
like learning the
form of a program,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.610
look, for example, at stuff
that Charles Kemp did.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.530
Part of his thesis
that was published

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.190
in PNAS a few years ago,
where he tried to generate

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.450
or, basically, have--

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.850
think of generative
grammars for graphs.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.730
Think about the problem--
so Laura mentioned Darwin.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.880
How did Darwin figure out
something about evolution

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.160
without understanding
any of the mechanisms?

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.520
Or the more basic problem
of figuring out that species

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.680
should be generated by
some kind of branching tree

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.840
process versus other kinds.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.230
Remember last time when I
talked about various kinds

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.150
of structured
probabilistic models, tree

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.450
structures, or spaces, or
chains for threshold reasoning.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.150
So Charles did some
really nice work,

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:32.540
basically trying to use the
idea of a program for generating

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.800
graphical models, like there's
a grammar that grows out graphs.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.190
And he showed how
you could take data

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.590
drawn from different domains,
like, say, those data sets

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.330
you saw before of animals
and their properties.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.780
We spent an hour
on that last time.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.780
So Charles showed how you
could induce not only a tree

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.330
structure but the higher level
fact that there is a tree

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.260
structure.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.560
Namely, a rule that
generates trees

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.180
being the right
abstract principle

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.150
to, say, give you the structure
of species in biology,

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.617
whereas other rules
would generate

00:27:04.617 --> 00:27:05.700
other kinds of structures.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.270
So for example, he took
similar data matrices

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.520
for how Supreme
Court judges voted

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.200
and was able to
infer a left-right,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.120
liberal-conservative spectrum.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.150
Or data from the proximities
between cities and figure

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.810
out a sort of cylinder,
like latitude and longitude

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.840
map of the world just from
the distances between cities.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.440
Or take faces and figure
out a low dimensional space

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.390
as the right way to
think about faces.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.190
So in some sense,
this was really cool.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.410
We were really excited.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.560
Oh, hey, we have a way to learn
these simple programs which

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.250
generate structures, which
themselves generate the data.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:41.660
It's where that idea
of hierarchical Bayes

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.120
meets up with this idea
of program induction

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.090
or learning a program.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.110
And it even captured--

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.800
OK, this is really the
last slide I'll show.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.730
It even captured
something which captured

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.220
all of our imaginations.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.720
We use this phrase "the blessing
of abstraction" to tie back

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.920
into one more theme of Laura's,
which is this idea that when

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.170
kids are building up
abstract concepts,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.210
there's a sense
in which, unlike,

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.840
say, a lot of maybe traditional
machine learning methods

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.760
or a lot of traditional
ideas and philosophy

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.625
about the origins of
abstract knowledge,

00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:14.750
it's not like you just get
the concrete stuff first

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.630
and layer on the
more abstract stuff.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.700
There's a sense
often, in children's

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.979
learning as in science, in which
the big picture comes in first.

00:28:21.979 --> 00:28:23.770
The abstract idea comes
there, and then you

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.250
fill in the details.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.729
So for example,
Darwin figured out,

00:28:27.729 --> 00:28:29.020
in some sense, the big picture.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.436
He figured out the
idea that there

00:28:30.436 --> 00:28:32.840
was some kind of branching
process that generated species

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.820
that was random.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.380
Not a nice perfect Linnean
seven-layer hierarchy

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.220
but some kind of random
branching process.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.380
And he didn't know
what the mechanisms

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.580
were that gave rise to it.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.800
And similarly, Newton
figured out something

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.922
about the law of gravitation
and everything else in his laws,

00:28:47.922 --> 00:28:49.630
though he didn't know
the mechanisms that

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.007
gave rise to gravity.

00:28:51.007 --> 00:28:52.090
And he didn't even know g.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.589
He didn't even know the value
of the gravitational constant.

00:28:54.589 --> 00:28:56.770
That couldn't be estimated
for 100 years later.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.299
But somehow he was able
to get the abstract form.

00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:01.090
And these nice things
that Charles Kemp did

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.180
were also able to do that.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.930
So for example, from
very little data,

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.330
to figure out that animals
should be generated

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.040
by some kind of
a tree structure,

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.690
as opposed to, say,
the simpler model

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.610
of just a bunch
of flat clusters.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.590
That model was able
to figure that out,

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.910
over here on the right,
from just a small fraction

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:17.410
of the data.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.120
And then with all
the rest of the data,

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.449
it was able to figure out
the right tree in a sense.

00:29:21.449 --> 00:29:23.490
And we called this "the
blessing of abstraction,"

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:27.190
this idea that often, in these
hierarchical program learning

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.140
programs, you could
get the high level

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.112
idea before you got
the lower level idea

00:29:31.112 --> 00:29:32.320
and then fill in the details.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.140
And I still think there's
something fundamentally right

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.250
about this idea of
children's learning,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.890
both representationally
and mechanistically.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.900
And that this dynamics
of sometimes getting

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.750
the big picture first and using
that as a constraint to fill

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:49.540
in the details is
fundamentally right.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.270
But actually,
understanding how this--

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.790
either algorithmically-- how
to search the space of programs

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.100
for anything that looks like
an intuitive causal theory

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.379
of physics and relate
that to the dynamics

00:29:59.379 --> 00:30:00.670
of how children actually learn.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.190
That's the big open question
that I will now hand over

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.630
to our other speakers.
