STEFANIE TELLEX: So today I'm
going to talk about human robot

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.920
collaboration.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.767
How can we make robots that can
work together with people just

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:30.350
as if they were
another person and try

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.620
to achieve this kind of fluid
dynamic that people have

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.820
when they work together?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.470
These are my human
collaborators.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.900
This work is done by a lot
of collaborative students

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.490
and postdocs.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.460
So we're really in an
exciting time in robotics

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.670
because robots are becoming
more and more capable

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.770
and they're able to operate
in one structured environment.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.920
Russ gave a great
talk about Atlas

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.517
doing things like driving
a car and opening doors.

00:00:55.517 --> 00:00:57.350
This is another robot
that I've worked with.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.260
A robotic forklift that can
drive around autonomously

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.880
in warehouse environments.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.360
It can detect where pallets are,
track people, pick things up,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.650
put things down.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.810
And it's designed to do
this in collaboration

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.330
with people who also
share the environment.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.580
There's robots that can
assemble IKEA furniture.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.040
This was Ross Knepper
and Daniela Rus

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.200
at MIT that I worked
with to do this.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.340
So they made this team of
robots that can autonomously

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.920
assemble tables and chairs
that are produced by IKEA.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.570
And what would be
nice is if people

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.770
can work with these robots.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.540
Sometimes they
encounter failures,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.280
and the person might
be able to intervene

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.730
in a way that enables the
robot to recover from failure.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.460
And kind of the dream
is robots that operate

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.082
in household environments.

00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:44.540
So this is my son when he was
about nine months old when we

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.720
shot this picture with a PR2.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.725
You'd really like
to imagine a robot--

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:52.100
Rosie the robot from the
Jetsons that lives in your house

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.110
with you and helps you
in all kinds of ways.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.530
Anything from doing the laundry
to cleaning up your room,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.520
emptying the dishwasher,
helping you cook.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.150
And this could have
applications for people

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.320
in all aspects of life.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.005
Elders, people who are
disabled, or even people

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:07.880
who are really busy and
don't feel like doing

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.340
all the chores in their house.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.340
So the aim of my
research program

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.670
is to enable humans and
robots to collaborate together

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.680
on complex tasks.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.500
And I'm going to talk about
the three big problems

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.600
that I think we need to
solve to make this happen.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.690
So the first problem
is that you need

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.960
to be able to have a robot that
can robustly perform actions

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.292
in real-world environments.

00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:34.500
And we're seeing more and
more progress in this area,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.030
but the house is kind of
like this grand challenge.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.247
And John was talking about
kind of all these edge cases.

00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:42.830
So I'm going to talk
about an approach

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.370
that we're taking
to try to increase

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.100
the robustness and also
the diversity of actions

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.350
that a robot can take in
a real-world environment

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.320
by taking an
instance-based approach.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.150
Next, you need robots
that can carry out

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.880
complex sequences of actions.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.710
So they need to be able
to plan in really, really

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.406
large combinatorial
state-action spaces.

00:03:03.406 --> 00:03:05.780
There might be hundreds or
thousands of objects in a home

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.600
that a robot might
need to manipulate

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.800
and depending on whether
the person is doing laundry

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.830
or they cooking broccoli
or are they making dessert.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.750
The set of objects
that are relevant that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.500
are useful that the robot needs
to worry about in order to help

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.490
the person is wildly different.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.410
So we need new algorithms for
planning in this really large

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.050
state- action space.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.480
And finally, the
robot needs to be

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.520
able to figure out what people
want in the first place.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.600
So people communicate
using language, gesture,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.640
but also just by walking
around the environment

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.400
and doing things that you can
infer something about what

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.774
their intentions are.

00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:41.190
And critically, when people
communicate with other people,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.200
it's not an open loop
kind of communication.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.574
It's not like you send a
message and then close your eyes

00:03:45.574 --> 00:03:46.500
and hope for the best.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500
People, when you're
talking with other people,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.020
engage in a closed
loop dialogue.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.390
There's feedback going on
in both directions that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.470
acts to detect and reduce
errors in the communication.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.450
And this is a critical
thing for robots

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.060
to exploit because robots
have a lot more problems

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.620
than people do in terms of
perceiving the environment

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.870
and acting in the environment.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.284
So it's really important
that we establish

00:04:08.284 --> 00:04:10.700
some kind of feedback loop
between the human and the robot

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.310
so that the robot can
infer what the person wants

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.830
and carry out helpful actions.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.310
So the three parts
of the talk are

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.579
going to be about each
of these three things.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.800
So this is my dad's
pantry in a home.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.430
And it's kind of like John's
pictures of the Google car.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.000
Most robots can't pick up
most objects most of the time.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.210
It's really hard to imagine
a robot doing anything

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.079
with a scene like this one.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:35.870
There was just the
Amazon picking challenge

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.740
and the team that won
used a vacuum cleaner,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.700
not a gripper to
pick up the objects.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.700
They literally sucked the
things up in the gripper

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.330
and then turned the vacuum
cleaner off to put things down.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.650
And the Amazon challenge
had much, much sparser stuff

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.286
on the shelves.

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:54.410
We'd really like to be able
to do things like this.

00:04:56.912 --> 00:04:58.370
And what we're
doing now I'm really

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.280
going to focus on a sub-problem,
which is object delivery.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.600
So from my perspective, I
think a really important sort

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.450
of baseline capability
for a manipulator robot

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.360
is to be able to pick something
up and move it somewhere else.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.160
We'd obviously love
a lot more things.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.920
We're also talking about
buttoning shirts in the car.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.154
And you can go on with
all the things you

00:05:18.154 --> 00:05:19.320
might want your robot to do.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.710
But at least, we'd like to
be able to do pick and place.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.782
Pick it up and put it down.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:25.740
So maybe you are in a
factory delivering tools,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.970
or maybe you're in the
kitchen delivering stuff

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.810
like ingredients or
cooking utensils.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.536
So to do pick and place in
response to natural language

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.910
commands-- so let's say, hand
me the knife or something--

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.370
you need to know a few
things about the object.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.850
First of all, you need to
be able to know what it is.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.527
If they said, hand
me the ruler, you

00:05:45.527 --> 00:05:48.110
need to be able to know whether
or not this object is a ruler.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.940
So some kind of label
that can hook up

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.920
to some kind of language model.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.719
Second, you have to know where
the object is in the world

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:57.260
because you're going
to actually move

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.270
your grippers and your
object and yourself

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.710
through 3D space in order
to find that object.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.160
So here I'm going to highlight
the pixels of the object.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.810
But you have to
register those pixels

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.240
into some kind of
coordinate system

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.920
that lets you move your
gripper over to that object.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.982
And then third, you have
to know where on that

00:06:12.982 --> 00:06:14.690
object are you going
to put your gripper.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.510
So in the case of this
ruler, it's pretty heavy,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.420
and it's this funny
shape that doesn't

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.420
have very good friction.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.180
So for our robot, the
best place to pick it up

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.677
is in the middle of the object.

00:06:24.677 --> 00:06:26.510
And there might be more
than one good place,

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.910
and it might depend
on the gripper.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.150
And different objects
might have complex things

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.510
going on that change where the
right place is to pick it up.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.490
So conventional
approaches to this problem

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.680
fall into two
general categories.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.240
The first category, the
first high-level approach

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.970
is what I'm going to call
category-based grasping.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.840
This is the dream.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.510
So the dream is that you
walk up to your robot,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.580
you hand it an object that
it's never seen before,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.210
and the robot infers all
three of those things, what

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.090
it is, where it is, and
where to put the gripper.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.190
And there's a line of
work that does this.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.140
So this is one paper
from Ashutosh Saxena,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.180
and there's a bunch of others.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.520
The problem is that it
doesn't work well enough.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.950
We are not at the accuracy
rates that sort of John

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.460
was alluding to that
we need for driving.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.575
So in Ashutosh's paper, I
think they got 70% or 80%

00:07:15.575 --> 00:07:19.430
pick success rate on their
particular test set at doing

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.639
category-based grasping.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.180
And I think that
you're going to have

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.210
to expect that to fall if
you actually give it a wider

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.890
array of objects in the home.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.290
And even if it doesn't
fall, 80% means

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.950
it's dropping things 20% of the
time, and that's not so good.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.720
The second approach is
instance-based grasping.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.822
So I was talking to Eric
Sudderth in my department

00:07:38.822 --> 00:07:40.280
who does machine
learning, he said,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.990
instant recognition is a solved
problem in computer vision.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.715
So instant recognition is I give
you a training set of the slide

00:07:46.715 --> 00:07:49.970
flipper, lots of images
of it, and then your job

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.610
given a new picture is to draw
a little box around the slide

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.290
flipper.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.070
This is considered a solved
problem in computer vision.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.502
There is a data
set and a corpus,

00:07:57.502 --> 00:07:59.210
and the performance
maxed out, and people

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.680
have stopped working on it.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.210
And a lot of the
work in robotics

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.660
uses this kind of approach.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.170
We were talking about you have
some kind of geometric model.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.320
That's the instance-based model.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.278
These models can take a
lot of different forms.

00:08:09.278 --> 00:08:11.990
They can be an image or a
3D model or whatever it is.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.010
The problem is, where
do you get that model.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.120
So if I am in my house
and there is thousands

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.520
of different objects,
you're not going

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.130
to have the 3D model most
likely for the object

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.600
that you want to pick up
right now for the person.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.030
So there's this
sort of data grab.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.910
But if you do have the model, it
can be really, really accurate

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.070
because you can know
a lot about the object

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.750
that you're trying to pick up.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.640
So the contribution
of our approach

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.600
is to try to bridge these
two by enabling a robot

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.630
to get the accuracy of the
instance-based approach

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.390
by autonomously
collecting its own data

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.684
that it needs in order to
robustly manipulate objects.

00:08:47.684 --> 00:08:49.100
So we're going to
get the accuracy

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.830
of instance-based approach
and the generality of category

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.650
at the cost of not human
time, but robot time

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.100
to build this model.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.410
So here's what it looks
like on our Baxter.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.550
It's going to make
a point cloud.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.460
This is showing-- it's got a one
pixel connect in its gripper.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.719
So you're seeing it doing
a sort of raster scan.

00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:10.260
This is sped up to
get a point cloud.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.110
Now it's taking
images of the object.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.414
So it's got an RGB
camera in its wrist.

00:09:14.414 --> 00:09:15.830
It's taking pictures
of the object

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.390
from lots of different
perspectives.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.370
So the data looks like this.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.652
You segment out the object
from the background.

00:09:21.652 --> 00:09:23.360
You get lots and lots
and lots of images.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.109
You do completely
standard computer vision

00:09:25.109 --> 00:09:28.717
stuff, SIFT and kNN, to make
a detector out of this data.

00:09:28.717 --> 00:09:29.800
You can get a point cloud.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.216
This is the point
cloud looks like

00:09:31.216 --> 00:09:33.210
at one-centimeter resolution.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.290
And after we do this, we're
able to pick up lots of stuff.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.100
So this is showing our robot--

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.120
these two objects,
localizing the object

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.010
and picking things up.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.580
It's going to pick up the egg.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.160
And that's a practice EpiPen.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.310
There's a little shake to make
sure it's got a good grasp.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.800
Now this works on
a lot of objects,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.930
so let's see how it
does on the ruler.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.060
So the way that the
system is working

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.740
is it's using the
point cloud to infer

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.030
where to grasp the object.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.720
But we don't really have a
model of physics or friction

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.380
or slippage.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.969
So it infers a
grasp near the end

00:10:08.969 --> 00:10:10.260
because it fits in the gripper.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.430
It kind of looks like
it's going to work.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.950
And it does fit in the
gripper, but when we go and do

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.706
that shake, what's
going to happen

00:10:15.706 --> 00:10:17.580
is it's going to pop
right out of the gripper

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.250
because it's got this
relatively low friction.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.330
There it goes and falls out.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.220
So that's bad, right?

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.630
We don't really like it
when our robots drop things.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.366
So before training, what happens
is it falls out of the gripper.

00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:31.740
In the case of
the ruler, there's

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.000
sort of physics going on, right?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.541
Things are slipping
out, and maybe we

00:10:34.541 --> 00:10:36.270
should be doing
physical reasoning.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.590
I think we should be
doing physical reasoning.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.760
I won't say "maybe" about that.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.134
But we're not
doing it right now.

00:10:40.134 --> 00:10:42.135
And there's lots of
reasons things could fail.

00:10:42.135 --> 00:10:44.542
So in other problematic
objects, this

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:45.750
is one of those salt shakers.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.080
It's got black handles that are
great for our robot to pick up,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.480
but they're black, so
they absorb the IR light,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.600
so we can't see them.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.975
So we can't figure out that
we're supposed to grab there.

00:10:54.975 --> 00:10:56.250
That round bulb looks awesome.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.990
It's transparent
though, so you get

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.250
all these weird reflections.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.120
So the robots-- are
inference algorithms is like,

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.161
oh, that bulb, that's
where we should pick it up.

00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:04.620
It doesn't fit in the gripper.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.700
So it will very often
slip out of the gripper.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.200
So what our approach to solve
this problem is, is we're

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.849
going to let the robot practice.

00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:14.140
So we have-- I'm not going
to go through the algorithm,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.250
but we have this unarmed
bandit algorithm that

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.300
lets us systematically decide
where we should pick objects

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:22.800
up.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.610
You can give it a prior on
where you think good graphs are.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.110
And you can use
whatever information

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.210
you want in that prior.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.850
And if the prior was perfect,
this would be boring.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.100
It would just work the first
time, and life would go on.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.730
But if the prior's
wrong for any reason,

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.880
the robot will be able to detect
it and fix things up and learn

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.525
where the most reliable places
are to pick up those objects.

00:11:44.525 --> 00:11:47.550
So here's an example
of what happens

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.990
when we use this algorithm.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.390
We practice picking
up the ruler.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.730
I forget how many times it had.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.350
Maybe 20 on this
particular object.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.060
One of the rifts
on the algorithm

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.660
is it decides when to stop.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.110
So we go a maximum 50 picks.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.600
But we might stop after
three if all three of them

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.010
work so that you can go on
to the next object to train.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.810
So here it picks up in the
middle and does a nice shake.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.300
OK, so what we're doing now is
scaling up this whole thing.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.500
So this is showing our robot
practicing on lots and lots

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.702
of different objects.

00:12:17.702 --> 00:12:18.660
A lot of them are toys.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.820
My son likes to watch
this video because he

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.700
likes to see the robot
playing with all of his toys.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.387
And I think playing
is actually--

00:12:25.387 --> 00:12:27.720
I mean it's one of those
loaded cognitive science words,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.561
but I think that's
an interesting way

00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:33.060
to think about what the robots
are actually doing right now.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.070
It's doing little
experiments trying

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.260
to pick up these objects
in different places

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.580
and recording where it works
and where it doesn't work.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.350
So this is sort of
showing 16, 32, one

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.220
in each hand objects being
done in our initial evaluation.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.040
And at the end of this,
basically, it works.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:55.140
So this is all the
objects in our test set.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.980
And before learning, we were
able to do with this proposal

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.745
system, which uses the steps
information, we get about 50%

00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:04.200
pick success rate.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.690
After learning,
they go up to 75%.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.000
And the other really
cool thing is that this

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.890
is a bimodal distribution.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:16.020
So it doesn't say 75% is
what you're going to get.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.350
A lot of these objects worked
eight, nine out of 10 times

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.450
or 10 out of 10 times.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.041
It goes from worst to best.

00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:23.540
So the good stuff
is all over there,

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.200
and the hard stuff
is all over there.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.910
A lot of other objects
were really hard.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.160
So that garlic press I think
we picked it up one time.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.620
It's really, really heavy,
so it slips out a lot.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.870
That gyro-ball thing
has a lot of reflection,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.720
so we had trouble
localizing it accurately.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.034
So we picked it
up very few times.

00:13:40.034 --> 00:13:41.700
I think everything
from about the EpiPen

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.158
over was eight out
of 10 or better.

00:13:43.158 --> 00:13:46.580
So not only-- so there's a lot
of objects that we can pick up,

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.330
and we can know which
ones we can pick up.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.680
And which ones we can't.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.650
We are right now taking an
aggressively instance-based

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.222
approach.

00:13:53.222 --> 00:13:54.930
And the reason that
we're doing that is I

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.138
think there's something
magic when the robot actually

00:13:57.138 --> 00:13:58.170
picks something up.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.380
So where I wanted to
start is let's cheat

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.340
in every way we can.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.020
Let's completely
make a model that's

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.990
totally specific to
this particular object.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.460
But the next step
that we're doing

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.890
is to try to scale
up this whole thing

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.040
and then start to think about
more general models to go back

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.770
to that dream of
category-based recognition.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.530
So if you look at computer
vision success stories,

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.340
one of the things that makes
a lot of algorithms successful

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.540
is data sets.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.585
And the size of those
data sets is immense.

00:14:26.585 --> 00:14:28.210
A lot of the computer
vision data sets,

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.900
COCO DB from Microsoft,
have millions

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.110
of images, which are labeled
with where the object is.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.060
But most of those
images are taken

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.610
by a human photographer
on your cell phone

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:39.750
or uploaded to Flicker.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.130
Wherever they got them from.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.130
And you get to see
each object once.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.140
Maybe you see it twice
from one perspective

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.931
that a human carefully chose.

00:14:47.931 --> 00:14:49.180
You don't get to play with it.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.570
You don't get to manipulate it.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.210
In robotics, there's some
data sets of object instances.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.850
The largest ones have a
few hundred of objects.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.530
So computer vision
people that I've

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.450
talked to they laugh at it
because it's just so much

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.540
smaller compared to the data
sets that we're working with.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.940
I think it's also so
much smaller than what

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.930
a human child gets to play
with over the course of going

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.487
from zero to two years old.

00:15:12.487 --> 00:15:15.070
I guess my son became a mobile
manipulator around a year later

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.236
around one and a half or so.

00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:18.110
I'm not sure exactly when.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.770
So one of my goals is to
scale up this whole thing

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.190
to change this data equation
to be more in our favor.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.220
So there's about 300 of these--
this is the Baxter robot--

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.920
there's about 300 of them
that Rethink Robotics--

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.240
Rod Brooks-- so we were
talking about Rob Brooks

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.115
in the previous talk.

00:15:32.115 --> 00:15:34.270
Rod founded this company
Rethink Robotics.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.240
They've sold about 300 of
them to the robotics research

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.740
community.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.630
That's a very high penetration
rate in robotics research.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:45.680
Everybody has a Baxter or
a friend with a Baxter.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.650
So we're starting something
which we're calling

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.900
the million object challenge.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.540
And the goal is to enlist
all of those Baxters, which

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.880
are sitting around doing
nothing a lot of the time--

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.154
to change this data equation.

00:15:57.154 --> 00:15:58.570
So what we're doing
is we're going

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.120
to try to get everybody
to scan objects for us,

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.340
so that we can get
models, perceptual models,

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.490
visual models, and also
manipulation experiences

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.880
with these objects to try to
train new and better category

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.860
models.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.970
And I think even
existing algorithms

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.350
may work way better simply
because they have better data.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.891
But I think it also
opens up the door

00:16:16.891 --> 00:16:19.364
to thinking about better models
that we maybe couldn't even

00:16:19.364 --> 00:16:21.280
think about before because
we just didn't have

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.020
the data to play with them.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.360
So where we are right now
is we've installed our stack

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.790
at MIT on Daniela Rus's Baxter.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.810
That's this one.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.460
And we went down
to Yale a couple

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.064
of weeks ago to Scass's lab
and we have our software

00:16:33.064 --> 00:16:33.730
on their Baxter.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.200
We're going to Rethink tomorrow.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.491
They're going to give us
three Baxters that we're going

00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:38.890
to play with and install there.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.350
And I have a verbal
yes from WPI.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.150
And a few other people
have been like--

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.147
I pitched this at RSS.

00:16:44.147 --> 00:16:46.230
So a lot of people have
said they were interested.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:50.050
I don't know if they'll actually
translate to robot time.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.460
And our goal is to get
about 500 or 1,000 objects

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.930
between these three sites.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.910
Four sites I guess if
the WPI gets on board.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.470
Four sites including us.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.200
So Rethink, Yale, MIT and us.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.470
And then do like a larger press
release about the project.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.140
Advertise it, push over all
of our friends with Baxters

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.369
to help us scan.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.579
And then have yearly scanathons
where you download the latest

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:15.640
software and then spend a
couple of days scanning objects

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:20.680
for the glory of
robotics or something.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.200
And really try to change this
data equation for the better,

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.699
so we can manipulate
lots of things.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.676
So that's our plan
for making robots

00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:32.050
that can robustly
perform actions

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.216
and real-world environments.

00:17:33.216 --> 00:17:35.140
More generally, I imagine
like a mobile robot

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.850
walking around
your house at night

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.890
and scanning stuff
completely autonomously.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.223
Taking these pictures, building
these models, hopefully,

00:17:41.223 --> 00:17:43.240
not breaking too
much of your stuff.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.710
And not only learning about your
particular house and the things

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.870
that are in it, but
also collecting data

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.820
that will enable other robots
to perform better over time.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.070
All right, so that's our
attack on making robots

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:01.450
robustly perform actions
in real-world environments.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.910
So the next problem that
I think is important

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.700
for language understanding
of human robot collaboration

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.640
is making robots to carry out
complex sequences of actions.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.692
So for example, this
is this pantry again.

00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:14.650
There might be hundreds
or thousands of objects

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.900
that the robot could
potentially manipulate.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.550
And it might need
to do a sequence

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.200
of 10 or 20
manipulations in order

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.510
to solve a problem such
as clean up the kitchen

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.850
or put away the groceries.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.370
For work that I had done in
the past on the forklift a lot

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.850
of the commands that
we studied and thought

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.980
about were the level
of abstraction of put

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.610
the pallet on the truck.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.860
But one of our annotators--
we cleared the law of data

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.412
on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:18:38.412 --> 00:18:40.870
And one of our annotators gave
us this problem that I never

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.030
forgot, which was how--

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.770
it was the actual
forklift operator

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.660
who worked in a
warehouse, and he

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.120
said if you paid me
extra money, I'll

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.300
tell you how to pick up a dime--
a dime, like a little coin

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.500
with a forklift.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.930
Here's the instructions
that he eventually

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.140
without making us
pay him gave us

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.390
for how to solve this problem.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.304
So it was raise the
forks 12 inches,

00:19:01.304 --> 00:19:03.220
line it in front of the
dime, tilt it forward,

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.665
drive a little bit
over, you lower the fork

00:19:05.665 --> 00:19:08.224
on top of the dime,
put it in reverse

00:19:08.224 --> 00:19:09.640
and travel backward,
the dime kind

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.440
of flips up backwards
on top of the fork.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.240
Maybe you know how
to drive a forklift,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.917
but you can see how
that would work.

00:19:17.917 --> 00:19:19.750
And if you did know how
to drive a forklift,

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:22.120
you can follow
those instructions

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.350
and have it happen.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.950
But I knew that our system if
we gave it these commands, there

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.119
is no way that it would work.

00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:29.410
It would completely fall apart.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.480
And the reason that
it would fall apart

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.120
is that we gave the
robot a model of actions

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.010
at a different
level of abstraction

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.320
than this language is using.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.050
We gave it a very high-level
of abstract actions,

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.360
like picking stuff up and moving
it into particular locations

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.830
and moving things down.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.930
And if we gave it
these low-level actions

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.310
of like raising the
forks 12 inches,

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.980
the search steps that
would be required

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.130
to find a high-level thing like
put the pallet on the truck

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.709
would be prohibitively
expensive.

00:19:55.709 --> 00:19:58.000
And I think if we want to
have human-- but the thing is

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.730
people don't like to stick at
any fixed level of abstraction.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.770
People move up and
down the tree freely.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.770
They give very high-level,
mid-level, low-level commands.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.110
So I think we need new
planning algorithms that

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.260
support this kind of thing.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.690
So to think about
this, we decided

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.810
to look at a version of
the problem in simulation.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.020
The simulator that we chose
is a game called Minecraft.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.970
Five minutes, OK.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.500
So it's sort of this--

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.110
this is a picture from
a Minecraft world.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.910
And we're trying to figure
out new planning algorithms.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.880
So the problem here
is that the agent

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.550
needs to cross the trench.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.080
So he needs to make a bridge
to get across the trench.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.080
So it's got some blocks
that he can manipulate.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.330
And you have this
combinatorial explosion

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.220
of where the blocks can go.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.270
They can go anywhere.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.770
So in a naive
algorithm, we'll spend

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.840
a lot of time putting
the blocks everywhere,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.720
which doesn't
really make progress

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.950
towards solving a problem.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.366
Whereas what you
really need to do

00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:53.320
is focus on putting these
blocks actually in the trench

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.324
in order to solve the problem.

00:20:55.324 --> 00:20:56.740
Of course, on a
different day, you

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.600
might be asked to make
a tower or make a castle

00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.920
or make a staircase,
and then these

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.060
might be good things to do.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.160
So you don't just throw
out those actions.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.380
You want to have them
both and figure out

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.690
what to do based on
your high-level goal.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.400
So we have some work about
learning how to do this.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.430
So we have an agent
that practices

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.920
solving small Minecraft
problems and then learns

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.330
how to solve bigger
problems from experience.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.576
This is showing transferring
this from small problems

00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:23.950
to big problems in a decision
theoretic framework, an MDP

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.572
framework.

00:21:25.572 --> 00:21:27.280
And we've just released
a couple of weeks

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.280
ago a mod for Minecraft,
the game called BurlapCraft.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.590
BURLAP is our reinforcement
learning and planning framework

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.170
that James MacGlashan
and Michael

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.670
Littman developed in Java.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.640
So you can run BURLAP
inside the Minecraft JVM.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.460
Get the state of the
real Minecraft world.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.200
Make small toy
problems if you want.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.810
Or let your agent
go in the real thing

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.200
and explore the whole space
of possible Minecraft spaces

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.180
if you're interested
in that simulation.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.010
OK, I'm almost out
of time, so I'm not

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.550
going to go too much into
robots coordinating with people.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:02.620
But maybe I will show some of
the videos about this work.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.650
The idea is that a lot of the
previous work and language

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:10.420
understanding shows people
works in batch mode.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.630
So the robot does something--
the person says something,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.304
the robot thinks
for a long time,

00:22:15.304 --> 00:22:16.720
and then the robot
does something.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.250
Hopefully, the right thing.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.770
And as I said before, this
is not how people will work.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.456
So we're working on new
models that enable the robot--

00:22:23.456 --> 00:22:25.330
this is a graphical
model that shows how it--

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.740
talking about it in the car.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.160
What happens, it incrementally
interprets language and gesture

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.600
updating at very
high frequencies.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.260
So this is showing the
belief about which objects

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.960
the person wants, updating
from their language and gesture

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.880
in an animated
kind of way, right?

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.310
Like, it's updating at 14 Hertz.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.719
So the idea is that the
robot has the information.

00:22:44.719 --> 00:22:45.760
This is its own language.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.670
I would like a bowl.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.040
Both bowls go up.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.040
That one he points and then
the one that he's pointing at

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:51.850
goes up.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.897
So the robot knows
very, very quickly,

00:22:53.897 --> 00:22:56.230
every time we get a new word
from [INAUDIBLE] condition,

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.850
every time we get a new
observation from the gesture

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.680
system, we update our belief.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.450
And just a couple of weeks ago,
we had our first pilot results

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.900
showing that we can use this
information to enable the robot

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.770
to produce real-time feedback
that increases the human's

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.150
accuracy at getting the robot
to select the right object.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.090
This is some
quantitative results.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.250
I'll skip it.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.162
OK, so that's the
three main thrusts

00:23:24.162 --> 00:23:25.870
that I'm working on
in my research group.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.316
Trying to make robots that
can robustly perform actions

00:23:28.316 --> 00:23:29.440
in real-world environments.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.590
Thinking about planning in
a really large state action

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.019
spaces that result when you have
a capable and powerful robot.

00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:38.560
And then thinking about how you
can make the robot coordinate

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.184
with people so that
they can figure out

00:23:40.184 --> 00:23:42.790
what to do in these really
large state actions spaces.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.550
Thank you.
