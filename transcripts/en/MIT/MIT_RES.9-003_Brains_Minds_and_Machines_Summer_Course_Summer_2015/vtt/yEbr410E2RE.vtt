00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.210
BORIS KATZ: When
a scientist though

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.860
approaches a complex phenomena
or when an engineer looks

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.890
at a difficult problem, they
usually break it up into pieces

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.670
and try to understand
this phenomena

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.380
and solve them separately.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.300
Understanding intelligence is
one such very, very complex,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.570
in fact, extraordinary complex
problem, and over the years,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.630
this divide and conquer
approach produced

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.910
a number of very
successful fields

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.130
like computer vision,
natural language processing,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.450
cognitive science, neuroscience,
machine vision, and so on.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.680
But we need to remember
the most cognitive tasks

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.980
that humans perform actually
go across modalities,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.820
which is they span these
established fields.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.880
And the goal of our thrust is
to bring together techniques

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.450
from all these fields,
create new models,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.670
and for solving
intelligence task,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.130
we also would like to understand
how these tasks operate

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.410
in the brain.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.154
So I will start with one task,
which is scene recognition.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.340
What does scene
recognition involve?

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.170
Well, machines, in order
to recognize a scene,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.860
a machine needs to do
some type of verification.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.360
Is that a street lamp?

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.350
It uses the detection of
other people in the scene.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.620
It needs to do identification.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.290
Is this particular
building, Potala Palace,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.200
somewhere in Tibet?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.850
It needs to do object
categorization.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.760
Look at this image
and tell me where

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.170
are mountains, trees, buildings,
street lamps, vendors, people,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.010
and so forth.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.950
We should also be able
to recognize activity.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.830
What is this person doing?

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.570
Or what are these
two guys doing here?

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.850
Well, currently, our
machines are pretty

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.261
bad at all of these tasks.

00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:04.760
I understand that there has
been quite a lot of progress

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.430
recently made in
machine learning.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.980
And I've also seen some claims
that machines perform better

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.470
than humans in
some visual tasks.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.650
However, I think we
should take these claims

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.380
with a grain of salt.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.070
First, there is nothing
amazing about machines

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.320
doing certain things
better than humans.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.600
People did it over millennia.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.220
Humans needed tools
to build pyramids.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.050
They build tools to carry
heavy things, to lift them,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.700
to go faster, and so on.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.660
Well, you'll tell me,
no, no, no, we need,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.940
we are talking about
intelligent tasks.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.590
Well, for $5 you
can buy a calculator

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.460
that multiplies numbers
much better than you do.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.280
For $100, you can build a gadget
that has a huge lookup table

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.970
and plays chess much
better than any of you.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.810
So when you hear that a
computer can distinguish

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.519
between 20 breeds of dogs,
or something like that,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.474
better than you
do, I don't think

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.640
you should assume that the
vision problem is solved.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.320
Well, understand, I'm not
saying that because we have

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.450
a dramatically better solution.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.310
Not at all.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.340
My point is that the problems
of real visual understanding

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.030
and real language understanding
are extraordinary hard,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.530
and we need to be patient
and try to understand why

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.940
and eventually find
better solutions.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.430
So back to visual
understanding problem.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.580
So as I said, machines are
better at these things.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.250
But humans are
absolutely awesome.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.630
You have absolutely no trouble
to do verification detection,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.526
identification, categorization.

00:05:07.526 --> 00:05:08.900
You could do much
more than that.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.120
You could recognize spatial
and temporal relationships

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.990
between objects.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.940
You can do event recognition.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.170
You can explain things.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.780
You can look at that
image that I showed you

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.330
and tell me what past
events caused the scene

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.260
to look like it is.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.390
You can look at that scene and
say what future events might

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.580
occur in that scene.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.646
You can fill gaps.

00:05:38.646 --> 00:05:39.770
You can hallucinate things.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.150
You could tell me
what objects which

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.790
were included in that
scene which I've barely

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.660
seen, actually, there
might be present there

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.840
and what events not visible in
the scene could have occurred.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.110
So why are machines
are falling short?

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.200
Well, in part, our
visual system is

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.920
tuned to process structures
typically found in the world,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.010
but our machines have no idea.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.230
They don't know
enough about the world

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.930
and they don't know what
structures and events make

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.290
sense and typically
happen in the world.

00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:27.780
So I will show you
a blurry video.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:34.090
And I wonder if,
well, some of you

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.750
who didn't see it, whether
you could figure out what's

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.250
going on.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.310
Who have not seen this video?

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.958
Could you tell me what you saw?

00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.333
AUDIENCE: A person was talking
on the phone then switched

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:08.678
to working on his computer

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:09.660
BORIS KATZ: Right.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.160
Well, this is amazing.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.490
Even with almost no
pixels there and you still

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.520
recognize what's going
on, well, because you know

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.530
what typically
happens in the world.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.290
Well, of course it
was sort of a joke

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.660
and people sometimes
make mistakes, too.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.956
So here's the unblurred video.

00:07:26.956 --> 00:07:30.442
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:39.900
Well, but, all jokes aside.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.280
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.230
BORIS KATZ: Jokes
aside, though, it

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.110
would have been extraordinary
if our machines could

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.990
make mistakes like this.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.140
Not even close.

00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:59.610
Well, so we may want to
ask ourselves questions.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.340
How is this knowledge that
you seem to have is obtained?

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.780
And how can we pass this
knowledge to our computers?

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.420
How can we determine whether
this computer knowledge

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.130
is correct?

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.970
Our partial answer
is using language.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.420
And I bolded the
word partial here,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:26.060
because clearly there are
many other ways humans obtain

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.160
knowledge about the
world, but today I

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.120
will be talking about
language and show you

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.830
what is needed to give
knowledge to the machine.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.870
So we have a proposal.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.220
We would like to create
a knowledge base that

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.910
contains descriptions
of objects,

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.490
their properties, the
relations between them

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.270
as they're typically
found in the world,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.750
and we want to
make this knowledge

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.980
base available to a
scene-recognition system.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.560
And to test the
performance of the system,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.940
we will ask natural
language questions.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.940
One of us here
has decided to see

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.630
what questions
people actually ask,

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.560
and he set up an
Amazon Turk experiment,

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.490
where he showed people
hundreds of images

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.670
and asked them to write
down, generate questions

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.480
about these images.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.688
And I will show you a couple.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.510
Here's a scene.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.530
In here, the questions
that people ask,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.810
you know, how many
men in the picture?

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.520
What's in the cart?

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.530
What does the number
on the sign say?

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.880
Is there any luggage?

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.120
What is the color of
shirt of some lady?

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.010
Another example.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.580
Who is winning, yellow or red?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:54.790
Well, the answer is, of course,
red, but how did you do that?

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.900
Well, you need to know that
this is a sporting event, which

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.850
all of you do.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.140
That it involves, in
this particular sporting

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.044
event, winners and
losers, that you do.

00:10:04.044 --> 00:10:07.950
It needs to know that this
sort of short-hand yellow

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.710
and the red means people
wearing these colors,

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.260
rather than color themselves.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.530
You need to know to pay no
attention to people wearing red

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.900
or maybe blue in the audience.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.410
And you also need to know that
a participant on the floor

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.386
is likely a loser, not a winner.

00:10:25.386 --> 00:10:27.105
That's a lot of knowledge.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.700
So, back to our proposal.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.430
We want to try to
give at least some

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.250
of that knowledge
using language,

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.700
and for that, of
course, we need tools.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:46.280
And over the years, we've built
a system called START, which,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.530
in fact, contains
some tools that

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.000
could be helpful for this task.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.330
And I will be happy to
share the API with you

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.000
so that you could use
the system and maybe

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.610
try to see what to do with the
knowledge that you give it.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.850
So there are only three
tools on this slide.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.055
So one is going from
language to structure.

00:11:12.055 --> 00:11:14.180
So we know that to provide
machines with knowledge,

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.770
we give the machine a bunch of
sentences, texts, paragraphs,

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.510
and that will be
converted into some kind

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.800
of semantic representation.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.854
And I will show some
details of that.

00:11:24.854 --> 00:11:26.270
We want to go the
other direction.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.630
We want a machine to
explain what it does

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.610
or describe its
knowledge using language.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.950
So we have a generator
that does that, that

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.536
goes from semantic
representation to language.

00:11:37.536 --> 00:11:39.410
And we want to test the
machine, because it's

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.390
very important to
know whether what

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.750
you thought the machine, if
actually it understood you

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.400
correctly.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.040
We want to ask
questions, give queries.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.960
Those will be converted in
semantic representations that

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.570
will be matched against
what the machine knows.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.800
And the computer will either
give you a language response

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.160
or perform some actions,
which will indicate that it

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:10.290
understood what you asked.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.600
So we will go
through these tools

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.940
and I will describe you
the START system in detail,

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.230
but I just want you to remember
that this is a discipline

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.950
and engineering
enterprise and these

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.100
are the tools that I want
to give you and other people

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.620
so that you could start thinking
deeper about human abilities

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.050
and modalities, like vision
and language and others.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.550
Some of the building
blocks of the START system.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.720
We need to parse
language, we need

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.030
to come up with
semantic representation,

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.890
generate match,
reply, and so forth.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.300
So let's very quickly
go through that.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.160
Most of you, somewhere
in middle school,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.940
learned about parse trees.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.310
Linguists love them.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.850
They're beautiful.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.600
This is an example of a
sentence from Tom Sawyer.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.690
Tom greeted his
aunt who was sitting

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.380
by an open window in a
pleasant rearward apartment.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.770
And linguists like to
argue about exactly

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.060
the representations, but
pretty much most of them

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.370
will agree that something
like that represents

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:25.440
the structure, the syntactic
structure of the sentence.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.630
Well, they're
beautiful and nice,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.430
but they're really
horrible if you

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.340
want to store them, if
you want to match them,

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.740
if you want to
retrieve from them.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.400
And so we use the information
found in parse trees,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.890
but we developed a
different representation

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.100
which we call Ternary
expression representation, which

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.560
is a more semantic
representation of language.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.450
It is syntax-driven, but it
highlights semantic relations

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.190
which humans find
important, and it also,

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.740
because we give this
knowledge to computers,

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.880
we made it very efficient
for indexing, for matching,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.930
and for retrieval.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.500
It's also reversible, and
I'll explain in a second what

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.770
I mean by that.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.120
We implemented it as a
nested subject, relation,

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.690
object set of tuples.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.510
So here is a different sentence.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.500
Say you have an image.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.470
You may recognize one of the
characters there in the back.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.180
It's Andrei Barbu.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.210
And say you want to describe,
in language, what you see here.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.520
And you say something
like, the person

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.110
who picked up the yellow
lemon placed it in the bowl

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.510
on the table.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:44.660
Using this structure, subject,
relation, object structure,

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.470
you could, and first
parsing the sentence,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.990
you could create this
Ternary expression.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.110
And you could see,
person picked up lemon.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:57.420
That same person placed that
lemon in the bowl on the table,

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.410
and that lemon
happens to be yellow.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:05.010
To make it a little
bit more easy

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:10.250
for you to see what's going
on and convenient for humans

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.100
and machines, we created a sort
of topologically equivalent

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.720
linearization of that
graph, that knowledge

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.730
graph, and as a set of triples.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.240
They're a little
bit misleading here

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.130
just due to its simplicity,
but all words here, of course,

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.380
need to have an index,
because if you have,

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.890
say, a tall person
and a short person

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.350
or, then, you will have to
distinguish between them.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.770
So you need indices,
but for simplicity, I

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.050
didn't show them here.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.760
And then the verbs
also have indices

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.460
so that when you use the
same word place here,

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.650
that is the relation,
the triple, that

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.350
happened to be in the
bowl, that the person

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.550
placed a lemon in the bowl.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.690
So this is all
representation and when

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:07.080
we distinguished at least three
types of Ternary expressions.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:12.330
So the first type you see
here, syntactic structure

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.020
of a sentence.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.730
We also have syntactic features.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.700
The fact that the sitting
was, it was past tense.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.500
She was sitting, it said here.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.280
But it's a progressive
tense, was sitting, and also

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.980
what kind of
article things have.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:36.720
The window had an article
and an indefinite article.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.920
And also the lexical features
that don't change from sentence

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.310
to sentence, the fact that Tom
is a proper noun and so forth.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:59.420
Well, I told you that our
representation is reversible.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.756
Well, we need to be able to
teach machines to talk to us.

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.339
And there are many
reasons to do that.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.099
Some of them are
shown on this slide.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:11.420
We want your robot
or your computer

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:16.339
to explain what it
does somewhat remotely.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.020
You want your
machine or your robot

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.329
to answer questions
which are complex

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:26.569
and the robot may want to ask
you about it for clarification.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:29.870
You want to keep track of
conversation history and state.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.060
Engage in
mixed-initiative dialogue.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.840
Offer related information.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.300
So all these things need
to happen in the dialogue

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.490
and, therefore,
your computer must

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.730
be able to speak to you in a
language that you understand.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:51.500
In fact, I find that the biggest
problem with learning systems

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.670
that we have today is
that some of the work

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.160
can work quite
robustly, and sometimes

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.680
give you good results,
but you have no idea why.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.130
You press a button, you
say, aha, here's the number,

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.340
and put it in the paper,
but more recently, people

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.470
started looking at why
it does what it does.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.990
But, again, it's
done by numbers.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.570
It would be really
wonderful if our learning

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.520
system could tell us why they
came up with their conclusions.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.970
So we need language
and so we created,

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.950
sort of built a
START generator that

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:33.740
goes from those same expressions
and create natural language.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:41.810
This is why we call this
representation reversable.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.202
So given a set of
Ternary expressions,

00:18:46.202 --> 00:18:47.660
the machine will
create a sentence,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.390
the person who picked out
the yellow lemon placed it

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.270
in the bowl on the table.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.550
But, of course, this
is a little bit silly,

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.530
just parroting the
same sentence back.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:58.950
You want the
machine, for example,

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.520
as I said, to ask you
a question or indicate

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.980
a negative statement or rephrase
it from different pieces

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.450
that it knows about.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.600
So, in fact, our generator
is very flexible.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.960
So here is an example where
by, say, observing the world,

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.770
robot adds more information
to this representation,

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.970
and they're indicated
here in blue.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.130
And now from the
original sentence about,

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.440
which was the person who
picked out the yellow lemon,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.820
placed it in the
bowl, the machine,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.020
by just adding a couple
of new relations,

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.350
the generator will be able to
ask a question, or the human.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.870
Will the person who placed
the yellow lemon in the bowl

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.500
on the table pick it up soon?

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.450
And so forth.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.180
All right, so we talked
about parse trees,

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.506
about semantic representation,
about generation.

00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:52.630
So what do we do with that?

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:58.130
Let's-- Supposing that you gave
some knowledge to your machine,

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:03.800
hear that Tom Sawyer assertion,
and somebody asked you,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.360
was anyone sitting
by an open window?

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.880
Well, what needs to
happen is this question

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.880
needs to be converted into
Ternary representation

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:19.340
as I indicated, and this
knowledge base, we assume,

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.910
had the knowledge from the
original assertion plus million

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.470
other assertions, of course.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.890
So we would need to match the
representation of the query

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.680
with the knowledge base,
and the machine will say,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.140
aha, here is the match.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.360
Well, this is very
simple here, if you

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.660
think window needs
to open to window,

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.920
open to match window open,
open, and sit and sit,

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.970
and then the word anyone, which
sort of matching the word,

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.190
needs to match aunt.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.410
But, in reality,
of course, people

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.110
ask questions which do
not that closely follow

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.430
what the machine knows,
and so for our matcher,

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.090
it needs to be much
more sophisticated.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:04.100
This is just the graphical
effect, sort of knowledge,

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.270
graph representation
of that match.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:14.020
So START distinguishes
things like term matching,

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.460
which as I showed, could
be a lexical match.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.600
Of course, it knows synonym.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.070
It knows hyponymy
when it goes one way.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.190
It's like a car is a vehicle.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.360
And as you can imagine, the
match also needs to go one way.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.800
If I say I bought a car, it also
means that I bought a vehicle.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.010
But if I say I bought
a vehicle, it's

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.090
not true that I bought
a car because I may have

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:40.730
bought a truck, but this aside.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.290
So it's pretty easy to do
matching on the level of terms

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:51.590
of words, but a much
more complex problem

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.400
is to match on the
level of the structure.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.225
And I will show you some
examples of this problem.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.010
But by now, you must
have figured out

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.976
I love to stare at
English sentences.

00:22:05.976 --> 00:22:07.100
I hope you do a little bit.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.020
If not, please try.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.190
So here, let's consider
a couple of verbs.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:16.310
So here is the verb surprise.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.040
Let's consider
these two sentences.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.640
The patient surprised the
doctor with his fast recovery.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.350
The patient's fast recovery
surprised the doctor.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.130
Now for you who are used
to understanding language

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.230
so quickly, it's even
hard to hear what's

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.940
different about the sentences.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.457
But if you actually
do the parsing,

00:22:36.457 --> 00:22:38.540
you will see that the parse
trees are dramatically

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.492
different, and therefore,
our Ternary representations

00:22:42.492 --> 00:22:43.450
will be very different.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.220
So we need to find a way
to tell the machine, yeah,

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.430
that's the same thing.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.470
And the linguists call
these things syntactic

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:52.740
alternations as well.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.680
In a different verb like load,
here's a different alternation.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.290
The crane loaded the ship
with containers or the crane

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.540
loaded containers onto the ship.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.980
Again, means the same
thing pretty much,

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.350
but the surface
representation is different.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:15.680
The next one is in
terms of a question.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.960
Did Iran provide
Syria with weapons

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.420
or did Iran provide
weapons to Syria?

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.540
Let's see if it's true for
every verb in the universe.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.010
So let's try to look at the,
say, surprise alternation

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.730
and use it with a load verb
or the other way around.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.630
So I hope you're
bearing with me.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:42.530
So linguists put stars in
front of bad sentences.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:46.640
And so here I tried to
use the word surprise

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.236
without alternation, which
load allows you to do.

00:23:51.236 --> 00:23:54.270
Here, you do the same onto, and
it says the patient surprised

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.920
fast recovery onto the doctor.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.880
It makes absolutely no sense.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.770
Here I tried to do surprise
alternation for the word load.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.730
And it says the crane's
containers loaded the ship.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.260
Again, complete gibberish.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.400
And the same below.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.920
Did Iran's weapons
provide Syria?

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.280
So it looks like a
really horrible story.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.570
Every English verb,
it looks like,

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:25.250
has a different way of saying,
expressing these alternations,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.110
but fortunately,
this is not the case.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.850
Let's go back to
the verb surprise.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:43.440
Well, let's look at verbs
similar to the word surprise.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.680
So you could use
the same alternation

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.700
with the word confused.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.070
You can say the patient
confused the doctor

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.170
with slow recovery,
which will convert

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.020
into the patient's slow
recovery confused the doctor.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.700
You can say the same
thing with anger,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.730
disappoint, embarrass, fight,
and impress, please, threaten.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.930
And what is really amazing
about it and very interesting

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:10.210
that this syntactic
alternation works

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:13.720
the same way for verbs
of the same meaning,

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.520
of the same semantic class.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.330
And this particular class is
called the emotional reaction

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.220
verbs.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.190
And it's a large semantic
class of about 300 verbs,

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.470
and they all behave
identically from the point

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.300
of view of that alternations.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.084
And it's true for all other
alternations that I showed you.

00:25:31.084 --> 00:25:32.500
So that's, of
course, is good news

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.590
because it makes an interesting
connection between syntax

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.240
and semantics,
but it also allows

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.980
to build lexicons that are
more compact and easier

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.030
to deal with.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:50.560
And one can imagine creating
this verb membership

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.950
automatically by
looking at large corpus.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.450
And this is how,
presumably, children

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:01.500
learn these verb classes
and these alternations.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.240
All right, so now that
you know how to match

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.897
and it's not just
trivial match only,

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.980
like I showed here, but a
more sophisticated match

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.590
on the level of
structure as well,

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.850
let's see what we can do
after the match happens.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.720
So here's the same sentence
and the same question.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.030
Was anybody sitting
by an open window?

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.810
We retrieved the
structure and then

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.980
we could tell our generator,
go and generate the sentence,

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.630
and it will do that.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.150
Tom's aunt was sitting
by an open window

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.990
in a pleasant
rearward apartment.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.250
Well, it's not as interesting.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.910
It's sort of parroting the
same thing I tell it, ABC,

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.392
and it told me
back, ABC, if I ask

00:26:44.392 --> 00:26:47.489
who BC or something like that.

00:26:47.489 --> 00:26:49.530
If you want to build a
question-answering system,

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.540
we want it to be able to,
in response to a question,

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.590
understand it, go somewhere,
find the right answer,

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.020
and give it back to you.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:04.030
And we build that and we
do it by a general, where,

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:08.260
if looking at it, our system can
execute a procedure in response

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:13.040
to a match to obtain the
answer from the data source.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.820
So an example is here and I
can show you some screenshots

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:19.070
or, in fact, if you like it, we
can play with the system live

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.590
and you'll see what it does.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.160
So it executes a procedure to
obtain an answer from the data

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.260
source.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.605
If you say who directed Gone
With the Wind, from match,

00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:32.320
it will happen between what
you know, what you ask,

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.010
and what the system knows,
some script will get executed

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.830
and the machine will go to some
data source, find the answer,

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:40.390
and give it back to you.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:41.380
So how this is done?

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:47.180
Well, in order to explain
that, I need two more ideas.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.850
One is a natural
language annotation idea.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:53.830
So annotations,
sentences, and phrases

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.626
that describe the content
of retrievable information

00:27:56.626 --> 00:27:58.750
segments, this is a graphic
sort of, in a cute way,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.110
show this sentence level,
or phrase level labels

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.700
on some data, and they describe
the retrievable information

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.210
segments.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.780
Annotations are then matched
against submitted queries

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.360
and the successful
match results in,

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.860
either retrieval of that
information or some procedure,

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.901
to retrieve that information.

00:28:20.901 --> 00:28:25.210
And the special case
of this procedure

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:30.490
is done using our
object-property-value data

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.800
model.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.760
This technique can
connect language

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:42.160
to arbitrary procedures,
but as I said,

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.260
let's consider a lot of
semi-structured information

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.540
sources available
on the web that

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:54.820
can be modeled using this
object-property-value model.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.230
Well, what are these,
what kind of repositories

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.130
have this property?

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:01.840
If you think about
it, almost anything

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.330
that humans create on the
web, which is semi-structured,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.190
is like that.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.580
If you have a site that
has a bunch of countries

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.490
with properties like
populations, areas

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:17.290
capitals, birthrates, and
so forth, the country is

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.140
an object, the word
population is a property,

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.250
and value is the actual
value of that property.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.680
You can have people
with their birth-dates,

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.560
you can have cities with maps
and elevations and so forth.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.980
So in a sense, this
object-property-value model

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:38.500
makes it possible to view and
use large segments of the web

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.770
as a database.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.120
And schematically, here's
how START uses this model.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.480
A user asks the language
part of the system

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.820
a question, the system needs
to understand the question,

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.530
understands where the
question might be found,

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.810
and what is the
object and property

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.970
implicit in the question.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.700
After START does
that, it says it

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.790
has a friend called Omnibase,
and it says, go get it.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.500
Go to this site.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:11.700
Go for that symbol called France
and go get the population.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.580
And it will go to
some world fact book

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.580
and get the population.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.740
So this is how the
system works and here's

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.440
an example of such a question.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.640
Here, the question
is, it's a screenshot,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.276
does Russia border on Moldova?

00:30:29.276 --> 00:30:33.180
The system says, ah ha,
you want to find out

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.880
what countries border
Moldova, and find out

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.940
whether Russia is among them.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:43.260
And then it actually checks that
and it tells you, no, Russia

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.240
does not border Moldova,
because it doesn't

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.690
find Russia in this response.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.920
And just for comparison, if
you ask the same question

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.430
of a search engine,
it will give you

00:30:55.430 --> 00:31:01.020
24 million results, today
maybe 240 million results,

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.940
and none of them really
answer the question.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.130
Well, I just want to tell you
that the ability to understand

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.020
something really helps.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.210
In this case, the ability
to understand language

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.880
gives you a lot of power.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.890
You can do a lot by trying
through the keywords

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.690
and you can retrieve
a lot of documents,

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:30.090
and this is how all of, pretty
much, modern systems work.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.960
But if you want to do something
a little bit more complex,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.460
it would be nice
to understand some.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.790
So here's an example
of a complex question.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:40.340
Who is the president of
the fourth largest country

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.560
married to?

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.520
Well, if you can analyze
this question into pieces,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.140
then you can very quickly
figure out that, right away,

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.560
just throwing the pieces
on your knowledge base,

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.250
you cannot resolve it.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:59.180
But we've built a very nice
syntatical-based algorithm

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:04.700
that allows us to resolve the
complex questions into subsets

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.860
of simpler questions and
understand in which order

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.940
to ask them.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.070
So the machine
will say, oh, first

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.350
I need to find out what's
the fourth largest country,

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.840
then who its president
is, and then with that,

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.490
who he is married to.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:20.140
And, very quickly, this is
how, schematically, it's done.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.170
This is sort of
an under the hood

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.990
Ternary expression
representation of the question.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.530
The machine says, oh,
too hard, let's first

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.515
find out what the fourth
largest country is.

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:32.060
It's China.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.700
Then let's find out,
it's still hard,

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.010
so let's find out who
the president of China

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:41.810
is, found the name, and then
the next is just a lookup table.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.950
Who is he married to?

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.270
And it gives you an answer.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.230
Some other examples.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.970
In what city was the fifth
president of the US born?

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:57.850
And finds like a James Monroe
and gives you the city.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.960
What books did the author
of War and Peace write?

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.790
Finds Leo Tolstoy and finds his
books from different sources.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:16.860
So the technology
that I described,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:22.260
object-property-value data
model, our Ternary expression

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:29.990
representation, complex question
answering, the annotation,

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.440
natural language
annotation, representation.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.840
They, over the years,
inspired a bunch of companies

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.650
and a bunch of technologies,
starting with Ask Jeeves, who,

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.010
I guess, existed before
you guys were even born,

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.420
to Wolfram Alpha,
who pretty much took

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.880
[INAUDIBLE] wholesale,
to more recently,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.470
Google QA started doing
really wonderful things using

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:57.720
this idea that, everybody
had the idea that you should

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.300
go from surface to a question.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.020
If you have a question,
you throw your question

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.300
onto the web and
you get some answer,

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.640
but it doesn't work
with high precision.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.320
So the idea that you need to
curate knowledge and build

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.600
some huge depository
of knowledge

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.630
was picked up by these
companies to, certainly now,

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:22.290
all these companies do quite
decent question answering.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.760
And the same is true
for Watson and Siri,

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.520
and I was involved in
some of these things,

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.370
so I will show you.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.730
Let's see.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.139
Right, so let's start with this.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.090
About 10 years ago,
we, on top of START,

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:53.431
we built a system that was
connected to a cell phone.

00:34:53.431 --> 00:34:55.389
I don't know how many of
you remember the world

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:58.120
without smartphones,
but that was

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.450
when smartphones wasn't there.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.840
There was no such
thing as iPhone.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.090
So there's a vanilla
phone that, all it did, it

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.520
made phone calls.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.950
Of course, it also had a
camera and unlimited text.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.800
But it really
didn't do much more

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.890
and we decided it's time
to connect it to language.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:22.860
So we convinced the company
to fund us to do that,

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:28.980
and we build some language
called StartMobile.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.770
And this is an intelligent
phone assistant,

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.320
which could, at the time,
retrieve general purpose

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.250
information, provide access
to computational services,

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:42.400
perform action on another
phone, trigger apparatus,

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.000
like a camera on a phone,
receive instructions.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.330
And we have a,
talking about YouTube,

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:53.890
we have a video that shows
the system in action.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.270
That video is quite old.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.660
It's from beginning of
2006, and at the time,

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.370
we did not connect
to speech, but you

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.970
could see what it
does by, the user

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.430
was typing in questions
for the system

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.570
in that particular video.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.110
So there's no narration so
if you read the captions,

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.670
you'll figure out
what is going on.

00:36:41.242 --> 00:36:42.950
So here's my former
student, who actually

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:49.260
went to Google to transition
our technology eventually.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:54.140
And he's not sure whether he
needs to take his coat or not.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.500
[JAZZ MUSIC]

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.250
Again, this is very
dated, of course,

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.470
because now the temperature
is almost uniform,

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.280
but, again, that
was 10 years ago.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.020
Is there any sound?

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.532

right, those of you

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:24.573

know that station.

00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:39.540
Where am I?

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:44.500
The GPS just came about and
we were lucky to connect it

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.580
and so now the guy gets
the map and knows where

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.220
to find where he needs to go.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.960
So this is our data center
for those who haven't seen it.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.520
This is where CSAIL is.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.700
Again, it's dated, because
right now this lawn

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.580
is a huge building, but it
wasn't there at the time.

worried about his mother

it even today for some reason.

Very good, yeah.

himself, I guess,

know how to do it.

Right, so, exactly.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.240
So a delayed accident
happened on her phone

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.710
so we inserted the
thing on her phone

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:16.090
and then she got this
warning, and that's my stuff.

be very good actors.

is the last thing.

How do I get from here
to Frederica's house?

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.740
Well, if you think about it,
this is a very hard question.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.400
You need to know
that here is here

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.760
and go to GPS and
find the location.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.830
You need to know
Frederica's house

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:28.530
from your list of contacts
that need to go there,

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.260
and you need to then send it
to, in that case, we send it to,

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.240
I believe it was
MapQuest, I don't even

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:38.051
know if it exists now, to
actually give the directions.

00:41:38.051 --> 00:41:39.450
Well, anyway, so.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:47.340
Well, it was a little bit
of a sad story actually.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.080
So we built the system.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.770
The company that I
mentioned was Nokia.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:56.017
We showed them the demo.

00:41:56.017 --> 00:41:57.350
They were very excited about it.

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:01.080
They said, well, can we
put START on the phone?

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:06.390
Because in that
application, the signals

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.250
were sent to MIT from
the phone and the answers

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.670
were sending back to the phone.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.960
I said, well, it
doesn't seem right.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.230
START is large and
there was no internet

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:21.290
that could take care of that.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.550

how big is your system?

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:28.460
Can you talk through the company
to put it to a LISP compiler,

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.210
to put it on our
chip, and so forth.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.160
We need another phone.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.790
Unfortunately, the word cloud
hadn't been invented yet.

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.640
Maybe I would have been more
eloquent in explaining to them

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:43.420
why they don't need to have
the system on the phone.

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:47.790
And so they didn't want
to use that the way it is.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:52.950
We wrote a paper,
showed it to them,

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:57.450
say, do something about
this, it will be too late.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:01.440
And right at that time, Apple
released its first iPhone.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.170

guys are ahead of you.

about it because they

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.260
will do what I gave you.

did Apple sell last month?

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:27.090
I said I read somewhere
like a couple of thousand.

And he starts
laughing hysterically.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:34.600
He said, we, my company, ships
one million phones every day.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.100
Why do we care about
Apple, he said.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.180
Well, so, we gave this talk.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.920
That was September 2007 by then.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:52.290
In December, somebody started
a company called Siri,

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.290
and then two years later,
Siri was bought by Apple

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.950
and the rest is history.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.240
And Nokia was sold pretty
much on a yard sale

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.600
and doesn't exist anymore.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.950
So be visionary.

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:10.140
Don't think that you know what
you are doing all the time.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:16.770
Yeah, people often ask me to
say a few words about Jeopardy!.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:23.430
The question that the IBM
team was hoping to answer

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:26.200
was actually a very
important question.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.180
Can we create a computer system
to compete against the best

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.760
human in a task,
which is normally

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.693
thought to require high
level of human intelligence?

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.980
I was involved with them
from the very beginning

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:47.300
for various reasons
which I will not go into.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.250
They put together a wonderful
team, some really good people,

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.250
very devoted people.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.980
They spent four or five years
of their life, pretty much,

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.130
totally devoted to that.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.800
And they built a system,
and these are the kind of,

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.740
I guess--

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.230
I don't know if any of you
know what Jeopardy! is but

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:09.830
pretty much, people
ask the question,

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:14.340
which for various reasons, is
formulated not as a question

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.770
but as an assertion,
with the most

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:19.640
to reflect these
that are pronouns

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.624
and you need to give an answer,
which they call the question,

00:45:23.624 --> 00:45:24.290
for some reason.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.020
There's a gimmick.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.228
You have to say what is
envelope instead of envelope,

00:45:27.228 --> 00:45:28.990
but let's not pay
attention to that.

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:30.470
It doesn't matter.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.520
And this is very hard.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.560
To push one of
these paper products

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.170
is to stretch the
established limits,

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.160
and you need to figure out
that to push the envelopes

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.200
means stretch
established limits.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.000
This is a idiom for those
of you who are not native.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.340
And the answer is envelope.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:50.270
A simple question is the
chapels of these colleges were

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.750
designed by this architect?

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:56.400
And you need to figure out that
Christopher Wren is the answer.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.590
Of course, many questions
involve a question

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:05.940
decomposition.

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.430
So here's an example
of a real question.

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.790
Of the four countries in the
world that the US does not

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:16.100
have diplomatic relations with,
the one that's farthest north?

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.800
So it's pretty much
asking several questions.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.079
One is the sort of
inner sub-question.

00:46:23.079 --> 00:46:24.870
The four countries in
the world that the US

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.930
doesn't have relations with,
and the outer sub-question

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:32.340
is, now that you know the answer
of these four countries, which

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.390
is the farthest north?

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.040
You do a little
bit of arithmetics

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.660
and you find the
answer is North Korea.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.090
And of course, this is very
similar to what started years

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.590
before, is pretty much
you decompose the question

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:47.580
and you solve them
separately, as I showed you

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.330
a few minutes ago.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.270
So Watson actually
took a bunch of ideas

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.210
from START, the Ternary
expression representation,

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.880
the natural language
annotations idea,

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.180
the object-property-value
data model, and the question

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.390
decomposition model,
and applied them

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:10.300
when they could really
analyze syntactically

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.020
the question where the question
was not too convoluted,

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.570
and when there was a
semi-structured resource,

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:19.860
or several resources,
to find an answer.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.050
But many questions, of
course, were not like that,

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.960
and stretching the
envelope is one example.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.080
And so Watson used some
statistical machine

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.700
learning approaches and
they did quite a good job

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.930
of looking at a lot of
data to resolve and answer

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.940
these questions.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.790
Their pipeline is,
really, miles long,

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:45.080
because each of
these bullets has

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.540
three, which are
a bunch of bullets

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.990
with a bunch of bullets that
the task that they were doing,

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:54.990
but on a very high level, they
needed to content acquisition.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.490
Pretty much, all right,
there was a problem.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:02.160
The company, Jeopardy!, told
them the web cannot be part

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.610
of that because everything
that Google knows everything.

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:06.940
So what is it that
you guys are doing?

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.410
So they had, so what would you
do if somebody tells you you

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:11.400
cannot use the word?

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:15.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:16.410
BORIS KATZ: What's that?

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:18.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:21.980
BORIS KATZ: Well, you
pretty much bring the web

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:24.060
and put it in a box.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.930
And this is what IBM did.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.870
They took every repository,
interesting repository,

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.810
every database, every
encyclopedia, every newspaper

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:37.520
collection, I forgot where
the blogs existed at the time,

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.820
and just had a lot
of clusters and a lot

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:42.440
of memory and
everything was there.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.040
So now they could tell
the company no web.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.154
We are smart without the web.

00:48:48.154 --> 00:48:49.320
So that was the first thing.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:53.420
Then, they actually, there were
some wonderful natural language

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:57.090
processing people do, so
they did question answering,

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:58.670
they searched the documents.

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:03.410
So what they really did, they
took the clue, they call it,

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:08.300
the question, throw it on
not the web but on their web,

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:12.080
find tens of
thousands of documents

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:17.680
that even closely
match these keywords,

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.910
and then the real
work just started.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:22.790
They had this kind of filtering,
that kind of filtering,

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.870
this kind of answer
generation, that kind of.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:28.010
They would score it, they
will pay new evidence,

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:30.200
they will do it again,
they will do ranking,

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.930
and they will decide how
confident they are about that

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:35.360
and then they will
decide whether it's worth

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.430
how much they spent,
incredible amount of time

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:40.820
figuring out how much money.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.040
I don't actually know
much about Jeopardy!,

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:47.030
but apparently you have to tell
them how good you answered.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:50.780
Well, you need to come up with
a number of how expensive you

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.060
are, how much you
will make if you win,

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.240
and how much you
lose if you lose.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:07.040
And so they did it all and
they built a wonderful system.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.740
In the beginning, when
I started going there,

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.450
that was very, very slow.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:16.520
It ran on a single processor
and really took two hours

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.870
to do this pipeline.

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:23.210
But that, if you think about it,
it's a very plausible problem.

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:25.760
You could send it
all to, in that case,

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.610
I think by the end it was
like several thousand cores,

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:33.260
and they easily reduced
the time to three seconds,

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:39.460
which was passable and
doable for the competition.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.100
And so they won,
as you all know.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.100
It's a great system
that nails the state

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.240
of the art in natural
language, in QA, in information

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.790
retrieval, machine learning.

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:56.020
It's a great piece
of engineering.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:00.946
It reignited, no doubts about
it, public interest in AI.

00:51:00.946 --> 00:51:04.950
It brought new talented
people in our field.

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.300
So this is all great news.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:13.880
But let's look at some
of the sort of blunders

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:19.970
that occurred, well, both before
the competition and after.

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.040
I had a whole bunch,
a collection of those.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.870
I'll just show you a couple.

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.850
This actually happened
before the competition

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:27.510
so they figured the problem.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.600
So the question was,
again, it's called

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.160
a clue, in a category of
letters, in the late 40s,

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:39.230
a mother wrote to this artist
that his picture, number nine,

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.960
looked like her son's
finger paintings.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.840
Well, for those who
are quick at that,

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.380
I'm sure you know that
it's Jackson Pollock,

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:51.090
but Watson sent Rembrandt
for some stupid reasons.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:54.760
It failed to recognize that
late 40s referred to 1940s,

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:58.700
or rather they thought it's
made in previous centuries,

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:06.820
and apparently, it has something
to do with number nine.

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:10.010
That was in a bunch of
documents related to Rembrandt

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:12.900
and so it said Rembrandt.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.850
Another more famous blunder,
because that happened

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:20.540
at the competition, the
category was US city,

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:23.540
and the question was
its, which is a series,

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:27.860
largest airport is named
for a World War II hero,

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:32.210
and its second largest
for a World War II battle.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.430
And again, those of
you quick at that

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:38.060
will know that in Chicago
there is this O'Hare Airport

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:41.690
and he happened to be
famous here from the world.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.880
And the second
airport called Midway,

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.520
which is a famous battle
in the Second World War.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:50.230
And Watson presses the
button and says Toronto.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:53.540
And there's a sort of
gasp in the audience,

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.270
and also like tens of millions
or hundreds of millions

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:59.757
television sets
around the world.

00:52:59.757 --> 00:53:01.465
And again, there are
some stupid reasons.

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.430
Watson did machine
learning, as I said,

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:10.220
and it statistically figured
out the category part

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:14.240
of the clue, which in this
case, since this is a US city,

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.210
it might not be that
important, so we should

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:18.530
pay less attention to it.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:22.460
It also knew that Toronto
team playing in baseball--

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:23.100
is that true?

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:23.900
Yes.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:27.300
In the US baseball
league, and that, in fact,

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.320
one of Toronto's airport
is named for a hero.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.600
Although, it's a
World War I hero.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.350
So it put it all together
and said Toronto.

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:41.420
In any case, it won anyway
because it did an amazing job

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.700
on answering many
more questions,

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:46.970
but the question to us
is whether this is what

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:48.350
we should all be striving for.

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.470
I'm certainly all in favor
of building awesome systems,

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:55.430
and they did, and I explained
to you why I think it's good,

00:53:55.430 --> 00:54:02.300
but IBM has not created a
machine that thinks like us.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:06.110
And what's in success
didn't bring us

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:09.620
even an inch closer
to understanding

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:12.720
human intelligence.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.930
And the positive
news, of course,

00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:20.360
is that there was those
blunders, should remind us

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.370
that the problem is
waiting to be solved

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:27.480
and you guys are in good
positions to try to do that.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.720
And that should be our
next big challenge.
