00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:22.640
JOSH TENENBAUM: I'm
going to be talking

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.580
about computational
cognitive science.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.590
In the brains, minds,
and machines landscape,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.250
this is connecting the
minds and the machines part.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.900
And I really want
to try to emphasize

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.870
both some conceptual themes
and some technical themes that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.640
are complimentary
to a lot of what

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.490
you've seen for the first
week or so of the class.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.357
That's going to include ideas
of generative models and ideas

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:46.940
of probabilistic
programs, which we'll

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.710
see a little bit
here and a lot more

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.570
in the tutorial
in the afternoon.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.060
And on the cognitive
side, maybe we

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.360
could sum it up by
calling it common sense.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.420
Since this is meant to
be a broad introduction--

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.550
and I'm going to try to
cover from some very basic

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.849
fundamental things that people
in this field were doing maybe

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:10.220
10 or 15 years ago up until
the state of the art current

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.150
research--

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.070
I want to try to give
that whole broad sweep.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.570
And I also want to
try to give a bit

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.210
of a sort of philosophical
introduction at the beginning

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.490
to set this in context with
the other things you're

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.050
seeing in the summer school.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.590
I think it's fair to say that
there are two different notions

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.957
of intelligence that are
both important and are

00:01:27.957 --> 00:01:30.290
both interesting to members
of this center in the summer

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.250
school.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.640
The two different
notions are what

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.960
I think you could call
classifying, recognizing

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.630
patterns in data, and what
you could call explaining,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.687
understanding,
modeling the world.

00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:51.020
So, again, there's the notion
of classification, pattern

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.470
recognition, finding
patterns in data

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.150
and maybe patterns that connect
data to some task you're

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.060
trying to solve.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.810
And then there's this
idea of intelligence

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.900
as explaining, understanding,
building a model of the world

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.280
that you can use to play
on and solve problems with.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.202
I'm going to emphasize here
notions of explanation,

00:02:10.202 --> 00:02:11.660
because I think
they are absolutely

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.120
central to intelligence,
certainly in any sense

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.890
that we mean when we
talk about humans.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.540
And because they get
kind of underemphasized

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.373
in a lot of recent work
in machine learning,

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:20.764
AI, neural networks, and so on.

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:22.430
Like, most of the
techniques that you've

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.240
seen so far in other
parts of the class

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.120
and will continue to see, I
think it's fair to say they

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640
sort of fall under
the broad idea

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.570
of trying to classify and
recognize patterns in data.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.070
And there's good
reasons why there's

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.820
been a lot of attention
on these recently,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.000
particularly coming from
the more brain side.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.610
Because it's much easier
when you go and look

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.970
in the brain to understand
how neural circuits do things

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.260
like classifying
recognized patterns.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.180
And it's also, I
think with at least

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.190
certain kinds of
current technology,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.230
much easier to get
machines to do this, right?

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.560
All the excitement in
deep neural networks

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.070
is all about this, right?

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.900
But what I want to
try to convince you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.470
here and illustrate a lot of
different kinds of examples

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.780
is how both of these
kinds of approaches

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.330
are probably necessary,
essential to understanding

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.900
the mind.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.330
I won't really bother to try to
convince you that the pattern

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.163
recognition approach
is essential, because I

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:17.619
take that for granted.

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.910
But both are essential and,
also, that they essentially

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.576
need each other.

00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:24.470
I'll try to illustrate a couple
of ways in which they really

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.630
each solve the problems
that the other one needs--

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.510
so ways in which ideas like
deep neural networks for doing

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.850
really fast pattern
recognition can

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.060
help to make the sort of
explaining understanding

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.830
view of intelligence much
quicker and maybe much lower

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.324
energy, but also ways in
which the sort of explaining,

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.740
understanding view
of intelligence

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.950
can make the pattern recognition
view much richer, much more

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.691
flexible.

00:03:50.691 --> 00:03:51.690
What do you really mean?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.920
What's the difference between
classification and explanation?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.600
Or what makes a
good explanation?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.190
So we're talking
about intelligence

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.130
as trying to explain your
experience in the world,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.160
basically, to build a
model that is in some sense

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.237
a kind of actionable
causal model.

00:04:06.237 --> 00:04:08.570
And there's a bunch of virtues
here, these bullet points

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.420
under explanation.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.836
There's a bunch
of things we could

00:04:10.836 --> 00:04:13.460
say about what makes
a good explanation

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.020
of the world or a good model.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.645
And I won't say too
much abstractly.

00:04:16.645 --> 00:04:19.519
I'll mostly try to illustrate
this over the morning.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.610
But like any kind of
model, whether it's

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.620
sort of more pattern
recognition classification

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.440
style or these more
explanatory type models,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.935
ideas of compactness,
unification,

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:34.810
are important, right?

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.630
You want to explain
a lot with a little.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.540
OK?

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.810
There's a term if anybody
has read David Deutsch's book

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.190
The Beginning Of Infinity.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.100
He talks about this
view in a certain form

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.550
of good explanations as being
hard to vary, non-arbitrary.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.150
OK.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.910
That's sort of in common
with any way of describing

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.020
or explaining the world.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.520
But some key features
of the models

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.670
we're going to talk about--
one is that they're generative.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.420
So what we mean by
generative is that they

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.890
generate the world, right?

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.490
In some sense, their output
is the world, your experience.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.740
They're trying to explain
the stuff you observe

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.530
by positing some hidden,
unobservable, but really

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.700
important, causal
actionable deep stuff.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.221
They don't model a task.

00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:15.220
That's really important.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.080
Because, like, if you're
used to something like,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.180
you know, end to end training
of a deep neural network

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.429
for classification where
there's an objective function

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:22.967
and the task and
the task is to map

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:24.550
from things you
experience and observe

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.360
in the world to how
you should behave,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.420
that's sort of the
opposite view, right?

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.270
These are things whose output
is not behavior on a task,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.985
but whose output is
the world you see.

00:05:32.985 --> 00:05:34.360
Because what
they're trying to do

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.240
is produce or
generate explanations.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.320
And that means they have
to come into contact.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.730
They have to basically
explain stuff you see.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.330
OK.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.910
Now, these models are not
just generative in this sense,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.170
but they're causal.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.310
And, again, I'm using
these terms intuitively.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.260
I'll get more precise later on.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.240
But what I mean by that is the
hidden or latent variables that

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.840
generate the stuff you
observe are, in some form,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.820
trying to get at the
actual causal mechanisms

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.404
in the world--

00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:03.778
the things that, if you were
then to go act on the world,

00:06:03.778 --> 00:06:06.446
you could intervene on and move
around and succeed in changing

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:07.570
the world the way you want.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.028
Because that's the point of
having one of these rich models

00:06:10.028 --> 00:06:13.540
is so that you can use it
to act intelligently, right?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.720
And, again, this is a contrast
with a approach that's

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.850
trying to find and
classify patterns that

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.377
are useful for performing
some particular task to detect

00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:22.960
oh, when I see this,
I should do this.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.779
When I see this, I
should do that, right?

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:25.820
That's good for one task.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.330
But these are meant to be good
for an endless array of tasks.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.020
Not any task, but, in
some important sense,

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.207
a kind of unbounded
set of tasks where

00:06:34.207 --> 00:06:36.790
given a goal which is different
from your model of the world--

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.390
you have your goal.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.764
You have your
model of the world.

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:42.400
And then you use that model to
plan some sequence of actions

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.540
to achieve your goal.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.770
And you change the goal,
you get a different plan.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.474
But the model is the
invariant, right?

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:49.390
And it's invariant,
because it captures what's

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.280
really going on causally.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.930
And then maybe the
most important,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.420
but hardest to really get a
handle on, theme-- although,

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.510
again, we'll try to do
this by the end of today--

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.750
is that they're
compositional in some way.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.520
They consist of parts which
have independent meaning

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.660
or which have some notion
of meaning, and then ways

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.160
of hooking those together
to form larger wholes.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.000
And that gives a kind of
flexibility or extensibility

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.990
that is fundamental,
important to intelligence--

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.690
the ability to not just,
say, learn from little data,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.450
but to be able to take what
you've learned in some tasks

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.940
and use it instantly,
immediately, on tasks you've

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.710
never had any training for.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.890
It's, I think, really only with
this kind of model building

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.470
view of intelligence
that you can do that.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.930
I'll give one other
motivating example--

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.000
just because it will
appear in different forms

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.480
throughout the talk--

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.010
just of the difference between
classification and explanation

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.330
as ways of thinking about the
world with thinking about,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.240
in particular, planets and
just the orbits of objects

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.410
in the solar system.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.441
That could include objects,
basically, on any one planet,

00:07:51.441 --> 00:07:51.940
like ours.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.520
But think about the problem
of describing the motions

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.740
of the planets around the sun.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.030
Well, there's some phenomena.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.560
You can make observations.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.990
You could observe
them in various ways.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.450
Go back to the early
stages of modern science

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.850
when the data by which the
phenomena were represented--

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.550
you know, things like
just measurements

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:15.490
of those light spots in the
sky, over nights, over years.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.870
So here are two ways to capture
the regularities in the data.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.030
You could think about Kepler's
laws or Newton's laws.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.420
So just to remind you,
these are Kepler's laws.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.930
And these are Newton's laws.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.513
I won't really go
through the details.

00:08:28.513 --> 00:08:31.000
Probably, all of you know
these or have some familiarity.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.500
The key thing is
that Kepler's laws

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.000
are laws about patterns of
motion and space and time.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.030
They specify the shape of the
orbits, the shape of the path

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.860
that the planets trace
out in the solar system.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.570
Not in the sky, but in
the actual 3D world--

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.630
the idea that the
orbits, the planets,

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.750
are an ellipse with
the sun at one focus.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.570
And then they give some other
mathematical regularities

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.220
that describe, in
a sense, how fast

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.050
the planets go around
the sun as a function

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.300
of the size of the
orbit and the fact

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.310
that they kind of go
faster at some places

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.690
and slower at other places
in the orbit, right?

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.970
OK.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.250
But in a very
important sense, they

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.860
don't explain why they
do these things, right?

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.500
These are patterns which,
if I were to give you

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.424
a set of data, a
path, and I said,

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:19.090
is this a possible
planet or not-- maybe

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.800
there's a undiscovered planet.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.510
And this is possibly
that, or maybe

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.109
this is some other
thing like a comet.

00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:25.900
And you could use this
to classify and say,

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.710
yeah, that's a planet,
not a comet, right?

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.350
And, you know, you could
use them to predict, right?

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.230
If you've observed a planet
over some periods of time

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.064
in the sky, then you
could use Kepler's laws

00:09:37.064 --> 00:09:39.063
to basically fit an ellipse
and figure out where

00:09:39.063 --> 00:09:40.210
it's going to be later on.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.260
That's great.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.120
But they don't explain.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.330
In contrast, Newton's laws
work like this, right?

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.030
Again, there's several
different kinds of laws.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.030
There's, classically,
Newton's laws of motion.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.240
These ideas about inertia and
F equals MA and every action

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.910
produces an equal and opposite
reaction, again, don't

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.129
say anything about planets.

00:10:00.129 --> 00:10:01.920
But they really say
everything about force.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.100
They talk about how forces
work and how forces interact

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.080
and combine and compose--

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.120
compositional--
to produce motion

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.080
or, in particular, to
produce the change of motion.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.460
That's acceleration or the
second derivative of position.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.250
And then there's this other law,
the law of gravitational force,

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.350
so the universal
gravitation, which

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.260
specifies in particular how
you get one particular force.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.450
That's the name of the
force we call gravity

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.970
as a function of the
mass of the two bodies

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.830
and the square
distance between them

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.295
and some unknown
constant, right?

00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:37.170
And the idea is you put
these things together

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.790
and you get Kepler's law.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.250
You can derive the fact
that the planets have

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.140
to go that way from
the combination

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.410
of these laws of motion and
the law of gravitational force.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.900
So there's a sense in which
the explanation is deeper

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.530
and that you can derive the
patterns from the explanation.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.960
But it's a lot more than that.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.500
Because these laws
don't just explain

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.450
the motions of the
planets around the sun,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.200
but a huge number
of other things.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.690
Like, for example,
they don't just

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.890
explain the orbits
of the planets,

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.640
but also other things
in the solar system.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.000
Like, you can use them
to describe comets.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.180
You can use them to describe the
moon going around the planets.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.980
And you can use
them to explain why

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.920
the moon goes around the
Earth and not around the sun

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.780
in that sense, right?

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.830
You can use them to explain not
just the motions of the really

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.330
big things in the solar system,
but the really little things

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.230
like, you know, this, and to
explain why when I drop this

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.980
or when Newton famously
did or didn't drop an apple

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.800
or had an apple drop
on its head, right?

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.430
That, superficially, seems to
be a very different pattern,

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.930
right?

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.600
It's something going down
in your current frame

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.380
of reference.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.500
But the very same laws
describe exactly that

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.230
and explain why the moon
goes around the Earth,

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.600
but the bottle or
the apple goes down

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.890
in my current
experience of the world.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.920
In terms of things like
causal and actionable ideas,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.612
they explain how you could get
a man to the moon and back again

00:11:59.612 --> 00:12:01.320
or how you could build
a rocket to escape

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.730
the gravitational field to not
only get off the ground the way

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.720
we're all on the ground, but
to get off or out of orbiting

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.480
around and get to orbiting
some other thing, right?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.810
And it's all about
compositionality

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.220
as well as causality.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.860
In order to escape the
Earth's gravitational field

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.277
or get to the moon
and back again,

00:12:21.277 --> 00:12:22.901
there's a lot of
things you have to do.

00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:24.630
But one of the key
things you have to do

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.240
is generate some
significant force

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.617
to oppose, be
stronger, than gravity.

00:12:29.617 --> 00:12:31.950
And, you know, Newton really
didn't know how to do that.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.932
But some years later,
people figured out,

00:12:33.932 --> 00:12:35.640
you know, by chemistry
and other things--

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.280
explosions, rockets-- how to
do some other kind of physics

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.140
which could generate a force
that was powerful enough

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:48.780
for an object the size of
rocket to go against gravity

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.410
and to get to where you need
to be and then to get back.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.860
So the idea of a causal
model, which in this case

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.340
is the one based on forces, and
compositionality-- the ability

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.832
to take the general laws
of forces, laws about one

00:13:01.832 --> 00:13:03.540
particular kind of
force that's generated

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.730
by this mysterious
thing called mass,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.320
some other kinds
of forces generated

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.410
by exploding chemicals--
put those all together

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:11.970
is hugely powerful.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.150
And, of course, this
as an expression

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.040
of human intelligence--
you know,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.110
the moon shot is a
classic metaphor.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.850
Demis used it in his talk.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.730
And I think if we really
want to understand

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.640
the way intelligence works in
the human mind and brain that

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.320
could lead to this,
you have to go back

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.697
to the roots of intelligence.

00:13:29.697 --> 00:13:31.030
You've heard me say this before.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.870
And I'm going to do
this more by today.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.370
We want to go back to the roots
of intelligence in even very

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.610
young children where you already
see all of this happening,

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.990
right?

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.560
OK.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.643
So that's the big picture.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.240
I'll just point you.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.615
If you want to learn more
about the history of this idea,

00:13:47.615 --> 00:13:52.290
a really nice thing to read
is this book by Kenneth Craik.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.370
He was an English scientist sort
of a contemporary of Turing,

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.770
also died tragically
early, although

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.132
from different tragic causes.

00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:03.840
He was, you know, one
of the first people

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.480
to start thinking about
this topic of brains, minds,

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.930
and machines,
cybernetics type ideas,

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.270
using math to describe
how the brain works, how

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.091
the mind might work in a brain.

00:14:15.091 --> 00:14:16.590
As you see when you
read this quote,

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.548
he didn't even really
know what a computer was.

00:14:18.548 --> 00:14:20.850
Because it was
pre-Turing, right?

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.990
But he wrote this wonderful
book, very short book.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.334
And I'll just quote here
from one of the chapters.

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:29.250
The book was called The
Nature Of Explanation.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.789
And it was sort of both a
philosophical study of that

00:14:31.789 --> 00:14:33.330
and how explanation
works in science,

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.280
like some of the ideas I was
just going through, but also

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.920
really arguing in very common
sense and compelling ways

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.572
why this is a key idea
for understanding how

00:14:41.572 --> 00:14:42.780
the mind and the brain works.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.620
And he wasn't just
talking about humans.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.726
Well, you know, these ideas
have their greatest expression

00:14:49.726 --> 00:14:51.600
in some form, their most
powerful expression,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.670
in the human mind.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.610
They're also important
ones for understanding

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.890
other intelligent brains.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.420
So he says here, "one of the
most fundamental properties

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.720
of thought is its power
of predicting events.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.640
It enables us, for
instance, to design bridges

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.194
with a sufficient
factor of safety

00:15:08.194 --> 00:15:09.610
instead of building
them haphazard

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.680
and waiting to see
whether they collapse.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.400
If the organism carries a small
scale model of external reality

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.990
into its own possible
actions within its head,

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.200
it is able to try out
various alternatives,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.880
conclude which is
the best of them,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.250
react to future situations
before they arise,

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.960
utilize the knowledge
of past events

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.750
in dealing with the
present and future

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.790
and in every way to react
in a much fuller, safer,

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.150
and more competent manner to
the emergencies which face it."

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.920
So he's just really
summing up this

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.270
is what intelligence is about--

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.160
building a model of
the world that you

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.010
can manipulate and plan on
and improve, think about,

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.970
reason about, all that.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.280
And then he makes this
very nice analogy,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.910
a kind of cognitive
technology analogy.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.091
"Most of the greatest
advances of modern technology

00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:53.590
have been instruments
which extended

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.890
the scope of our sense organs,
our brains, or our limbs--

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.750
such, our telescopes
and microscopes,

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.740
wireless calculating machines,
typewriters, motor cars, ships,

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.620
and airplanes."

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.120
Right?

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.790
He's writing in 1943, or that's
when the book was published,

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.170
writing a little before that.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:08.440
Right?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.565
He didn't even have
the word computer.

00:16:09.565 --> 00:16:11.940
Or back then, computer meant
something different-- people

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.280
who did calculations, basically.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.374
But same idea-- that's
what he's talking about.

00:16:17.374 --> 00:16:19.540
He's talking about a computer,
though he doesn't yet

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.470
have the language
quite to describe it.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.950
"Is it not possible, therefore,
that our brains themselves

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.860
utilize comparable mechanisms
to achieve the same ends

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.900
and that these mechanisms
can parallel phenomena

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.340
in the external world
as a calculating machine

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.917
can parallel with development
of strains in a bridge?"

00:16:33.917 --> 00:16:35.500
And what he's saying
is that the brain

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.870
is this amazing kind of
calculating machine that,

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:42.945
in some form, can parallel
the development of forces

00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:44.320
in all sorts of
different systems

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.790
in the world and
not only forces.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.990
And, again, he doesn't
have the vocabulary

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.900
in English or the math really
to describe it formally.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.210
That's, you know, why this
is such an exciting time

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.080
to be doing all
these things we're

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.829
doing is because now
we're really starting

00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:59.830
to have the vocabulary
and the technology

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.500
to make good on this idea.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.000
OK.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.790
So that's it for the big picture
philosophical introduction.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.770
Now, I'll try to
get more concrete

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:12.369
with the questions that
have motivated not only me,

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.630
but many cognitive scientists.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.734
Like, why are we thinking about
these issues of explanation?

00:17:17.734 --> 00:17:19.150
And what are our
concrete handles?

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.040
Like, let's give a
couple of examples

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.550
of ways we can study
intelligence in this form.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.040
And I like to say that the
big question of our field--

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.770
it's big enough that
it can fold in most,

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.630
if not all, of our big
questions-- is this one.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.160
How does the mind get so
much out of so little, right?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.380
So across cognition
wherever you look,

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.720
our minds are building
these rich models

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.540
of the world that go way
beyond the data of our senses.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.280
That's this extension
of our sense organs

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.590
that Craik was talking
about there, right?

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.030
From data that is
altogether way too sparse,

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.670
noisy, ambiguous in
all sorts of ways,

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.600
we build models that allow us
to go beyond our experience,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.730
to plan effectively.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:58.600
How do we do it?

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.050
And you could add-- and I do
want to go in this direction.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.690
Because it is part
of how when we relate

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.000
the mind to the brain or
these more explanatory models

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.590
to more sort of pattern
classification models,

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.590
we also have to
ask not only how do

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.320
you get such a rich model of
the world from so little data,

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.220
but how do you do it so quickly?

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.110
How do you do it so flexibly?

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.740
How do you do it with
such little energy, right?

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.640
Metabolic energy is an
incredible constraint

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.120
on computation in
the mind and brain.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.000
So just to give some examples--

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.370
again, these are ones that
will keep coming up here.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.470
They've come up in our work.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.980
But they're key
ones that allow us

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.980
to take the perspective
that you're seeing today

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.750
and bring it into contact with
the other perspectives you're

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.916
seeing in the summer school.

00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:43.930
So let's look at visual
scene perception.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.850
This is just a
snapshot of images

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.841
I got searching on Google Images
for, I think, object detection,

00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:49.340
right?

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.880
And we've seen a lot of examples
of these kinds of things.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.570
You can go to the iCub and see
its trainable object detectors.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:59.625
We'll see more of this when
Amnon, the Mobileye guy,

00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:01.750
comes and tells us about
really cool things they've

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.830
done to do object detection
for self-driving cars.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.221
You saw a lot of this kind
of thing in robotics before.

00:19:07.221 --> 00:19:07.720
OK.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.720
So what's the basic sort of
idea, the state of the art,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.940
in a lot of higher
level computer vision?

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.520
It's getting a
system that learns

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.065
to put boxes around regions
of an image that contains

00:19:18.065 --> 00:19:20.440
some object of interest that
you can label with the word,

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.320
like person or pedestrian
or car or horse,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.610
or various parts of things.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.860
Like, you might not just put
a box around the bicycle,

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.370
but you might put a box around
the wheel, handlebar, seat,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:29.870
and so on.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.006
OK.

00:19:31.006 --> 00:19:32.380
And in some sense,
you know, this

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.340
is starting to get at some
aspect of computer vision,

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.360
right?

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.760
Several people have quoted
from David Marr who said,

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.100
you know, vision is
figuring out what is where

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.630
from images, right?

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.860
But Marr meant something
that goes way beyond this,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.255
way beyond putting boxes in
images with single-word labels.

00:19:53.255 --> 00:19:54.880
And I think you just
have to, you know,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.497
look around you to see that your
brain's ability to reconstruct

00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:01.330
the world, the whole
three-dimensional world

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.280
with all the objects
and surfaces in it,

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.060
goes so far beyond putting a
few boxes around some parts

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.110
of the image, right?

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.120
Even put aside the fact
that when you actually

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.800
do this in real time on
a real system, you know,

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.112
the mistakes and the gaps
are just glaring, right?

00:20:18.112 --> 00:20:19.570
But even if you
could do this, even

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.403
if you could put a box
around all the things

00:20:21.403 --> 00:20:24.050
that we could easily label,
you look around the world.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.660
You see so many
objects and surfaces

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.340
out there, all actionable.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.580
This is what this is when I
talk about causality, right?

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.040
Think about, you know,
if somebody told me

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.460
that there was some treasure
hidden behind the chair that

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.552
has Timothy
Goldsmith's name on it,

00:20:38.552 --> 00:20:40.510
I know I could go around
looking for the chair.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.455
I think I saw it
over there, right?

00:20:42.455 --> 00:20:44.080
And I know exactly
what I'd have to do.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.140
I'd have to go there,
lift up the thing, right?

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.630
That's just one of the
many plans I could make

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:51.850
given what I see in this world.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.396
If I didn't know that that
was Timothy Goldsmith's chair,

00:20:55.396 --> 00:20:57.520
somewhere over there there's
the Lily chair, right?

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.020
OK.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.340
So I know that
there's chairs here.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.800
There's little
name tags on them.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.680
I could go around, make my way
through looking at that tags,

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.045
and find the one that
says Lily and then, again,

00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:10.420
know what I have to do to go
look for the treasure buried

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.190
under it, right?

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.466
That's just one of,
really, this endless number

00:21:14.466 --> 00:21:16.090
of tasks that you
can do with the model

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.590
of the world around
you that you've

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:22.300
built from visual perception.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.090
And we don't need to get
into a debate of, you know--

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.990
here, we can do this in a
few minutes if you want--

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.150
about the difference
between, like say

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.760
for example, what Jim DiCarlo
might call core object

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.700
recognition or the kind of stuff
that Winrich is studying where,

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.490
you know, you show a
monkey just a single object

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.980
against maybe a cluttered
background or a single face

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.410
for 100 or 200
milliseconds, and you

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.040
ask a very important question.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.310
What can you get
in 100 milliseconds

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.630
in that kind of limited scene?

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.610
That's a very
important question.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.652
But the convergence of visual
neuroscience on that problem

00:21:54.652 --> 00:21:56.110
has enabled us to
really understand

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.390
a lot about the
circuits that drive

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.860
the first initial paths of some
aspects of high-level vision,

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.520
right?

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.860
But that is really only
getting out the classification

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.840
or pattern detection
part of the problem.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.720
And the other part
of the problem,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.444
figuring out the stuff in the
world that causes what you see,

00:22:13.444 --> 00:22:14.860
that is really the
actionable part

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.792
of things to guide
your actions the world.

00:22:16.792 --> 00:22:19.000
We really are still quite
far from understanding that

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.400
at least with those
kinds of methods.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.920
Just to give a few examples--

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.280
some of my favorite kind of
hard object detection examples,

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.477
but ones that show that
your brain is really

00:22:30.477 --> 00:22:32.560
doing this kind of thing
even from a single image.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.060
You know, it
doesn't just require

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.960
a lot of extensive exploration.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.370
So let's do some person
detecting problems here.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.630
So here's a few images.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.020
And let's just start with
the one in the upper left.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.531
You tell me.

00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:49.030
Here, I'll point with this, so
you can see it on the screen.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.770
How many people are in
this upper left image?

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.420
Just tell me.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.800
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.180
AUDIENCE: About 18.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.470
JOSH TENENBAUM: About 18?

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.970
OK.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.990
OK.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.235
Yeah.

00:23:01.235 --> 00:23:02.360
That's a good answer, yeah.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.670
There are somewhere between
20 or 30 or something.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.170
Yeah.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.000
That was even more precise
than I was expecting.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.500
OK.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.340
Now, I don't know.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.381
This would be a good
project if somebody is still

00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:13.210
looking for a project.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.700
If you take the best person
detector that you can find out

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.324
there or that you can build from
however much training data you

00:23:18.324 --> 00:23:20.890
find labeled on the
web, how many of those

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.151
people is it going to detect?

00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:23.650
You know, my guess
is, at best, it's

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.050
going to detect just five
or six-- just the bicyclists

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:26.786
in the front row.

00:23:26.786 --> 00:23:27.910
Does that seem fair to say?

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.160
Even that will be
a challenge, right?

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.650
Whereas, not only do you
have no trouble detecting

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.630
the bicyclists in the front
row, but all the other ones back

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.790
there, too, even though for
many of them all you can see

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.620
is like a little bit
of their face or neck

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.260
or sometimes even
just that funny helmet

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.910
that bicyclists wear.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.920
But your ability to
make sense of that

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.806
depends on understanding a lot
of causal stuff in the world--

00:23:48.806 --> 00:23:50.680
the three-dimensional
structure of the world,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.507
the three-dimensional structure
of bodies in the world,

00:23:53.507 --> 00:23:55.840
some of the behaviors that
bicyclists tend to engage in,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.160
and so on.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.350
Or take the scene in
the upper right there,

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.380
how many people
are in that scene?

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.170
AUDIENCE: 350.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.096
JOSH TENENBAUM: 350.

00:24:04.096 --> 00:24:05.720
Maybe a couple of
hundred or something.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.627
Yeah, I guess.

00:24:06.627 --> 00:24:07.960
Were you counting all this time?

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.360
No.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:08.680
That was a good estimate

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:08.760
AUDIENCE: No.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.020
JOSH TENENBAUM: Yeah, OK.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.417
The scene in the lower left,
how many people are there?

00:24:13.417 --> 00:24:14.000
AUDIENCE: 100?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.500
JOSH TENENBAUM:
100-something, yeah.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.215
The scene in the lower right?

00:24:17.215 --> 00:24:17.840
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.714
JOSH TENENBAUM: Zero.

00:24:18.714 --> 00:24:20.790
Was anybody tempted to say two?

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.740
Were you tempted to say
two as a joke or seriously?

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.895
Both are valid responses.

00:24:24.895 --> 00:24:25.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:26.445
JOSH TENENBAUM: Yeah.

00:24:26.445 --> 00:24:27.197
OK.

00:24:27.197 --> 00:24:29.530
So, again, how do we solve
all those problems, including

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.140
knowing that one in the bottom--

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.000
maybe it takes a second or so--
but knowing that, you know,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.570
there's actually zero there.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.470
You know, it's the hats,
the graduation hats,

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.470
that are the cues to
people in the other scenes.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.270
But here, again, because
we know something

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.010
about physics and the fact
that people need to breathe--

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.640
or just tend to
not bury themselves

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.890
all the way up to the
tippy top of their head,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.530
unless it's like some kind
of Samuel Beckett play

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.620
or something,
Graduation Endgame--

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.570
then, you know, there's almost
certainly nobody in that scene.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:02.584
OK.

00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:04.000
Now, all of those
problems, again,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.430
are really way beyond what
current computer vision

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.370
can do and really wants to do.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.224
But I mean, I think,
you know, the aspect

00:25:11.224 --> 00:25:12.640
of scene understanding
that really

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.989
taps into this notion of
intelligence, of explaining

00:25:14.989 --> 00:25:16.780
modeling the causal
structure of the world,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.030
should be able to do all that.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.030
Because we can, right?

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.720
But here's a problem which
is one that motivates us

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.590
on the vision side
that's somewhere

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.680
in between these
sort of ridiculously

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.930
hard by current standards
problems and one

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.202
that, you know,
people can do now.

00:25:31.202 --> 00:25:32.660
This is a kind of
problem that I've

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.262
been trying to put out there
for computer vision community

00:25:36.262 --> 00:25:37.720
to think about it
in a serious way.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.730
Because it's a big challenge,
but it's not ridiculously hard.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.230
OK.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.500
So here, this is a scene of
airplane full of computer

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.910
vision researchers,
in fact, going

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.560
to last year's CVPR conference.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.779
And, again, how many
people are in the scene?

00:25:56.779 --> 00:25:57.320
AUDIENCE: 20?

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.530
JOSH TENENBAUM: 20,50?

00:25:58.530 --> 00:25:59.850
Yeah, something like that.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.430
Again, you know, more than
10, less than 500, right?

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.260
You could count.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.530
Well, you can count, actually.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.850
Let's try that.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:14.220
So, you know, just do this
mentally along with me.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.800
Just touch, in your
mind, all the people.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.100
You know, 1, 2, 3, 4--
well, it's too hard

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.100
to do it with the mouse.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.070
Da, da, da, da, da--
you know, at some point

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:24.570
it gets a little bit hard to
see exactly how many people are

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.291
standing in the back
by the restroom.

00:26:26.291 --> 00:26:26.790
OK.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:31.587
But it's amazing how much you
can, with just the slightest

00:26:31.587 --> 00:26:34.170
little bit of effort, pick out
all the people even though most

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.432
of them are barely visible.

00:26:35.432 --> 00:26:36.390
And it's not only that.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.120
It's not just that
you can pick them out.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.580
While you only see a very
small part of their bodies,

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.288
you know where all
the rest of their body

00:26:43.288 --> 00:26:45.150
is to some degree of
being able to predict

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.580
an act if you needed to, right?

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.660
So to sort of probe this, here's
a kind of little experiment

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.680
we can do.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.390
So let's take this guy here.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.210
See, you've just got his head.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.630
And though you see his
head, think about where

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:00.630
the rest of his body is.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:07.200
And in particular,
think about where

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.872
his right hand is in the scene.

00:27:08.872 --> 00:27:10.080
You can't see his right hand.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.746
But in some sense,
you know where it is.

00:27:11.746 --> 00:27:12.720
I'll move the cursor.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.219
And you just hum
when I get to where

00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:17.220
you think his right hand
is if you could see,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.717
like if everything
was transparent.

00:27:18.717 --> 00:27:19.342
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:19.342 --> 00:27:20.629
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:20.629 --> 00:27:21.420
JOSH TENENBAUM: OK.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.260
Somewhere around there.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.560
All right, how about
let's take this guy.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.030
You can see his scalp only and
maybe a bit of his shoulder.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.520
Think about his left big toe.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.300
OK?

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.940
Think about that.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.437
And just hum when I get to
where his left big toe is.

00:27:39.437 --> 00:27:40.062
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:40.062 --> 00:27:42.137
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:42.137 --> 00:27:43.470
JOSH TENENBAUM: Somewhere, yeah.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.170
All right, so you can see we
did an instant experiment.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.080
You don't even need
Mechanical Turk.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.670
It's like recording
from neurons,

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.470
only you're each being a neuron.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.157
And you're humming
instead of spiking.

00:27:54.157 --> 00:27:56.490
But it's amazing how much you
can learn about your brain

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.417
just by doing things like that.

00:27:58.417 --> 00:28:00.750
You've got a whole probability
distribution right there,

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.170
right?

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.520
And that's a meaningful
distribution.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.230
You weren't just
hallucinating, right?

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.380
You were using a model, a
causal model, of how bodies work

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.050
and how other three-dimensional
structures work

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.962
to solve that problem.

00:28:11.962 --> 00:28:13.050
OK.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.550
This isn't just
about bodies, right?

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.590
Our ability to
detect objects, like

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.360
to detect all the
books on my bookshelf

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.940
there-- again, most of which
are barely visible, just

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:25.560
a few pixels, a small part
of each book, or the glasses

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.660
in this tabletop
scene there, right?

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.420
I don't really know any
other way you can do this.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.110
Like, any standard machine
learning-based book detector

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.100
is not going to detect
most of those books.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.770
Any standard glass
detector is not

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.320
going to detect most
of those glasses.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.490
And yet you can do it.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.615
And I don't think there's
any alternative to saying

00:28:43.615 --> 00:28:45.750
that in some sense, as
we'll talk more about it

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:50.416
in a little bit, you're kind of
inverting the graphics process,

00:28:50.416 --> 00:28:52.290
In computer science now,
we call it graphics.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.460
We maybe used to call it optics.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.210
But the way light
bounces off the surfaces

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:56.700
of objects in the
world and comes

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.980
into your eye, that's
a causal process

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.720
that your visual
system is in some way

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.272
able to invert, to model
and go from the observable

00:29:05.272 --> 00:29:07.230
to the unobservable stuff,
just like Newton was

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.650
doing with astronomical data.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:10.530
OK.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.780
Enough on vision
for now, sort of.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.720
Let's go from actually just
perceiving this stuff out there

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.000
in the world to forming
concepts and generalizing.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.250
So a problem that I've studied
a lot, that a lot of us

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.170
have studied a
lot in this field,

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.680
is the problem of learning
concepts and, in particular,

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.430
one very particular
kind of concept, which

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.650
is object kinds like
categories of objects, things

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.460
we could label with a word.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.690
It's one of the very
most obvious forms

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.190
of interesting learning that
you see in young children, part

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.065
of learning language.

00:29:36.065 --> 00:29:37.560
But it's not just
about language.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.790
And the striking thing
when you look at, say,

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.360
a child learning words--
just in particular let's say,

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.920
words that label
kinds of objects,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.430
like chair or horse
or bottle, ball--

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.970
is how little data
of a certain labels

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:54.090
or how little task
relevant data is required.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.654
A lot of other data is probably
used in some way, right?

00:29:57.654 --> 00:29:59.070
And, again, this
is a theme you've

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.929
heard from a number
of the other speakers.

00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:02.970
But just to give you some
of my favorite examples

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.860
of how we can learn
object concepts from just

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.362
one or a few
examples, well, here's

00:30:06.362 --> 00:30:08.070
an example from some
experimental stimuli

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:11.880
we use where we just made up a
whole little world of objects.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.604
And in this world, I can teach
you a new name, let's say tufa,

00:30:16.604 --> 00:30:17.770
and give you a few examples.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:18.900
And, again, you
can now go through.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.150
We can try this as a little
experiment here and just

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.470
say, you know, yes or no.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:23.830
For each of these
objects, is it a tufa?

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.038
So how about this, yes or no?

00:30:25.038 --> 00:30:25.645
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:25.645 --> 00:30:26.520
JOSH TENENBAUM: Here?

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.175
AUDIENCE: No.

00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:28.050
JOSH TENENBAUM: Here?

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:28.592
AUDIENCE: No.

00:30:28.592 --> 00:30:29.466
JOSH TENENBAUM: Here?

00:30:29.466 --> 00:30:30.150
AUDIENCE: No.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:30.420
JOSH TENENBAUM: Here?

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:30.962
AUDIENCE: No.

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:31.836
JOSH TENENBAUM: Here?

00:30:31.836 --> 00:30:32.420
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.294
JOSH TENENBAUM: Here?

00:30:33.294 --> 00:30:33.960
AUDIENCE: No.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.835
JOSH TENENBAUM: Here?

00:30:34.835 --> 00:30:35.733
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:37.206
No.

00:30:37.206 --> 00:30:38.679
No.

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:39.661
No.

00:30:39.661 --> 00:30:41.625
No.

00:30:41.625 --> 00:30:42.620
Yes.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.770
JOSH TENENBAUM: Yeah.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.270
OK.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:47.090
So first of all, how long
did it take you for each one?

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.590
I mean, it basically
didn't take you

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:52.550
any longer than it takes in one
of Winrich's experiments to get

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.110
the spike seeing the face.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.030
So you learned this
concept, and now you

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.680
can just use it right away.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.680
It's far less than a second
of actual visual processing.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.040
And there was a little
bit of a latency.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.550
This one's a little more
uncertain here, right?

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.220
And you saw that in that it
took you maybe almost twice as

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.165
long to make that decision.

00:31:12.165 --> 00:31:13.470
OK.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.460
That's the kind of thing we'd
like to be able to explain.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.919
And that means how can
you get a whole concept?

00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:20.210
It's a whole new kind of thing.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.560
You don't really
know much about it.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.060
Maybe you know it's
some kind of weird plant

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:23.893
on this weird thing.

00:31:23.893 --> 00:31:27.320
But you've got a whole new
concept and a whole entry

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.920
into a whole, probably,
system of concepts.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.740
Again, several notions of being
quick-- sample complexity,

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.570
as we say, just one
or a few examples,

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:37.340
but also the speed--
the speed in which

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.990
you formed that
concept and the speed

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.810
in which you're able to
deploy it in now recognizing

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.660
and detecting things.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.360
Just to give one other real
world example, so it's not just

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.030
we make things up-- but, for
example, here's an object.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.130
Just how many know
what this thing is?

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.414
Raise your hand if you do.

00:31:53.414 --> 00:31:55.330
How many people don't
know what this thing is?

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:55.850
OK.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:56.990
Good.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.870
So this is a piece of
rock climbing equipment.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.010
It's called a cam.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:02.781
I won't tell you
anything more than that.

00:32:02.781 --> 00:32:04.280
Well, maybe I'll
tell you one thing,

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.370
because it's kind of useful.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.880
Well, I mean, you may or
may not even need to--

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.640
yeah.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.059
This strap here
is not technically

00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:13.350
part of the piece of equipment.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.210
But it doesn't really matter.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.709
OK.

00:32:14.709 --> 00:32:17.439
So anyway, I've given you
one example of this new kind

00:32:17.439 --> 00:32:18.480
of thing for most of you.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.390
And now, you can look
at a complex scene

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.700
like this climber's
equipment rack.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.220
And tell me, are there
any cams in this scene?

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:26.900
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.191
JOSH TENENBAUM: Where are they?

00:32:28.191 --> 00:32:29.735
AUDIENCE: On top.

00:32:29.735 --> 00:32:30.610
JOSH TENENBAUM: Yeah.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:31.430
The top.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.930
Like here?

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:32.814
AUDIENCE: No.

00:32:32.814 --> 00:32:33.700
Next to there.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.120
JOSH TENENBAUM: Here.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:34.620
Yeah.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.530
Right, exactly.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.267
How about this scene, any?

00:32:38.267 --> 00:32:39.608
AUDIENCE: No.

00:32:39.608 --> 00:32:40.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.010
JOSH TENENBAUM:
There's none of that--

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:42.968
well, there's a couple.

00:32:42.968 --> 00:32:45.760
Anyone see the ones over up
in the upper right up here?

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.990
JOSH TENENBAUM: Yeah.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.823
They're hard to see.

00:32:47.823 --> 00:32:49.780
They're really dark
and shaded, right?

00:32:52.242 --> 00:32:54.700
But when I draw your attention
to it, and then you're like,

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.200
oh yeah.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.827
I see that, right?

00:32:56.827 --> 00:32:58.660
So part of why I give
these examples is they

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.970
show how the several
examples I've

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:02.470
been giving, like
the object concept

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.511
learning thing, interacts
with the vision, right?

00:33:04.511 --> 00:33:06.010
I think your ability
to solve tasks

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.880
like this rests on your ability
to form this abstract concept

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.620
of this physical object.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.737
And notice all these ones,
they're different colors.

00:33:14.737 --> 00:33:16.820
The physical details of
the objects are different.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.270
It's only a category of
object that's preserved.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:22.060
But your ability to recognize
these things in the real world

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.250
depends on, also, the
ability to recognize them

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:26.666
in very different viewpoints
under very different lighting

00:33:26.666 --> 00:33:27.250
conditions.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.130
And if we want to explain
how you can do this-- again,

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:33.100
to go back to composability
and compositionality--

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.620
we need to understand
how you can put together

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.017
the kind of causal model
of how scenes are formed.

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:41.350
That vision is inverting--
this inverse graphics thing--

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.766
with the causal
model of something

00:33:42.766 --> 00:33:47.560
about how objects concepts
work and compose them together

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.260
to be able to learn a
new concept of an object

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:55.175
that you can also recognize new
instances of the kind of thing

00:33:55.175 --> 00:33:57.550
in new viewpoints and under
different lighting conditions

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:00.160
than the really wonderfully
perfect example I gave you here

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.230
with a nice lighting
and nice viewpoint.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.900
We can push this
to quite extremes.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.970
Like, in that scene
in the upper right,

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.150
do you see any cams there?

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:09.894
JOSH TENENBAUM: Yeah.

00:34:09.894 --> 00:34:11.440
How many are there?

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.864
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:12.864 --> 00:34:14.739
JOSH TENENBAUM: Quite
a lot, yeah, and, like,

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:16.010
all occluded and cluttered.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.510
Yeah.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.560
Amazing that you can do this.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.949
And as we'll see in
a little bit, what we

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:23.199
do with our object concepts--

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.570
and these are other
ways to show this notion

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.110
of a generative model--

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.360
we don't just classify things.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.790
But we can use them for all
sorts of other tasks, right?

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.550
We can use them to generate
or imagine new instances.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.320
We can parse an
object out into parts.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.960
This is another novel,
but real object--

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.415
the Segway personal thing.

00:34:41.415 --> 00:34:43.540
Which, again, probably all
of you know this, right?

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.550
How many people have seen
those Segways before, right?

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.050
OK.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.460
But you all probably
remember the first time

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:49.239
you saw one on the street.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:50.020
And whoa, that's really cool.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.936
What's that new thing?

00:34:50.936 --> 00:34:53.449
And then somebody tells you,
and now you know, right?

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:56.679
But it's partly related to your
ability to parse out the parts.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.930
If somebody says, oh, my
Segway has a flat tire,

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.670
you kind of know what
that means and what

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.130
you could do, at least in
principle, to fix it, right?

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.600
You can take different
kinds of things

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.010
in some category like
vehicles and imagine

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.690
ways of combining
the parts to make yet

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.610
other new either real or
fanciful vehicles, like that C

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.380
to the lower right there.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.040
These are all things you
do from very little data

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.650
from these object concepts.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:27.010
Moving on and then both
back to some examples

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.310
you saw Tomer and I talk
about on the first day

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.500
in our brief
introduction and what

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.470
we'll get to more by the end
of today, examples like these.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.360
So Tomer already
showed you the scene

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.470
of the red and the blue ball
chasing each other around.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.270
I won't rehearse that example.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:46.400
I'll show you another
scene that is more famous.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:46.900
OK.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.067
Well, so for the people
who haven't seen it,

00:35:49.067 --> 00:35:50.650
you can never watch
it too many times.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.066
Again, like that one, it's
just some shapes moving around.

00:35:53.066 --> 00:35:56.050
It was done in the
1940s, that golden age

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:58.690
for cognitive science as
well as many other things.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:03.310
And much lower technology
of animation, it's

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:06.222
like stop-action
animation on a table top.

00:36:06.222 --> 00:36:07.930
But just like the
scene on the left which

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:09.760
is done with computer
animation, just

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.610
from the motion of a few shapes
in this two-dimensional world,

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.350
you get so much.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.600
First of all, you get physics.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.755
Let's watch it again.

00:36:17.755 --> 00:36:19.180
It looks like
there's a collision.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.380
It's just objects,
shapes moving.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.190
But it looks like one thing
is banging into another.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.110
And it looks like they're
characters, right?

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.430
It looks like the big one is
kind of bullying the other one.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.240
It's sort of backed
him up against the wall

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.240
scaring them off, right?

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.270
Does you guys see that?

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.830
The other one was hiding.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:34.960
Now, this one goes
in to go after him.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.820
It starts to get a
little scary, right?

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.224
Cue the scary music if
it was a silent movie.

00:36:39.224 --> 00:36:40.390
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, OK.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.160
You can watch the end of
it on YouTube if you want.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.210
It's quite famous.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:45.290
So I won't show
you the end of it.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.620
But in case you're getting
nervous, don't worry.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.820
It ends happily, at least for
two of the three characters.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.730
From some combination of all
your experiences in your life

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.100
and whatever evolution
genetics gave you

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.780
before you came
out into the world,

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.740
you've built up a model that
allows you to understand this.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.410
And then it's a separate,
but very interesting,

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:03.430
question and harder one.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.239
How do you get to
that point, right?

00:37:05.239 --> 00:37:07.030
The question of the
development of the kind

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:08.530
of commonsense
knowledge that allows

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.945
you to parse out just the
motion into both forces,

00:37:10.945 --> 00:37:13.390
you know, one thing hitting
another thing, and then

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.892
the whole mental state structure
and the sort of social who's

00:37:16.892 --> 00:37:18.100
good and who's bad on there--

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.130
I mean, because,
again, most people

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.088
when they see this and
think about a little bit

00:37:21.088 --> 00:37:24.160
see some of the characters
as good and others as bad.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.450
How that knowledge develops
is extremely interesting.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.340
We're going to see a lot more
of the more experiments, how

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:34.090
we study this kind of thing
in young children, next week.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.132
And we'll talk more about
the learning next week.

00:37:36.132 --> 00:37:37.631
We'll see how much
of that I get to.

00:37:37.631 --> 00:37:39.267
What I want to
talk about here is

00:37:39.267 --> 00:37:41.350
sort of general issues of
how the knowledge works,

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.510
how you deploy it, how
you make the inferences

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:45.110
with the knowledge, and a
little bit about learning.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.690
Maybe we'll see if we have
time for that at the end.

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:48.273
But they'll be more
of that next week.

00:37:48.273 --> 00:37:52.974
I think it's important to
understand what the models are,

00:37:52.974 --> 00:37:55.390
these generative models that
you're building of the world,

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.890
before you actually
study learning.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:59.380
I think there's a danger
if you study learning.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.680
Without having the right target
of learning, you might be--

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.580
to take a classic analogy--

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.560
trying to get to the
moon by climbing trees.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.080
How about this?

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.755
Just to give one example
that is familiar,

00:38:18.755 --> 00:38:20.630
because we saw this
wonderful talk by Demis--

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.350
and I think many people
had seen the DeepMind work.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.720
And I hope everybody
here saw Demis' talk.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.210
This is just a couple of
slides from their Nature paper,

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:38.510
where, again, they had
this deep Q-network, which

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.970
is I think a great
example of trying

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.450
to see how far you can go with
this pattern recognition idea,

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:45.020
right?

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.186
In a sense, what this network
does, if you remember,

00:38:47.186 --> 00:38:49.650
is it has a bunch of sort
of convolutional layers

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:50.900
and of fully connected layers.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.080
But it's mapping.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.370
It's learning a feedforward
mapping from images

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.170
to joystick action.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.180
So it's a perfect
example of trying

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:01.907
to solve interesting
problems of intelligence.

00:39:01.907 --> 00:39:03.740
I think that the problems
of video gaming AI

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.936
are really cool ones.

00:39:05.936 --> 00:39:07.310
With this pattern
classification,

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.018
they're basically
trying to find patterns

00:39:09.018 --> 00:39:10.790
of pixels in Atari
video games that

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.375
are diagnostic of
whether you should

00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:14.000
move your joystick
this way or that way

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.664
or press the button this
way or that way, right?

00:39:16.664 --> 00:39:18.080
And they showed
that that can give

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.990
very competitive performance
with humans when you give it

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.660
enough training data and with
clever training algorithms,

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.250
right?

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:28.160
But I think there's also an
important sense in which what

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.680
this is doing is quite
different from what

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.660
humans are doing
when they're learning

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.310
to play one of these games.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.800
And, you know, Demis, I
think is quite aware of this.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.490
He made some of these
points in his talk

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.760
and, informally,
afterwards, right?

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.710
There's all sorts of
things that a person

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.960
brings to the problem of
learning an Atari video game,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.470
just like your question of what
do you bring to learning this.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.150
But I think from a
cognitive point of view,

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:52.790
the real problem
of intelligence is

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:55.454
to understand how learning
works with the knowledge

00:39:55.454 --> 00:39:56.870
that you have and
how you actually

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.190
build up that knowledge.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.770
I think that at least
the current DeepMind

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.360
system, the one that was
published a few months ago,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.020
is not really getting
that question.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.630
It's trying to see how much
you can do without really

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.290
a causal model of the world.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.590
But as I think Demis
showed in his talk,

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:17.415
that's a direction,
among many others,

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:20.409
that I think they realized
they need to go in.

00:40:20.409 --> 00:40:21.950
A nice way to
illustrate this is just

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.160
to look at one
particular video game.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.880
This is a game called Frostbite.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.180
It's one of the ones
down here on this chart,

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.700
which the DeepMind
system did particularly

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.370
poorly on in terms
of getting only

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:37.550
about 6% performance
relative to humans.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:40.264
But I think it's
interesting and informative.

00:40:40.264 --> 00:40:42.680
And it really gets to the heart
of all of the things we're

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.850
talking about here.

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:48.290
To contrast how the mind system
as well as other attempts

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:52.670
to do sort of powerful scalable
deep reinforcement learning,

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.620
I'll show you another
more recent result

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.540
from a different
group in a second.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.870
Contrast how those systems
learn to play this video game

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.600
with how a human child
might learn to play a game,

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.820
like that kid over there
who's watching his older

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.230
brother play a game, right?

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:11.690
So the DeepMind
system, you know,

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:17.060
gets about 1,000 hours of
game play experience, right?

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.390
And then it chops that up
in various interesting ways

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:22.580
with the replay that
Demis talked about, right?

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.920
But when we talk about getting
so much from so little,

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.550
the basic data is about
1,000 hours of experience.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:33.020
But I would venture that
a kid learns a lot more

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.657
from a lot less, right?

00:41:34.657 --> 00:41:36.740
The way a kid actually
learns to play a video game

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:40.175
is not by trial and error
for 1,000 hours, right?

00:41:40.175 --> 00:41:42.800
I mean, it might be a little bit
of trial and error themselves.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.000
But, often, it might
be just watching

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.140
someone else play and
say, wow, that's awesome.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.040
I'd like to do that.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.540
Can I play?

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:47.900
My turn.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.550
My turn-- and wrestling
for the joystick and then

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:50.570
seeing what you can do.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.370
And it only takes
a minute, really,

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:54.200
to figure out if
this game is fun,

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.616
interesting, if
it's something you

00:41:55.616 --> 00:41:59.100
want to do, and to sort of
get the basic hang of things,

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.890
at least of what you
should try to do.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.520
That's not to say
to be able to do it.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.420
So I mean, unless you
saw me give a talk,

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.960
has anybody played
this game before?

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.460
OK.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.300
So perfect example-- let's
watch a minute of this game

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.430
and see if you can figure
out what's going on.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.920
Think about how you learn
to play this game, right?

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.780
Imagine you're watching
somebody else play.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.670
This is a video of not
the DeepMind system,

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.070
but of an expert
human game player,

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:23.660
a really good
human playing this,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.265
like that kid's older brother.

00:42:25.265 --> 00:42:30.710
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:11.767 --> 00:43:12.350
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:13.250
OK.

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.340
Maybe you've got the idea.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.600
So, again, only people
who haven't seen before,

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.295
so how does this game work?

00:43:19.295 --> 00:43:21.170
So probably everybody
noticed, and it's maybe

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.720
so obvious you didn't
even mention it,

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.050
but every time he
hits a platform,

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:24.970
there's a beep, right?

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:26.120
And the platform turns blue.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.140
Did everybody notice that?

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:27.640
Right.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.710
So it only takes like one or two
of those, maybe even just one.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.350
Like, beep, beep, woop, woop,
and you get that right away.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:34.730
That's an important
causal thing.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:37.700
And it just happened
that this guy is so good,

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.940
and he starts right away.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.790
So he goes, ba, ba
ba, ba, ba, and he's

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.200
doing it about once a second.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.970
And so there's an
illusory correlation.

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:46.410
And the same part of your
brain that figures out

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.521
the actually important and
true causal thing going on,

00:43:49.521 --> 00:43:51.020
the first thing I
mentioned, figures

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.060
out this other thing, which
is just a slight illusion.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.500
But if you started
playing it yourself,

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.480
you would quickly notice
that that wasn't true, right?

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.827
Because you'd start off there.

00:43:57.827 --> 00:43:59.910
Maybe you would have thought
of that for a minute.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.090
But then you'd
start off playing.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.170
And very quickly, you'd
see you're sitting there

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.950
trying to decide what to do.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.783
Because you're not as
expert as this person.

00:44:05.783 --> 00:44:08.107
And the temperature's
going down anyway.

00:44:08.107 --> 00:44:10.190
So, again, you would figure
that out very quickly.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:11.240
What else is going
on in this game?

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.936
AUDIENCE: He has
to build an igloo.

00:44:12.936 --> 00:44:15.316
JOSH TENENBAUM: He has
to build an igloo, yeah.

00:44:15.316 --> 00:44:16.440
How does he build an igloo?

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.300
AUDIENCE: Just by [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:18.510
JOSH TENENBAUM: Right.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.260
Every time he hits one
of those platforms,

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.820
a brick comes into play.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:26.160
And then what, when you say
he has to build an igloo?

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.395
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:28.395 --> 00:44:29.270
JOSH TENENBAUM: Yeah.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.938
And then what happens?

00:44:30.938 --> 00:44:31.906
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:31.906 --> 00:44:33.842
JOSH TENENBAUM: What, sir?

00:44:33.842 --> 00:44:38.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.070
JOSH TENENBAUM: Right.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:41.380
He goes in.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.320
The level ends, he
gets some score for.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.360
What about these things?

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.430
What are these, those
little dust on the screen?

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:50.125
AUDIENCE: Avoid them.

00:44:50.125 --> 00:44:51.250
JOSH TENENBAUM: Avoid them.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:51.749
Yeah.

00:44:51.749 --> 00:44:53.537
How do you know?

00:44:53.537 --> 00:44:55.328
AUDIENCE: He doesn't
actually [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:55.328 --> 00:44:56.240
AUDIENCE: We haven't
seen an example.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.260
JOSH TENENBAUM: Yeah.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.470
Well, an example of what?

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:00.010
We don't know what's going
to happen if he hits one.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:00.290
AUDIENCE: We assume [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.250
JOSH TENENBAUM: But
somehow, we assume-- well,

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:03.249
it's just an assumption.

00:45:03.249 --> 00:45:07.224
I think we very reasonably
infer that there's something bad

00:45:07.224 --> 00:45:08.390
will happen if he hits them.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.431
Now, do you remember of
some of the other objects

00:45:10.431 --> 00:45:11.840
that we saw on
the second screen?

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.460
There were these fish, yeah.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.106
What happens if he hits those?

00:45:16.106 --> 00:45:17.510
AUDIENCE: He gets more points

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:18.410
JOSH TENENBAUM: He
gets points, yeah.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.490
And he went out of his
way to actually get them.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:20.990
OK.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:24.132
So you basically
figured it out, right?

00:45:24.132 --> 00:45:26.090
It only took you really
literally just a minute

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:29.789
of watching this game
to figure out a lot.

00:45:29.789 --> 00:45:31.580
Now, if you actually
went to go and play it

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.170
after a minute of
experience, you

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.460
wouldn't be that good, right?

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.430
It turns out that it's hard
to coordinate all these moves.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:40.760
But you would be kind of
excited and frustrated,

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.640
which is the experience of
a good video game, right?

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.916
Anybody remember the
Flappy Bird phenomenon?

00:45:45.916 --> 00:45:46.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:47.000
JOSH TENENBAUM: Right.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.920
This was this, like,
sensation, this game that

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.300
was like the stupidest game.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.190
I mean, it seemed like
it should be trivial,

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:53.240
and yet it was really hard.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.410
But, again, you just
watch it for a second,

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:55.370
you know exactly what
you're supposed to do.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:56.953
You think you can
do it, but it's just

00:45:56.953 --> 00:45:59.010
hard to get the rhythms
down for most people.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.200
And certainly, this game
is a little bit hard

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.310
to time the rhythms.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:03.350
But what you do when
you play this game is

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:05.690
you get, from one minute,
you build that whole model

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.330
of the world, the causal
relations, the goals,

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:09.860
the subgoals.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.810
And you can formulate
clearly what

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:13.460
are the right kinds of plans.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.610
But to actually implement
them in real time,

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:18.050
but without getting killed
is a little bit harder.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:20.030
And you could say
that, you know,

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.570
when the child is
learning to walk

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:23.278
there's a similar kind
of thing going on,

00:46:23.278 --> 00:46:26.150
except usually without the
danger of getting killed, just

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:27.740
danger falling
over a little bit.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.540
OK.

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.366
Contrast that learning
dynamics-- which,

00:46:31.366 --> 00:46:32.990
again, I'm just
describing anecdotally.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.120
One of the things we'd
like to do actually as one

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.100
of our center activities
and it's a possible project

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.350
for students, either in our
center or some of you guys

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.550
if you're interested-- it's
a big possible project--

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.300
is to actually measure
this, like actually

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.290
study what do people learn
from just a minute or two

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.890
or very, very quick
learning experience

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.710
with these kinds of
games, whether they're

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:53.377
adults like us who've
played other games

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:54.835
or even young
children who've never

00:46:54.835 --> 00:46:56.030
played a video game before.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:59.157
But I think what we will find
is the kind of learning dynamic

00:46:59.157 --> 00:46:59.990
that I'm describing.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:01.323
It will be tricky to measure it.

00:47:01.323 --> 00:47:03.197
But I'm sure we can.

00:47:03.197 --> 00:47:05.780
And it'll be very different from
the kind of learning dynamics

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.170
that you get from these
deep reinforcement networks.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.074
Here, this is an example
of their learning curves

00:47:11.074 --> 00:47:12.740
which comes not from
the DeepMind paper,

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.864
but from some slightly more
recent work from Pieter

00:47:14.864 --> 00:47:16.687
Abbeel's group which
basically builds

00:47:16.687 --> 00:47:18.770
on the same architecture,
but shows how to improve

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:22.400
the exploration part of it in
order to improve dramatically

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.470
on some games, including
this Frostbite game.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:28.440
So this is the learning curve
for this game you just saw.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.180
The black dashed line
is the DeepMind system

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.140
from the Nature paper.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.390
And they will tell you
that their current system

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:36.020
is much better.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.730
So I don't know how much better.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:41.930
But, anyway, just
to be fair, right?

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:46.520
And, again, I'm essentially
criticizing these approaches

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.210
saying, from a
human point of view,

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:48.990
they're very
different from humans.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:51.950
That's not to take away from the
really impressive engineering

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:53.952
in AI, machine learning
accomplishments

00:47:53.952 --> 00:47:55.160
that these systems are doing.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.831
I think they are
really interesting.

00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:57.830
They're really valuable.

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:02.240
They have scientific value
as well as engineering value.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.450
I just want to draw the contrast
between what they're doing

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.910
and some other really important
scientific and engineering

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:09.493
questions that are
the ones that we're

00:48:09.493 --> 00:48:12.330
trying to talk about here.

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:14.692
So the DeepMind system
is the black dashed line.

00:48:14.692 --> 00:48:17.150
And then the red and blue curves
are two different versions

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.622
of the system from Pieter
Abbeel's group, which

00:48:19.622 --> 00:48:21.080
is basically the
same architecture,

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.240
but it just explores
a little bit better.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.960
And you can see that the x-axis
is the amount of experience.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.020
It's in training epochs.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.540
But I think, if I
understand correctly,

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.740
it's roughly
proportional to like

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.948
hours of gameplay experience.

00:48:31.948 --> 00:48:34.850
So 100 is like 100 hours.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:37.580
At the end, the DeepQ
network in the Nature paper

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:38.550
trained up for 1,000.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:41.150
And you're showing
there the asymptote.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.550
That's the horizontal
dashed line.

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:47.250
And then this line
here is what it does

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:48.860
after about 100 iterations.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.960
And you can see it's
basically asymptoted

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.880
in that after 10 times as much,
there's a time lapse here,

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.380
right?

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.640
10 times as much, it
gets up to about there.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.300
OK.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.810
And impressively, Abbeel's
group system does much better.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:01.970
After only 100
hours, it's already

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:04.190
twice as good as that system.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:06.680
But, again, contrast
this with humans, both

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.050
what a human would
do and also where

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.820
the human knowledge is, right?

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.860
I mean, the human
game player that you

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:20.060
saw in here, by the time it's
finished the first screen,

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:24.290
is already like up here, so
after about a minute of play.

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:27.290
Now, again, you wouldn't be able
to be that good after a minute.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:29.750
But essentially, the difference
between these systems

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:34.130
is that the DeepQ network never
gets past the first screen even

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:35.480
with 1,000 hours.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.390
And this other one gets past
the first screen in 100 hours,

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:40.760
kind of gets to about
the second screen.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.800
It's sort of midway
through the second screen.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.480
In this domain, it's
really interesting

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.862
to think about not what
happens scientifically.

00:49:47.862 --> 00:49:49.820
It's really interesting
to think about not what

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.644
happens when you had
1,000 hours of experience

00:49:52.644 --> 00:49:55.060
with no prior knowledge, because
humans just don't do that

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.740
on this or really any
other task that we

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.890
can study experimentally.

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:00.820
But you can study what humans
do in the first minute, which is

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.742
just this blip like right here.

00:50:02.742 --> 00:50:05.200
I think if we could get the
right learning curve, you know,

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.283
what you'd see is that
humans are going like this.

00:50:07.283 --> 00:50:09.830
And they may asymptote well
before any of these systems do.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:11.710
But the interesting
human learning part

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:15.090
is what's going on in the
first minute, more or less

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:19.090
or the first hour, with all of
the knowledge that you bring

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.579
to this task as well
as how did you build up

00:50:21.579 --> 00:50:22.370
all that knowledge.

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:24.190
So you want to talk
about learning to learn

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.440
and multiple task learning,
so that's all there, too.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.760
I'm just saying in
this one game that's

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.230
what you can study
I think, or that's

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:31.510
where the heart of the matter
is of human intelligence

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:32.996
in this setting.

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:34.370
And I think we
should study that.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:35.440
So, you know, what
I've been trying

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.940
to do here for the last hour
is motivate the kinds of things

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.700
we should study if
we want to understand

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.790
the aspect of intelligence
that we could call explaining,

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.710
understanding, the
heart of building causal

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:46.550
models of the world.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:47.380
We can do it.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.360
But we have to do it a
little bit differently.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.240
In a flash, that's the first
problem, I started with.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.390
How do we learn a generalizable
concept from just one example?

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:56.920
How can we discover
causal relations

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.260
from just a single observed
event, like that, you know,

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.710
jumping on the block
and the beep and so on,

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:05.720
which sometimes can go wrong
like any other perceptual

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.220
process?

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.030
You can have illusions.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.980
You can see an accident
that isn't quite right.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.521
And then you move your head,
and you see something different.

00:51:11.521 --> 00:51:14.095
Or you go into the game, and
you realize that it's not just

00:51:14.095 --> 00:51:16.220
touching blocks that makes
the temperature go down,

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.950
but it's just time.

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:21.135
How do we see forces, physics,
and see inside of other minds

00:51:21.135 --> 00:51:22.510
even if they're
just a few shapes

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.260
moving around in two dimensions?

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:27.670
How do we learn to play games
and act in a whole new world

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:30.735
in just under a minute, right?

00:51:30.735 --> 00:51:32.110
And then there's
all the problems

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.151
of language, which I'm
not going to go into,

00:51:34.151 --> 00:51:35.650
like understanding
what we're saying

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:36.899
and what you're reading here--

00:51:36.899 --> 00:51:38.290
also, versions of
these problems.

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:41.200
And our goal in our field is to
understand this in engineering

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.090
terms, to have a
computational framework that

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.790
explains how this is even
possible and, in particular,

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:47.450
then how people do it.

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:48.650
OK.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:51.901
Now, you know, in some
sense cognitive scientists

00:51:51.901 --> 00:51:54.400
and researchers, we're not the
first people to work on this.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.800
Philosophers have talked
about this kind of thing

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.455
for thousands of years
in the Western tradition.

00:51:59.455 --> 00:52:02.375
It's a version of the problem
of induction, the problem of how

00:52:02.375 --> 00:52:04.250
do you know the sun is
going to rise tomorrow

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.210
or just generalizing
from experience.

00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:09.400
And for as long as people
have studied this problem,

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.770
the answer has always
been clear in some form

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:13.840
that, again, it has to
be about the knowledge

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.420
that you bring to the
situation that gives you

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.460
the constraints that
allows you to fill in

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.300
from this very sparse data.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:24.354
But, again, if you're
dissatisfied with that

00:52:24.354 --> 00:52:26.020
is the answer, of
course, you should be.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:26.920
That's not really the answer.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.670
That just raises the
real problems, right?

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:30.220
And these are the
problems that I

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.350
want to try to
address in the more

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:37.230
substantive part of the morning,
which is these questions here.

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:40.380
So how do you
actually use knowledge

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.850
to guide learning
from sparse data?

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:43.400
What form does it take?

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.834
How can we describe
the knowledge?

00:52:44.834 --> 00:52:46.500
And how can we explain
how it's learned?

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.230
How is that knowledge
itself constructed

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.150
from other kinds
of experiences you

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:54.660
have combined with whatever,
you know, your genes have set up

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:55.710
for you?

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:58.140
And I'm going to be talking
about this approach.

00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:59.925
And you know,
again, really think

00:52:59.925 --> 00:53:01.800
of this as the introduction
to the whole day.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.674
Because you're going to
see a couple of hours

00:53:03.674 --> 00:53:06.900
from me and then also from Tomer
more hands on in the afternoon.

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:08.012
This is our approach.

00:53:08.012 --> 00:53:09.720
You can give it
different kinds of names.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.303
I guess I called it
generative models,

00:53:11.303 --> 00:53:13.830
because that's what Tommy
likes to call it in CBMM.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:14.620
And that's fine.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.320
Like any other
approach, you know,

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.290
there's no one word that
captures what it's about.

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:20.910
But these are the
key ideas that we're

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:23.100
going to be talking about.

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.620
We're going to talk a lot
about generative models

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.670
in a probabilistic sense.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.250
So what it means to
have a generative model

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:34.620
is to be able to describe the
joint distribution in some form

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.750
on your observable data with
some kind of latent variables,

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:38.250
right?

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:39.770
And then you can do
probabilistic inference

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:41.370
or Bayesian
inference, which means

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:43.504
conditioning on
some of the outputs

00:53:43.504 --> 00:53:45.420
of that generative model
and making inferences

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.580
about the latent structure,
the hidden variables,

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.900
as well as the other things.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.500
But crucially, there's
lots of problematic models,

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.050
but these ones have very
particular kinds of structures,

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:55.550
right?

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:57.930
So the probabilities
are not just defined

00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.040
in statisticians terms.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.710
But they're defined on some
kind of interestingly structured

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:03.780
representation that
can actually capture

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.347
the causal and compositional
things we're talking about,

00:54:06.347 --> 00:54:08.430
that can capture the causal
structure of the world

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:12.660
in a composable way that can
support the kind of flexibility

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.800
of learning and planning
that we're talking about.

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.030
So a key part of how
you do this sort of work

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.940
is to understand how to
build probabilistic models

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:25.050
and do inference over various
kinds of richly structured

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:26.502
symbolic representations.

00:54:26.502 --> 00:54:27.960
And this is the
sort of thing which

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.720
is a fairly new
technical advance, right?

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.300
If you look in the
history of AI as well as

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.971
in cognitive
science, there's been

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:37.470
a lot of back and forth between
people emphasizing these two

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:40.380
big ideas, the ideas of
statistics and symbols

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:41.462
if you like, right?

00:54:41.462 --> 00:54:43.170
And there's a long
history of people sort

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:45.820
of saying one of these is
going to explain everything

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.000
and the other one is not
going explain very much

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.220
or isn't even real, right?

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.819
For example, some of the debates
between Chomsky in language

00:54:52.819 --> 00:54:55.110
in cognitive science and the
people who came before him

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:57.870
and the people who came after
him had this character, right?

00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.880
Or some of the debates
in AI in the first wave

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.560
of neural networks, people
like Minsky, for example,

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.900
and spend some of the
neural network people

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.090
like Jay McClelland initially--

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:13.601
I mean, I'm mixing
up chronology there.

00:55:13.601 --> 00:55:14.100
I'm sorry.

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:16.920
But you know, you see this
every time whether it's

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.630
in the '60s or the '80s or now.

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:23.040
You know, there's a
discourse in our field, which

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.290
is a really interesting one.

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:26.389
I think, ultimately, we
have to go beyond it.

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:27.930
And what's so exciting
is that we are

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:29.500
being starting to go beyond it.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.892
But there's been this discourse
of people really saying,

00:55:31.892 --> 00:55:33.600
you know, the heart
of human intelligence

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.814
is some kind of rich
symbolic structures.

00:55:35.814 --> 00:55:37.980
Oh, and there's some other
people who said something

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:38.970
about statistics.

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:42.411
But that's like trivial or
uninteresting or never going

00:55:42.411 --> 00:55:42.910
to anything.

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:45.160
And then some other
people often responding

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.160
to those first people--
it's very much of a back

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.870
and forth debate.

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:53.590
It gets very acrimonious and
emotional saying, you know,

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:55.680
no, those symbols are
magical, mysterious things,

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.580
completely ridiculous,
totally useless, never worked.

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:03.240
It's really all
about statistics.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.370
And somehow something
kind of maybe like symbols

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:06.630
will emerge from those.

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:08.760
And I think we as a
field are learning

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.710
that neither of
those extreme views

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:12.820
is going to get us anywhere
really quite honestly

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:14.910
and that we have to
understand-- among other things.

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:16.110
It's not the only thing
we have to understand.

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.651
But a big thing we
have to understand

00:56:17.651 --> 00:56:19.200
and are starting
to understand is

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.020
how to do probabilistic
inference over richly

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.910
structured symbolic objects.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:27.150
And that means both using
interesting symbolic structures

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:29.460
to define the priors for
probabilistic inference,

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:32.400
but also-- and this moves
more into the third topic--

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.710
being able to think
about learning

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.140
interesting symbolic
representations as a kind

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:38.430
of probabilistic inference.

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:41.727
And to do that, we need to
combine statistics and symbols

00:56:41.727 --> 00:56:43.560
with some kind of notion
of what's sometimes

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.730
called hierarchical
probabilistic models.

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:48.750
Or it's a certain kind of
recursive generative model

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:51.345
where you don't just have
a generative model that

00:56:51.345 --> 00:56:53.220
has some latent variables
which then generate

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.540
your observable
experience, but where

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.010
you have hierarchies
of these things--

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:58.260
so generative models for
generative models or priors

00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:58.920
on priors.

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.420
If you've heard of hierarchical
Bayes or hierarchical models

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:03.414
and statistics, it's
a version of the idea.

00:57:03.414 --> 00:57:05.580
But it's sort of a more
general version of that idea

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:08.940
where the hypothesis space
and priors for Bayesian

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.220
inference that, you know,
you see in the simplest

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.290
version of Bayes' rule,
are not considered

00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:17.960
to be just some fixed thing
that you write down and wire up

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.720
and that's it.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.220
But rather, they
themselves could

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.036
be generated by some higher
level or more abstract

00:57:23.036 --> 00:57:24.660
probabilistic model,
a hypothesis space

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:26.610
of hypothesis spaces,
or priors on priors,

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:29.410
or a generative model
for generative models.

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:31.620
And, again, there's a
long history of that idea.

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:33.990
So, for example, some really
interesting early work

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:36.330
on grammar induction
in the 1960s

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:38.300
introduced something
called grammar grammar,

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.880
where it used the
grammar, a formal grammar,

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:45.774
to give a hypothesis base for
grammars of languages, right?

00:57:45.774 --> 00:57:47.690
But, again, what we're
understanding how to do

00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:51.410
is to combine this notion of a
kind of recursive abstraction

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:52.797
with statistics and symbols.

00:57:52.797 --> 00:57:54.380
And you put all those
things together,

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.180
and you get a really
powerful tool kit

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:57.860
for thinking about intelligence.

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.590
There's one other version of
this big picture which you'll

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:03.740
hear about both in the morning
and in the afternoon, which

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.880
is this idea of
probabilistic programs.

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:09.290
So when I would give a kind
of tutorial introduction about

00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:10.850
five years ago-- oops, sorry--

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:13.190
I would say this.

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:15.590
But one of the really
exciting recent developments

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.420
in the last few
years is in a sense

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.520
a kind of unified language that
puts all these things together.

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.490
So we can have a lot
fewer words on the slide

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:24.781
and just say, oh, it's all
a big probabilistic program.

00:58:24.781 --> 00:58:27.200
I mean, that's way
simplifying and leaving

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.610
out a lot of important stuff.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.830
But the language of
probabilistic programs

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:33.080
that you're going to see
in little bits in my talks

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.450
and much more in the
tutorial later on

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:37.760
is part of why it's a
powerful language, or really

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.960
the main reason.

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.360
It's that it just gives a
unifying language and set

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:42.780
of tools for all
of these things,

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.900
including probabilistic
models defined

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.580
over all sorts of interesting
symbolic structures.

00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:50.540
In fact any computable model,
any probabilistic model

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:53.660
defined on any representation
that's computable

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.950
can be expressed as a
probabilistic program.

00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:59.450
It's where Turing universal
computation meets probability.

00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:01.850
And everything about
hierarchical models,

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:03.890
generative models for
generative models,

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:06.890
or priors on priors, hypothesis
space by hypothesis space,

00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:08.591
can be very naturally
expressed in terms

00:59:08.591 --> 00:59:11.090
of probabilistic programs, where
basically you have programs

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:12.600
that generate other programs.

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.024
So if your model is
a program and it's

00:59:15.024 --> 00:59:16.440
a probabilistic
generative model--

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.510
so it's a
probabilistic program--

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:19.337
and you want to put
down a generative model

00:59:19.337 --> 00:59:21.170
for generative models
that can make learning

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:24.170
into inference recursively up
in higher levels of abstraction,

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:27.260
you just add a little bit more
to the probabilistic program.

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:30.170
And so it's a very both
beautiful, but also extremely

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:33.362
useful model building tool kit.

00:59:33.362 --> 00:59:34.820
Now, there's a few
other ideas that

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.281
go along with these things
which I won't talk about.

00:59:37.281 --> 00:59:38.780
The content of what
I'm going to try

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.890
to do for the rest
of the morning

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:41.431
and what you'll see
for the afternoon

00:59:41.431 --> 00:59:44.840
is just to give you various
examples and ways to do things

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.370
with the ideas on these slides.

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:47.480
Now, there's some
other stuff which

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.350
we won't say that much about.

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:50.510
Although, I think Tomer,
who just walked in-- hey--

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:52.310
you will talk a little
about MCMC, right?

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:54.632
And we'll say a little
bit about item four,

00:59:54.632 --> 00:59:56.840
because it goes back to
these questions I started off

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.412
with also that
are very pressing.

00:59:58.412 --> 00:59:59.870
And they're really
interesting ones

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:02.570
for where neural networks meet
up with generative models.

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:05.660
You know, just how can we do
inference and learning so fast

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.210
and not just from few examples--
that's what this stuff is

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.810
about--

01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:13.670
but just very quickly
in terms of time?

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:16.080
So we will say a
little bit about that.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.530
But all of these, every item,
component of this approach,

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.280
is a whole research
area in and of itself.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.655
There are people who spend
their entire career these days

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:29.060
focusing on how to make four
work and other people who

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:32.870
focus on how to use these kind
of rich probabilistic models

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:35.480
to guide planning
and decision making,

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.090
or how to relate
them to the brain.

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.074
Any one of these you could
spend more than a career on.

01:00:40.074 --> 01:00:41.990
But what's exciting to
us is that with a bunch

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:44.600
of smart people working on
these and kind of developing

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.990
common languages to
link up these questions,

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:50.570
I think we really are poised
to make progress in my lifetime

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:52.840
and even more in yours.
