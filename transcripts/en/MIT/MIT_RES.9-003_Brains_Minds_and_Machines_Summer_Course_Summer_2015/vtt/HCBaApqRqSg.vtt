JOSH MCDERMOTT: I'm going
to talk about hearing.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.850
I gather this is the
first time in this class

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.460
that, really, people have
talked about audition.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.069
And usually, when I
give talks and lectures,

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:33.860
I find it's often
helpful to just start out

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.584
by doing some listening.

00:00:35.584 --> 00:00:38.000
So we're going to start out
this morning by just listening

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.860
to some examples of
typical auditory input

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.590
that you might encounter
during the course of your day.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.760
So all you've got to do is just
close your eyes and listen.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.422
Here we go.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.088
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:50.992
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:33.540
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.070
OK.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.560
So you guys could probably
tell what all of those things

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.530
were, in case not,
here are some labels.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.860
So the first one is just a
scene I recorded on my iPhone

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.870
in a cafe.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.304
The second one was
something from a sports bar.

00:01:48.304 --> 00:01:50.720
Then there was a radio excerpt,
and then some Barry White.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.139
And the point is that
in all of those cases,

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.680
I mean, they're all
pretty different,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.096
but in all those
cases, your brain

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:59.030
was inferring an awful lot about
what was happening in the world

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.230
from the sound signal that
was entering your ears.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.730
Right?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.090
And so what makes that kind
of amazing and remarkable

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.815
is the sensory input that it
was getting, to first order,

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:08.690
just looks like this.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.900
Right?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.210
So there was sound energy
that traveled through the air.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.293
It was making your ear
drums wiggle back and forth

00:02:13.293 --> 00:02:15.762
in some particular pattern
that would be indicated

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:17.720
by that waveform there,
that plots the pressure

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.730
at your eardrum as
a function of time.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.480
And so from that particular
funny pattern of wiggles,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.750
you were able to infer
all those things.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.410
So in the case of
the cafe scene,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.110
you could tell that there
were a few people talking.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.860
You could probably
hear a man and a woman,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.020
you could tell there was
music in the background.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.030
You could hear there
was dishes clattering.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.159
You might have been able to tell
somebody had an Irish accent.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.950
You could probably
tell, in the sports bar,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.320
that people were watching
football and talking about it,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.880
and there were a
bunch of people there.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.630
You instantly recognized
the radio excerpt

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.410
as drivetime radio, that sort
of, like, standard sound.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.050
And in the case of
the music excerpt,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.370
you could probably
hear six or seven,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.870
or maybe eight
different instruments

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.550
that were each,
in their own way,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.200
contributing to the groove.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.340
So that's kind of
audition at work.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.680
And so the task of the brain is
to take the sound signal that

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.020
arrives at your ears
that is then transduced

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.770
into electrical signals by your
ears, and then to interpret it

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.071
and to figure out what's
out there in the world.

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.320
So what you're interested
in, really, is not the sound

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.680
itself.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.790
You're interested
in whether it was

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.860
a dog, or a train, or
rain, or people singing,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.210
or whatever it was.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.610
And so the interesting
and hard problem

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.410
that comes along with this is
that most of the properties

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.827
that we are interested
in as listeners are not

00:03:31.827 --> 00:03:33.410
explicit in the
waveform, in the sense

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.450
that if I hand you the
sound waveform itself,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.310
and you either look
at it, or you run sort

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.160
of standard machine
classifiers on it,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.690
it would be very difficult to
discern the kinds of things

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.066
that you, with your brain,
can very easily just report.

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:48.690
And so that's really that's the
question that I'm interested in

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.534
and that our lab
studies, namely,

00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:52.700
how is it that we derive
information about the world

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.520
from sound?

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.500
And so there's lots
of different aspects

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.844
to the problem of audition.

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:01.760
I'm going to give you a
taste of a few of them

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.044
over the course of
today's lecture.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.960
A big one that lots of
people have heard about

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.509
is often known as the
cocktail party problem, which

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.550
refers to the fact that
real world settings often

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.760
involve concurrent sound.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.310
So if you're in a room
full of busy people,

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.690
you might be trying to have a
conversation with one of them,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.564
but there'll be lots of
other people talking,

00:04:17.564 --> 00:04:19.959
music in the background,
and so on, and so forth.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.397
And so from that kind of
complicated mixed signal that

00:04:22.397 --> 00:04:24.230
enters your ears, your
brain has to estimate

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.040
the content of one particular
source of interest,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.540
of the person that you're
trying to converse with.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.870
So really, what you'd like
to be hearing might be this.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.300
AUDIO: She argues
with her sister.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.800
JOSH MCDERMOTT: But what might
enter your ear could be this.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.768
AUDIO: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:40.450
JOSH MCDERMOTT: Or
maybe even this.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.162
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:42.162 --> 00:04:43.620
JOSH MCDERMOTT: Or
maybe even this.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.007
AUDIO: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:47.590
JOSH MCDERMOTT: So
what I've done here

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.349
plotted next to the
icons are spectrograms.

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.890
That's a way of
taking a sound signal

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.181
and turning that into an image.

00:04:53.181 --> 00:04:56.330
So it's a plot of the
frequency content over time.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.120
And you can see with the single
utterance up here at the top,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.160
there's all kinds
of structure, right?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.410
And we think that your
brain uses that structure

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.910
to understand what
was being said.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.370
And you can see that, as more
and more people are added

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.360
to the party, that that
structure becomes progressively

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.110
more and more obscured,
until, by the time

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.651
you get to the bottom, it's kind
of amazing that you can kind

00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:16.260
of pull anything out at all.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.410
And yet, as you hopefully
heard, your brain

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.330
has this remarkable ability
to attend to and understand

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
the speech signal of interest.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.880
And this is an ability
that still, to this day,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.297
is really unmatched by machines.

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:34.130
So present day speech
recognition algorithms

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.290
are getting better
by the minute,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.320
but this particular
problem is still

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.620
quite a significant challenge.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.120
And you've probably
encountered this

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.930
when you try to talk to your
iPhone when you're in a car

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.040
or wherever else.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.440
Another kind of interesting
complexity in hearing

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.650
is that sound interacts with
the environment on its way

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.910
to your ears.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.800
So, you know, you
typically think of yourself

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.540
as listening to,
say, a person talking

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.915
or to some sound source, but
in reality, what's happening

00:06:01.915 --> 00:06:03.540
is something like
this picture here.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.240
So there's a speaker
in the upper right

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.589
corner from which
sound is emanating,

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:10.130
but the sound takes a whole lot
of different paths on its way

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.680
to your ears.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.724
There's the direct path,
which is shown in green,

00:06:12.724 --> 00:06:14.390
but then there are
all these other paths

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.940
where it can reflect off
of the walls in the room.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.160
So the blue lines
here indicate paths

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.110
where there's a
single reflection.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.169
And the red lines
indicate paths where

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.710
there are two
reflections, and so you

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.961
can see there's a lot of them.

00:06:25.961 --> 00:06:27.335
And so the
consequence of this is

00:06:27.335 --> 00:06:28.940
that your brain gets
all these delayed

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.830
copies of the source signal.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.280
And what that amounts to is
really massive distortion

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.790
of the signal.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.340
And this is known
as reverberation.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.219
So this is dry speech.

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.260
Of course, you're hearing
this in this auditorium

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.843
that itself has lots
of reverberation,

00:06:42.843 --> 00:06:44.714
so you're not actually
going to hear it dry,

00:06:44.714 --> 00:06:46.630
but you'll still be able
to hear a difference.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.310
AUDIO: They ate the lemon pie.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.895
Father forgot the bread.

00:06:49.895 --> 00:06:51.520
JOSH MCDERMOTT: And
this is that signal

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.780
with lots of
reverberation added,

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.240
as though you were listening to
it in a cathedral or something.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.323
Of course, you're, again,
hearing it in this room,

00:06:57.323 --> 00:06:59.682
as well.

00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:01.574
AUDIO: They ate the lemon pie.

00:07:01.574 --> 00:07:03.164
Father forgot the bread.

00:07:03.164 --> 00:07:05.330
JOSH MCDERMOTT: And you can
still hear a difference.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.942
And if the reverb in this
auditorium is swamping that,

00:07:07.942 --> 00:07:09.400
you can just look
at the waveforms.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.060
And you can see that the
waveforms of those two signals

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.710
look pretty
dramatically different,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.100
as do the spectrograms.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.600
All right?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.099
So the point is
that the consequence

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:19.690
of all of those
delayed reflections

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.250
massively distorts
the signal, all right?

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.291
Physically, there are two
really different things

00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.980
in those two cases.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.250
But again, your ability to
recognize what's being said

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.480
is remarkably invariant to the
presence of that reverberation.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.780
And again, this is an
instance where humans really

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.195
are outperforming machines
to a considerable extent.

00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:37.570
This graph is a
little bit dated.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.620
This is from, I think,
three years ago,

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.230
but it's a plot of five
different speech recognition

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.620
algorithms.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.210
And the percent
of errors they're

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.620
making when given
a speech signal

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.494
is a function of the
amount of reverberation.

00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:54.836
And so zero means that
there's no reverberation.

00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:55.960
That's the dry case, right?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.732
And so speech recognition works
pretty well without any reverb.

00:07:59.732 --> 00:08:01.690
But when you add a little
bit of reverberation,

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.310
and this is measured in terms
of the reverberation time,

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.310
it's the amount of time
that it takes the reverb

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.880
to fall off by a certain
specified amount,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.670
and 300 and 500 milliseconds
are actually very, very modest.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.830
So in this auditorium,
my guess would

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.250
be that the reverberation time
is maybe even a couple seconds.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.320
So this is, like, what you get
in a small classroom, maybe.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.950
Maybe even less than that.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.370
But you can see that it causes
major problems for speech

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.300
recognition.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.730
And it's because the
information in the speech signal

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.650
gets blurred out over
time, and again, it's

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.515
just massive distortion.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.640
So your brain is doing
something pretty complicated

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.400
in order for you to be
so robust to the presence

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.390
of the reverberation.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.150
So I run a research
group where we

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.400
study these kinds of problems.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.316
It's called the Lab for
Computational Addition

00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:50.936
in the Department of Brain
and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.

00:08:50.936 --> 00:08:52.810
We operate at the
intersection of psychology,

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.400
and neuroscience,
and engineering,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.410
where what we aspire
to do is to understand

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.800
how it is that people hear so
well in computational terms

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.690
that would allow us
to instantiate them

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.690
in algorithms that we might
replicate in machines.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.810
And so the research
that we try to do

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.050
involves hopefully
symbiotic relationships

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.140
between experiments in
humans, auditory neuroscience,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.140
and machine algorithms.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.870
And the general
approach that we take

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.160
is to start with what the
brain has to work with.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.610
And by that, I mean we try
to work with representations

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:29.170
like the ones that are in
the early auditory system.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.680
And so here's the
plan for this morning.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.690
And this is subject
to change, depending

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.630
on what kind of feedback
I get from you guys.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.370
But my general plan
was to start out

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.082
with an overview of
the auditory system,

00:09:41.082 --> 00:09:43.540
because I gather there's sort
of a diversity of backgrounds

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.030
here, and nobody's talked
about audition so far.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.490
So I was going to go
through a little overview.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.500
And then there's been
a special request

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.020
to talk about some
texture perception.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.730
I gather that there
were some earlier

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:59.470
lectures on visual texture, and
that might be a useful thing

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.160
to talk about.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.550
It's also a nice way to
understand auditory models

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.384
a little bit better.

00:10:04.384 --> 00:10:06.800
I was then going to talk a
little bit about the perception

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.500
of individual sound sources
and sort of the flip side

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.750
to sound texture,
and then conclude

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.140
with a section on
auditory scene analysis,

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.440
so what your brain
is able to do when

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.080
it gets a complicated sound
signal like you would get

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.810
normally in the world,
that has contributions

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.931
from multiple causes and
you have to infer those.

00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:27.430
OK.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.670
And so we'll take a break
about halfway through,

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.600
as I guess that's
kind of standard.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.620
And I'm happy for people to
interrupt and ask questions.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.380
OK.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.130
So the general outline
for hearing, right,

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.980
is that sound is created when
objects in the world vibrate.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.764
Usually, this is because
something hits something else,

00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:48.430
or in the case of a
biological organism,

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.330
there is some energy
imparted to the vocal cords.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.500
And the object vibrates.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.800
That vibration gets transmitted
to the air molecules around it,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.310
and you get a sound wave
that travels through the air.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.480
And that sound wave then
gets measured by the ears.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.410
And so the ear is a
pretty complicated device

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.320
that is designed
to measure sound.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.390
It's typically divided
up into three pieces.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.280
So there's the outer
ear, consisting

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.602
of the pinna and the eardrum.

00:11:14.602 --> 00:11:16.060
In functional terms,
people usually

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.162
think about this as a
directional microphone.

00:11:18.162 --> 00:11:19.120
There's the middle ear.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.810
They're these three little
bones in between the eardrum

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.816
and the cochlea
that are typically

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:27.190
ascribed the functions of
impedance matching and overload

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.689
protection.

00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:29.620
I'm not going to talk
about that today.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.760
And then there's the inner
ear that the cochlea,

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.690
which in very coarse
engineering terms,

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.500
we think of as doing some
kind of frequency analysis.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.080
And so again, at
kind of a high level,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.380
so you've got your ears here.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.440
This is the inner
ear on each side.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.850
And then those send feedforward
input to the midbrain,

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.560
and there's a few different
way stations here.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.690
The cochlear nucleus is
superior olivery complex,

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.710
the inferior colliculus, and
then the mediagenic nucleus

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.000
or the thalamus.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.829
And the thalamus then projects
to the auditory cortex.

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:05.620
And there's a couple
things at a high level

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.830
that are worth noting here.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.140
One is that the pathways
here are actually

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.420
pretty complicated, especially
relative to the visual system

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.090
that you guys have been
hearing lots about it.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:12.590
Right?

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.760
So there's a bunch of different
stops on the way to the cortex.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.150
Another interesting thing is
that input from the two ears

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.890
gets mixed at a
pretty early stage.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.790
OK.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.860
All right, so let's
step back and talk

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.740
about the cochlea for a moment.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.330
And I realize that
some of you guys

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.830
will know about
this stuff, so we'll

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.845
go through it kind of quick.

00:12:34.845 --> 00:12:36.220
Now one of the
signature features

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.110
of cochlear transduction is
that its frequency tunes.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.280
So this is an unwrapped
version of the cochlea.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.160
So if we step back
to here, all right--

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.740
so we've got the outer ear,
the ear canal, the eardrum,

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.080
those three little bones
that I told you about that

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.220
connect to the cochlea.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.470
And the cochlea is this thing
that looks like a snail.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.130
And then if we unroll that
snail and look at it like this,

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.810
you can see that
the cochlea consists

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.737
of these tubes
separated by a membrane.

00:13:02.737 --> 00:13:04.570
The membrane is called
the basilar membrane.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.160
That's worth knowing about.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:13.270
So sound enters here at the base
and sets up a traveling wave

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.480
along this membrane.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.102
So this is really a
mechanical thing that happens.

00:13:17.102 --> 00:13:19.060
So there's actually,
like, a physical vibration

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.720
that occurs in this membrane.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.260
And it's a wave that
travels along the cochlea.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.620
And one of the signature
discoveries about the cochlea

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.131
is that that traveling wave
peaks in different places,

00:13:28.131 --> 00:13:30.130
depending on the frequency
content of the sound.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:34.420
And that's schematized in these
drawings here on the right.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.250
So if the ear were to receive
a high frequency sound,

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.380
that traveling wave
would peak near the base.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.627
If it were to receive a
medium frequency sound,

00:13:43.627 --> 00:13:45.460
the wave would peak
somewhere in the middle.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.180
And a low frequency sound
would peak near the apex.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.910
And the frequency tuning, it's
partly mechanical in origin,

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.930
so that membrane, it varies
in thickness and stiffness

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.820
along its length.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.800
And there's also a contribution
that's non-linear and active,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.674
that we'll talk briefly
about it in a little bit.

00:14:05.674 --> 00:14:06.590
So this is a close up.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.490
This is a cross-section.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.280
So imagine you took this
diagram and you kind of cut it

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.200
in the middle.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.310
This is a cross-section
of the cochlea.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.594
So this here is the
basilar membrane,

00:14:15.594 --> 00:14:17.260
and this is the organ
of Corti that sits

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.250
on top of the basilar membrane.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.520
And so if you look
closely, you can

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.080
see that there's
this thing in here.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.480
This is the inner hair cell.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.460
And that's the guy that
does the transduction that

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.830
takes the mechanical energy
that's coming from the fact

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.780
that this thing is
vibrating up and down,

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.655
and turns that into an
electrical signal that

00:14:33.655 --> 00:14:35.510
gets sent to your brain.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.517
And so the way
that that works is

00:14:37.517 --> 00:14:39.100
that there is this
other membrane here

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.020
called the tectorial membrane.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.261
And the hair cells got these
cilia that stick out of it.

00:14:44.261 --> 00:14:45.760
And as it moves up
and down, there's

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.130
a shearing that's created
between the two membranes.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.120
The hair cell body deforms,
and that deformation

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.250
causes a change in its
membrane potential.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.514
And that causes
neurotransmitter to be released.

00:14:57.514 --> 00:14:58.930
All right, so
that's the mechanism

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.030
by which the brain takes
that mechanical signal

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.821
and turns it into an
electrical signal that

00:15:02.821 --> 00:15:05.219
gets sent to your brain.

00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:07.510
The other thing to note here,
and we'll return to this,

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.550
is that there are these
other three cells here

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.190
that are labeled as
outer hair cells.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.190
And so those kind of
do what the inner hair

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.330
cell does in reverse.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.360
So they get an electrical
signal from your brain,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.624
and that causes the hair
cell bodies to deform,

00:15:22.624 --> 00:15:25.040
and that actually alters the
motion of the basilar memory.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.950
So it's like a
feedback system that we

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.957
believe serves to amplify sounds
and to sharpen their tuning.

00:15:30.957 --> 00:15:33.040
So there's feedback all
the way to the all the way

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.340
to the cochlea.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.130
OK.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.820
So this is just another view.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.760
So here's the inner
hair cell here.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.269
As this thing
vibrates up and down,

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:43.060
there's a shearing
between these membranes.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.240
The inner hair cell
membrane potential changes,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.360
and that causes
neurotransmitter release.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.400
OK, and so here's the
really important point.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.490
So we just talked about
how there's this traveling

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.698
wave that gets set up that
peaks in different places,

00:15:56.698 --> 00:15:58.910
depending on the frequency
content of the sound.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.910
And so because to
first order only,

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.590
part of the basilar
membrane moves

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.440
for a given frequency
of sound, each hair cell

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.650
and the auditory nerve
fiber that it synopsis with,

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.880
signals only particular
frequencies of sound.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.096
And so this is sort of the
classic textbook figure

00:16:14.096 --> 00:16:15.470
that you would
see on this, where

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.830
what's being plotted
on the y-axis

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.780
is the minimum sound
intensity needed

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.910
to elicit a neural response.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.580
And the x-axis is the frequency
of a tone with which you

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.110
would be stimulating the ear.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.930
So we have a little
pure tone generator

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.750
with a knob that allows you
to change the frequency,

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.120
and another knob that allows
you to change the level.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.560
And you sit there recording
from an auditory nerve fiber,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.101
varying the frequency, and then
turning the level up and down

00:16:39.101 --> 00:16:41.100
until you get spikes
out of the nerve fiber.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.930
And so for every
nerve fiber, there

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.980
will be some frequency called
the characteristic frequency,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.730
at which you can
elicit spikes when

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.690
you present the sound
at a fairly low level.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.540
And then as you
change the frequency,

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.760
either higher or
lower, the level

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.126
that is needed to
elicit a response grows.

00:16:58.126 --> 00:17:00.250
And so you can think of
this as like a tuning curve

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.815
for that auditory nerve fiber.

00:17:01.815 --> 00:17:02.947
All right?

00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:05.280
And different nerve fibers
have different characteristic

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:05.779
frequencies.

00:17:05.779 --> 00:17:08.819
Here is just a picture that
shows a handful of them.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.060
And so together, collectively,
they kind of tile the space.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.099
And of course, given
what I just told you,

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.010
you can probably guess that
each of these nerve fibers

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.182
would synapse to a different
location along the cochlea.

00:17:22.697 --> 00:17:24.780
The ones that have high
characteristic frequencies

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.760
would be near the base.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.801
The ones that have low
characteristic frequencies

00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:28.870
would be near the apex.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:29.370
OK.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.610
So in computational terms, the
common way to think about this

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.759
is to approximate auditory nerve
fibers with bandpass filters.

00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:39.300
And so this would
be the way that you

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.260
would do this in a model.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.090
Each of these curves
is a bandpass filter,

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:46.350
so what you see on the y-axis
is the response of the filter.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.640
The x-axis is frequency.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.702
So each filter has some
particular frequency

00:17:51.702 --> 00:17:53.160
at which they give
a peak response,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.740
and then the signal
is attenuated

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.650
on either side of
that peak frequency.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:04.090
And so one way to think about
what the cochlea is doing

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:08.170
to the signal is that it's
taking the signal that

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.360
enters the ears, this
thing here-- so this

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.700
is just a sound signal,
so the amplitude just

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.736
varies over time in
some particular way.

00:18:15.736 --> 00:18:17.110
You take that
signal, you pass it

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.510
through this bank
of bandpass filters,

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.096
and then the output of
each of these filters

00:18:22.096 --> 00:18:23.970
is a filtered version
of the original signal.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.070
And so in engineering terms,
we call that a subband.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.950
So this would be the result
of taking that sound signal

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.960
and filtering it
with a filter that's

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.110
tuned to relatively low
frequencies, 350 to 520

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.800
Hertz, in this particular case.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.920
And so you can see that
the output of that filter

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.260
is a signal that varies
relatively slowly.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.480
So it wiggles up
and down, but you

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.550
can see that the wiggles are
in some sort of confined space

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.265
of frequencies.

00:18:50.265 --> 00:18:51.640
If we go a little
bit further up,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.181
we get the output
of something that's

00:18:53.181 --> 00:18:54.794
tuned to slightly
higher frequencies.

00:18:54.794 --> 00:18:56.710
And you can see that the
output of that filter

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.710
is wiggling at a faster rate.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.900
And then if we go
up further still,

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.220
we get a different thing, that
is again wiggling even faster.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:12.100
And so collectively, we can take
this original broadband signal,

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.430
and then represent it with a
whole bunch of these subbands.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.680
Typically, you might
use 30, or 40, or 50.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.540
So one thing to
note here, you might

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.700
have noticed that
there's something

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.180
funny about this picture and
that the filters, here, which

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.950
are indicated by these colored
curves, are not uniform.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:32.450
Right?

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.010
So the ones down
here are very narrow,

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.450
and the ones down
here are very broad.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:36.575
And that's not an accident.

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:38.900
That's roughly what you
find when you actually

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.090
look in the ear.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.600
And why things are
that way is something

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.010
that you could
potentially debate.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.520
But it's very
clear, empirically,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.380
that that's roughly
what you find.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.910
I'm not going to say too
much more about this now,

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.350
but remember that
because it will

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.390
become important a
little bit later on.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.580
So we can take these
filters, and turn that

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.820
into an initial stage of an
auditory model, the stuff

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.160
that we think is happening
in the early auditory system

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.080
where we've got our
sound signal that

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.510
gets passed through this
bag of bandpass filters.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.165
And you're now
representing that signal

00:20:10.165 --> 00:20:12.290
as a bunch of different
subbands, just two of which

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.950
are shown here for clarity.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.917
And the frequency selectivity
that you find in the ear

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:20.750
has a whole host of
perceptual consequences.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.330
I won't go through all
of them exhaustively.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.540
It's one of the main
deterrents of what masks what.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.780
So for instance,
when you're trying

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.110
to compress a sound signal
by turning it into an mp3,

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.690
you have to really pay attention
to the nature of these filters.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.690
And, you know, you don't
need to represent parts

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.960
of the filters that would be--

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.870
sorry, parts of the
signal would be masked,

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.680
and these filters tell
you a lot about that.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.470
One respect in which frequency
selectivity is evident

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.150
is by the ability to hear
out individual frequency

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.080
components of sounds that have
lots of frequencies in them.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.100
So this is kind of a
cool demonstration.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.420
And to kind of help us
see what's going on,

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.050
we're going to look at
a spectrogram of what's

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:04.324
coming in.

00:21:04.324 --> 00:21:05.490
So hopefully this will work.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.060
So what this little
thing is doing is

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.890
there's a microphone
in the laptop,

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.440
and it takes that
microphone signal

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.790
and turns it into a spectrogram.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.160
It's using a logarithmic
frequency scale here,

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.077
so it goes from about
100 Hertz up to 6400.

00:21:19.077 --> 00:21:20.660
And so if I don't
say anything, you'll

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.910
be able to hear the room
noise, or see the room noise.

00:21:26.124 --> 00:21:27.540
All right, so
that's the baseline.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.040
And also, the
other thing to note

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.170
is that the microphone doesn't
have very good bass response.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.087
And so the very low
frequencies won't show up.

00:21:33.087 --> 00:21:34.128
But everything else will.

00:21:34.128 --> 00:21:34.775
OK.

00:21:34.775 --> 00:21:35.441

A complex tone is

by several cancellations
and restorations

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.310

END PLAYBACK]

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:13.860
OK.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.950
And just to be clear,
the point of this, right,

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.860
is that what's happening here--

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.110
just stop that for a second--

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.457
is you're hearing what's
called a complex tone.

00:22:23.457 --> 00:22:25.790
That just means a tone that
has more than one frequency.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.360
All right?

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.160
That's what
constitutes complexity

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.590
for a psychoacoustician.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.940
So it's a complex tone.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.950
And each of the stripes, here,
is one of the frequencies.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.200
So this is a harmonic complex.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.976
Notice that the fundamental
frequency is 200 Hertz,

00:22:38.976 --> 00:22:41.600
and so all the other frequencies
are integer multiples of that.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.230
So there's 400, 600, 800, 1,000
1200, and so on, and so forth.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.920
OK?

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.680
Then what's happening is
that in each little cycle

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.012
of this demonstration,
one of the harmonics

00:22:54.012 --> 00:22:55.220
is getting pulsed on and off.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.719
All right?

00:22:55.719 --> 00:22:57.761
And the consequence of it
being pulsed on and off

00:22:57.761 --> 00:22:59.802
is that you're able to
actually hear it as, like,

00:22:59.802 --> 00:23:00.590
a distinct thing.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.710
And the fact that that
happens, that's not, itself,

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:04.920
happening in the ear.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.774
That's something
complicated and interesting

00:23:06.774 --> 00:23:08.690
that your brain is doing
with that signal it's

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:09.750
getting from the ear.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.870
But the fact you're
able to do that

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.790
is only possible by
virtue of the fact

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.820
that the signal that your
brain gets from the ear

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.550
divides the signal up in a
way that kind of preserves

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.730
the individual frequencies.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:20.910
All right?

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.120
And so this is just a
demonstration that you're

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.550
actually able to, under
appropriate circumstances,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.830
to hear out particular
frequency components

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.830
of this complicated thing, even
if you just heard it by itself,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.360
it would just sound
like one thing.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.500
So another kind of interesting
and cool phenomenon

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.280
that is related to
frequency selectivity

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.120
is the perception of beating.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.820
So how many people here
know what beating is?

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:44.660
Yeah, OK.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.190
So beating is a
physical phenomenon

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.090
that happens whenever you have
multiple different frequencies

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:54.660
that are present
at the same time.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.930
So in this case, those are
the red and blue curves

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.390
up at the top.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.680
So those are sinusoids of
two different frequencies.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.440
And the consequence of them
being two different frequencies

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.840
is that over time, they
shift in and out of phase.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.180
And so there's this
particular point here

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.280
where the peaks of the
waveforms are aligned,

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.821
and then there's this point
over here where the peak of one

00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:15.320
aligns with the
trough of the other.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.790
It's just because they're
two different frequencies

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:18.371
and they slide in
and out of phase.

00:24:18.371 --> 00:24:20.870
And so when you play those two
frequencies at the same time,

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.780
you get the black
waveform, so some linearly.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.200
That's what sounds do when
they're both present at once.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.342
And so the point at
which the peaks align,

00:24:29.342 --> 00:24:30.800
there is constructive
interference.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.620
And the point at which the
peak and the trough align,

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.036
there is destructive
interference.

00:24:34.036 --> 00:24:37.160
And so over time, the
amplitude waxes and wanes.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.070
And so physically, that's
what's known as beating.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.440
And the interesting thing
is that the audibility

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.290
of the beating is very tightly
constrained by the cochlea.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:47.360
So here's one frequency.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.731
[TONE]

00:24:48.731 --> 00:24:50.046
Here's the other.

00:24:50.046 --> 00:24:51.000
[TONE]

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.075
And then you play
them at the same time.

00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:54.082
[TONE]

00:24:54.082 --> 00:24:56.040
Can you hear that fluttering
kind of sensation?

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:56.539
All right.

00:24:56.539 --> 00:25:00.011
So that's amplitude modulation.

00:25:00.011 --> 00:25:00.510
OK.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:04.170
And so I've just
told you how we can

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.260
think of the cochlea
as this set of filters,

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.310
and so it's an interesting
empirical fact that you only

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.580
hear beating if the two
frequencies that are beating

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.071
fall roughly within the
same cochlear bandwidth.

00:25:17.071 --> 00:25:17.570
OK?

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.514
And so when they're pretty close
together, like, one semi-tone,

00:25:20.514 --> 00:25:21.680
the beating is very audible.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.397
[TONE]

00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:25.730
But as you move them further
apart-- so three semi-tones

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.150
is getting close to, roughly,
what a typical cochlear filter

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.887
bandwidth would be, and the
beating is a lot less audible.

00:25:32.887 --> 00:25:33.719
[TONE]

00:25:33.719 --> 00:25:35.760
And then by the time you
get to eight semi-tones,

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.660
you just don't hear anything.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.909
It just sounds like two tones.

00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:39.670
[TONE]

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.510
Very clear.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.986
So contrast that with--

00:25:41.986 --> 00:25:43.920
[TONE]

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.420
All right.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.240
So the important thing to
emphasize is that in all three

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.940
of these cases, physically,
there's beating happening.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.440
All right?

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.200
So if you actually were to look
at what the eardrum was doing,

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.210
you would see the
amplitude modulation here,

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:57.990
but you don't hear that.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.500
So this is just another
consequence of the way

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.830
that you're cochlea
is filtering sound.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.520
OK.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.561
All right, so we've got
our auditory model, here.

00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:07.860
What happens next?

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.270
So there's a couple of
important caveats about this.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.730
And I mentioned this, in part,
because some of these things

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.570
are--

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.947
we don't really know exactly
what the true significance

00:26:16.947 --> 00:26:18.530
is of some of these
things, especially

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.500
in computational terms.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.920
So I've just told you
about how we typically

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.780
will model with the
cochlea is doing

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.790
as a set of linear
bandpass filters.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.040
So you get a signal, you
apply a linear filter,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.080
you get a subband.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.630
But in actuality,
if you actually

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.484
look at what the
ear is doing, it's

00:26:34.484 --> 00:26:35.900
pretty clear that
linear filtering

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.990
provides only an approximate
description of cochlear tuning.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.720
And in particular,
this is evident

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.320
when you change sound levels.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.740
So what this is a plot
of is tuning curves

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.440
that you would measure from
an auditory nerve fiber.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.140
So we've got spikes per
second on the y-axis,

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.810
we've got the frequency
of a pure tone stimulus

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.330
on the x-axis, and
each curve plots

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.710
the response at a different
stimulus intensity.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.210
All right?

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.820
So down here at
the bottom, we've

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.959
got 35 dB SPL, so that's, like,
a very, very low level, like,

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:09.250
maybe if you rub your hands
together or something, that

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.110
would be close to 35.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.180
And 45-- and you can
see here that the tuning

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.460
is pretty narrow here
at these low levels.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.810
So 45 dB SPL.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.895
So you get a pretty
big response, here,

00:27:19.895 --> 00:27:22.610
at looks like, you
know, 1700 Hertz.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:27.380
And then by the time you go down
half an octave or something,

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.080
there's almost no response.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.590
But as the stimulus
level increases,

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.990
you can see that the
tuning broadens really

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.940
very considerably.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:39.890
And so up here at 75 or 85
dB, you're getting a response

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.430
from anywhere from 500 Hertz out
to, you know, over 2,000 Hertz.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.140
That's, like, a two
octave range, right?

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.190
So the bandwidth is growing
pretty dramatically.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.630
And this is very typical.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.090
Here is a bunch of examples
of different nerve fibers

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:54.750
that are doing the same thing.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.900
So at high levels, the
tuning is really broad.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.860
At low levels, it's
kind of narrow.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.610
And so mechanistically,
in terms of the biology,

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.370
we have a pretty
good understanding

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.492
of why this is happening.

00:28:06.492 --> 00:28:08.450
So what's going on is
that the outer hair cells

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:12.350
are providing amplification
of the frequencies kind

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.960
of near the characteristic
frequency of the nerve fiber

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.452
at low levels, but
not at high levels.

00:28:17.452 --> 00:28:19.160
And so at high levels,
what you're seeing

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.420
is just very broad kind
of mechanical tuning.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.170
But what really sort
of remains unclear is

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.890
what the consequences of this
are for hearing, and really,

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.850
how to think about it
in computational terms.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.450
So it's clear that the
linear filtering view is not

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.880
exactly right.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.410
And one of the
interesting things

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:39.590
is that it's not like you
get a lot worse at hearing

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.840
when you go up to 75 or 85 dB.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.630
In fact, if anything, most
psychophysical phenomena,

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.510
actually, are better
in some sense.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.162
This phenomena, as
I said, is related

00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:51.620
to this distinction between
inner hair cells and outer hair

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:51.800
cells.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.090
So the inner hair
cells are the ones

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.256
that, actually, are responsible
for the transduction

00:28:55.256 --> 00:28:58.400
of sound energy, and the outer
hair cells we think of as part

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.561
of a feedback system
that amplifies

00:29:00.561 --> 00:29:02.810
the motion of the membrane
and sharpens at the tuning.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.260
And that amplification is
selective for frequencies

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.390
at the characteristic
frequency, and really occurs

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.790
at very low levels.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.290
OK.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.540
So this is related to
what Hynek was mentioning

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.660
and the question that
was asked earlier.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.510
So there's this other
important response property

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.750
of the cochlea, which is
that for frequencies that

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.330
are sufficiently low,
auditory nerve spikes are

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.010
phase locked to the stimulus.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:31.370
And so what you're seeing
here is a single trace

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.470
of a recording from a
nerve fiber that's up top,

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.854
and then at the
bottom is the stimulus

00:29:35.854 --> 00:29:37.520
that would be supplied
to the air, which

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.860
is just a pure tone of
some particular frequency.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.140
And so you can note, like,
two interesting things

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.124
about this response.

00:29:44.124 --> 00:29:46.040
The first is that the
spikes are intermittent.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.460
You don't get a spike at
every cycle of the frequency.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.160
But when the spikes occur--

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.660
sorry, they occur at
a particular phase

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.440
relative to the stimulus.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:55.940
Right?

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.440
So they're kind of
just a little bit

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.340
behind the peak of the waveform
in this particular case, right,

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.390
and in every single case.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.850
All right, so this is
known as phase locking.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.090
And it's a pretty robust
phenomena for frequencies

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.786
under a few kilohertz.

00:30:09.786 --> 00:30:11.160
And this is in
non-human animals.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.451
There's no measurements of
the auditory nerve in humans

00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:15.650
because to do so
is highly invasive,

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:19.970
and just nobody's ever done
it, and probably won't ever.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.010
So this is another example
of the same thing, where

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.910
again, this is sort
of the input waveform,

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.430
and this is a bunch of different
recordings of the same nerve

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.070
fiber that are time aligned.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.940
So you can see the
spikes always occur

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.190
at a particular
region of phase space.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.287
So they're not
uniformly distributed.

00:30:40.287 --> 00:30:41.870
And the figure here
on the right shows

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.910
that this phenomenon
deteriorates

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:44.880
at very high frequency.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.736
So this is the plot of the
strength of the phase locking

00:30:47.736 --> 00:30:48.860
as a function of frequency.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.780
And so up to a kilohertz,
it's quite strong,

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.850
and then it starts to kind of
drop off, and above about 4k

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.180
there's not really a whole lot.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:59.450
OK.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:02.660
And so as I said, one of
the other salient things

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.570
is that the fibers don't
fire with every cycle

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.910
of the stimulus.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.220
And one interesting
fact about the ear

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.590
is that there are a whole
bunch of auditory nerve fibers

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.820
for every inner hair cell.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.130
And people think that one
of the reasons for that

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.500
is because of this
phenomena, here.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.080
And this is probably due to
things like refractory periods

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.259
and stuff, right?

00:31:23.259 --> 00:31:25.550
But if you have a whole bunch
of nerve fibers synapsing

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.550
under the same
hair cell, the idea

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.930
is that, well, collectively,
you'll get spikes

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.424
at every single cycle.

00:31:32.424 --> 00:31:34.090
So here's just some
interesting numbers.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:38.450
So the number of inner hair
cells per ear in a human

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:42.140
is estimated to be about 3500.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.110
There's about four times
as many outer hair cells,

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.350
or roughly 12,000, but
that's the key number here.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.540
So coming out of every ear are
roughly 30,000 auditory nerve

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.040
fibers.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.500
So there's about 10 times as
many auditory nerve fibers

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.405
as there are inner hair cells.

00:31:59.405 --> 00:32:01.280
And it's interesting to
compare those numbers

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.080
to what you see in the eye.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.320
So these are estimates
from a few years

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.000
ago, from the eye of roughly
5 million cones per eye,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.690
lots of rods, obviously.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.450
But then you go to
the optic nerve,

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.170
and the number of
optic nerve fibers

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.560
is actually substantially
less than the number of cones.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.551
So 1 and 1/2 million.

00:32:19.551 --> 00:32:21.050
So there's this big
compression that

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.760
happens when you go into
the auditory nerve--

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.820
sorry, in the optic
nerve, whereas there's

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.860
an expansion that happens
in the auditory nerve.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.659
And just for fun, these
are rough estimates

00:32:32.659 --> 00:32:33.950
of what you find in the cortex.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.749
So in primary
auditory cortex, this

00:32:36.749 --> 00:32:38.540
is a very crude estimate
I got from someone

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.380
a couple of days ago, of 60
million neurons per hemisphere.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.980
And in v1, the estimate
that I was able to find

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.210
was 140 million.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:50.030
So these are sort of roughly
the same order of magnitude,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.600
although it's obviously
smaller in the auditory system.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.187
But there is something
very different

00:32:55.187 --> 00:32:57.770
happening here, in terms of the
way the information is getting

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.950
piped from the periphery
onto the brain.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.080
And one reason for
this might just

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.850
be the fact that
phenomena here, where

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.892
the spiking in an individual
auditory nerve fiber

00:33:08.892 --> 00:33:10.849
is going to be intermittent
because the signals

00:33:10.849 --> 00:33:12.800
that it has to convey
are very, very fast,

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.590
and so you kind of have
to multiplex in this way.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.450
All right, so the
big picture here

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.630
is that if you look at
the output of the cochlea,

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.070
there are, in some
sense, two cues

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.229
to the frequencies that
are contained in a sound.

00:33:24.229 --> 00:33:26.270
So there's what is often
referred to as the place

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.584
of excitation in the cochlea.

00:33:27.584 --> 00:33:29.000
So these are the
nerve fibers that

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.260
are firing the most,
according to a rate code.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.270
And there's also the
timing of the spikes that

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:39.380
are fired, in the sense that,
for frequencies below about 4k,

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.790
you get phase locking.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.260
And so the inner
spiked intervals

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.510
will be stereotyped, depending
on the frequencies that

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.010
come in.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.660
And so it's one
of these sort of--

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.400
I still find this
kind of remarkable

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.560
when I sort of
step back and think

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.060
about the state of
things, that this

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.870
is a very basic question about
neural coding at the very

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.030
front end of the system.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.400
And the importance
of these things

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.830
really remains unresolved.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:07.160
So people have been debating
this for a really long time,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.620
and we still don't really
have very clear answers

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.560
to the extent to which
the spike timing really

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.170
is critical for
inferring frequency.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.000
So I'm going to play you
a demo that provides--

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.420
it's an example of some of
the circumstantial evidence

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.920
for the importance
of phase locking.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.500
And broadly speaking,
the evidence

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.320
for the importance of
phase locking in humans

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.870
comes from the fact that
the perception of frequency

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:34.040
seems to change once you
kind of get above about 4k.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.310
So for instance,
if you give people

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.860
a musical interval,
[SINGING] da da, and then

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.830
you ask them to replicate that,
in, say, different octaves,

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.889
people can do that pretty well
until you get to about 4k.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.670
And above 4k, they
just break down.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.969
They become very,
very highly variable.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.719
And that's evident in
this demonstration.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.290
So what you're going
to hear in this demo,

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:57.260
and this is a demonstration
I got from Peter Cariani.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.880
Thanks to him.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.670
It's a melody that is probably
familiar to all of you that's

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.590
being played with pure tones.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.780
And it will be
played repeatedly,

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.170
transposed from very
high frequencies down in,

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.040
I don't know, third
octaves or something,

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.520
to lower and lower frequencies.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.512
And what you will
experience is that when

00:35:15.512 --> 00:35:17.345
you hear the very high
frequencies, well, A,

00:35:17.345 --> 00:35:19.790
they'll be kind of annoying,
so just bear with me,

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.179
but the melody will
also be unrecognizable.

00:35:22.179 --> 00:35:24.470
And so it'll only be when
you get below a certain point

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.180
that you'll say, aha,
I know what that is.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:26.679
OK?

00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:31.460
And again, we can look at
this in our spectrogram, which

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.650
is still going.

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:37.154
And you can actually
see what's going on.

00:35:37.154 --> 00:35:40.591
[MELODIC TONES]

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.754
OK.

00:36:56.754 --> 00:36:58.170
So by the end,
hopefully everybody

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.120
recognized what that was.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.979
So let's just talk
briefly about how

00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:04.020
these subbands that we
were talking about earlier

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.853
relate to what we see
in the auditory nerve,

00:37:05.853 --> 00:37:10.380
and again, this relates to
one of the earlier questions.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.480
So the subband is
this blue signal here.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.960
This is the output
of a linear filter.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.540
And one of the ways to
characterize a subband

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.140
like this that's band limited is
by the instantaneous amplitude

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.616
and the instantaneous phase.

00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:24.990
And these things,
loosely, can be

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.540
mapped onto a spike
rate and spike

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.990
timing in the auditory nerve.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:34.230
So again, this is an example of
the phase locking that you see,

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.570
where the spikes get fired
at some particular point

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.710
in the waveform.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:39.090
And so if you
observe this, well,

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.131
you know something about
exactly what's happening

00:37:41.131 --> 00:37:44.190
in the waveform, namely,
you know that there's energy

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.494
there in the stimulus because
you're getting spikes,

00:37:46.494 --> 00:37:48.660
but you also actually know
the phase of the waveform

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.740
because the spikes are
happening in particular places.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.002
And so this issue of phase
is sort of a tricky one,

00:37:56.002 --> 00:37:57.960
because it's often not
something that we really

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.930
know how to deal with.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.030
And it's also just
empirically the case

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:06.660
that a lot of the information
in sound is carried by the way

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.970
that frequencies are
modulated over time,

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:12.420
as measured by the instantaneous
amplitude in a subband.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.934
And so the
instantaneous amplitude

00:38:13.934 --> 00:38:15.850
is measured by a quantity
called the envelope.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:17.308
So that's the red
curve, here, that

00:38:17.308 --> 00:38:20.359
shows how the amplitude
waxes and wanes.

00:38:20.359 --> 00:38:22.650
And the envelope is easy to
extract from auditory nerve

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.590
response, just by computing
the firing rate over local time

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:26.250
windows.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.542
And in signal processing
terms, we typically extract it

00:38:28.542 --> 00:38:30.374
with something called
the Hilbert transform,

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:32.490
by taking the magnitude
of the analytic signal.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.114
So it's a pretty easy
thing to pull out

00:38:34.114 --> 00:38:37.140
in MATLAB, for instance.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.490
So just to relate this to stuff
that may be more familiar,

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.240
the spectrograms that
people have probably

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.770
seen in the past--
again, these are

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.330
pictures that take
a sound waveform

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.590
and plot the frequency
content over time.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.980
One way to get a
spectrogram is to have

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.770
a bank of bandpass filters,
to get a bunch of subbands,

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.380
and then to extract the
envelope of each subband,

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.970
and just plot the envelope
in grayscale, horizontally.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:58.470
All right?

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:02.250
So a stripe through this picture
is the envelope in grayscale.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.230
So it's black in
the places where

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:08.290
the energy is high, and white
in the places where it's low.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:13.185
And so this is a
spectrogram of this.

00:39:13.185 --> 00:39:16.012
[DRUMMING]

00:39:16.012 --> 00:39:17.720
All right, so that's
what you just heard.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.610
It's just a drum break.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.152
And you can probably
see that there

00:39:21.152 --> 00:39:23.360
are sort of events in the
spectrogram that correspond

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.170
to things like the drumbeats.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.540
Now, one of the other striking
things about this picture

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.590
is it looks like a mess, right?

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:32.131
I mean, you listen
to that drum break

00:39:32.131 --> 00:39:34.500
and it sounded kind
of crisp and clean,

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.220
and when you actually look at
the instantaneous amplitude

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:42.450
in each of the subbands, it just
sort of looks messy and noisy.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:47.900
But one interesting fact is that
this picture, for most signals,

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.260
captures all of the information
that matters perceptually

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.790
in the following sense, that
if you have some sound signal

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:57.680
and you let me
generate this picture,

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.600
and all you let me
keep is that picture.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.580
We throw out the
original sound waveform.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.440
From that picture,
I can generate

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.730
a sound signal that will
sound just like the original.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:06.230
All right?

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:09.050
And in fact, I've done this.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.798
And here is a reconstruction
from that picture.

00:40:11.798 --> 00:40:14.430
[DRUMMING]

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:15.677
Here's the original.

00:40:15.677 --> 00:40:18.319
[DRUMMING]

00:40:18.319 --> 00:40:19.360
Sounded exactly the same.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.010
OK?

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.840
And so-- and I'll tell you
in a second, how we do this,

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.740
but the fact that this picture
looks messy and noisy is,

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.310
I think, mostly
just due to the fact

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:31.740
that your brain is not used
to getting the sensory input

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:32.540
in this format.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.039
Right?

00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:34.490
You're used to hearing as sound.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.990
Right?

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.740
And so your visual system is
actually not optimally designed

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.320
to interpret a spectrogram.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.780
I want to just briefly explain
how you take this picture

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.070
and generate a sound
signal because this

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.736
is sort of a useful
thing to understand,

00:40:45.736 --> 00:40:48.370
and it will become relevant
a little bit later.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.570
So the general game
that we play here

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.244
is you hand me this
picture, right,

00:40:54.244 --> 00:40:55.660
and I want to
synthesize a signal.

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.860
And so usually what we do, is we
start out with a noise signal,

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.754
and we transform that noise
signal until it's in kind

00:41:01.754 --> 00:41:02.920
of the right representation.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.610
So we split it up
into its subbands.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:09.000
And then we'll replace the
envelopes of the noise subbands

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.990
by the envelopes
from this picture.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.490
OK?

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:13.410
And so the way
that we do that is

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.450
we measure the envelope
of each noise subband,

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.810
we divide it out, and then
we multiply by the envelope

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.260
of the thing that we want.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.380
And that gives us new subbands.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:27.120
And we then add those up, and
we get a new sound signal.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.240
And for various reasons,
this is a process

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.500
that needs to be iterated.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.260
So you take that
new sound signal,

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.200
you generate its subbands,
you replace their envelopes

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.750
by the ones you want,
and you add them back up

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:40.819
to get a sound signal.

00:41:40.819 --> 00:41:43.110
And if you do this about 10
times, what you end up with

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.520
is something that has the
envelopes that you want.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.540
And so then you
can listen to it.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.790
And that's the thing
that I played you.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:48.570
OK?

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:50.778
So it's this iterative
procedure, where you typically

00:41:50.778 --> 00:41:53.670
start with noise, you
project the signal

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:57.980
that you want onto the noise,
collapse, and then iterate.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:58.880
OK.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.560
And we'll see some more
examples of this in action.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.434
So I just told you how the
instantaneous amplitude

00:42:07.434 --> 00:42:09.600
in each of the filter
outputs, which we characterize

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.060
with the envelope,
is an important thing

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.270
for sound representation.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:16.050
And so in the auditory model
that I'm building here,

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.700
we've got a second
stage of processing

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.929
now, where we've
taken the subbands

00:42:19.929 --> 00:42:21.720
and we extract the
instantaneous amplitude.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.420
And there's one other thing
here that I'll just mention,

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.670
which is that another important
feature of the cochlea

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.378
is what's known as
amplitude compression.

00:42:28.378 --> 00:42:30.930
So the response of the cochlea
as a function of sound level

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:34.117
is not linear, rather
it's compressive.

00:42:34.117 --> 00:42:35.700
And this is due to
the fact that there

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.700
is selective amplification
when sounds are quiet,

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:42.460
and not when they're
very high in intensity.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.920
And I'm not going
to say anything

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.270
more about this for now, but
it will become important later.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:50.630
And this is something that has
a lot of practical consequences.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.359
So when people
lose their hearing,

00:42:53.359 --> 00:42:54.900
one of the common
things that happens

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.179
is that the outer hair cells
stop working correctly.

00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:00.720
And the outer hair cells are
one of the things that generates

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.840
that compressive response.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.780
So they're the
nonlinear component

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.430
of processing in the cochlea.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.200
And so when people
lose their hearing,

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.710
the tuning both broadens,
and you get a linear response

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:12.930
to sound amplitude
because you lose

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.856
that selective
amplification, and that's

00:43:15.856 --> 00:43:17.730
something that hearing
aids try to replicate,

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:20.651
and that's hard to do.

00:43:20.651 --> 00:43:21.150
OK.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:22.885
So what happens next?

00:43:22.885 --> 00:43:24.510
So everybody here--
does everybody here

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.190
know what a spike
triggered average is?

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.460
Yeah.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.251
Lots of people talked
about this, probably.

00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:28.860
OK.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.920
So one of the standard
ways that we investigate

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.950
sensory systems, when
we have some reason

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:39.062
to think that things might
be reasonably linear,

00:43:39.062 --> 00:43:41.520
is by measuring something called
a spike triggered average.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.228
And so the way this
experiment might work

00:43:43.228 --> 00:43:45.686
is you would play
stimulus like this.

00:43:45.686 --> 00:43:54.080
[NOISE SIGNAL]

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.760
So that's a type
of a noise signal.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.260
Right?

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.230
So you'd play your
animal that signal, you'd

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.690
be recording spikes
from a neuron

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:05.180
that you might be interested in,
and every time there's a spike,

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.930
you would look back at
what happens in the signal

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:10.900
and then you would take all
the little histories that

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:11.800
preceded that spike.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.470
You'd average them together,
and you get the average stimulus

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:15.860
that preceded a spike.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.530
And so in this
particular case, we're

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:20.560
going to actually do this in
the domain of the spectrogram.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.840
And that's because you might
hypothesize that, really,

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.465
what the neurons
would care about would

00:44:24.465 --> 00:44:27.100
be the instantaneous
amplitude in the sound signal,

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.320
and not necessarily the phase.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.500
So if you do that, for instance,
in the inferior colliculus,

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.510
the stage of the
midbrain, you see things

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:36.790
that are pretty stereotyped.

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.430
And we're going to
refer to what we get out

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:42.670
of this procedure as a
spectrotemporal receptive

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:43.390
field.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:48.170
And that would often be
referred to as a STRF for short.

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:51.850
So if you hear people talk about
STRFs, this is what they mean.

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:52.660
OK.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.212
So these are
derived from methods

00:44:54.212 --> 00:44:56.170
that would be like the
spike triggered average.

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.586
People don't usually actually
do a spike triggered average

00:44:58.586 --> 00:45:02.230
for various reasons, but
what you get out is similar.

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:06.296
And so what you see here is
the average spectrogram that

00:45:06.296 --> 00:45:07.420
would be preceding a spike.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.130
And for this
particular neuron, you

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.880
can see there's a bit of
red and then a bit of blue.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.770
And so at this particular
frequency, which, in this case,

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:20.590
is something like 10 kilohertz
or something like that,

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:23.050
the optimal stimulus that
would generate a spike

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:25.660
is something that gives you an
increase in energy, and then

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.070
a decrease.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:32.890
And so what this corresponds
to is amplitude modulation

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.250
at a particular rate.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.583
And so you can see there's a
characteristic timing here.

00:45:36.583 --> 00:45:38.307
So the red thing has
a certain duration,

00:45:38.307 --> 00:45:39.640
and then there's the blue thing.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.080
And so there is this
very rapid increase

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.460
and decrease in energy at
that particular frequency.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.850
So that's known as
amplitude modulation.

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:48.820
And so this is
one way of looking

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.770
at this in the domain
of the spectrogram.

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.780
Another way of
looking at this would

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.910
be to generate a tuning function
as a function of the modulation

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:56.410
rate.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:57.951
So you could actually
change how fast

00:45:57.951 --> 00:46:00.070
the amplitude is
being modulated,

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.380
and you would see in
a neuron like this,

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.250
that the response
would exhibit tuning.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:07.391
And so each one of
the graphs here,

00:46:07.391 --> 00:46:08.890
or each one of the
plots, the dashed

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:13.570
curves in the lower right
plot-- so each dashed line is

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.910
a tuning curve for one neuron.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:18.370
So it's a plot of the
response of that neuron

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:21.070
as a function of the temporal
modulation frequencies.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:24.650
So that's how fast the
amplitude is changing with time.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:27.580
And if you look at this
particular case here,

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.280
you can see that there's a peak
response when the modulation

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.540
frequency is maybe 70
Hertz, and then the response

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.940
decreases if you go
in either direction.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.930
This guy here has got a slightly
lower preferred frequency,

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.940
and down here, lower still.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.710
And so again, what
you can see is

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.320
something that looks strikingly
similar to the kinds of filter

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.992
banks that we just saw when we
were looking at the cochlea.

00:46:49.992 --> 00:46:51.700
But there's a key
difference here, right,

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.030
that here we're seeing tuning
to modulation frequency,

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:56.400
not to audio frequency.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.170
So this is the rate at
which the amplitude changes.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.910
That's the amplitude of the
sound, not the audio frequency.

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:06.310
So there's a carrier
frequency here, which is 10k,

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:08.140
but the frequency we're
talking about here

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:09.670
is the rate at
which this changes.

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.380
And so in this
case here, you can

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.760
see the period here is maybe
5 milliseconds, and so this

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.685
would correspond to a modulation
of, I guess, 200 Hertz.

00:47:19.685 --> 00:47:20.795
Is that right?

00:47:20.795 --> 00:47:21.670
I think that's right.

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:22.680
Yeah.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.450
OK.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:27.220
And so as early as the midbrain,
you see stuff like this.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.530
So in the inferior colliculus,
there's lots of it.

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:35.200
And so this suggests a
second, or in this case,

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.780
a third stage of processing,
which are known as modulation

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:38.730
filters.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:42.865
This is a very old idea
in auditory science

00:47:42.865 --> 00:47:44.740
that now has a fair bit
of empirical support.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.880
And so the idea is
that in our model,

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.200
we've got our sound signal.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.408
It gets passed through this
bank of bandpass filters,

00:47:50.408 --> 00:47:51.940
you get these
subbands, you extract

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.440
the instantaneous amplitude,
known as the envelope,

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.398
and then you take that
envelope and you pass it

00:47:56.398 --> 00:47:57.670
through another filter bank.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.211
This time, these
are filters that are

00:47:59.211 --> 00:48:01.194
tuned in modulation frequency.

00:48:01.194 --> 00:48:02.860
And the output of
those filters-- again,

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.950
it's exactly conceptually
analogous to the output

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:08.210
of this first set of
band pass filters.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.120
So in this case,
we have a filter

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.702
that's tuned to low
modulation rates,

00:48:11.702 --> 00:48:13.660
and so you can see what
it outputs is something

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.476
that's fluctuating very slowly.

00:48:15.476 --> 00:48:17.350
So it's just taken the
very slow fluctuations

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:18.352
out of that envelope.

00:48:18.352 --> 00:48:20.560
Here, you have a filter
that's tuned to higher rates,

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.950
and so it's wiggling
around at faster rates.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.080
And you have a different
set of these filters

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.880
for each cochlear channel,
each thing coming out

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.910
of the cochlea.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:33.280
So this picture here that
we've gradually built up

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.490
gives us a model of
the signal processing

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:40.330
that we think occurs between
the cochlea and the midbrain

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.020
or the thalamus.

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:43.480
So you have the
bandpass filtering

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.996
that happens in the
cochlea, you get subbands,

00:48:45.996 --> 00:48:48.370
you extract the instantaneous
amplitude in the envelopes,

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:52.611
and then you filter that again
with these modulation filters.

00:48:52.611 --> 00:48:54.860
This is sort of a rough
understanding of the front end

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.818
of the auditory system.

00:48:55.818 --> 00:48:59.294
And the question is, given
these representations,

00:48:59.294 --> 00:49:01.710
how do we do the interesting
things that we do with sound?

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.835
So how do we recognize
things and their properties,

00:49:03.835 --> 00:49:07.342
and do scene analysis,
and so on, and so forth.

00:49:07.342 --> 00:49:09.050
And this is still
something that is still

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:14.584
very much in its infancy in
terms of our understanding.

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.500
One of the areas that
I've spent a bit of time

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.609
on to try to get a handle
on this is sound texture.

00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:21.900
And I started working on this
because I sort of thought

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.090
it would be a nice way
in to understanding some

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:28.230
of these issues, and because
I gather that Eero was here

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:29.820
talking about visual textures.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:34.480
I was asked to feature this, and
hopefully this will be useful.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.527
So what are sound textures?

00:49:36.527 --> 00:49:38.610
Textures are sounds that
result from large numbers

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:40.830
of acoustic events,
and they include things

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:43.020
that you hear all
the time, like rain--

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.120
[RAIN]

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.130

[FIRE BURNING]

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.160
OK.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.620
So these are sounds
that they, typically,

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.230
are generated from large
numbers of acoustic events.

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.604
They're very common
in the world.

00:50:18.604 --> 00:50:20.500
You hear these
things all the time.

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.390
But they've been
largely unstudied.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:26.260
So there's been a long and
storied history of research

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.800
on visual texture,
and this really

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.950
had not been thought about very
much until a few years ago.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.160
Now, a lot of the things that
people typically think about

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.610
in hearing are the
sounds that are

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:41.860
produced by individual events.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.110
And if we have time, we'll
talk about this more later,

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:45.026
but stuff like this.

00:50:45.026 --> 00:50:45.881
AUDIO: January.

00:50:45.881 --> 00:50:46.880
JOSH MCDERMOTT: Or this.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.736
[SQUEAK]

00:50:47.736 --> 00:50:50.110
And these are the waveforms
associated with those events.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:51.550
And the point is
that those sounds,

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.620
they have a beginning, and an
end, and a temporal evolution.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.180
And that temporal
evolution is sort

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.335
of part of what makes the
sound what it is, right?

00:50:58.335 --> 00:50:59.710
And textures are
a bit different.

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:01.866
So here's just
the sound of rain.

00:51:01.866 --> 00:51:04.250
[RAIN]

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.340
Now of course, at some
point, the rain started

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.570
and hopefully at some
point it will end,

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:08.590
but the start and
the end are not

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:10.150
what makes it sound
like rain, right?

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.566
The qualities that make it
sound like rain are just there.

00:51:12.566 --> 00:51:14.540
So the texture is stationary.

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.720
So the essential properties
don't change over time.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.230
And so I got
interested in textures

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.560
because it seemed like
stationarity would make them

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.330
a good starting point
for understanding

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:24.288
auditory representation
because, in some sense,

00:51:24.288 --> 00:51:26.200
it sort of simplifies
the kinds of things

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.199
you have to worry about.

00:51:27.199 --> 00:51:31.004
You don't have to worry about
time in quite the same way.

00:51:31.004 --> 00:51:32.920
And so the question that
we were interested in

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.910
is how people represent
and recognize texture.

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:38.575
So just to make that
concrete, listen to this.

00:51:38.575 --> 00:51:40.900
[CHATTER]

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.095
And then this.

00:51:42.095 --> 00:51:43.912
[CHATTER]

00:51:43.912 --> 00:51:45.370
So it's immediately
apparent to you

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:46.910
that those are the same
kind of thing, right?

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:49.510
In fact, they're two different
excerpts of the same recording.

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:51.610
But the waveform itself is
totally different in the two

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:52.140
cases.

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.223
So there's something that
your brain is extracting

00:51:54.223 --> 00:51:56.348
from those two excerpts
that tells you that they're

00:51:56.348 --> 00:51:58.639
the same kind of thing, and
that, for instance, they're

00:51:58.639 --> 00:51:59.666
different from this.

00:51:59.666 --> 00:52:01.850
[BEES BUZZING]

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:04.310
So the question is, what is
it that you extract and store

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:07.010
about those waveforms that tells
you that certain somethings are

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:08.676
the same and other
things are different,

00:52:08.676 --> 00:52:11.390
and that allows you to
recognize what things are?

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:13.669
And so the key
theoretical proposal

00:52:13.669 --> 00:52:15.710
that we made in this work
is that because they're

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:17.840
stationary, textures
can be captured

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.760
by statistics that
are time averages

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.050
of acoustic measurements.

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.591
So the proposal is that when
you recognize the sound of fire,

00:52:23.591 --> 00:52:25.100
or rain, or what
have you, you're

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.990
recognizing these statistics.

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:28.490
So what kinds of
statistics might we

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:32.060
be measuring if you think this
proposal has some plausibility?

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.010
And so part of the
reason for walking you

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:36.350
through this auditory model
is that whatever statistics

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:37.910
the auditory system
measures are presumably

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:39.620
derived from
representations like this,

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.320
right, that constitute the
input that your brain is getting

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.630
from the auditory periphery.

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:47.480
And so we initially
asked how far

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.240
one might get with
representations consisting

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.210
of fairly generic statistics
of these standard auditory

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.250
representations, things
like marginal moments

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:59.250
and correlations.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.070
So the statistics
that we initially

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:03.500
considered were not, in any
way, specifically tailored

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.990
to natural sounds, and
really, ultimately,

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:08.480
what we'd like to do would be
to actually learn statistics

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.650
from data that, actually, we
think are good representations.

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.792
That's something
we're working on.

00:53:13.792 --> 00:53:16.250
But these statistics are simple
and they involve operations

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:17.930
that you could
instantiate in neurons,

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:19.679
so it seemed like maybe
a reasonable place

00:53:19.679 --> 00:53:21.740
to start to at least
get a feel for what

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.230
the landscape was like.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:25.850
And so what I want
to do now is just

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:29.360
to give you some intuitions
as to what sorts of things

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:32.250
might be captured by statistics
of these representations.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.717
And so at a minimum, to
be useful for recognition,

00:53:34.717 --> 00:53:36.800
well, statistics need to
give you different values

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.675
for different sounds.

00:53:37.675 --> 00:53:39.150
And so let's see what happens.

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:42.140
So let's first have a look
at what kinds of things

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:45.650
might be captured by marginal
moments of amplitude envelopes

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:47.520
from bandpass filters.

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.240
OK?

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.760
So remember, the
envelope, here, you

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.860
can think of as a stripe
through a spectrogram,

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.980
right, so it's the instantaneous
amplitude in a given frequency

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:55.916
channel.

00:53:55.916 --> 00:53:57.290
So the blue thing
is the subband,

00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:59.090
the red thing here
is the envelope.

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:01.490
And the marginal moments
will describe the way

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:02.820
the envelope is distributed.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.730
So imagine you
took that red curve

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:07.359
and you collapsed that over
time to get a histogram that

00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:08.900
tells you the
frequency of occurrence

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:13.434
of different amplitudes in that
particular frequency channel.

00:54:13.434 --> 00:54:15.850
And that's what it looks like
for this particular example.

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:19.250
And you might think that,
well, this can't possibly

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:21.880
be all that informative,
right, because it's obviously

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.630
got some central
tendency and some spread,

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:25.963
but when you do this business
of collapsing across time,

00:54:25.963 --> 00:54:28.110
you're throwing out all
kinds of information.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:29.030
But one of the
interesting things

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:30.950
is that when you look at
these kinds of distributions

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:32.390
for different types
of sounds, you

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:34.580
see that they vary a fair
bit, and in particular,

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.170
that they're
systematically different

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:38.790
for a lot of natural sounds
than they are for noise signals.

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.520
So this is that same thing,
so it's this histogram here,

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.840
just rotated 90 degrees.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.780
So we've got the
probability of occurrence

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.800
on the y-axis, and the
magnitude in the envelope of one

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.929
particular frequency
channel on the x-axis,

00:54:50.929 --> 00:54:52.220
for three different recordings.

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.400
So the red plots what you
get for a recording of noise,

00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:00.260
the blue is a stream, and the
green is a bunch of geese.

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.100
Geese don't quack.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:01.640
Whatever the geese do.

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.020
AUDIENCE: Honk.

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:02.660
JOSH MCDERMOTT: Yeah, honking.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.160
Yeah.

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:03.780
All right.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:08.390
And this is a filter that's
centered at 2,200 Hertz.

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:10.250
In particular,
these examples were

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:12.920
chosen because the average
value of the envelope

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.690
is very similar in
the three cases.

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:16.273
But you can see that
the distributions

00:55:16.273 --> 00:55:17.460
have very different shapes.

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:20.960
So the noise one, here, has
got pretty low variance.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.640
The stream has got larger
variance, and the geese larger

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.530
still, and it's also
positively skewed.

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:29.244
So to got this kind
of long tail, here.

00:55:29.244 --> 00:55:31.160
And if you look at the
spectrograms associated

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.870
with these sounds, you can
see where this comes from.

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:37.329
So spectogram of
noise is pretty gray,

00:55:37.329 --> 00:55:38.870
so the noise signal
kind of hangs out

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:40.910
around its average
value most of the time,

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:43.340
whereas the stream has got
more gray and more black,

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.440
and the geese actually has
some white and some dark black.

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.314
So here, white would
correspond to down here,

00:55:47.314 --> 00:55:50.060
black would
correspond to up here.

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.720
And the intuition here is that
natural signals are sparse.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.210
In particular, they're
sparser than noise.

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:58.640
So we think of natural
signals as often being made up

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.710
of events like
raindrops, or geese

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:02.630
calls, and these
events are infrequent,

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.380
but when they occur they produce
large amplitudes in the signal.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:07.550
And when they don't occur,
the amplitude is lower.

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:11.390
In contrast, the noise signal
doesn't really have those.

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:14.900
But the important
point about this

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.060
from the standpoint of
wanting to characterize

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:20.780
a signal with statistics is
that this phenomenon of sparsity

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.520
is reflected in some
pretty simple things

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.670
that you could compute
from the signal,

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:24.989
like the variance and the skew.

00:56:24.989 --> 00:56:27.530
So you can see that the variance
varies across these signals,

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:30.150
as does a skew.

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.650
All right.

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:31.730
Let's take a quick
look at what you

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:33.380
might get by
measuring correlations

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:35.476
between these
different channels.

00:56:35.476 --> 00:56:37.100
So these things also
vary across sound.

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.370
And you can see them in
the cochleogram here,

00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:43.067
in this particular
example, as reflected

00:56:43.067 --> 00:56:44.150
in these vertical streaks.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:45.890
So this is the
cochleogram of fire,

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:48.034
and fire's got lots
of crackles and pops.

00:56:48.034 --> 00:56:52.120
[FIRE BURNING]

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.310
And those crackles
and pops show up

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.530
as these vertical streaks
in the cochleogram.

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.500
So a crackle and pop is
like a click-like event.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.136
Clicks have lots of different
frequencies in them,

00:57:02.136 --> 00:57:04.510
and so you see these vertical
streaks in the spectrogram,

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:06.400
and that introduces
statistical dependencies

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.230
between different
frequency channels.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:11.350
And so that can be measured
by just computing correlations

00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:14.140
between the envelopes of
these different channels,

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.240
and that's reflected
in this matrix here.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.730
So every cell of this
matrix is the correlation

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:21.160
between a pair of channels.

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:24.490
So we're going from
low frequencies,

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:26.094
here, to high, and low to high.

00:57:26.094 --> 00:57:28.510
The diagonal has got to be
one, but the off-diagonal stuff

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:29.230
can be whatever.

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:32.020
You can see for example of
fire, there's a lot of yellow

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:35.200
and a lot of red, which
means that the amplitudes

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.450
of different channels
tends to be correlated.

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:39.116
But this is not the
case for everything.

00:57:39.116 --> 00:57:41.590
So if you look at a water
sound, like a stream--

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:44.612
[STREAM]

00:57:44.612 --> 00:57:46.820
--there are not very many
things that are click-like,

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.505
and most of the correlations
here are pretty close to zero.

00:57:49.505 --> 00:57:51.130
So again, this is a
pretty simple thing

00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:53.213
that you can measure, but
you get different values

00:57:53.213 --> 00:57:55.300
for different sounds.

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:59.140
Similarly, if we look
at the power coming out

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.540
of these modulation filters,
you also see big differences

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.190
across sounds.

00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:06.710
So that's plotted here for three
different sound recordings,

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:09.190
insects, waves, and a stream.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.560
And so remember that
these modulation filters,

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.810
we think of them as being
applied to each cochlear

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:14.320
channel.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.455
So the modulation power
that you would get from all

00:58:17.455 --> 00:58:18.880
your modulation filters is--

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.780
you can see that in a 2D plot.

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:23.350
So this is the frequency
of the cochlear channel,

00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:25.570
and this is the rate of
the modulation channel.

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:30.520
So these are slow modulations
and these are fast modulations.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.500
And so for the
insects, you can see

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.800
that there are these,
like, little blobs up here.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.550
And that actually
corresponds to the rates

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:39.280
at which the insects rub
their wings together and make

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.200
the sound that they
make, which kind of

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.847
gives it this shimmery quality.

00:58:42.847 --> 00:58:46.750
[INSECTS]

00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:49.000
In contrast, the waves
have got most of the power

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.884
here at very slow modulations.

00:58:51.884 --> 00:58:56.760
[WAVES]

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.540
And the stream is
pretty broadband,

00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:02.097
so there's modulations at a
whole bunch of different rates.

00:59:02.097 --> 00:59:04.970
[STREAM]

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:05.470
All right.

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:07.840
So just by measuring the power
coming out of these channels,

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.400
we're potentially
learning something

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.590
about what's in the signal.

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.602
And I'm going to skip
this last example.

00:59:13.602 --> 00:59:15.310
All right, so the
point is just that when

00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:17.650
you look at these statistics,
they vary pretty substantially

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:18.220
across sound.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.140
And so the question
we were interested in

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:23.340
is whether they could plausibly
account for the perception

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:26.680
of real world textures.

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.270
The key methodological
proposal of this work

00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:32.600
was that synthesis is a
potentially very powerful way

00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.700
to test a perceptual theory.

00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:37.732
Now, maybe the kind
of standard thing

00:59:37.732 --> 00:59:39.190
that you might
think that you might

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:41.289
try to do with this
type of representation

00:59:41.289 --> 00:59:42.830
is measure these
statistics, and then

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:44.329
see whether, for
instance, you could

00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:47.900
discriminate between different
signals or maybe [AUDIO OUT]..

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.370
And for various
reasons, I actually

00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:50.720
think that synthesis
is potentially

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.620
a lot more powerful.

00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:54.980
And the notion is this, that
if your brain is representing

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.522
sounds with some
set of measurements,

00:59:56.522 --> 00:59:59.021
then signals that have the same
values of those measurements

00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:00.490
ought to sound the same to you.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:04.100
And so in particular, if we've
got some real world recording,

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.790
and we synthesize
a signal to cause

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:07.790
it to have the same
measurements, the statistics

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:09.582
in this case, as that
real world recording,

01:00:09.582 --> 01:00:11.123
well, then the
synthetic signal ought

01:00:11.123 --> 01:00:12.860
to sound like the
real world recording

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.170
if the measurements that
we use are like the ones

01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:17.810
that the brain is using
to represent sound.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:20.270
And so we can potentially
use synthesis,

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:22.830
then, to test a
candidate representation,

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:25.580
in this case, these statistics
that we're measuring,

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:30.320
are a reasonable representation
for the brain to be using.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.466
So here's just a simple
example to kind of walk you

01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:33.216
through the logic.

01:00:33.216 --> 01:00:36.680
So let's suppose that you had
a relatively simple theory

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.319
of sound texture
perception, which

01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:40.610
is that texture perception
might be rooted in the power

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:41.411
spectrum.

01:00:41.411 --> 01:00:42.410
It's not so implausible.

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.034
Lots of people think
the power spectrum

01:00:44.034 --> 01:00:46.368
is sort of a useful way to
characterize it [AUDIO OUT]..

01:00:46.368 --> 01:00:48.367
And you might think that
it would have something

01:00:48.367 --> 01:00:50.390
to do with the way
textures would sound.

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:52.670
And so in the context
of our auditory model,

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:55.430
the power spectrum is
captured by the average value

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:56.220
of each envelope.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.020
Remember, the
envelope's telling you

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.480
the instantaneous amplitude,
and so if you just average that,

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.979
you're going to find out how
much power is in each frequency

01:01:01.979 --> 01:01:03.160
channel.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.685
So that's how you would
do it in this framework.

01:01:05.685 --> 01:01:08.060
So the way this would work,
if you get some sound signal,

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:08.570
say, this--

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.210
[BUBBLES]

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.810
--you would pass it
through the model,

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:14.810
you'd measure the average
value of the envelope,

01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:16.520
so you get a set of 30 numbers.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.422
Say, if you have 30
bandpass filters there,

01:01:19.422 --> 01:01:20.880
at the output of
each one of those,

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.713
you get the average of
all of the envelopes,

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:23.750
so you get 30 numbers.

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:25.520
And then you take
those 30 numbers

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.392
and you want to
synthesize the signal,

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.600
subject to the constraint
of it having the same value

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.920
for those 30 numbers.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.104
And so in this case,
it's pretty simple to do.

01:01:33.104 --> 01:01:34.520
So we take a noise
signal, we want

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.978
to start out as
random as possible,

01:01:35.978 --> 01:01:38.724
so we take a noise signal,
we generate it's subbands,

01:01:38.724 --> 01:01:40.640
and then we just scale
the subbands up or down

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.420
so that they have the
right amount of power.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.750
And we add them back up, and
we get a new sound signal.

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:46.180
And then we listen to
it and we see whether it

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.304
sounds like the same thing.

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:48.114
OK?

01:01:48.114 --> 01:01:49.280
Here's what they sound like.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.781
And as you will hear, they just
sound like noise, basically,

01:01:51.781 --> 01:01:52.280
right?

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.170
So this is supposed
to sound like rain--

[RAIN]

01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:57.796

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.824
--or bubbles--

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.715
--or fire--

01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:09.980
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.500
So you might notice that
they sound different, right?

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.940
And you might have even been
able to convince yourself,

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.160
well, that sounds a little
bit like applause, right?

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.285
So there's something there.

01:02:17.285 --> 01:02:19.917
But the point is that they
don't sound anything like--

01:02:19.917 --> 01:02:21.378
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:21.378 --> 01:02:22.352
--or--

--so on, and so forth.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:25.970
OK?

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:27.290
All right, so the point
is that everything just

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:28.820
sounds like noise,
and so what this

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.130
tells us is that our
brains are not simply

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:34.750
registering the spectrum when
we recognize these textures.

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.190
Question is whether
additional simple statistics

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:38.340
will do any better.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.370
And so we're going to
play the same game, right,

01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:43.430
except we have a souped up
representation that's got

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.566
all these other things in it.

01:02:45.566 --> 01:02:46.940
And so the
consequence of this is

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:49.620
that the process of
synthesizing something

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:53.360
is less straightforward.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.780
So I was in Eero Simoncelli's
at the lab at the time,

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.860
and spent a while trying
to get this to work,

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:01.250
and eventually we got to work.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.390
But conceptually, the
process is the same.

01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:06.320
So you have some original
sound recording, rain,

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.750
or what have you, you pass it
through your auditory model,

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:11.420
and then you measure
some set of statistics.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.370
And then you start out
with a noise signal,

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:14.540
you pass it through
the same model,

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.956
and then measure its statistics,
and those will in general

01:03:16.956 --> 01:03:18.680
be different from
the target values.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.960
And so you get some
error signal here,

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.930
and you use that error signal
to perform gradient descent

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:26.730
on the representation of the
noise in the auditory model.

01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:30.140
And so you cause the
envelopes of the noise signal

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.290
to change in ways that cause
their statistics to move

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:35.340
towards the target value.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:38.050
And there's a procedure here
by which this is iterated,

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:39.800
and I'm not going to
get into the details.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.460
If you want to play
around with it,

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:45.020
there's a toolbox that's now
available on the lab website

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.820
if you want to do that,
and it's described

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.780
in more detail in that paper.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.280
All right.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.457
So the result, the
whole point of this,

01:03:51.457 --> 01:03:53.540
is that we get a signal
that shares the statistics

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.950
of some real world sound.

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:55.700
How do they sound?

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.283
And remember, we're
interested in this

01:03:57.283 --> 01:04:00.530
because if these statistics, if
this candidate representation

01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:02.480
accounts for our perception
of texture, well,

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.090
then the synthetic signals
ought to sound like new examples

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.150
of the real thing.

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:08.540
And the cool thing,
and rewarding part

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.150
of this whole thing, is
that in many cases, they do.

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:13.546
So I'm just going to play
the synthetic versions.

01:04:13.546 --> 01:04:15.170
All of these were
generated from noise,

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:17.211
just by causing the noise
to match the statistics

01:04:17.211 --> 01:04:18.680

01:04:52.442 --> 01:04:53.727
All right.

01:04:53.727 --> 01:04:55.560
It also works for a lot
of unnatural sounds.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.610
Here's rustling paper--

01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:59.570

01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:01.232

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.020
All right.

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.280
And so the cool
thing about this is

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.410
you can put it whatever
you want in there, right?

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:09.790
You can measure the
statistics from anything,

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:12.040
and you can generate something
that is statistically matched.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.873
And when you do this
with a lot of textures,

01:05:13.873 --> 01:05:16.060
you tend to get something
that captures some

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.640
of the qualitative properties.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.440
And so the success
of this, and this

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.870
is in this case, the reason
why this is scientifically

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:24.670
interesting in
addition to fun, is

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:27.520
that it lends
plausibility to the notion

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.160
that these statistics could
underlie the representation

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.760
and recognition of textures.
