00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.300
PROFESSOR: So
welcome to this week.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.190
We're going to talk
about trees mainly.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.640
We're going to talk about
some very special ones,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.770
spanning trees.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.770
But before we do
this, you will go

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.690
through a whole
bunch of definitions

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.070
and look at examples to
explain how it works.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.365
So let's talk about
walks and paths.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.450
So you've already seen
a bit of graph theory.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.000
We've talked about graph
colorings and so on.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.560
But now we're going to talk
about special types of graphs,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.960
and special structures
within such graphs.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.510
Well, let's start with
the first definition.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.797
How do we define a walk?

00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:18.380
Well, a walk is
something very simple.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.250
You walk from one vertex
in the graph over an edge

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.740
to a next vertex, to a
next vertex, and so on.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.370
So how do we define this?

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:47.920
A walk is a sequence of vertices
that are connected by edges.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.910
So for example, we
may have something

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.470
that looks like a first vertex.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.520
That we call the start.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.760
And an edge that goes
to a second vertex.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.860
We continue like
this until the end,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.520
say, at vk, which we
call the end of the walk.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.370
And if you look at
this, we say this

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.900
is a walk from v0
all the way to vk.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.250
It has exactly k edges.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.130
And we say that the length
is actually equal to k.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.570
So this is a very basic notion.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.660
And what we are
really interested in

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.770
is actually paths.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.620
And paths are special
types of walks

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.700
in which all those
vertices are actually

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.700
different from one another.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.530
But let's first give
an example of a graph

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.030
that you will study throughout
the whole lecture, especially

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.390
when we come to spanning trees.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.070
So let's have a look
at the following graph.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.840
So let this be a graph.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.400
And for example, we
can have a walk that

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.890
goes from this particular edge.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.060
Say we call this v0.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.640
It goes over this
edge over here.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.610
Suppose I want to end over here.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.030
Well, I can go many ways
in this particular one.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.435
I can go for this edge.

00:03:36.435 --> 00:03:38.670
I may go over here.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.040
I may go all the way
to this part over here.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.760
I may return if I want to.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.010
And I finally, I take this
edge for example back to--

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.490
over this edge, I will
end in the last vertex vk.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.566
So what we notice
here is that we

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:58.690
have a walk that actually gets
to this particular vertex,

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.370
and then returns to this vertex.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.470
So for a few other edges, and
then goes all the way to vk.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.370
So if you talk about
the path, then we really

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.920
want all the difference
vertices not to occur twice.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.610
So let's define this
so the destination is

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.500
that a path is actually a walk.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:33.380
Is a walk where all
edges, where all vertices,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.505
vi's, are different.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.490
In this particular
case-- well for example,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.810
if you strip off
this part over here,

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.950
you will get a path from v0
to here, to here, to here.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.450
And all these vertices
on the path on this walk

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.220
are different.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.130
And therefore it is a path.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.830
This also shows us something.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.140
It is possible to construct
from a walk a path.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.560
As you can see, we started
off with this particular walk.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.560
And we just deleted,
essentially,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.630
a part where we sort of came
back to the same vertex again.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.230
And when we delete all
those kinds of parts,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.530
you will end up with a path.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.660
So can we formalize this
a little bit better?

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.350
Then we get the next lemma.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.630
I call this lemma one.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.700
And let's see whether
we can prove this.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.970
So we want to show that if
there exists a walk from, say,

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.900
a vertex u to-- well, maybe
I should not use arrows.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:57.210
That's confusing--
from u to v. Then there

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:06.140
also exists a path from u to v.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.410
So how can we prove this?

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.590
Do you have any ideas?

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.190
So what kind of proof
techniques can we use here?

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:21.396
And maybe one of the
principles that we have seen?

00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:26.808
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but I have an idea

00:06:26.808 --> 00:06:28.284
about how you could show this.

00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:32.600
It's basically if you
visit one vertex-- let's

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.650
you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.132
You can walk from 1 to 6.

00:06:42.132 --> 00:06:46.732
Then we just take out the
4, you just go 1, 2, 3, 6.

00:06:46.732 --> 00:06:47.440
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.520
So what did we do there?

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.760
We essentially had a walk.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.250
And then we cut out
a smaller parts here

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.480
that recurs in a sense.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.060
And we have shortened the path,
we have shortened the walk

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.950
to a smaller path.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.720
So what we've used here
is we can sort of take out

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.850
parts of the walk just
like we did over here

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.440
until the walk gets shorter,
and shorter, and shorter.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.420
So maybe one of the things
that we may consider

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.425
is a walk of shortest length.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.860
And we know that
this is possible.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.991
Oops, sorry about that.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.470
So let's prove this.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:42.930
So for example, suppose there
exists such a walk from u

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.030
to v. Then we know by
the ordering principle

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.900
that there exists a
walk of minimum length.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.960
So that's what we're
going to use here.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.000
And then we're going
to essentially go

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.580
in the same direction as
what you were talking about

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.510
because we're going to show
that it's not possible to delete

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.804
anything more.

00:08:04.804 --> 00:08:06.470
Because otherwise,
if you could do that,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.594
the walk would get shorter.

00:08:07.594 --> 00:08:13.010
And that's not possible, because
by the well ordering principle,

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:22.580
we simply consider that there
exists a walk of minimal length

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.990
that we are interested in.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.940
We will show that this
particular walk is actually

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.630
going to be a path.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.950
So let's see how we can do this.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:41.770
So let's do walk be equal
to-- well, it starts in v0.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.450
It's equal to u.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.200
There's an edge to, say, v1.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:53.160
It goes all the way up to vk,
which is the last vertex, v.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.410
So what are we going to prove?

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.140
We're going to prove that
this is actually a path.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.790
And since this is a
walk of minimal length,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.200
well suppose it is not a path.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.980
So we are going to
use contradiction.

00:09:08.795 --> 00:09:13.030
Well if it's not a path, then
by our definitions over here,

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.950
there must be two
vertices that are actually

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.170
the same, just like in here.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:22.270
So we go from v0 to, say, this
particular vertex, or this one.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.900
And then we come
back to this one,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.220
and then all the way to vk.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.950
So if it is not a
path, then two of those

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.150
must be equal to one another.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.520
And then we are going
to use this trick.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.000
We're going to
take out this part.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.070
We get the shorter walk.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.660
But that contradicts that
our walk is minimal length.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.470
So that's sort of the proof
technique that we're doing.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.970
OK.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:46.970
Let's do this.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.640
So first, let's
consider a few cases.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.400
If k equals 0, then
that's pretty obvious.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.640
We have only a single vertex u
that is connected by a 0 length

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.500
path to itself.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.230
So this is fine.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.020
For k equals 1, we have
just a single edge.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.020
And then we're done too.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.830
That's a path as well.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:22.230
So let's consider the case
where k is at least two.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.874
Well, suppose it's a walk.

00:10:23.874 --> 00:10:24.540
It's not a path.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.695
So we are going to
assume the opposite.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.340
If it's not a path,
then we concluded

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.330
that two of those vi's must
be equal to one another.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:51.208
So there exits an i unequal to
j such that vertex vi equals vj.

00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:55.800
Ah, but now we have
a walk that goes

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:02.280
from v0 all the way to, say,
vi, which is equal to vj.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.480
And then we go all the way
up to vk which is equal to v.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.420
So essentially, we have
created a shorter walk.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.930
We have taken out this
little triangle over here.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.920
Now this is a shorter walk.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:27.170
And this contradicts our
assumption of minimality.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.650
So that means that our
assumption over here

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.740
is not true.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.350
So the walk is actually a path.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.010
So this concludes the proof.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.300
So even though this
lemma is pretty

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.010
straightforward in
the sense that we all

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:52.010
feel that if you have a walk,
then you can create a path,

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.750
if you really want to write it
down with all the principles

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.594
that we have been
taught, you can see

00:11:57.594 --> 00:11:58.760
a few things appearing here.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.170
So we first started with
the well ordering principle.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:07.620
And also we used the method
of contradiction in our proof.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.910
So let's set talk about
the next definition.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.180
So we talked about
walks and paths.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.430
Let's talk about connectivity.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.430
We actually defined
two vertices, u and v

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.710
to be connected if
there is a path that

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:39.160
connects u to v. So
u and v are connected

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:49.680
if there is a path from u to v.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.540
And now we can talk about the
graphs that are connected.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.090
That's a very important concept.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:14.480
A graph is connected if every
pair of vertices is connected.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:25.490
So when every pair of vertices
in the graph are connected.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:32.130
So an example is the particular
graph on the blackboard.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.720
You can see here that
there's always a path

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.210
to be found from this vertex,
to this one, or to that one,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.140
to this. to that,
to this, or that.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.420
You can do this for
any two vertices.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.130
So this is a connected graph.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.500
A graph that is not
connected looks something

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.560
like this for example.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.980
You may have a single
edge plus, say,

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.532
another triangle,
maybe with another edge

00:14:02.532 --> 00:14:03.490
or something like that.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.780
So they are disconnected
from this vertex.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.690
I do not have a
graph that connects

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.080
to this vertex over here.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.640
So this is about connectivity.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:22.730
And now we can start talking
about cycles and closed walks.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:34.686
Together, these concepts
will help us to define trees.

00:14:34.686 --> 00:14:36.560
And then we can start
talking about this very

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.320
special concept, spanning trees.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.280
So let's see how that works.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.300
So cycles and closed walks.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.980
We first define a closed walk.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:04.210
And once we have done this, we
are able to get into cycles.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.120
So what's a closed walk?

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.830
Well, it's actually a walk for
which the start and the end

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:09.830
vertex are the same.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:23.980
So it starts and ends at
exactly the same vertex.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.830
So this is all pretty
straightforward.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:39.360
So we have v0 connected to,
say, v1, all the way up to vk.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.650
And vk itself is equal to v0.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.790
So you have a walk
that goes all the way

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.420
from v0 all the way back to vk.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:53.020
For example, in this graph, you
could have walked all the way

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.920
back to v0.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.820
You would have a closed walk.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.160
So what's a cycle?

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.000
A cycle is a little
bit more special

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.900
in which all these
vertices over here

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.600
are actually different
from one another.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.240
So if k is at least
three-- so the walk

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.940
is not just a simple edge,
or just a single vertex.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:29.340
And if all v0, v1, all the way
up to vk minus 1 are different,

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:36.900
then we are saying
that we have a cycle.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.060
Then it is called a cycle.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.240
So these two concepts,
connectivity and cycles,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.485
will help us to define trees.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.630
So what are trees?

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.580
A simple example
is something that

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.570
looks like this, for example.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.530
The idea is that a
tree is both connected.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.630
And it has no cycles.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.760
So in this case, we can see
that every vertex it's connected

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.310
to every other vertex.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.359
But there is no cycle like
a triangle or something

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.220
that is connected all around.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.920
So let's define this properly.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:43.690
A definition is that a
connected and acyclic graph

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.720
is called a tree.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.870
And within trees, we also
have something very special

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.520
that we call leaves.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.600
And leaves are exactly those
nodes that have degree one.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.740
So for example, this
node has degree one.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.290
It has only this
edge connected to it.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.840
So this is called a leaf.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.964
This one also is a leaf
because it has just one edge

00:18:10.964 --> 00:18:11.630
connected to it.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.290
But this lead over
here has three edges.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.140
So it has degree three.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.830
This one has degree four.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.850
This is the leaf again.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:23.130
This one is a leaf,
this one, and this one.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.230
So this is very
important concept.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.920
We often use leaves
in our proofs.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.510
And we will get to one.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:45.620
So a lead is a node with
degree one in a tree.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.640
OK great.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.470
So now let's have
a look at trees.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.410
Suppose I'm looking at
a subgraph of a tree.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.947
What can we say
about a subgraph?

00:19:02.947 --> 00:19:04.530
What kind of structure
does this have?

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:10.310
So suppose for example I want to
take some connected subgraphs.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.060
So that's what I'm
actually interested in.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.400
So for example, I
take this-- suppose

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.170
I take this connected subgraph.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.150
Then what does it look like?

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.460
Do we see some
structure in this?

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.420
It's-- no?

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.620
AUDIENCE: It's a tree.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's a three.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.710
So are we able to
prove this also?

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:42.060
So this lemma you
actually lose later on.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:54.940
So any connected subgraph
of the tree is a tree.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:02.440
And to prove-- well, how
can we start out a proof?

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.750
Any suggestions?

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.280
So let's have a look here.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.960
So how may I think about this?

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.300
Well, I may take a
connected subgraph,

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.596
and I want to show--
of a tree- and I

00:20:14.596 --> 00:20:16.880
want show that it is a tree.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.144
A general method could
be, for example, to--

00:20:21.144 --> 00:20:23.736
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
You know, one

00:20:23.736 --> 00:20:25.518
of the things, one
of the conditions

00:20:25.518 --> 00:20:28.434
is it has to be acyclical.

00:20:28.434 --> 00:20:31.836
So since you're not adding
nodes and you're not

00:20:31.836 --> 00:20:35.794
starting within cycles, you
can't create a new cycle.

00:20:35.794 --> 00:20:36.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.840
I think you're saying
something like,

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.480
if I have a connected
subgraph, which

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.979
is like a smaller
part of the tree--

00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:46.520
now suppose that
would not be a tree.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.450
Say it would have a cycle.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.840
Then that cycle would also be
present in the tree itself.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.020
And that's not really possible
because a tree has no cycles.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.440
So that's sort of indeed
how the proof goes.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.550
So we essentially
use contradiction.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:13.830
So let's suppose that this
connected subgraph is actually

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.470
not a tree.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.980
So suppose it's a
connected subgraph.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.040
It's not a tree.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.690
Well then, in that case,
it must have a cycle,

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.110
because a tree is something
that is both connected

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.850
and has a cycle and is acyclic.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.590
We have a connected subgraph,
which is not a tree.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.870
So it must have a cycle.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.480
So it has a cycle.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.400
But now since it is a
subgraph of the bigger graph,

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.780
we know that the cycle must
also be in the whole graph.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:07.190
So the whole graph has
this particular cycle.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.620
Wait a minute.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.420
The whole graph is the tree.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.130
And a tree's acyclic.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.280
So we get a contradiction.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.610
So that means that our original
assumption that it's not a tree

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:21.890
is wrong.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.580
So it is a tree.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.725
So this is, again, such a
general kind of proof method

00:22:27.725 --> 00:22:30.520
that we repeatedly use here.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.380
So this lemma, which
we will call two,

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.820
we will use in the
next proof where

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.970
we're going to talk about the
relationship between vertices

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.040
and edges within trees.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.450
It's a very beautiful
relationship.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:05.150
The lemma states if you have
a tree that has n vertices,

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.840
then it must have
n minus 1 edges.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.110
So this is a very tight
relationship here.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:23.070
So a tree with n vertices
has n minus 1 edges.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.860
So let's see.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.930
How can we prove this one?

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:27.770
Any suggestions?

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.600
So what did we use at the
beginning of the course here?

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.040
So we have n vertices.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.020
And we want to show that
it has n minus 1 edges.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.670
We can use induction, right?

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:50.350
So let's use induction.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.720
on n.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.280
So how do we proceed
if you do this?

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.920
Well, we always start out
with an induction hypothesis.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.640
So the statement here
would be something

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:15.380
like, well, there are n minus
1 edges in any n vertex tree.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.950
And if you start with
induction, you always

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.580
start with the base case, right?

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.930
So we have the base case.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.540
So how does this work?

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:33.090
So for example, we
want to consider P1.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:37.069
So there are zero edges
in any one vertex tree.

00:24:37.069 --> 00:24:38.110
Well, that's true, right?

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.390
If I have just one
vertex, there's no edge.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.630
So this is definitely correct.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.930
So that's easy.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:53.900
So let's prove the other part,
which is the inductive step.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:02.306
And the inductive step is--

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:11.270
So to do the inductive step, we
are going to always assume Pn.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.530
And then we want
to prove Pn plus 1.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.060
So let's do this.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.390
So we have the inductive step.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.780
And we always start
out the same way.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:32.850
So we suppose P of n.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.960
And now we want to
prove Pn plus 1.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.350
So how do we do this?

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.910
Well, take a tree that has
n plus 1 vertices vertices.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.390
And we want to show
that it has n edges.

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.680
So take any such tree.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:56.660
So let T be a tree that
has n plus 1 vertices.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.880
So how can we use the
induction hypothesis here?

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.360
So do you have any
ideas over here?

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.100
So I have a tree with
n plus 1 vertices.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.960
And if I want to be able
to use this induction

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.740
at this induction
hypothesis, then I

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:24.125
can only apply it on trees
that have n vertices.

00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.960
So somehow I have to
delete one vertex.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.440
Right?

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.120
So what kind of vertex
can I delete in such a way

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.480
that we still have a tree?

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:44.550
And I need that because
this induction step can only

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.660
be applied to trees.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:53.060
So what type of vertex can I
remove from a tree and it still

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.560
stays a tree?

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.630
So for example, if you look
at this example up here,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.540
what kind of vertex
can I remove here?

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.326
AUDIENCE: A leaf.

00:27:02.326 --> 00:27:04.230
PROFESSOR: Yeah, except.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.594
I can remove a leaf--
for example, this one.

00:27:06.594 --> 00:27:07.260
And why is that?

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.790
Because if there's only one
edge connected to the rest

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:15.420
of the tree-- so if I delete
it, I will actually keep a tree.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.070
So that's how the
proof will continue.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.170
So we take out one vertex.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:25.850
So let v be a leaf of the tree.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:35.970
And let's remove this
particular vertex.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.250
So what do we get?

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:47.600
Well, we again have
a connected subgraph.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:56.540
So this creates a
connected subgraph.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.740
And we also know
that this is a tree.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.640
So how can we conclude that?

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.060
Well, we had another
lemma somewhere

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.060
that's behind this blackboard.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.555
It says that if you
have connected subgraph,

00:28:11.555 --> 00:28:13.896
then we still have a tree.

00:28:13.896 --> 00:28:15.040
So this is great.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.380
So this is also a tree.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:28.290
So now we can apply Pn
because we have n vertices,

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.140
because we deleted one.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:36.630
So by Pn, we can conclude
that this particular subgraph

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.510
has n minus 1 edges.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.070
You simply apply our
statement over here.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.960
But we want to say something
about the original tree.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.680
So how do we do this?

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.840
Well, we have to somehow
reconstruct this tree.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.972
Well, we have deleted v. So
we have to reattach v again.

00:28:58.972 --> 00:28:59.680
So let's do this.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:08.730
So we reattach v.
And if I do this,

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.310
well, let's look at
this example over here.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.950
I reattach the leaf.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:16.260
I will add one more edge.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:21.100
So if I reattach
this particular leaf,

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:27.100
I will get back the
original T over here.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.600
And how many edges does it have?

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.650
Well, it has these
n minus 1 edges

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:41.890
plus the one edge that is
needed to reattach the leaf.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:46.420
So that's all together
exactly n edges.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:54.430
So now we have shown that for
every n plus 1 vertex tree,

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.440
every such tree has n edges.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.740
So now we're done, because
this shows P n plus 1.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.105
So this is how the
lemma is proved.

00:30:05.105 --> 00:30:08.980
And in the homework,
you actually use this.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.895
So let's now talk about very
special trees, spanning trees.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.760
I think this is a
very exciting topic.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.060
So let's look at this
particular graph over here.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.380
Let's define spanning trees.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.640
So what's a spanning tree?

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:42.420
A spanning tree is a subgraph of
a graph that somehow spans all

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.680
the vertices within this graph.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.830
So it's a tree that touches
every single vertex.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:54.718
So for example, we may have--

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.690
Maybe this is not
such a bright color.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.460
Maybe this one.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:07.590
So for example, we may have
a tree that looks like this.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.450
So in this particular
graph, we can

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:24.840
create a subgraph with
the thickened green edges

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.480
over here, which is a
tree, and also covers

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.972
all the different vertices
of the original graph.

00:31:32.972 --> 00:31:35.180
This is actually pretty
amazing that you can do this,

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:40.030
you can actually create
such a kind of tree.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.950
And what you want to
prove, first of all,

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.510
is that for every
connected graph,

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.870
we can construct
such a spanning tree.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.660
So let's first define this.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.610
And then we will
prove this theorem.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:00.660
And then after this, we're going
to talk about weighted graphs.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.772
That will lead to minimum
weight spanning trees.

00:32:04.772 --> 00:32:06.230
And then it gets
really interesting

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.510
because you want to figure
out how we can actually

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.710
construct those for any graph.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:19.930
So let's define a spanning tree.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.725
A spanning tree--

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:40.230
And we appreciate this as
SD-- of a connected graph

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:51.820
is actually a subgraph
that is a tree.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.900
So that's the first condition.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.940
And it also covers all
the other vertices.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:06.725
So it has the same
vertices as the graph.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.970
And over here, we
have this example.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.960
So now what you want to show
is the following theorem

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.940
that any connected
graph actually

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.810
has such a spanning tree.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:43.110
So the theorem is
every connected graph

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.760
has a spanning tree.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.090
And let's think about
a proof together.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:59.020
So for example, we may
start with the idea

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.510
to use a contradiction.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.810
Suppose there exists
a connected graph that

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.450
has no spanning tree.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.540
So how would we go ahead?

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:21.644
So how can we prove that we
have a contradiction here?

00:34:21.644 --> 00:34:24.830
So the proof that we're
going to propose here

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:25.820
is by contradiction.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.620
That means that we're going
to assume the opposite.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:42.040
So assume that we have
a connected graph,

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.014
a connected graph G.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.600
That has no spanning tree.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.450
So how can we use this?

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.300
How could this be strange?

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.520
Or what can we do here?

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:17.390
So one of the nice things
about trees over here is--

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:22.970
so that maybe gives us some
insight is that if we have

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:29.395
a tree-- well, it seems like
such a kind of spanning tree is

00:35:29.395 --> 00:35:31.739
like--

00:35:32.238 --> 00:35:36.000
It's a solution to a
subgraph that is connected

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.555
with a minimum number of edges.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:46.970
Like if I have any other type
of subgraph-- for example,

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.900
if it has cycles, I can always
remove an edge of course.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:36:00.260
So we know a subgraph of G that
touches all the different edges

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.980
and has a cycle
can get shortened

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.240
by eliminating one
edge of a cycle that's

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.370
within such as a subgraph.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.910
So maybe we have an idea here.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.340
And maybe we can use this.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:23.370
So maybe we can say, let's
set consider a graph T. So

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:30.730
let T be a connected subgraph
of G, but with a property

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:34.570
that it has a minimum
number of edges.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:41.790
So let this be a
connected subgraph of G.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:47.290
And we assume that it has the
same vertices of G of course.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:37:00.200
In addition, it has the smallest
number of edges possible.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:18.720
So what do we know?

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.410
Well, let's look at
our assumption here.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:25.070
We said that a connected
graph, G-- that's

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.140
what we consider
here-- for which

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.379
there is no spanning tree.

00:37:29.379 --> 00:37:30.170
So what do we know?

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.622
We know that this
particular T over here

00:37:32.622 --> 00:37:34.830
can definitely not be a
spanning tree, because that's

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:35.790
what we assume here.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.920
Can we use this?

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.230
So let's think about this.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:55.510
So if it is not a spanning
tree, then what must it have?

00:37:55.510 --> 00:38:01.380
So we already know that T
is a connected subgraph of G

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:06.180
with the same vertices of
G. So the only difference

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:11.035
between a spanning tree and T
is that the spanning tree is

00:38:11.035 --> 00:38:15.550
a tree, and T is not a tree.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.870
So therefor, T
must have a cycle.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:22.790
So we use our
assumption over here.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:27.730
We know that T is
not a spanning tree.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:31.060
And now we can conclude
that it must have a cycle.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:42.530
So now we can start
thinking about this cycle.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.820
And let's feel--

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.830
What can we do here?

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:52.445
So we constructed T
as the subgraph that

00:38:52.445 --> 00:38:55.730
has the minimum number
of edges possible.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.480
So now if you have a
cycle, the whole idea

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.750
is that we're going to delete
one of the edges of the cycle.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.710
And if you do that, we will
be able to construct a smaller

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:11.420
subgraph T, essentially, with
a smaller number of edges.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:15.370
And that contradicts this
particular statement over here.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.900
So that's sort of
how we go ahead.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.370
So if it has a cycle,
let's write it out.

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:26.195
For example, here we
have a cycle like this.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:36.820
Well, let's prove that if
we remove one of the cycle,

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:41.280
that we still have a
connected subgraph.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.180
So the whole graph T
is much bigger, right?

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:49.480
It has lots of
connections and so on.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.470
Suppose we will remove this
particular edge over here.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.100
So we remove this one.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:03.060
Do we still have a
connected subgraph of G

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.060
that covers all
the vertices of G?

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.010
Well, of course it cover
all the vertices of G

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:09.980
because we only removed
an edge over here.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.630
So that's fine.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.900
All these parts are still
connected to the rest.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:23.080
If you can show that it is
connected, then well we just--

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.380
well, we removed one edge.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.210
So we actually created
this smaller graph.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:28.510
And then we get contradiction.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:30.800
And then we're done
with our proof.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.330
So let's see whether we
can prove that if we remove

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.350
this particular edge
over here, that we still

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.110
have a connected subgraph.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:40.055
So how can we do this?

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:51.382
Well, let's take-- so the
first case would be if a vertex

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:56.020
x is connected to y.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:00.000
So I want to take any
pair x, y of vertices.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.210
And suppose that the path
that connects x and y

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:09.030
does not contain this particular
edge e that I remove here.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:18.000
So suppose this
does not contain e.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.770
So I look at the graph
T. I Know T is connected.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.110
So I take a pair of
vertices x and y.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:31.020
I know there is a path
between x and y in T.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:35.360
If this path does not
contain the edge e,

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.410
then I know that the same path
still exists in the same graph

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.620
where I've removed
this particular edge.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.960
So that's great, right?

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.110
I have shown that
x and y are still

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:51.250
connected in the new graph
where I've removed this e.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.870
So now let's look
at another case.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:56.440
For example, x is over here.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.500
And it is connected all
the way through here

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:06.770
over this particular edge all
the way to, say, y over here.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.360
So this is case number two.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.660
Well, are x ad y
still connected?

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.650
Yes they are, right?

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:25.610
Because I have removed
e from a cycle.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:30.400
So I can still go into the
other direction of the cycle

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.540
and connect back towards y.

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:38.710
So what we see here is that
x can go all the way to here.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.110
But it can still go
over the cycle back

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:45.090
to here, and then to y.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.410
So we are still connected.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.120
So this shows that
in both of the cases,

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.260
for any pair of vertices,
even after removal of e,

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.050
the graph T minus this
edge e is still connected.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:02.990
So let's write this out.

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:20.540
So all vertices in G
are still connected

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:31.150
after removing e from T.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:32.730
So now we are done.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:35.320
So what was that again?

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.290
We now constructed
a smaller graph--

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:42.540
smaller in the sense that it has
one less edge-- that is still

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:46.890
connected, and with
the same vertices as G.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:49.470
But I assumed that T
was already the smallest

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.450
such graph, such subgraph.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.370
So we have a contradiction.

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:56.190
So what does this mean?

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.870
This means that our original
assumption that we have over

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:03.170
here cannot be true because
we started off with this

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.530
assumption.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:07.460
Because of this, we could
start to construct this.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:11.705
And then you could derive
this whole argumentation.

00:44:11.705 --> 00:44:13.330
And in the end, we
get a contradiction.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.750
So our original
assumption is wrong.

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:20.040
So actually, this
is not possible.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.760
There does not exist a connected
graph G that has no ST.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.120
So the theorem is true.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.590
So this is an important theorem.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:34.416
So now we can start talking
about weighted minimum spanning

00:44:34.416 --> 00:44:34.915
trees.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:48.020
So let's use this picture over
here and assign some weights

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.260
to this graph.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:08.800
So for example, we have 1,
2, 2, 3, 3, 3, a 1 over here,

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:15.130
another 1, 1, 4, and 7.

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:20.950
And let's construct
a spanning tree.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.110
So let me give an
example over here.

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:25.980
Actually, this is an example
that we have right her

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.580
in the thick lines in green.

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.430
So what is the weight
of the spanning tree

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.580
that we have here?

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.920
So we simply add the
weights of all the edges.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.020
So we have 7, 3.

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:38.960
That makes 10.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:44.800
11, 14, another
2, 16, 17, 18, 19.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:53.650
So the weight of this
particular spanning tree is 19.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.700
So now the problem
is-- and that's

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.970
the rest of the
lecture-- how can you

00:45:57.970 --> 00:45:59.790
construct a minimum
weight spanning

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:05.870
tree, one that has the
minimum weight possible?

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:09.380
So we see another example.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.280
So could I swap
some edges around

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.560
or something like that such
that I can get a lesser weight?

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.940
So for example, over here,
I have-- for example,

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:27.290
this node over here is connected
by an edge that has weight 3.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:29.590
But I could also
have connected it

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:33.530
to this particular one over
here, which is only weight 1.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:39.220
If I do this, I actually improve
the spanning tree construction.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:44.035
So I will get something
that looks like--

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.095
Let's see-- that
looks like this.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.590
And now we replaced 3 by 1.

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:02.260
So it gets 17.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:06.060
So can we do anything
less than this?

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.580
That's maybe-- it's
still a tree, right?

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:09.850
Because there's no cycle.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:14.300
Here we have this, this,
this, this part over here.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.230
If you want to have
connected subgraph,

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.040
I always need the 7 in here.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:25.170
Well, it seems like you
cannot really replace anything

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.020
by something cheaper.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:34.467
Like any edge in here seems
to be pretty necessary.

00:47:34.467 --> 00:47:36.300
Of course, what I could
do is I could create

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.000
other minimum spanning trees.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.060
So actually it turns out that
17 is the minimum weight.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.640
For example, I could,
instead of this edge,

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.270
I could use this edge.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:46.930
That's another solution.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:50.070
Or instead of this edge,
I could use this edge.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.080
So how do we construct such a
minimum weight spanning tree?

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.330
Can we somehow find an
algorithm that creates this?

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:09.220
And that's the big
problem of today.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.860
So let me write out
one spanning tree

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:16.890
that I will use for
the rest of this class.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:23.604
And maybe I will use a
little bit different color.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:36.720
Let's use red over here.

00:48:39.892 --> 00:48:40.850
I hope this is visible.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:49.828
So we have red, this
one, and this one,

00:48:49.828 --> 00:48:54.300
and this one, and this
one, and this one.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.480
That's going to
be-- this is going

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.440
to be the spanning tree
that I'm going to look at.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.730
This is also weight 17.

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.780
So let's first define what a
minimum weight spanning tree

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:15.180
is, just to be very precise.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.610
And then let's
have an algorithm.

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:22.790
Maybe you have already ideas
of how this could be done.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.610
It turns out actually
that if you just

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:26.890
start with a greedy
approach, you just

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:31.420
start to add sort of through
the edges of minimum weight,

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:36.630
that you can still add
without creating any cycles.

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.300
You will get an
algorithm that is

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.030
going to do the trick for you.

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:43.830
So that's kind of surprising.

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:46.555
So let's talk about
the definition.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:50:01.830
So the minimum spanning tree
of an edge weighted graph

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:06.030
is defined as--

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:17.270
It's defined as the
spanning tree of G such

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:31.850
that it has the smallest
possible sum of edge weights.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.810
Well the algorithm
that I'm thinking about

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:46.530
here is very straightforward.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:49.610
Actually I'll use
this blackboard

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:52.160
because this algorithm
will be the focus

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.930
of the rest of the lecture.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:09.870
So what's the algorithm?

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:20.430
We actually grow a
subgraph step by step.

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:35.360
So one edge at a time
such that at each step

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:55.850
we want to add the
minimum weight edge that

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:57.900
keeps the subgraph acyclic.

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.940
So this is our algorithm.

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.010
Let's have a look how this
works in this particular graph

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:18.733
over here.

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.530
So suppose I would
start off with-- well,

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:31.080
if I start with this algorithm.

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.340
I take, say, any
minimum weight edge.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.120
Say I take this particular one.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.160
So this could be my
first edge that I choose.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:43.980
Then I may want to choose
another minimum weight

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.199
edge such that I do
not create a cycle.

00:52:47.199 --> 00:52:48.490
Well, which one could I choose?

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:49.770
I could choose this one.

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:52.494
I could also choose this one.

00:52:52.494 --> 00:52:54.160
With this one, I could
choose this part.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.826
With this one, I could
choose that part.

00:52:55.826 --> 00:52:57.430
I could also choose this one.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:00.780
So let's choose
this one actually.

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.540
This would be our second
step and our second edge

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.490
that we select in our algorithm.

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.130
There are two disjoint edges.

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:09.820
So there's definitely no graph.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.810
Well, maybe now
our third step, I

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:21.390
can choose one of these edges,
which also has just weight

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:23.030
1, which is minimum weight.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.323
So this could be my
third possibility.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.570
Then what's the
fourth possibility?

00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:35.890
Well, I have to choose
one of those actually.

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:40.350
I cannot choose
this weight 1 edge?

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:40.850
Why not?

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.400
Because that would
create a cycle.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.520
So I'm not allowed to
choose this one anymore.

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.340
So I choose one of these two.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.860
So for example, I choose
this one over here.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:55.410
This is the fourth edge that
I add to the whole picture.

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:57.200
So note that in the meantime.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.370
I have two disconnected
components.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:07.300
One other here, which is this
arc, and another arc over here.

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.860
So which edge do I attach
now in the algorithm?

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:15.050
Well, I can still add
this minimum weight edge

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:20.140
over here of weight two, because
it does not create any cycle.

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.860
So this would be
the fifth wonder

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.500
that I add to the whole picture.

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:28.750
Well, now I can choose
either one of those.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.310
So for example, this
would be my sixth step.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:35.420
And then finally, I can
choose none of these

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:37.410
because those would
create cycles.

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:39.350
But I can choose this one.

00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:42.990
So this is going to be
the seventh one that I

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:47.270
add to the whole graph
that I construct here

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:49.060
and grow in this algorithm.

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.510
It turns out that this algorithm
actually creates for you

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:53.360
a minimum spanning tree.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.700
And the proof is
much more complex

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:58.120
than what you have seen before.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.970
So that's what we're
going to do right now.

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:06.050
So when we think
about this algorithm,

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:10.220
then somehow I want to guarantee
that at every single step,

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:14.090
I will be able to grow into
a minimum spanning tree.

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:18.090
And that's the basic
intuition that we have.

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:21.520
And that's the lemma that
we want to prove first.

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:29.227
So formalizing, we
get the following.

00:55:29.227 --> 00:55:30.935
We want to prove the
following statement.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:46.870
So the lemma that will help us
is let S be the set of edges

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:53.100
that I have been selecting
up to now in the algorithm.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:56:00.175
So let S consist, for
example, of the first m edges.

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:17.760
What we want to show
is that we can still

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.960
extend this set of edges
into a minimum spanning tree.

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.190
We can still grow
within the algorithm

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.950
into a minimum spanning tree.

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:28.280
That is what you want to show.

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:34.300
So we want to show that their
exists a minimum spanning tree

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:41.942
T that has the vertex
set V and an edge set E.

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.220
So this is the minimum
spanning tree for the graph G

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:57.950
such that S is actually
a subset of the edges

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:59.200
in this minimum spanning tree.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.780
So this is a nice
mathematical formulation

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:08.836
that really precisely
states that we can still

00:57:08.836 --> 00:57:10.710
keep on growing into a
minimum spanning tree.

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:13.560
So how would this lemma help
us in proving the theorem

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.980
that we want to show?

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:20.110
Actually, where is the theorem?

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:23.080
I did not write down
the theorem so far.

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.180
I can put this over here.

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:26.910
So the theorem
that's want to show

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:43.990
is that for any connected
weighted graph G,

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.180
the algorithm creates a
minimum spanning tree.

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:59.960
The algorithm produces
a minimum spanning tree.

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.580
So how can we prove his theorem?

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.840
Suppose we know that
this lemma is true,

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.050
which we will prove later.

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:10.010
Then how do we know
that this theorem holds?

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.630
Actually, I'm wiping out this
particular theorem over here.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:20.530
We will use this in a moment.

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:23.990
So we know that every connected
graph has a spanning tree.

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:26.740
We already know that.

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.880
But now we want to
show that we can even

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.480
construct a minimum spanning
tree for a weighted graph.

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:36.140
So how are we going ahead?

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:45.820
The proof of the
theorem is as follows.

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.940
I will suppose that
the number of edges--

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:52.320
the number of vertices--
is actually equal to n.

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:57.750
And if we want to show that we
get to a minimum spanning tree,

00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:00.820
we want to first of all
show that the algorithm

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:05.840
is able to choose at least
n minus 1 edges, right?

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.100
Because a tree has
n minus 1 edges.

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:09.395
We have shown this before.

00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:15.030
The algorithm should
not get stuck.

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:17.280
So let's first prove that.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:23.160
So suppose I have chosen
less than n minus 1 edges.

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:31.920
So suppose we have less
than n minus 1 edges picked.

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:35.220
Well then what do we know?

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:44.460
Well, there exists as
edge in E minus S--

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:48.510
well, let me first
write it out--

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:58.440
that can be added
without creating a cycle.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.760
So why is this?

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.220
Well, I know that
E is the edge set

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.760
of my minimum spanning tree.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:18.390
I know that S is a part of--
is a subset of all the edges.

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:21.490
I know that a minimum
spanning tree is a tree.

01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:24.570
It's a tree on n vertices.

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:29.870
We know that's a tree on n
vertices has n minus 1 edges.

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:35.070
I know that less than n minus 1
edges have been chosen so far.

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:40.720
So that means that S has
less than n minus 1 edges.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.650
E has successfully
n minus 1 edges.

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:45.915
So there's at least one
edge that is contained,

01:00:45.915 --> 01:00:52.345
that it is an element
in E, but not in S.

01:00:52.345 --> 01:00:55.610
And for that
particular edge-- well,

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:58.390
since it's part of
this tree, together

01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:05.340
with S, which is also part of
all the edges within the tree--

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:08.770
well, we know that that
edge, for that reason,

01:01:08.770 --> 01:01:11.990
will not create a cycle.

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:14.830
Because otherwise, the
original would have a cycle.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.340
So we know that the
algorithm can always

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:25.300
select an edge such that's
no cycle is created.

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.960
And that means that we can
keep on going in the algorithm

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:33.410
until at least n minus
1 edges are selected.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:36.695
So what happens if we
have n minus 1 edges?

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:49.960
So once n minus 1
edges have been chosen,

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:54.500
well, then S has
exactly n minus 1 edges.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.450
E has exactly n minus 1
edges, because it's a tree.

01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:59.930
They are subsets of one another.

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:02.330
So they must be
equal to one another.

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:04.160
So essentially what
we have here is

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:10.040
that S exactly defines
the minimum spanning tree

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.730
that we are looking for.

01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:15.880
So the algorithm
at the very end,

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.010
when it has chosen
n minus 1 edges,

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:21.540
produces a minimum
spanning tree.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:34.130
So we know that S defines
the edges of a minimum weight

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:35.970
spanning tree.

01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:38.610
So if this lemma
really holds true,

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:41.226
then this theorem can be shown.

01:02:41.226 --> 01:02:42.850
So now let's have a
look at this lemma.

01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:44.830
And we're going to use
that picture over there

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.610
to see how we can prove this.

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:51.610
So this is a little bit tricky.

01:02:51.610 --> 01:03:00.340
And the way to go about this
is actually to use induction.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.640
So let's check see whether
we can do this together.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.740
So the proof of the
lemma is as follows.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.940
We want to use induction.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.160
On what do you think we
are going to induct here?

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.560
Well, we want to prove
this particular lemma,

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.490
and we have this
particular variable m.

01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:34.790
So that seems to be a
good methods to continue.

01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:36.840
So we'll use induction on m.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:47.030
Let's state the
induction hypothesis.

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:49.000
Well, it's exactly the
same as in the lemma.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.780
So we say for all
G and for all sets

01:03:54.780 --> 01:04:12.730
S that consists of the
first m selected edges,

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:22.120
there exists a minimum
spanning tree of G such

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:28.780
that S is a subset of E.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.020
So this is how
induction hypothesis.

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:34.720
And as always, we start
with the base case.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.980
And the base case is
going to be pretty

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.900
straightforward in
this particular case.

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:44.690
We have to do a little
bit of work for it.

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:46.660
So let's see how that works.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:50.620
So the base case is m equals 0.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.880
So let's reread this statement
where m is equal to 0.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:03.780
Well, if we have zero selected
edges, then S is the empty set.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.900
So I have to prove
that for all G,

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:09.240
there exists a minimum
spanning tree such

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.010
that the empty set is a subset
of E. Well, the empty set is

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:14.691
always a subset of E, right?

01:05:14.691 --> 01:05:15.565
So that's no problem.

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:20.570
So what I need to proof
is that for all G,

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:25.780
there exists a minimum
spanning tree of G.

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.610
And this is where our
previous theorem comes in,

01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:32.010
because we showed
that for all graphs G,

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:33.450
there exists a spanning tree.

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:34.950
And if there exists
a spanning tree,

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:38.540
there exists a minimum
weight spanning tree.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.660
So that's the base case.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:46.380
So m equals 0 implies that
S is equal to the empty set.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.530
So that means that
S is definitely

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:58.420
a subset for any set of edges of
a minimum weight spanning tree.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:07.030
And now we're going to use our
theorem to show that there also

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:08.570
exists a minimum spanning tree.

01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:10.950
So this in itself is not
yet sufficient, right?

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:13.970
You see that.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.450
I know that if S
is the empty set,

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:19.120
then I know that
this always holds.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.230
But the statement is
a little bit bigger.

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:23.989
For all G, I still
need to prove there

01:06:23.989 --> 01:06:25.280
exists a minimum spanning tree.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.950
And that's what our
previous theorem told us.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:29.800
So we'll now write
that part out.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.090
So we have to base case.

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:36.130
Let's see.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:49.020
I think I will go and
prove this over here.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.106
So let's look at the--

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.850
That's the inductive step.

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:59.750
And then hopefully we can play
a little bit with this picture

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.916
up here to get some insight.

01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:09.050
So how do we do this?

01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:13.480
Well, with an inductive
step, we start as usual.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:23.765
We assume that P of m holds.

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:27.880
Now how do we go ahead?

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:34.160
So I want to prove Pm plus
1, which is stated over here.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:38.150
So I want to consider
the set S that

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:40.960
consists of the first n
plus 1 selected edges.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.140
So well, essentially
what I'm interested in

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:49.940
is what happens in
the n plus 1 step.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:08:03.484
So let E denote the edge that
I added in the m plus 1 step.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:16.319
And let S be the first
m selected edges.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:19.500
And we know that we can
apply p of m for S, right?

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.960
Because we assume this
is our inductive step.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.140
So we can apply
something for S. We

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.554
would like to show Pm plus 1.

01:08:27.554 --> 01:08:28.970
So we would like
to show something

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:30.710
for the union of those two.

01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:33.870
So let me repeat that.

01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:40.800
Let S denote the first
m selected edges.

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:54.430
So by our induction hypothesis,
we can-- well, let's apply it.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:57.810
We know that there
exists a minimum spanning

01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:01.700
tree such that S is a
subset of the edges.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:06.050
So let's just pick one
such minimum spanning tree.

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:11.490
So let T star be such a
minimum spanning tree.

01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:13.490
It has edges E star.

01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:27.640
And we know that S is
actually a subset of E star.

01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:37.507
Let's look at the
very first case.

01:09:37.507 --> 01:09:39.840
So what are the kind of cases
that we are interested in?

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.700
So let's think again.

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.990
What do we need to prove?

01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:45.420
We need to prove Pn plus 1.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.670
So we need to prove something
about the union of S and E.

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:52.729
We want to show that there is
a minimum spanning tree such

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:56.220
that the edge set of this
minimum spanning tree

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:01.190
contains both S and also E.

01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:05.100
So what kind of cases
can we handle here?

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:09.590
Well, what will be a
really good first case?

01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:13.260
The first case could be
that E is actually already

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.790
part of E star.

01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:20.980
Well, if that's true, then
of course, S together with E

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:24.700
is also a subset of E star.

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:32.450
And that means that we are
done, in this particular case.

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:33.570
And why is this?

01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:38.220
Because this is an example of
a minimum spanning tree that

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.025
contains both S and E.
So it contains the n

01:10:41.025 --> 01:10:43.430
plus 1 first selected edges.

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:45.830
And so this is Pn plus 1.

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:47.890
Now the next case is
the difficult part.

01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:59.400
OK, let's wipe
out-- actually, we

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.150
do not really need the proof
of the theorem anymore.

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:05.930
So let's take this
off the blackboard.

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:18.910
So the way to do this
is to sort of see

01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:26.040
how we can use the tree, T
star, and somehow transform it

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.680
into another tree for
this particular case

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.565
where we assume that
E is not in E star.

01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:44.070
So let's have a look
at that graph up there.

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:45.730
Let me rewrite it a little bit.

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:50.020
And let's look at what
happens in the algorithm

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.200
after two steps.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.980
So I will redraw the graph.

01:11:54.980 --> 01:12:03.920
So we have, say, these edges.

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:19.370
This one-- let me see.

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:24.100
I want to use some different
colors to make this as clear

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.630
as possible.

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:28.623
We have this one.

01:12:28.623 --> 01:12:30.516
We have this one.

01:12:30.516 --> 01:12:33.170
We have this one.

01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:35.140
And we also have
this one actually.

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.440
Sorry.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:41.740
All right, so let's define
the different edges.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:46.290
The straight ones
from the set S.

01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:49.990
So after two steps over there,
we have selected this edge

01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:52.630
first, and then this
edge was the second edge

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:55.150
that we selected
in our algorithm.

01:12:55.150 --> 01:12:59.860
So these two together
form the set S.

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.100
So what is T star?

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.270
T star could be, for
example, the spanning tree

01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:14.155
that contains both these
edges plus the dotted ones.

01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:18.300
So let's have a look here.

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.390
This is indeed a tree, right?

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:26.580
And if we look into
this picture over here,

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:30.710
you can see that the weight
of this particular tree is 17.

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:33.180
It's also a minimum
weight spanning tree.

01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:37.240
What is G?

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.500
G is the complete graph and
contains not only these two

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:46.245
types of edges, but also these
sort of more orange colored

01:13:46.245 --> 01:13:46.744
ones.

01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:54.490
So this is so the
situation that we are in.

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:58.870
Now in our algorithm,
we want to choose

01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:02.350
this particular third edge.

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:09.140
So this is going to be our
e, this particular edge.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:13.320
And as you can see, e
is not part of T star.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.190
It's not one of those
two kinds of edges.

01:14:16.190 --> 01:14:20.230
It's actually one
of the orange edges.

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:22.400
So what can we do here?

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:29.640
Well, the idea is that we
want to recreate like a you

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.530
tree in which we somehow
exchange e-- exchange one

01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:39.330
of the edges in T
star with e, and still

01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:42.740
sort of maintaining the
minimum spanning tree property.

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:43.970
So how can you prove this?

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:57.190
The way to do this
is to figure out

01:14:57.190 --> 01:15:00.610
what the algorithm
teaches us about e,

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:04.771
and also what the tree
property tells us.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.410
So let's combine
all our knowledge.

01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:13.470
So first of all, we
know that the algorithm,

01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:18.470
from its definition,
implies that as together

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:24.370
with e, actually has no cycle.

01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:28.750
That's how we select
the n plus 1 edge.

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:32.710
There's no-- all
selected edged together

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:34.020
should not contain a cycle.

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.040
That's the definition
of the algorithm.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.430
We know that T star is a tree.

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:45.750
And this implies that if
you look at the graph that

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:49.710
has the edges, has the
vertices V together

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:56.250
with E star with edge e, then
this must contain a cycle.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.626
Now this property I will
not prove right now,

01:16:02.626 --> 01:16:04.000
but it is pretty
straightforward.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.840
It's a one line proof
actually in the book.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.080
So you can look it up.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:10.050
So it simply states that
if you have a tree, if you

01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:15.500
add another edge, an edge that
is not contained in E star,

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:19.110
then we will create a cycle.

01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:22.780
So now we can combine these
two statements together

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:30.500
and conclude that, well,
if S with e has no cycle,

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:36.940
but E star with e has a cycle,
and S is contained in E star,

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:39.180
well there's only
one possibility.

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:52.420
And that is that this cycle
must have an edge, e prime, that

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:56.210
is in E star minus S.

01:16:56.210 --> 01:16:59.630
Because if it would
not have such an edge,

01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:08.440
then all the edges of the cycle
must be located in S-- in S

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.432
together with E. But S
together with E has no cycle.

01:17:11.432 --> 01:17:12.390
So that's not possible.

01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:14.460
So this cycle must
have and edge e

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.850
prime that is outside
S, but still in E star.

01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:22.000
So we can find one over here.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.800
e prime can be this
particular edge.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.820
So e prime is in E star.

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:33.980
But it is not already
selected in S.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.085
So now we are going
to do a trick.

01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:43.560
The idea is to
swap e and e prime.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.580
So that's the main idea.

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:51.620
So let's first write down what
we know about the weight of e

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.770
prime and e.

01:17:53.770 --> 01:18:04.370
So since the algorithm,
well, could have selected e

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:07.300
or e prime-- it did
select e, right?

01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.670
But it could have
also selected e prime,

01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:15.150
because e prime does not
create a cycle with S.

01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:18.760
That's what we have seen here.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:27.920
So this really implies
therefore that the weight of e

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:35.520
is at most the
weight of e prime.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.210
So why is this?

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:39.540
Because the algorithm always
chooses the minimum weight.

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.515
And it can choose between e
or e prime, but it chose e.

01:18:43.515 --> 01:18:47.320
So the weight of e must be less
than the weight of e prime.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.620
So that's what we know also.

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:54.030
So now let's swap
e and e prime in T.

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:55.900
And then we're almost
done with this proof,

01:18:55.900 --> 01:19:02.295
because that will be the tree
of which we will prove that it

01:19:02.295 --> 01:19:04.386
is a minimum spanning tree.

01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:22.510
So the key idea is to swap e and
e prime in T. How do we do it?

01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:27.390
Well, let T double
star be equal to V

01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:32.080
with the edge set
E double star where

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:38.530
E double star is really equal
to, well, the original set E

01:19:38.530 --> 01:19:39.260
star.

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:43.000
But we take out of this e prime.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.330
So this one is taken out of
the minimum spanning tree.

01:19:46.330 --> 01:19:48.614
And we add e in here.

01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:54.440
Now we want to prove
that this particular T

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.100
double star is a minimum
spanning tree that

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:59.810
fits our lemma.

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:03.180
So what do we know?

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.366
We know that T double
star is acyclic.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.030
And why is this?

01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:25.500
Well, we actually removed e
prime from the only cycle-- so

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:33.000
look up here also-- the
only cycle in E star

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.720
together with e.

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:39.110
So it's acyclic.

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:41.130
T double star is also connected.

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.620
And why is that?

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:52.440
Well, since e prime is
removed-- but it was on a cycle.

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.988
So it remains connected.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:04.300
And finally, we also know
that T double star actually

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:15.530
contains all the vertices in
G. So all these three together

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:22.830
with prove that T double
star is a spanning tree of G,

01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:26.700
because it's acyclic, connected,
contains all the vertices.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:29.780
Is it a minimum
weight spanning tree?

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:34.840
Now we are really almost done,
because-- let me write it out

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.980
here.

01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:42.980
We know that the
weight of T double star

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:48.270
is at most the weight of T star.

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.210
Why is this?

01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:53.570
Well, we showed just
now that the weight of e

01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:55.350
is at most the
weight of e prime.

01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:58.360
So we have exchanged
e and e prime.

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.750
So that means that the
weight of T double star

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:04.110
is at most that of
the weight of T star.

01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:12.750
We also know that T star
is a minimum spanning tree.

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:17.600
So if you combine
these two together,

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.290
then we know that the weight of
T double star cannot get less

01:22:20.290 --> 01:22:22.010
than the minimum
weight possibility.

01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:25.080
So it also has a minimum weight.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:30.940
So T double star is a
minimum spanning tree.

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:33.250
So now we're done
because in this case,

01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:37.720
we have constructed
a T double star such

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:44.720
that S together with E is
a subset of E double star.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:50.630
And that means that we have
shown that our induction

01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:52.110
step is true.

01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:54.800
We have shown that
Pn plus 1 holds.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.040
So now we finally have figured
out that the lemma is true.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:05.080
And now we showed already how
to use the lemma in our proof

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.570
for this particular theorem.

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:11.030
So this is the end
of this lecture.

01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:14.620
And tomorrow, you will actually
go again over this proof

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.830
because it's rather complex.

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:19.740
And then hopefully you
really get into all

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:21.110
the different proof techniques.

01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.610
OK.

01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:23.510
Thank you.
