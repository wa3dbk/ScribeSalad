00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.920
PROFESSOR: OK let's get started.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.480
I once taught with
a professor who

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.100
was lamenting the fact that as
the term progresses attendance

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.830
in lecture tends to drop off.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.640
And gets pretty dramatic
by the end of the term

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.760
when you're lecturing,
and nobody's there.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.980
And I asked him what
he did about it.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.180
And he thought about
it and he said,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.030
there's only two things that
can get students to come

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.840
to lecture, candy and sex.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.510
Now we've already tried
candy, so today we're

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.410
going to talk about sex.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.600
In fact we're going
to use graph theory

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.630
to address a decades
old debate concerning

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.240
the relative promiscuity
of men versus women.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.410
Now graphs are incredibly useful
structures in computer science,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.270
and we're going to be studying
them for the next five or six

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.520
lectures.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.800
They come up in all sorts
of applications, scheduling,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.070
optimization,
communications, the design

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.710
and analysis of algorithms.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.310
In fact next week, you're
going to see how to Stanford

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.990
graduate students
became gazillionaires

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.200
because they use graph
theoretic in a clever way.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.470
But let's talk about sex.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.640
The issue that we're
going to address today

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.660
is one of the most talked
about, and most well studied,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.900
questions in all
of human sociology.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.400
On average, who has more
opposite gender partners,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.715
men or women?

00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:05.310
Now opposite gender is
going to be important.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.035
And by this I mean,
one boy, and one girl.

00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:11.035
All right, I'm not making
a political statement.

00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:16.770
It's just that the math is a lot
easier that way, as you'll see.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.860
Now I'd like to start
by taking a pole here

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.270
to see what you
think about that.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.830
So raise your and if you
think men, on average,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.910
have more opposite gender
partners than women do.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.095
Only a few.

00:02:31.095 --> 00:02:33.401
AUDIENCE: In life or [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:34.400
PROFESSOR: Um, you can--

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.640
PROFESSOR: One on one.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.970
OK, so let's say over the course
of their lives, let's say,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.200
or over the course of
2010, that men in America

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.460
have more opposite-gender
partners than women in America,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.830
say in 2010.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.030
Raise your hand if you think
men have more going on.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.040
All right a bunch of you.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.730
Raise your hand if
you think women have

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.890
more opposite-gender partners?

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.490
This is unusual.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.870
Maybe even more voted for
women, but it's close.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.744
Raise your hand if
you think it's equal.

00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:09.680
All right, about the same.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.550
Raise your hand if you think
there's no way to know,

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.210
that it's hopeless to
really figure it out.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.210
All right, nobody goes for that.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.565
All right, good.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:20.460
All right well now in
the popular literature,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.620
I think the feelings are
different than expressed here.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.450
Pretty much universally,
in the literature,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.000
it's believed that men have
more opposite-gender partners

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.216
than women.

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:30.590
And in fact, you
could even think

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.120
about that, if you
think about literature,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.780
the leader of the
harem is always a man.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.680
And he's got lots of women.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.540
In polygamist
cultures, it's always

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.890
the man that has multiple
wives, not the reverse.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.410
Now not surprisingly,
this issue has

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.620
been studied
"scientifically," I'll

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.520
put in quotes, extensively, in
one of the largest studies ever

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.220
done.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.210
Researchers from
University of Chicago

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.200
interviewed 2,500 people, at
random, over several years.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.800
They brought them in,
on many occasions,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.920
to try to get the answer for
the question once and for all.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.560
And they wrote
this 700 page book,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.680
called The soul of Social
Organization of Sexuality:

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.050
Sexual Practices in the US.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.670
Actually walking
around with this book

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.720
has proved to be a
little embarrassing.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.890
Last week my 11-year-old
daughter saw it,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.410
and she goes dad, why do
you have this sex book.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.700
And I grabbed it back and said,
well that's for the course.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.910
I'm teaching.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.040
And I thought I'd
gotten away with it,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.930
and everything was fine.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.150
And then later that day she
texted all of our friends

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.330
about the new news
that what do you know,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.960
her dad teaches sex ed at MIT.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.950
Anyway this study concludes
that on average men

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:00.430
have 74% more opposite-gender
partners than women.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.925
There's one other
central claims.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:11.305
And this is in the US.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:43.350
OK now, when you think about it
that sounds maybe reasonable,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.390
might be OK.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.750
But not according to ABC News.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.315
They did a poll of 1,500
people in the country, in 2004,

00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:59.090
and concluded that the average
disparity is much greater.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.950
In particular, in
this study, they

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.210
said that the average
man has 20 partners--

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.100
I'm assuming over
their lifetime--

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.050
and the average woman has six.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.636
And this gives a disparity 233%.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:30.630
So ABC News did a smaller
survey says that it's 233% here,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.540
much more than 74%.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.800
Now ABC News claimed
this is one of the most

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.060
scientific studies ever done.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.430
And there was a 2.5%
margin of error.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.540
Now we'll actually talk about
what that means mathematically

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.570
later in the term when
we do probability, and do

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.512
study polling.

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:50.970
Now of course I
should also mention

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.770
that ABC News is
the one that said

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.720
Al Gore won the presidential
election in 2000.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.930
Now the study is called
American Sex Survey,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.740
a Peak Between the Sheets.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.530
That doesn't sound
so scientific.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.990
And it was on TV, on
Primetime Live in 2004.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.300
The promo for this
is really good.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.740
It says, a groundbreaking ABC
News Primetime Live survey

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.030
finds a range of eye popping
sexual activities, fantasies,

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.460
and attitudes in this
country, confirming

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.700
some conventional wisdom,
exploding some myths,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.560
and venturing where few
scientific surveys have

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.972
gone before.

00:07:29.972 --> 00:07:31.680
By the end of today,
we're going to agree

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.390
with that last statement.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.250
OK now who do you think's right?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.980
University of Chicago.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.010
Who votes for 74% as
being pretty close?

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.190
A few of you.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.890
I've already slammed these guys.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.830
Who votes for ABC News
as being more accurate?

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.980
Yeah, nobody.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.210
Who votes for no way to tell?

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.360
I got some votes
there, all right.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.230
So how do you
tackle this problem?

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.414
In theory we could do
our own 6.042 survey.

00:08:06.414 --> 00:08:08.080
I don't know how much
we'd really learn,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.430
and for sure I'd get fired.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.030
So I don't think we're
going to do that.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.310
But fortunately, this
is the kind of question

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.940
that could be
handled, and actually

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.430
answered, by graph theory,
even though it might

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.680
be more interesting to
interview thousands of people,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.640
and find out what's going on.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.760
That's not as efficient
as using graphs.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.070
So let me start by
defining what a graph is.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:37.210
Informally graph is just
a bunch of dots and lines

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.374
connecting the dots, it's
actually very simple.

00:08:40.374 --> 00:08:41.165
So here's to graph.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.460
These are the nodes,
and they're connected

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.215
with these lines, called edges.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.530
And often the nodes,
and sometimes the edges,

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.770
are labeled.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:10.323
For example, we might call this
x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, and x7.

00:09:10.323 --> 00:09:13.090
So that's an example of a graph.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.940
Now this being a
math class, we got

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.747
to give a formal
definition of a graph.

00:09:17.747 --> 00:09:19.580
And we'll usually use
the formal definition.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:41.310
A graph G is a pair of
sets often called V and E.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.850
Where V is a set of elements
called vertices or nodes.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.330
And it has to be non-empty
here in this class.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.820
And we'll go back and forth
between vertices and nodes.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.270
Even the text we use both
words interchangeably.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:26.590
And E is a set of
2-item subsets and V,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:27.950
and they're called edges.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.060
So for example, over
here in this picture,

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:48.950
V is the set of nodes is x1, x2,
x3, up to x7, that's the nodes.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:54.430
And E, the set of
edges, is pairs,

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.700
unordered pairs of vertices.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:04.615
So for example
x1, x2 is an edge.

00:11:04.615 --> 00:11:07.660
And it's the same
as the set x2, x1,

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.210
doesn't matter the order here.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.680
Later in a week or so, we'll
talk about directed graphs

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.600
where the order matters.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:21.750
x1, x3 is also an
edge here, and so one.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.231
Think we've got, let's
see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:27.570
7 edges in this graph.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.250
And the last one
would be x5, x7.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:41.190
Edges are also sometimes written
with this notation, x1 line x2,

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.877
is another notation.

00:11:42.877 --> 00:11:44.960
And then later when you
talk about directed edges,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.710
we'll put a little arrowhead
on one end of this.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.110
Now the definition of a graph
is really pretty simple.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.290
Just think of it as dots
and lines, if you want.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.440
But there's often differences
in how people define graphs.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.550
For example, in this class we
don't allow the empty graph,

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.742
i.e. the graph with no nodes.

00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:08.950
So we're going to insist
that every graph has to have

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.270
at least one node in it.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.770
And that's just to
make the theorems

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.010
we're going prove be true.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.510
Otherwise there's
some theorems that

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.880
are false for the special
case of the empty graph.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.270
But we don't require the
graph to have any edges.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.330
In fact, it's possible you
have a graph with nodes,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:23.945
but no edges.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.560
For example, this graph.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.310
Three-node graph.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:42.730
So here G equals VE,
V equals x1, x2, x3.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.210
And E is just the empty set.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:53.060
Now for a general graph,
when you do have edges,

00:12:53.060 --> 00:13:04.005
we say that two nodes,
call them xi and xj,

00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:13.120
are adjacent if they're
connected by an edge, namely

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.160
if xi xj is an edge.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.630
All right so for example,
x5 is adjacent to x7,

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:29.040
but it's not adjacent to
x4, there's no edge there.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.810
Closely related is the
definition of the incidence.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:48.410
An edge E, which
is xixj, is said

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:55.560
to be incident to its
end points, xi and xj.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.400
OK so, for example, if I
labeled that edge as E, E

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.435
is the edge x1, x2, and this
incident to x1, and incident

00:14:11.435 --> 00:14:11.935
x2.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.600
Then we can talk about
the degree of a node.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:38.180
The number of edges
incident to a node

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.030
is called the
degree of the node.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:57.520
So for example, what's the
degree of x5 over here?

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:05.010
3, so in this case, the
degree of x5 equals 3.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:10.920
The degree of x7 is 1.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.190
These guys all have
degree 0, there's

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.980
no edges incident to them.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.790
Now in this class, we're going
to look at only simple graphs,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.000
at lease for a while.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:40.950
A graph is simple if it has
no loops, or multiple edges.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.750
Now a loop is an edge that only
connects up one node, that's

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.250
a loop and we don't allow it.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:00.070
A multiple edge is we've got two
edges that are really the same,

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.980
they connect the same endpoints.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.040
Also called a multi-edge.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.620
And those we're not going
to have in simple graphs.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.975
We don't allow this.

00:16:11.975 --> 00:16:15.200
We don't allow that.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.920
Any questions so far
about what a graph is?

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.390
So how are we going
to use a graph

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:32.470
to model the problem of
opposite-gender partners?

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.890
That's the question we're after.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.052
So any thoughts about what
the nodes of the graph

00:16:38.052 --> 00:16:39.010
are going to represent?

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.440
What is it?

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.930
AUDIENCE: Males and females?

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.370
PROFESSOR: People.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.670
Yeah, so we're going
to have people.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.290
In fact, there's two
kinds of people here.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.630
There's men, and women.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:01.520
All right we got nodes
here for the men.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.400
And in fact in America,
there's a lot of nodes here.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.750
All right, and so this
might be oh I don't know,

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:14.310
say that's Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.944
Now what's the edge
going to represent?

00:17:16.944 --> 00:17:18.420
AUDIENCE: Partners.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.020
PROFESSOR: Partners.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.109
They were
opposite-gender partners.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:26.470
And there's actually
more edges probably here.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:34.200
We could have Penelope
here, and Katie here.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.400
And well probably lots more, I
probably don't know them all.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.250
And Ben's over here with Nicole.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:48.054
And Nicole got Jude and Keith.

00:17:48.054 --> 00:17:49.470
There's actually
a website you can

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.500
go to get a lot of
these things here.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.830
And Katie went with Josh.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.779
It's called whosedatedwho.com,
and you get big graph,

00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:01.320
you could start
filling in the edges.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.690
I don't know how reliable it is.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.340
Now it's really critical
that we're only looking edges

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.270
from here to here.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.650
All right, so if there's an
edge between Tom and Ben,

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.740
I don't want to know about it.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.540
Just opposite-gender partners.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:22.090
OK now in the USA,
the number of nodes

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.590
here is about 300 million.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.220
About three million people.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.080
And the number of men nodes,
male nodes, call these VM,

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.950
and this is VW, by the way,
I'm using cardinality notation.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.750
When I put bars
around a set, that

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.050
is the denoting how
many are in the set.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:53.360
In the US there's about
147.6 men out of the 300.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.820
And the number of women--
oh we got a w here--

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.240
is about 152.4 million.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.740
So there's a little
bit more nodes

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.420
on this side of the graph,
than that side in the US.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.130
What about the edges?

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.115
Any idea of how many
edges there are here?

00:19:17.097 --> 00:19:17.680
We don't know.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.070
I sure as heck don't know
how many edges there are.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.410
So that we don't know.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.160
The cardinality of the
edge set we don't know,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.940
and we're not likely
to figure out.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.420
I don't even think
these surveys, really,

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.900
can estimate that.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.430
But what we're
trying to figure out

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:40.570
is the ratio of the
average degree of the men,

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.310
to the average
degree of the women.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.280
Because the number of
opposite-gender partners

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.640
you have is your
degree here, and you're

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.770
looking for the
average guy degree,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.370
compared to the average
female degree here.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.390
That's what we're after.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.835
All right so let's
find that quantity.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:10.020
Let's let A sub m equal
the average number

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:21.240
of opposite-gender
partners for men.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.970
And we can let A W be
the same thing for women.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.090
All right.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.440
Now we're trying to figure out
the answer to this question.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:48.360
What is A m, the
average guy degree,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.550
over the average woman degree.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.490
And in particular, the
University of Chicago

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.480
says, they say it's 1.74.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.770
That the average guy as 74%
more opposite-gender partners

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.550
than the average woman.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:10.830
ABC News says it's 3.33, that
is 233% more for the men,

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.460
than the women.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.860
Now we're going to figure
this out what this ratio is.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.540
Just use a little
bit of math here,

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.260
and a little bit
of graph theory.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.650
So let's write a
formula for A m.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:34.230
Well we're trying to figure out
the average degree over here.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.660
Well, that's pretty simple.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.370
We just add up all the
degrees, and divide

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.735
by the number of nodes.

00:21:40.735 --> 00:21:42.360
And that'll give us
the average degree.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.390
So the average degree is
the sum of the degrees,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.670
over all men, x
in the set of men,

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:56.490
of the degree of x, divided
by the number of men.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:04.620
Can somebody give me a
simpler expression for this?

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.454
It doesn't have that
nasty sum in it?

00:22:07.454 --> 00:22:09.210
AUDIENCE: E.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.440
PROFESSOR: E. The
cardinality of E.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.960
I'm adding all the degrees here.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.940
Well that's just another way
of counting all the edges,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.430
because every edge shows
up once, and only once,

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.360
in a degree count here.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.990
And this is where,
we use the fact we

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.370
have opposite-gender partners.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.130
Because if I had
some edges over here

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:40.240
they wouldn't get counted
in sum of the degrees here.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.255
All right so this is
just the cardinality

00:22:45.255 --> 00:22:48.970
of the number of edges,
divided by the number of men.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.380
Any questions about that?

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.020
Because this is an
important statement about

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.930
graphs in general.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.384
When I have a graph
like this-- which

00:22:57.384 --> 00:22:58.800
is called a bipartite
graph, we'll

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.249
talk about more in a little bit.

00:23:00.249 --> 00:23:02.290
But where the edges go
from the left to the right

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.987
if I sum the
degrees on the left,

00:23:03.987 --> 00:23:05.570
I'm just counting
the number of edges.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.840
All right, let's figure out a
formula for the average number

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.340
of partners for the women.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:23.240
That simple that's just
sum x over the women.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.950
The degree of x, divided
by the number of women.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.530
Let me rewrite that
so it's clearer.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.508
What's a simpler
expression for this?

00:23:38.508 --> 00:23:39.383
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
this sum, adding

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:52.410
the degrees of the women,
is just the number of edges,

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.690
right.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:24:00.280
So that is cardinality of edges,
divided by the number of women.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:06.700
All right, well now we can
write, solve for our formula,

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:12.320
average over men over
average of the women.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:22.126
That's E over VM,
divided by E over VW.

00:24:22.126 --> 00:24:24.900
Wow, this is nice.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:30.290
I don't know the number of edges
is, but it just canceled out.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:33.300
And this is just
the number of women,

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.890
divided by the number of men.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:40.740
And in fact we know that.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.660
That's this number,
divided by that number,

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:52.090
which is about 1.0325.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:57.550
So we just proved,
that on average, a man

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.950
has 3%, or 3 and 1/4% more
opposite-gender partners

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:02.500
than women.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.800
No need to do the interviews,
or spend years doing.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.390
That is the answer.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:14.120
And it has nothing to do
with the promiscuity of men,

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.345
or women, nothing at all.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.300
So the Chicago study is way
off, and the ABC New study

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.400
is completely nuts.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:30.050
It just can't be
right, this is a proof.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.740
Now what happened here?

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.910
Well what's going on, what's
the reason for why this is true?

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:38.410
Yeah?

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.679
AUDIENCE: A male has
a female partner then

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:44.004
the female has a male partner.

00:25:44.004 --> 00:25:44.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.456
AUDIENCE: You're not looking
at like how many males

00:25:47.456 --> 00:25:49.786
are going to one female.

00:25:49.786 --> 00:25:53.110
The promiscuity isn't even
a part of the question.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.110
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.610
It takes two to tango.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.880
Every time you got a
guy, you got a women.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.920
And you have the number
of relationships going.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.530
The average for the men is that
number, divided by the men.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.810
Average for the women
is that same number,

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:07.699
divided by the women.

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:09.240
And so if there's
more women, they're

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.080
going to have less
partners on average.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.670
Has to be.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.420
So it really was
a stupid question.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.970
It's very, very
simple to answer.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.340
Now as it turns out there are
endless studies like this,

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.090
in the literature.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.940
In fact, a few years
ago the Boston Globe

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:31.140
ran an explosive story about
the study habits of students

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.530
on Boston-area campuses.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:38.320
And their surveys show that,
on average, minority students

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.380
tended to study with
non-minority students

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.685
more than the other way around.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.250
And they want on great
length consulting the experts

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.980
as to why this might be true.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.230
Why is it the minority
students study

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.870
with non-minority students
more than the other way around.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.940
Now can anyone tell
me why it is certainly

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.205
true, and not surprising,
why that's the case?

00:27:02.205 --> 00:27:04.120
AUDIENCE: Because
they're the minority.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.703
PROFESSOR: Because
they're a minority.

00:27:05.703 --> 00:27:07.745
There's fewer minorities
than non-minorities.

00:27:07.745 --> 00:27:12.030
End of story, we don't
need this sociology PhD

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.780
from down the street
to explain it to us.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.060
We're going to see a lot of
other bogus studies later.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.270
This is not unusual, especially
when we get the probability.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.410
Just every day there's a
new one in probability.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.310
Any questions about
this before we leave?

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.160
Unfortunately that's most all
we'll say about sex today.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.800
OK.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:42.110
But now, in this example,
we used an edge in the graph

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:46.530
to denote some kind of
affinity between two nodes.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.594
The two nodes liked
each other in some sense

00:27:48.594 --> 00:27:50.010
if they were
connected by an edge,

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.520
or they had a
relationship of some kind.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.490
There's lots of examples
in computer science

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.453
where you use an edge to
denote just the opposite.

00:27:57.453 --> 00:28:00.200
That the two nodes can't
be near each other,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.750
or don't like each other.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.420
For example,
consider the problem

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.080
of scheduling
final exams at MIT.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.310
And they do this after they
find out all of your schedules,

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.354
and they try to schedule
the exams so that you don't

00:28:14.354 --> 00:28:16.270
have to take two at once,
or there's as little

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:19.270
of that as possible.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.730
For example, let's
do an example here.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.760
Say we look at
these five classes.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.220
Take 6041.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.920
And this may not be totally
accurate, but roughly.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.950
So I've got five
MIT classes, and I'm

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.920
going to put an edge between
pairs of classes that have

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.400
overlapping student enrollment.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.490
So in this case,
for example, we've

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.160
assumed in the
drawing of his graph,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.280
that you can't have our
exam the same time is 6002,

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.640
on the assumption there's
students in both classes.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.560
But you could have our
exam the same time as 6034.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.730
Because there's not
an overlapping student

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.350
in both classes,
so the exams could

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.510
be scheduled at the same time.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.720
So we've used a
graph to represent

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.740
which courses can't have
their exam at the same time.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.100
Now let's also suppose we have
a set of slots for the exam.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.670
And say they're
all on a Wednesday.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:51.480
And the first slot is
Wednesday from 5:00 to 7:00.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.430
And the next one
is 7:00 to 9:00.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:30:00.070
And then, the next
one is 9:00 to 11:00.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:05.290
And then 11:00 to 1:00 in the
morning, and then 1:00 to 3:00,

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.930
getting pretty late.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:13.230
And your job is to figure
out how not to have

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.290
to use these later exam slots.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.140
You'd like to use
as few as possible

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.180
so you're not going
too late night,

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.930
or come before the
holidays, so you're not

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.380
having exams on Christmas
and New Year's, for example.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:33.840
So the goal is to assign
slots to the nodes.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.090
Put every node in
a slot so you don't

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:42.110
have nodes hooked by an
edge getting the same slot.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.400
Now this is an example
of what's called

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.496
a graph coloring problem.

00:30:46.496 --> 00:30:47.370
So let's define that.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:44.020
Given a graph G, and K colors,
assign a color to each node,

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:55.970
so that adjacent nodes
get different colors.

00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:08.120
All right, and then the minimum
number of colors you need

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.750
is called the chromatic
number of the graph.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:36.460
So the minimum value of K, for
which such a coloring exist,

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:48.840
is the chromatic
number OF the graph.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:59.956
And it's denoted by
this symbol chi of G.

00:32:59.956 --> 00:33:02.330
Because usually you want to
use a small number of colors.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:07.270
Now what does a color
represent when we're

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.220
dealing with this problem?

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.760
What's the meaning of a color?

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.900
AUDIENCE: Time slot.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.080
PROFESSOR: A time slot, OK.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:22.690
So let's call this time slot
C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, so there's

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.850
five possible colors.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.800
Now of course, we could color
this graph with five colors,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.150
every node could just
get its own color.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:33.060
But then somebody's taking
their exam from 1:00 to 3:00 AM,

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.880
and that's a bit of a pain.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:41.360
Let's see if we can
do less than five.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.010
Let's say I give this color
one, let's give this one color

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:50.630
one, that's OK, because
they're not connected.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:55.880
I can't give this one color one,
so I give it color two, say.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.570
Now this one I can't give color
one, because this guy got it,

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.570
he can't get color two,
because that guy got it.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.020
So it give it color three.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:08.159
And well, I can't do
one, two, or three here,

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:11.020
so I gotta go to color four.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:17.800
All right so 6042 will get
the 11:00 PM to 1:00 AM slot,

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.443
not so good.

00:34:19.443 --> 00:34:21.916
Can we do any better?

00:34:21.916 --> 00:34:26.139
Can we get away
with three colors.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:29.870
Some say yes, some say no.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.690
How many people think you can
do three colors on this graph?

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.830
A bunch.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:37.402
How many think you
can't do any better?

00:34:37.402 --> 00:34:40.270
All right, the vote
is mostly for three.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.060
Let's see.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:42.639
Any ideas?

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:43.980
Anybody see how to do three?

00:34:46.775 --> 00:34:47.275
Yeah?

00:34:47.275 --> 00:34:50.199
AUDIENCE: Assign C4 to 6034 .

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.550
PROFESSOR: Assign C4 to 6043.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.889
AUDIENCE: Or C1 to 6042.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:59.580
PROFESSOR: C-- I can't
do see C1 to 6042.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.561
It crashes, but can I do-- yeah?

00:35:01.561 --> 00:35:02.060
Put

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.434
AUDIENCE: C1 in 6003.

00:35:04.434 --> 00:35:05.350
PROFESSOR: C1 in 6003.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.222
AUDIENCE: And get
rid of C1 in 6034.

00:35:10.222 --> 00:35:11.180
PROFESSOR: Get rid of--

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.580
AUDIENCE: Make it C2.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.070
PROFESSOR: Make this a C2.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.362
Oh, yeah.

00:35:17.362 --> 00:35:21.520
All right, these got C1,
they're not adjacent.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.740
These got C2,
they're not adjacent.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.380
This can now get C3.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.990
So we can have our exam from
9:00 to 11:00, which is better.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.375
All right, can anybody
do it in two colors?

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.935
Can anybody offer a reason why
two colors may not be possible?

00:35:47.536 --> 00:35:48.035
Yeah?

00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:51.575
AUDIENCE: Because let's say you
could do it with two colors.

00:35:51.575 --> 00:35:52.200
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:58.170
AUDIENCE: 6041 and 6002
have to be different colors.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.830
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.500
AUDIENCE: 6042 can't be
C1, and it can't be C2.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, good.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.130
So you can't in two colors,
because these three guys

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:10.670
would violate that.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:11.990
You've got a triangle here.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.550
Each one of these guys has to
be different than the other two.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.920
So two colors can't work.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.740
You've got to have at
least three in this case.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.760
So three is optimal.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.000
We have just shown
for this graph,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.836
the chromatic number is three.

00:36:26.836 --> 00:36:33.300
All right, now in general doing
what we just did is very hard.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.680
No one knows a fast
algorithm for determining

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.560
the chromatic number.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.370
In fact, it's a weird
kind of problem,

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:44.239
because it's easy enough to
check that a coloring is OK.

00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:46.530
If somebody put a coloring
on the board, you can check,

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:48.420
oh that works really simply.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.070
Just check every edge, and make
sure the colors are different.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.590
But figuring it out,
as best we know,

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:57.840
you've got to try an exponential
number of possibilities.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.962
So if I had 100 nodes
here, my running time

00:37:00.962 --> 00:37:02.920
of the algorithm to check
all the possibilities

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.800
would be exponential
and a hundred.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.300
Yeah?

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.772
AUDIENCE: Can that number
just like the highest

00:37:08.772 --> 00:37:11.750
degree of each node, or nodes.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.015
PROFESSOR: Uh no.

00:37:13.015 --> 00:37:15.770
But it's no worse than
something like that,

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:17.130
as we'll see a few minutes.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:18.750
That's a great observation.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.210
And we're going to come back
to that in a few minutes.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.180
But it's not just that.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:30.140
OK now in fact even figuring
out for an arbitrary graph

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.320
if three colors
can be done, called

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.290
the three-coloring problem,
that's really hard.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.570
No one knows how to solve that
in less than exponential time.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:43.000
In fact, one of these
NP-complete problems

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.340
is what it's called.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.870
How many people here don't
know about NP-completeness?

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:49.822
Is everybody-- all
right so all of you

00:37:49.822 --> 00:37:51.030
haven't seen NP-completeness.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:56.120
OK so there is a class of
thousands of problems--

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.230
in fact there's books list these
1,000 problems-- that are all

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:03.000
NP-complete, somebody's proved
they belong in the class.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.440
And what that means is
that if somebody gave you

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.300
a solution, like
a coloring here,

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.850
it's easy to check really
quickly if it's valid.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:16.040
But figuring it
out is really hard.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.790
And if you figured
out how to solve

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:19.761
one of those
thousands of problems,

00:38:19.761 --> 00:38:22.260
like suddenly you figured out
how to tell if any graph could

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:25.610
work with three colors, you
would solve automatically

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:28.429
all other thousands in the book.

00:38:28.429 --> 00:38:30.470
So it's this book of
problems you will constantly

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:33.952
run into in your career
in computer science.

00:38:33.952 --> 00:38:35.410
And it's bad when
you run into one,

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.200
because there's no good
algorithm to solve it known.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.065
But if you just
solved one of them,

00:38:40.065 --> 00:38:43.620
the other thousands would
suddenly be solvable quickly.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.540
Even better, you win a
million dollar prize.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.000
One of these
Millennium Prizes we

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.860
talked about the first lecture.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.880
Even if you show you can't
find a fast algorithm for one

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.000
of them, that means that known
of them have fast algorithms,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.397
and you also get
a million dollars.

00:38:59.397 --> 00:39:01.980
So this is the central problem
in computer science, and theory

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.410
computing, is whether
or not you could solve

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:07.060
these NP-complete problems.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.770
Now actually lots of
people have claim to do it.

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.300
And in fact, there was a
lot of buzz in the community

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.110
about a month ago when
actually a reputable researcher

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.370
at HP Labs said he'd done it.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:21.630
He proved that you can't
solve NP-complete problems.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.100
And he got people going for
probably at least a week,

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.420
until they discovered
a fatal flaw.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.550
And the proof was
actually bogus.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.770
So no one still knows
if you can solve

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:34.770
these NP-complete
problems quickly.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:38.620
Now the problem is, in practice,
you run into these things

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.430
all the time, like
MIT really does

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.430
have to schedule the exams.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:43.680
So you've got to do something.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.690
You can't just go say, hey
it's NP-complete, so no exams

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.870
this year, or whatever.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:52.970
That's not going to fly,
so you got to do something.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.320
So now this is a
problem-- many of you

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.510
when you go into careers, you're
going to be faced with this.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.250
You got to do something.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:06.010
Any thoughts about an algorithm
for coloring graphs that might

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.880
use a small number of colors?

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.335
It doesn't have to
always work, or you're

00:40:10.335 --> 00:40:11.960
going to win a lot
of money if it does.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.300
But a simple
algorithm, you can't

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.590
take either the 100 steps.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.690
You got to be linear,
probably, or quadratic time.

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.800
That could get you a
small number of colors.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.860
Any thoughts about
what you'd do?

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.360
Yeah?

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.770
AUDIENCE: The number
of degrees and nodes?

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:30.590
PROFESSOR: The
number-- what about it?

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.220
AUDIENCE: The highest
degree and that node,

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.799
the 6042 is [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:35.465
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:40:35.465 --> 00:40:38.700
AUDIENCE: So you could use that.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.210
PROFESSOR: Good, all right.

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:42.200
So what do I do with
that-- so I found

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:45.130
a node with a high
degree, there's

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.030
three of them have
degree three here.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.806
What do I do with them?

00:40:48.806 --> 00:40:52.324
AUDIENCE: Pick a
different color to.

00:40:52.324 --> 00:40:53.740
PROFESSOR: Pick a
different color,

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.890
that means I've colored
some of the others.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:59.040
If I pick a different
color, do I start with them,

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:03.030
or do I finish with
a high degree nodes?

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.807
Because you've got to
assign the colors to them.

00:41:05.807 --> 00:41:07.890
And high degree is important
to be thinking about.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.431
We're going to prove a theorem
in just a minute about related

00:41:10.431 --> 00:41:11.730
to degree and coloring.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.800
AUDIENCE: Start with them.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.310
PROFESSOR: Start with
them, and do what with it?

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:18.498
Color?

00:41:18.498 --> 00:41:22.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and then assign
the ones that aren't connected

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:26.310
[INAUDIBLE] to the same slots.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.250
PROFESSOR: OK, so I could--
here's a degree of theory

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.630
now I can start with
color one for that.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.190
And then what do I do next?

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.372
I pick-- its neighbors have to
get different colors, I guess.

00:41:38.372 --> 00:41:39.830
You'd start coloring
the neighbors.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.305
AUDIENCE: My first
instinct would be

00:41:42.305 --> 00:41:44.780
to color all the [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:49.530
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:51.320
And what color
would use for them?

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.702
AUDIENCE: Different ones.

00:41:52.702 --> 00:41:54.660
PROFESSOR: Different ones
if they're connected,

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.790
or if they're not connected
you'd still use different ones?

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.670
AUDIENCE: Only if
they're connected.

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.940
PROFESSOR: Only they're
connected use different ones.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.901
And so if they're not connected,
you'd use the same colors?

00:42:06.901 --> 00:42:07.401
Yeah?

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:14.620
You're going close, and it
actually works pretty well.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.910
The underlying principle you're
sort of thinking about here

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.160
is you've got some notion
of the order in which you're

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.985
going to process your graph.

00:42:22.985 --> 00:42:25.110
And you're going to start
with a high degree nodes,

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.530
in your case.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.200
And as you go
along, you're going

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.950
to start coloring the nodes.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:33.990
And you're going to make
sure you color them legally.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:37.920
And it sounds like you're going
to color them with a low color

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.270
as you go along.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:44.860
And that is probably the most
basic graph coloring approach.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.560
And almost you could almost
say is a generic approach.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.091
So let's define that, and then
see prove some facts about it.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.860
Most of the graph coloring
algorithms in practice

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.070
are based on this approach.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:05.320
And we're going to call it the
basic graph coloring algorithm.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:20.840
And for our graph G, with
vertices V, and edges E.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:31.080
So the first step is going to be
to order the nodes from 1 to n.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:35.850
Now in your case,
you were suggesting

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.700
an ordering where I have
the high degree nodes first.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.217
All right.

00:43:41.217 --> 00:43:43.050
But for now we're not
going to specify that.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:47.290
We're going to make it
any ordering you want.

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.080
And then we're going to
have a notion of an order

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.490
on the colors, as well.

00:43:57.815 --> 00:43:59.190
And I don't know
how many colors,

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:02.480
but they're going to be
numbered 1, 2, and so forth.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.773
And then we're going to process
the nodes one at a time,

00:44:08.773 --> 00:44:13.860
to N. We color the
nodes, what is step I,

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:18.430
we color the Ith node V sub i
with the lowest legal color.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.490
And by the legal I mean you
don't color at the same node

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:31.640
as another node that's already
been colored the same that it's

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.602
adjacent to.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:43.290
All right so let's try this.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:47.480
In fact, this is sort of the
algorithm I used initially

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.700
to color exam graph over there.

00:44:54.508 --> 00:44:58.230
All right, so
let's look at that.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:04.310
So let's say we-- let me
erase the colors here, and put

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:05.465
an ordering on the nodes.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:12.230
So let's say I ordered
them with 6034 first,

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:15.060
so this would be V1.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.390
Then 6041 is V2.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:23.380
Then V3, V4, V5.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:30.552
If that's my ordering, what
color would I assign to 6034?

00:45:30.552 --> 00:45:31.730
AUDIENCE: One.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.140
PROFESSOR: One, C1, I'd
color it first to get C1.

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.860
What color does 6041 get?

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.420
C1, as well, it's the
lowest possible color

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:47.110
that's legal, and is not hooked
to this guy, so C1 is legal.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:49.810
What color do I give here?

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.480
C2.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:59.170
Then I color this one next
C-- can't do C2, can't do C1,

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:01.460
so I pick C3.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.500
And then I get to
6042 last, and I

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:07.220
can't do one, two, or
three, so I do four.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.150
All right so algorithm,
with that ordering,

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:10.860
gave four colors.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.970
However we know there's a way
to do a different ordering that

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:19.220
gives us three colors.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.840
In particular,
let's see if we do

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.150
this what happens if we
use this other ordering.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:26.050
Let me erase these.

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:33.960
Say that's V1, V2, V3, V4, V5.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:40.140
Now I get C1, this
will be C2, C1.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.670
What's this one get?

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:46.320
C2.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.350
Ah, much better.

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:50.800
C3.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.880
So different orderings result
in different numbers of colors

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.380
here.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.850
So the whole art now becomes
finding a clever ordering.

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:03.210
And so many people have
already had good ideas,

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:05.850
pick the largest
degree nodes first.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:11.740
And in fact, if you simulate
the algorithm on lots of graphs,

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:16.140
you do better on average when
you color the larger degree

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.820
nodes first.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.850
And then if you start to
use more exotic orderings,

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.762
you can do even better.

00:47:22.762 --> 00:47:24.720
If you take a lot of
graphs that are out there,

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.719
and run your algorithm,
and see how well you do,

00:47:26.719 --> 00:47:29.540
you do better with more
sophisticated orderings.

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:34.550
In fact, this was my
senior thesis back

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.290
when I was
undergraduate student.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:39.650
I was trying to figure out
better and better orderings

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.690
that worked for graphs.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.820
And at the time it caused
a bit of a problem.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.470
I was a undergraduate
at Princeton.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.120
And Princeton, to
this day I think,

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.090
still has exams after the
holidays, the Christmas

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.010
holidays, New Year's holidays.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:57.810
And the students wanted to have
the exams before Christmas,

00:47:57.810 --> 00:47:59.770
because they hated going
home for the holiday,

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.790
and then you've got to
worry about your exams

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:03.270
when you come back.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.050
And the faculty said
no, there's no way

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:09.570
to get them all compressed
into a small number of days.

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.010
Now I wasn't aware of
all that of the time.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:14.255
But my thesis was go
figure out good ordering.

00:48:14.255 --> 00:48:15.880
So I tried lots of
different orderings.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.850
And I tried the
largest degree first,

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:21.730
and recursive versions of that
actually worked very well.

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:25.620
And then tried it on the
Princeton exam graph.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.310
And lo and behold, you could
actually squish it down,

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.200
so you could give all
the exams, I think was,

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.960
4 and 1/2 days, plenty of time
to give them before Christmas.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.330
Which caused a fair of
scandal at the time,

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.670
because then the faculty
had to come clean

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.730
that they just didn't
want to bother having

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:44.180
the exams before Christmas.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.770
Now this algorithm is
an example of what's

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.780
known as a greedy algorithm.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.930
Now in a greedy algorithm
it's always simple.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.360
You just go one
step after the next,

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.760
taking the best you
can do at each stop.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.670
You never go back and try
to make things better.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.950
You never do hill climbing, if
you're familiar with that term.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:07.010
You just always keep it simple,
one thing after the next,

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:08.830
very fast.

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:10.770
Sometimes it works
great in practice.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:12.570
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:16.860
But it's always where you start,
some simple approach like this.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.770
Now this algorithm
actually, even

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.850
if you don't try to
monkey with the ordering,

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:25.140
even for a worst case
ordering of the nodes,

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.930
that actually does pretty
good for a lot of graphs.

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:30.730
And in fact, it
does really well--

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.040
as somebody already
asked about--

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.510
if all the nodes
have low degree.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:37.060
So let's state
that as a theorem.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.518
And then we're
going to prove that.

00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:54.330
So if every node in a graph
G has degree, at most,

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:58.550
d-- so that's the biggest
degree in the graph, D-- then

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:16.480
this basic algorithm uses, at
most, d plus 1 colors for G.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.920
No matter what the
ordering is, you'll

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.490
never do worse than
d plus 1 colors.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:28.840
So what's the value of d for
our exam graph over here?

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.180
d is 3.

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:33.240
Every node has degree,
at most, three.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:37.120
And so it says, that no matter
what ordering you picked here,

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.350
you'd get at most four colors.

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:40.350
Now you might do better.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.620
In fact, we found an
ordering that got three.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.940
So it's possible to do better.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:49.040
So let's prove this fact
because this makes a difference.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.260
Say you have a graph
with hundreds of nodes.

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.716
But every node has
degree, at most, three.

00:50:55.716 --> 00:50:58.560
Well that says you only
need four colors even,

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.840
if the graph has 1,000 nodes,
and that's very useful.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.580
So in that kind of
situation it does very well.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:05.525
So let's prove that.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:12.733
Any ideas as to what proof
technique we're going to use?

00:51:12.733 --> 00:51:14.705
AUDIENCE: Invariant.

00:51:14.705 --> 00:51:17.120
PROFESSOR: Invariant, close.

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.560
Not quite an
invariant, but close.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:23.404
PROFESSOR: What?

00:51:23.404 --> 00:51:24.820
AUDIENCE: Well
ordering principle.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.420
PROFESSOR: You know well
ordering principle, yeah,

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.503
we're going to use the
equivalent version of that.

00:51:28.503 --> 00:51:31.024
We're going to use induction.

00:51:31.024 --> 00:51:33.190
If you like well-- it's
equivalent to well ordering.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.314
If you like well ordering
you could do it that way.

00:51:35.314 --> 00:51:38.400
I think it's easier
using induction here.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.765
So the proof is by induction.

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:46.720
All right so the
first thing we need

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.845
is an induction hypothesis.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:54.450
Any thoughts about what the
induction hypothesis should be?

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:55.202
Yeah?

00:51:55.202 --> 00:52:01.270
AUDIENCE: If you have a
graph with n nodes then

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:06.150
where the degree of any nodes
is less than [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:08.090
then you can do it.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:09.090
PROFESSOR: That's great.

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:12.030
You're going to do really
well on the midterm,

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.450
because you put an
n into this thing,

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:16.570
but there's not an
n here to start.

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:18.320
What are most
people going to do--

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.210
we used to ask this actually.

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.830
We asked this once on
a test many years ago,

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:25.820
and it was an utter disaster,
because did everybody do?

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:28.832
May be one student, or
two, put an n into there.

00:52:28.832 --> 00:52:31.290
But what's the naturally thing
to do to induct on here when

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.560
you look at this statement?

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.760
You're going to induct on d,
because the first thing you do

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.680
is you make this be your
induction hypothesis.

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.950
There's only one thing
to use, so you're

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.910
going to have your
predicate be p of d,

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:47.014
and it's going to be that.

00:52:47.014 --> 00:52:49.680
Now It didn't occur to us that's
what everybody was going to do,

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.560
but it should have.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.220
They all did that and
it was a disaster.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:56.010
Because if you do
this, well you've

00:52:56.010 --> 00:53:00.280
got to take a graph with
maximum degree d, or d plus 1

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:03.200
in the inductive step,
pull out all the nodes

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:07.021
with degree d plus 1 to get
a graph with now degree d.

00:53:07.021 --> 00:53:07.770
And that's a mess.

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:10.410
You just pulled out a lot
of nodes, potentially.

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:14.650
Color that in d plus 1 colors,
now put all that junk back in.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:17.180
And say only used
one more color.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.520
Nightmare.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.300
And these were MIT
students under pressure.

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.330
It was a nightmare.

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:24.410
So that does not work.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.410
And in fact, we will ask
an induction question

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:29.960
on graphs on every test
you take in this course.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.190
It will happen.

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:34.850
And so usually,
with induction, you

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:36.580
take this as your
induction hypothesis.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.650
With graphs, you
have to be careful.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:41.830
And worst part about
this is we tell people

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:45.950
when this doesn't work, use a
stronger induction hypothesis.

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:48.280
So students tried
to make a stronger,

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.900
but they're still stuck on d,
and it was still a disaster.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.930
With graphs, you do
something different.

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.240
And the first thing you
do with a graph, usually,

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.385
is put n in here.

00:53:58.385 --> 00:54:00.510
And if it doesn't work with
n, the number of nodes,

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:03.410
you put in e the
number of edges.

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.120
And induct on that.

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.460
And so what you said is
exactly the right thing to do.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.270
Don't do this, or least don't
spend too much time on it.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:13.360
Pretty quickly try this.

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:17.970
If every end node graph--
if every node in an n

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:23.840
node graph G has
degree at most degree,

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:27.070
then the basic algorithm uses
at most d, plus one colors.

00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:30.350
And now you induct on n.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:33.100
And almost always on graphs,
that's the first thing to try.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:37.270
Even if it's not in
your theorem statement.

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.900
Any questions about that?

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.570
Well let's start
with this, and see

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:51.256
if we can make this one work.

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:04.140
So what's the next
step in our proof?

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:06.560
What do we got to do?

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.380
Base case.

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:14.750
And the base case will
be, not n equals 0,

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:19.300
because we can't have a zero
node graph, but n equals 1.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.940
And how many edges do we have?

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:23.440
Zero.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.190
If there's one node,
we don't allow loops,

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:33.140
so it's zero edges, which means
that the degree of our graph

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:36.380
has to be zero.

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.780
There's no edges.

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:39.900
And of course there's
only one node,

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:44.140
so one color is going
to work, and that

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.340
happens to equal d plus 1.

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:52.110
All right, so the
base case is true.

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:55.110
For one node graphs,
you can always

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:59.010
use d plus 1 colors,
where d is the max degree.

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:01.210
All right, next we have
the inductive step.

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:14.425
So here we assume P n is
true for the induction.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:23.130
And now we look at an
n plus 1 node graph

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:26.620
to show P n plus 1 is true.

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:35.240
So we let G be any
N plus 1 node graph.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.152
We got to show you can
color it in d plus 1 colors.

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:48.790
And let's let d be the
max degree, the largest

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:56.020
degree in G.

00:56:56.020 --> 00:57:01.180
We've got to show we can
color it in d plus 1 colors.

00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.120
Well the basic
algorithm, let's say.

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.680
First thing we do is
we order the nodes

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.954
in an arbitrary order.

00:57:10.363 --> 00:57:13.700
And we're going to show
whatever order you pick is OK.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:28.185
All right so what are the nodes?

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:41.200
Anyway at all.

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:45.690
Now how am I going to use
the induction hypothesis?

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:49.900
I know, I can assume,
the for any N node graph

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:54.550
I can color it in the
max degree plus 1 colors.

00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:56.940
How am I going to use that
to help me color G here,

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.260
the n plus 1 node graph?

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.690
Any thoughts?

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:01.190
Yeah?

00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:03.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's
create an n node graph

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.410
by looking at these
nodes, and taking

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:12.310
this one out of the time being.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:15.910
Remove the last V n plus
1 node in the order.

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:19.400
That leaves an n node graph.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.310
So let's write that down.

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:33.120
We remove the n plus 1 from G.
And that creates a new graph,

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:38.530
call it G prime with vertices,
V prime and edges, E prime.

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:40.925
So we create a new graph
by removing that node.

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.240
And we remove all the
edges tied to that node.

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.360
So for example over
here, the last node

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:56.150
was 6042, so we take out
6042, and all these edges.

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:59.116
And this is a graph
that we're left with.

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:06.190
That graph has n nodes.

00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:08.637
What's the maximum
degree in G prime?

00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:18.054
When I pull out a node, can
the degree of any node go up?

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:21.320
No, I'm just taking stuff out.

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:27.930
So I know that G prime has
maximum degree, at most, d.

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:30.370
The degree didn't
go up of any node.

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:38.430
Might have gone down,
but it didn't go up.

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:44.045
So G prime has max degree, at
most, d, and it has n nodes.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.440
So we can use the
induction hypothesis P n.

00:59:53.360 --> 01:00:01.320
It says that the basic
algorithm uses d plus 1,

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:09.758
at most, d plus 1 colors
for nodes V1 to V n.

01:00:13.104 --> 01:00:14.260
Any questions about that?

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:22.140
So if this were the n plus first
node, last node in the ordering

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.090
take it out.

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:26.490
The basic algorithm now,
take the same order here,

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:33.850
V1, V2, V3, V4, basic, we'll
color that in d plus 1 colors.

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:36.950
And all I have left is
to give this guy color,

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:41.360
and I'll have color G. Question?

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.640
No.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.600
All right.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.820
So by induction I've colored
these guys, V1 to V2,

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.760
and d plus 1 colors, all
that I have left to do

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.000
is color V n plus 1.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.585
And hopefully we're not
going to use color d plus 2,

01:00:59.585 --> 01:01:02.450
because then we sort
of-- it wouldn't work.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.953
We got to use one of
the first d plus 1.

01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:14.370
All right, so let's
look at V n plus 1.

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:25.780
And let's call its
neighbors in G, U1, U2, Ud.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:31.630
It has, at most d neighbors,
because every node in G has,

01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:34.320
at most, degree d.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.980
A neighbor's a node
you're adjacent to.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:45.950
All right so, V n plus 1 has at
most d neighbors, is adjacent

01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:48.061
to, at most, d other nodes.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:54.470
Now what does that
mean about the color I

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:56.990
can use on V n plus 1?

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:04.605
What do I know about what
color I can use for that?

01:02:04.605 --> 01:02:05.105
Yeah?

01:02:05.105 --> 01:02:10.070
AUDIENCE: It can't be any of
the colors of U1, U2, and so on.

01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:12.850
PROFESSOR: It can't be any
one of these colors that

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:14.860
were assigned here.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.110
That's true.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:19.440
So how many colors
got ruled out?

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.300
At most d, and how
many am I working with?

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:25.560
d Plus 1.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.580
So I got one left
that I can use safely.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.920
OK.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:35.660
So this means there
exists at least one color

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.890
in my set of d plus 1 colors.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:47.575
It's not used by any neighbor.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:56.390
And we're going to give
V n plus 1 that color.

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.650
All right.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:12.350
So now I've colored every node
in G, the n plus 1 node graph,

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:15.315
safely using a total
of d plus 1 colors.

01:03:18.692 --> 01:03:25.050
So that means the
basic algorithm uses,

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:33.340
at most, d plus 1 colors,
on G. That means P n plus 1

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:37.815
is true-- whoops-- and
the induction is complete.

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:44.853
Any questions?

01:03:44.853 --> 01:03:45.353
Yeah.

01:03:45.353 --> 01:03:49.281
AUDIENCE: Could you also
start from the other way,

01:03:49.281 --> 01:03:55.664
and start 1, go to 2 nodes,
3 nodes at each step keeping

01:03:55.664 --> 01:03:59.101
all nodes at all other nodes.

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:02.080
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.308
PROFESSOR: What do you mean by
keeping all nodes connected?

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:16.264
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] each
node has an edge connecting

01:04:16.264 --> 01:04:17.804
to each other one.

01:04:17.804 --> 01:04:19.720
PROFESSOR: OK so, then
I get a specific graph.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.240
I start with this, I add a
node and make it adjacent.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.680
I add a node and
make it adjacent.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.554
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:33.904
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:04:33.904 --> 01:04:36.620
So you've constructed
a particular graph.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:40.260
This is actually called, for
the n nodes, it's called Kn,

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:45.010
is the n node complete
graph, also called a clique,

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:49.100
like a clique of friends, where
everybody likes everybody,

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:52.350
in a clique.

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:55.660
And in fact for n here,
for those n nodes,

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.940
what's the max degree?

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.440
Max degree is n minus 1.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.420
What's the chromatic
number of this graph?

01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:07.485
What's the minimum
number of colors?

01:05:07.485 --> 01:05:09.156
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:11.030
PROFESSOR: And they all
have to be different,

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:12.890
which is d plus 1.

01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:16.420
So you have built
a special graph

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.560
for which the optimum of
number colors is d plus 1.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.630
But that is not a proof that
this is true for all graphs.

01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:26.384
Because you've looked at
a particular graph here.

01:05:26.384 --> 01:05:27.259
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:30.222 --> 01:05:31.180
PROFESSOR: What's that?

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] It means
that you can still use your

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.138
less than or equal to sign.

01:05:36.138 --> 01:05:38.490
PROFESSOR: I see,
so you'd add a node,

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:41.182
and it's only connected
to a few of them.

01:05:41.182 --> 01:05:43.015
AUDIENCE: No, it's
connected to all of them,

01:05:43.015 --> 01:05:45.930
but it still implies
that you need less than

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:47.050
or equal to the colors.

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:49.083
It turns out it
happens to be equal to.

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:50.832
PROFESSOR: Yes, in
this case that's right.

01:05:50.832 --> 01:05:52.510
So you've made an
argument for this case

01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:54.060
where it actually
is equal, but that

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.200
only worked for this graph.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
worse case.

01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:02.666
PROFESSOR: It is the worst
case, so it meets the bound.

01:06:02.666 --> 01:06:04.290
It shows you cannot
improve this bound.

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:06.052
Yeah, is there a
question up there?

01:06:06.052 --> 01:06:09.290
AUDIENCE: All I was going
to say is that you've

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:10.620
proved it's the worst case.

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.369
PROFESSOR: Right, so
what you've done here

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:15.587
is you've shown that I could not
make that theorem any stronger.

01:06:15.587 --> 01:06:18.531
I could not replace
it with d here.

01:06:18.531 --> 01:06:19.030
All right.

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:20.571
Because you've given
an example where

01:06:20.571 --> 01:06:23.440
I can't get d colors, where
the maximum degree is d.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.880
But that doesn't-- To get
a proof for a theorem,

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.110
I got to go through all this.

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:30.480
That wouldn't give me
a proof of the theorem.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.130
They're not equivalent.

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:35.660
One's an upper bound, one's
an existence of a lower bound.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:40.940
This shows that for any graph,
you need at most d plus 1.

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:43.990
So any graph, at most.

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:50.430
That shows there is a graph
that you need at least.

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:52.640
And they are not equivalent.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.230
All right.

01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:56.610
One is for all, and upper bound.

01:06:56.610 --> 01:07:00.830
The other is there
exists a lower bound.

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:05.590
So different in two
ways that are important.

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:08.980
This kind of proof is very
typical for what you'll

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.390
see with induction in graphs.

01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:13.340
And you'll get a lot
of practice with it.

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.380
Are there any other
questions on this proof?

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.870
OK.

01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:24.800
All right, see we've seen
now, by that example,

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.330
we can't improve the theorem.

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:30.200
In some cases,
though, the theorem

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.020
is way off, for some graphs.

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.530
Can anybody think
of a graph where

01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:37.850
the bound we get from the
theorem, of d plus 1 colors,

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:40.680
is way off from the actual
chromatic number you need,

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.962
the number of colors you need?

01:07:41.962 --> 01:07:42.462
Yeah?

01:07:42.462 --> 01:07:44.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:44.916
PROFESSOR: What is it?

01:07:44.916 --> 01:07:51.282
AUDIENCE: A graph [INAUDIBLE]
two sets of [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:56.470
PROFESSOR: Good, OK.

01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:58.220
Yes, so what if
we did this graph.

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:00.042
Let me draw it out.

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:09.600
So you've got a bunch of nodes
here, bunch of nodes here.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.300
And every node here is
connected to every node

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.600
over the other side.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.050
And if this is an n no
graph, and I've got n over 2

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:21.100
on each side, what's
my degree here?

01:08:25.922 --> 01:08:27.380
What's my max degree
of this graph?

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.560
AUDIENCE: N over 2.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.319
PROFESSOR: N over 2.

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:32.680
So d is n over 2.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.060
What's the chromatic number?

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.520
How many colors do
I need for this?

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.250
Two.

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:41.380
All right, so d plus
1 is way off of two.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.466
There is a even worse example.

01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:43.966
Yeah?

01:08:43.966 --> 01:08:48.130
AUDIENCE: That graph where you
have one node center that's

01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:51.126
connected to a bunch of nodes
regularly distributed about.

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:52.564
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the star graph.

01:08:52.564 --> 01:08:56.300
All right, so I got one of
the center, I got n minus 1

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.330
outside.

01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:03.050
So here the maximum
degree is n minus 1,

01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:05.460
just like a complete graph.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.649
But how many colors do I need?

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:10.069
Two.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:11.500
So it's even worse here.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:18.920
All right now what about
the basic algorithm?

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.599
How well does the basic
algorithm do on this graph?

01:09:24.649 --> 01:09:27.790
Or to the vertices some way?

01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:29.630
Color on one [INAUDIBLE]
lowest color.

01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:31.620
How many colors is
it going to use?

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.840
AUDIENCE: Two.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.240
PROFESSOR: Two.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.109
It doesn't matter the vertices.

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:46.619
V1, V2, V3, V4, because
I'll color this one 1.

01:09:46.619 --> 01:09:49.668
What am I going
to call that one?

01:09:49.668 --> 01:09:51.950
1.

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:54.770
Then I get to the center,
what am I going to color it?

01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:56.360
2.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.130
And now all the arms,
what do they get colored?

01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:01.240
They all get 1.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.275
Whatever order you pick,
you get two colors.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.892
All right so now
there's a difference

01:10:08.892 --> 01:10:11.350
between the theorem just gives
you an upper bound, it says,

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.150
at most, d plus 1 colors.

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:15.700
But in fact the algorithm
can do a lot better

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:19.050
than that, as on this example.

01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:22.420
So the algorithm
might be a lot better.

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.770
Everybody see that
what we're doing here?

01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:26.520
How the algorithm is
better than the bound

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.644
we proved by the theorem,
even though the bound was

01:10:28.644 --> 01:10:31.180
pretty good for some graphs.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.620
Now it turns out--
I mean we're not

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.110
going to win a million
dollars for this algorithm.

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:39.880
And in fact, this algorithm
is sometimes very bad.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.370
And a really bad example
it's very close to this.

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:48.470
In fact actually this one, let's
look at how well does basic

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:51.310
do one this one here.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.160
Make some ordering.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:59.950
V1, V2, V3.

01:11:02.715 --> 01:11:05.520
What's the basic algorithm
going to do on this complete--

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.780
it's called a complete bipartite
graph, is what's this called.

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.300
I'll define bipartite
in a minute--

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.001
but what's the basic
algorithm do here?

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:20.860
Any idea-- does it take n over
2 colors, or does it take 2?

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.170
Any ideas?

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:24.370
2.

01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:29.650
So take a vertex, and the first
one, say V1s here, get C1.

01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:32.790
As long as I keep picking
vertices over on this side,

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:33.790
they're going to get C1.

01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:39.560
As soon as I get to
a vertex over here,

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.363
what color does it have to get?

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:42.130
AUDIENCE: C2.

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:43.620
PROFESSOR: C2
because it's touching

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.296
the very first one we had here.

01:11:46.296 --> 01:11:47.670
So when I get
vertices over here,

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:48.795
they're all going to be C2.

01:11:48.795 --> 01:11:52.270
When I go back over here,
they're going to be back to C1.

01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:55.910
So actually basic does good
here too, gives you two colors.

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:56.410
Yeah?

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:57.408
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.620
PROFESSOR: Ah, those
two aren't connected.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.480
But this case, if I've
got a vertex over here

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.540
it is, by definition, connected
to the vertex over here.

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.820
Because every
possible edge is here.

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:18.870
But that's a great idea.

01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:22.447
What if they weren't
all connected,

01:12:22.447 --> 01:12:23.655
that's actually a great idea.

01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:29.270
In fact, the nasty example
for the basic algorithm

01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:30.270
is very much like that.

01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:31.446
Let's draw it.

01:12:35.748 --> 01:12:38.200
Because so far,
the basic algorithm

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.080
is pretty much done
perfectly on all the graphs

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.870
we looked at even when
the theorem wasn't tight.

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:50.445
So here is a nasty graph.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.930
And it is very close to the
graph we just look like,

01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:00.910
where all the edges are there.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.080
In this case, all
the edges are there,

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.040
except for the one
straight across.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.980
So if this is-- the
edge denotes likes,

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:14.410
this is a world where you like
everybody but your spouse.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:19.390
All right, so you have
an edge to every one,

01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:21.240
except the one directly
across from you.

01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:29.370
No edge there, and so forth.

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:32.460
So it has almost every edge,
but it's missing these edges.

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:42.440
Now the basic algorithm
might do well here.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.120
What would be a good
ordering for this graph

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.010
to label these V1 through Vn?

01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:48.510
Yeah?

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:51.630
AUDIENCE: Go through
everything on the left side,

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:54.818
and then the right side.

01:13:54.818 --> 01:13:56.312
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:12.480
Because then color 1, color
1, color 1, all the way down.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.460
One color for the left,
what does this one get?

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.540
Color 2, because it's
hooked up against.

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:25.670
And these all get color 2,
so I've used two colors.

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:26.260
Really good.

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:28.630
Basic algorithm's looking great.

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.470
Now here's a harder question.

01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:34.800
Can you figure
out a bad ordering

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.995
for this graph, where I use
a lot more than two colors.

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:38.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:42.124 --> 01:14:43.040
PROFESSOR: What is it?

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.286
AUDIENCE: It starts at the
top of the cross, and then

01:14:47.286 --> 01:14:48.685
the next level then across.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:49.560
PROFESSOR: Very good.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.740
V1, V2.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:53.210
Just as natural, really,
if think about it,

01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:54.490
to order it this way.

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:03.860
All right.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.650
What color does V1 get?

01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:07.410
C1.

01:15:07.410 --> 01:15:08.890
What color does V2 get?

01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:09.910
AUDIENCE: C1.

01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:12.250
PROFESSOR: C1 because
it's not hooked up here.

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:13.735
What color does V3 get?

01:15:13.735 --> 01:15:14.387
AUDIENCE: C2.

01:15:14.387 --> 01:15:14.970
PROFESSOR: C2.

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:16.480
What about V4?

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.887
AUDIENCE: C2.

01:15:17.887 --> 01:15:18.470
PROFESSOR: C2.

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:19.670
It's not hooked up.

01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:21.560
It can't get one,
because that's up here.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.310
And it's not the two, so it
gets two What color does V5 get?

01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:26.600
AUDIENCE: C3.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.490
PROFESSOR: C3.

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:29.450
Because it's hooked
up to one to two.

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:30.806
V6 ?

01:15:30.806 --> 01:15:31.610
AUDIENCE: C3.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:34.900
PROFESSOR: C3, it's hooked up
to one and two, but not three.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:38.560
And you can see
what's happening here.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.230
All the way down
here he's hooked up

01:15:40.230 --> 01:15:43.165
to all the n over
2 minus 1 colors.

01:15:43.165 --> 01:15:47.110
So he also takes C n over 2.

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:50.120
So if you pick that
ordering, not so good.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.600
You use n over two colors.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.510
So it really matters
the ordering.

01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:58.030
Now I should say graphs
like-- actually any questions

01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:59.700
about what we did here?

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.430
About this?

01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:04.560
All right, now I should
say that graphs like this

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.470
have a special name, they're
called bipartite graphs.

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:11.249
And that's important
to remember.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:43.780
All right, so a graph G
is said to be bipartite

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:53.316
if the vertices can be split
into two sets, or partitioned,

01:16:53.316 --> 01:17:01.360
and we'll call them a
left set, and a right set,

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:17.330
so that all the edges connect
a node in the left set,

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:21.190
to a node in the right set.

01:17:23.759 --> 01:17:25.300
So in fact, a lot
of today we've been

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:28.500
looking at bipartite graphs,
because the nodes are here.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:32.660
Like the men, and the women, and
the edges only go from the left

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:33.900
to the right.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:35.335
And that is called bipartite.

01:17:35.335 --> 01:17:37.290
And it's called
bipartite because you

01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:41.820
can do it with two
colors, or in two pieces.

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.860
So you don't win
a million dollars

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.630
for deciding whether
or not a graph can

01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:47.600
be colored in two colors.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.950
That's easy.

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:51.730
You'll even do it for
homework one of these times.

01:17:51.730 --> 01:17:54.330
You do win the million dollars
for deciding if a graph can

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:56.700
be colored in three colors.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.450
That's really hard to do.

01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:04.800
Now coloring problems come up
in all sorts of applications.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.950
You know with this company,
Akamai, that came out of MIT,

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.070
we've talked about.

01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:14.490
We run a network
of 75,000 servers.

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:16.860
And they're used to distribute
content on the internet,

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.280
and so forth.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.210
And we have to
deploy a new version

01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:21.800
of our software
on those servers,

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.420
pretty much every week.

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.560
We're pushing new software out.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:31.070
And you can't deploy on every
server at the same time,

01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:32.950
because you've got
to take down a server

01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:34.450
to deploy new software on it.

01:18:34.450 --> 01:18:36.050
Got to take it
out of commission.

01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:38.650
And so we can't just take
down all 75,000 servers,

01:18:38.650 --> 01:18:40.960
because then all the
Facebook, and Netflix,

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.410
and all those sites would stop.

01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:44.840
That would be bad.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:48.060
And we can't do them one at a
time, because there's 75,000.

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.780
And it takes a few
hours for each one

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:54.070
to get the traffic off,
stop it, load new software,

01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.980
and turn it back on.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:58.240
And it would take us years
to do one software install,

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.610
which we got to do every week.

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:03.280
So we've got to figure out a
schedule for how many servers

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.530
you take down at a given
time, and which ones.

01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:07.590
And it turns out
pairs of servers

01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:09.639
have certain critical functions.

01:19:09.639 --> 01:19:11.930
So there's certain pairs of
servers you can't take down

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:14.750
at the same time.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:18.536
So we have a gigantic 75,000
node coloring problem,

01:19:18.536 --> 01:19:20.035
where there's edges
between servers.

01:19:20.035 --> 01:19:21.618
Nodes are servers,
and there's an edge

01:19:21.618 --> 01:19:25.634
between if you can't install
new software at the same time.

01:19:25.634 --> 01:19:27.050
And so when it
turns out, when you

01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:30.410
run one of these graph
coloring algorithms on it,

01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:32.120
you could do it
with eight colors.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.160
It just turns out that way.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.070
So that means there's
eight waves of install

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.920
that go on to the network.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.450
And now eight times
a few hours each

01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:44.672
means that we can do it in a
day, and you can manage it.

01:19:44.672 --> 01:19:47.780
You know on a much
smaller scale,

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.310
the same problem exists
for register allocation,

01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:52.120
for variables.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.486
Here you've got to assign
every variable to register.

01:19:55.486 --> 01:19:56.860
But you can't have
variables that

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.360
are active at the
same time associated

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.900
with the same register.

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:03.850
And you want to minimize the
number of registers you need.

01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:07.110
So again, you have the
graph coloring problem.

01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:10.220
The number of colors is the
number of registers you need.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.920
And two variables can't get
the same color if their active

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:15.810
at the same time, so you
put an edge between them.

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.720
The most famous example
of graph coloring

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:21.670
is the map coloring problem,
with the four coloring theorem.

01:20:21.670 --> 01:20:25.800
And so here, every
country is a node.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.727
Adjacent countries have
an edge between them,

01:20:27.727 --> 01:20:29.810
because you don't want to
color adjacent countries

01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:31.480
the same color,
or you can't tell

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.730
they're different countries.

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:36.990
Now the last example
we can talk about

01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:40.000
is an important problem
in communication theory,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.630
communication networks, where
again coloring comes up.

01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:48.100
Now here you need to assign
frequencies to radio stations,

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.035
or the cell towers.

01:20:49.035 --> 01:20:54.510
It comes up in mobile networks,
or just in with radio stations.

01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:59.370
And if two towers have
an overlapping area,

01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:01.290
they can't be given
the same frequency,

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:05.540
so you get collisions
between the towers.

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.110
And frequencies
are very expensive.

01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:08.901
Companies pay the
government a lot of money

01:21:08.901 --> 01:21:11.020
to get certain spectrum.

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:13.350
So suppose you had this problem.

01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:17.205
Here's tower A, this is A's
range, where it reaches.

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:20.750
Here's tower B, so
it overlaps some

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:36.660
with A. Here's tower C. Here's
tower E. And here's tower D.

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.280
All right now the
question would be,

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.869
how many radio
frequencies do you need?

01:21:40.869 --> 01:21:42.910
What's the minimum number
of frequencies you need

01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:45.916
to enable all the towers here?

01:21:45.916 --> 01:21:47.480
We could make that be a graph.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.760
There's a node for each tower.

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:54.400
And an edge between
towers, if they overlap.

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:58.650
C doesn't overlap
with B, E does.

01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:00.970
E overlaps here.

01:22:00.970 --> 01:22:05.060
And then D overlaps here.

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:09.197
So how many frequencies do
you need for this graph?

01:22:09.197 --> 01:22:10.360
AUDIENCE: Four.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.580
PROFESSOR: Four would
work, three is better.

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.512
Can you do two?

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.380
No you can't do two,
because you got here.

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.820
But you could do three.

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:29.830
You could do one,
two, three, two, one.

01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:30.841
This problem comes up--

01:22:30.841 --> 01:22:31.715
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:31.715 --> 01:22:33.010
PROFESSOR: Did I screw up?

01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:34.660
Ooh, no I can't do that.

01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:36.630
One, two, yeah much better.

01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:39.300
All right, this problem
comes up all over the place.

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:41.640
I'm certain you'll see it
sometime in your career,

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.015
you'll have some problem, or
you're scheduling something,

01:22:44.015 --> 01:22:45.960
and it's really a graph
problem in disguise.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.250
OK that's it for today.
