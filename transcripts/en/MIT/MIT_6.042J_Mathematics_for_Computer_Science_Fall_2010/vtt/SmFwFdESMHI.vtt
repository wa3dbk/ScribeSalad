00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.090
PROFESSOR: Let's get started.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.540
Drop date is coming up.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.499
So that you didn't do
very well on the midterm,

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.206
and you haven't been
doing your homework,

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:32.070
and you haven't been
going to recitation,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.580
I would strongly
consider drop date.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.820
And you can see your
TAs to get some idea

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.040
of what your grades
are, and what you're

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.410
likely to do if you keep on
giving the same performance

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.400
you've had so far.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.740
Now, today, we're going to
switch gears again and cover

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.577
the last topic for the course.

00:00:51.577 --> 00:00:53.160
For the remainder
of the course, we're

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.800
going to talk about probability.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.880
It's one of the most
important subjects in all

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.540
of math or computer science.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.020
In fact, I was at a frat
last night for dinner,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.550
and they asked me what my
favorite algorithm was.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.340
And I couldn't really think
about my favorite algorithm

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.370
was, but in terms of one of the
most important subjects for you

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.730
to know about, after induction,
it's probably probability.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.850
It's really important across
math and computer science.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.812
Most of the upper level courses
you take in computer science

00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:23.020
are going to use probability.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.660
They're going to expect
you to know the basics.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.110
For example, when you're
designing algorithms in 006

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.360
or 6046, you're going to
be designing in some cases

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.990
probabilistic algorithms--
algorithms that flip coins

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.910
or generate random
numbers to get the result.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.410
And by using randomness,
they run faster.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.800
If you're doing software
engineering later,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.300
you're going to use
probability when

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.950
you analyze system performance
or build hash tables.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.190
Probability is used
in information theory,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.590
in coding theory,
in cryptography.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.150
In fact, our nation's
codes, their security

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
depends on
probabilistic analysis.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.580
Because the bad guys
are using probabilistic

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.199
algorithms to break
the crypto-system.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.920
And we'll give an example of
that in another week or so.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.820
Probability is
obviously important

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.240
if you're doing game theory
or if you like to gamble,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.480
really critical in gambling.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.100
In fact, we're going to analyze
a lot of different gambling

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.350
games over the next few weeks.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.710
And for fun, we'll
play some in class.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.170
In fact, we'll play
one later today.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.010
And it's amazing how often
the intuition is wrong.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.440
You think the
answer goes one way,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.000
and then it's
actually the other.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.160
Probability is important in
the study of fault tolerance.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.090
For example, how
do you figure out

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.730
the probability there's going
to be some critical failure that

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.120
causes the space
shuttle to crash?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.990
Or a critical failure that
causes a nuclear plant

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.350
to meltdown?

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.250
That's done through
probabilistic analysis.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.780
And we'll do some
examples of that.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.370
Probability comes
up in everyday life.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.112
We just had an election.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.570
And running up to
the election, you

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.780
get all these polls that
say that's so-and-so

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.060
is ahead of so-and-so by three
points with a margin of error

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.780
of five points.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.650
So it's a statistical dead
heat, is what they say.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.930
Well, what the heck
does that mean?

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.990
In fact, usually they've
got it screwed up.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.156
And we're going to spend
the recitation where you're

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:22.880
going to do a margin of
error analysis for a poll,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.500
and see how many people
do you need to poll to get

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.490
a pretty accurate result?

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.390
Comes up in the medical studies.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.400
Does cholesterol
cause heart disease?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.090
Does smoking cause lung cancer?

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.410
How effective is a certain drug?

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.780
Say you get tested for a disease
and it comes back positive.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.950
Well, there's false positives
and false negatives.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.970
What are the chances you
really have the disease?

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.942
So the list goes on and on.

00:03:51.942 --> 00:03:53.900
In fact, we're going to
see all these examples.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.910
We've got eight lectures
and eight recitations.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.020
And there's just no end
of interesting examples

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.770
where probability
comes into play.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.920
The bad news is,
probability is probably

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.400
the most misunderstood
subject in all of mathematics

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.370
and the sciences.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.750
In fact, Mark Twain
once said, there's

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.300
three kinds of lies-- lies,
damned lies, and statistics,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.210
meaning probability.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.890
Because it's so easy
to lie with statistics.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.750
And we're going to see lots
and lots of examples of that.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.790
In fact, newspaper
articles, you know,

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.000
have all sorts of things that
are just horribly fallacious

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.032
based on statistics.

00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:41.990
And we'll see examples.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.690
In fact, we're going to even
debunk a very famous article--

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.920
published research paper--
by some famous computer

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.720
scientists at Berkeley.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.610
Where they got to a conclusion
using a very standard method

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.650
you see all the time--
completely fallacious.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.120
And we'll see that.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.280
So you can think of that
as, I'm going to teach you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.080
how to lie with statistics.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.380
Even better, how not to be taken
in by incorrect arguments using

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.860
probability theory.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.390
Now, at MIT, it's
probably the subject

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.910
that most often
trips up students

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.760
in their PhD qualifying exams.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.450
You know, there's no
better way to strike

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.109
terror in the heart of a
student then to be sitting there

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:28.650
and ask them a
question while they're

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.480
at the board, what's the
probability that foo happens?

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.760
It's like panic sets
in when they've got

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.060
to do a probabilistic analysis.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.330
And now, MIT PhD
students are good.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.260
You know, they can crank out
the most horrendous calculation,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.880
no problem, come up with really
clever ideas to solve problems.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.170
But you get into probability,
it gets into trouble.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.070
In fact, even the other
faculty sitting there

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.050
start squirming around when
this question's being posed.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.894
You know, and probability
questions are--

00:05:57.894 --> 00:05:59.810
and we'll see some
examples today-- are always

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.980
the best at faculty
parties, just

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.450
can ruin people's whole night.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.366
You know, what's the
probability this happens?

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:06.580
And it's some weird answer.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.130
Now, the strange thing
about this-- well,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.820
first strange thing is that our
human intuition is terrible.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.380
And you will see that.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.960
Your intuition will
be wrong, just the way

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.840
our brains are
created genetically.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.880
But the good news is that
probability can be very simple.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.880
If you force yourself to just go
to the basic principles-- which

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.920
we're going to cover-- and
go through the basic template

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.630
of how to solve a problem--
which we're going to cover--

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.370
it is easy, and
you can't go wrong.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.660
The key is forcing yourself
to just actually write it

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.850
down, follow the
basic principles,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.110
and get to the answer.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.969
As opposed to saying, oh, the
answer's that and here's why.

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:54.010
Because it's amazing how
often you'll be wrong if

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.620
you just try to rely
on your intuition.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.730
Now, we're going to start
today our study of probability

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.760
with a famous, simple game.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.270
And the game is known as
the Monty Hall problem.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.500
Now, do you all know
who Monty Hall was?

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.590
You're probably too young.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.850
Yeah, OK, not many people
know who Monte Hall was.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.530
But back in the 1970s, there
was a very popular daytime TV

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.850
show-- a game show--
called Let's Make a Deal.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.090
And it was a great show.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.870
It was the precursor
of Wheel of Fortune--

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.240
if you're old enough to
have seen that-- and then

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.900
Deal or No Deal after that.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.500
There's always some game
show that's really popular.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.660
Anyway, back in the '70s,
it was Let's Make a Deal,

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.132
and Monty Hall was the host.

00:07:40.132 --> 00:07:42.340
How many people have ever
heard of Let's Make a Deal?

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.214
Raise your hand if you've
ever heard of that.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.630
OK, so it still has some fame.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.460
Good.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.690
All right.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.970
Now, Monty Hall, of
course, was the precursor

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.740
of Pat Sajak of Wheel of
Fortune and Howie Mandel,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.410
you know, from Deal or No Deal.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.070
And his assistant
was Carol Merrill.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.620
She was also famous as
the beautiful assistant.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.430
Now, in Let's Make a
Deal, they TV audience

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.890
would come dressed
up in wild costumes.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.690
And Monty would go
into the audience

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.240
and pick out a contestant
from the audience based

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.620
on how wild their
costume was-- you know,

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.910
somebody that would
look interesting for TV.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.440
And what he would do is he'd
buy a piece of the costume--

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.290
maybe their hat or
shirt or something--

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.960
and give them $100 for a
piece of their costume.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.370
And then he would say,
hey look, you know,

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.340
if you give me back the
$100 I just gave you,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.230
I'm going to let you have
your choice of what's

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.669
behind door number one,
door number two, or door

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.730
number three.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.320
Or sometimes it would be box
number one, box number two,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.260
and box number three.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.560
Now, because people have
seen the game show before,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.620
they knew that behind
one of the doors

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.380
was a brand new car or
underneath one of the boxes

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.520
was a diamond ring.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.520
And behind the other doors
were goats or donkeys

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.960
or something totally useless.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.010
So one of the three
doors has a big prize,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.930
the other two got nothing.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.790
But because anybody would pay
$100 for a one-in-three chance

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.990
at the car, they played.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.820
And they're on national TV.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.930
So they give the $100 back to
Monty, and they pick a door,

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.830
say door number one.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.690
Monty wouldn't open door
number one right away.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.110
What he would do is say, OK,
you're sure you like that?

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.792
All right.

00:09:29.792 --> 00:09:31.250
Carol, can you
please reveal what's

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.490
behind door number three?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.270
So Carol opens up
door number three,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.150
and there's one of the
donkeys sitting there

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.920
or a goat sitting there.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.650
Well, now there's
only two doors left.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.500
One of them has the car.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.070
So he'd ask the contestant,
well, you've seen the goat.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.510
There's a car behind
one of the two doors.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.620
Do you want to stick
with door number one?

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.260
Or do you want to switch
and get door number two?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.960
And then the audience is
screaming, you know, switch,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.570
stick, you know, door
number one, door number two.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.320
You know, the guy's
wife's there screaming

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.840
at him and everything.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.300
You know, he's got to
pick, so he picks one.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.620
And you know, if he picks the
car, well, his wife's thrilled.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.760
They live happily ever.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.559
He's a hero on national TV.

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:18.100
And if he picks the goat, you
know, he's looking at a divorce

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.560
and his career's ruined.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.250
So it's pretty important that
he gets the right strategy here.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.380
Now, the question we're
going to look at today

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.670
is whether or not
the contestant should

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.050
switch, playing this game.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.720
Now, before we do
the analysis, we're

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.540
going to actually play
the game in class.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.414
I've got three boxes here.

00:10:41.414 --> 00:10:43.330
The game we're going to
play is the same idea.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.300
The prizes are a
little different.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.470
Instead of a diamond
ring or a brand new car,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.700
we've got $10 Toski's
gift certificates.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.370
You know, your tuition
only goes so far here.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.790
Instead of donkeys
or goats, we've

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.871
got something much better, the
ever-popular nerd pride pocket

00:10:59.871 --> 00:11:00.370
protector.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.230
And just to be
clear, this is not

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.590
the prize, the gift
certificate here--

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.559
this is much, much better.

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:11.350
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.890
Now, in terms of Monty
Hall, we don't have him,

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.680
but you have me.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.580
But I am very happy to report
that we're bringing Carol

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.530
Merrill out of retirement.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.630
She's coming and making a
special appearance today,

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.680
I hope, at 6042.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.882
Do we have Carol?

00:11:30.882 --> 00:11:31.840
GUEST SPEAKER: Hi, Tom.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.140
PROFESSOR: Oh,
yes, we have Carol.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.186
That's scary.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.085
Oh, Jesus.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.190
OK.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.290
As you can see, the years
have not been kind to Carol.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.720
And your tuition only
does goes so far.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.840
Now, we need three volunteers.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.760
We're going to play
the game three times.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.600
All right, got a couple there.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.690
Why don't you come down?

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.180
We've got three volunteers here.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.490
All right, we'll get
the boxes set up.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.090
And Carol, why don't
you set those up

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.660
and load them up with-- these
are the gift certificates.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.645
That's the pocket
protector there.

00:12:16.645 --> 00:12:17.770
All right, now, don't look.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.590
You've got to get back over
there so you can't see--

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.550
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.730
And no, no, no, now, you've
got the film going, you know,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.070
here we go.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.910
All right.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.810
So Carol is going to put the
prize in one of the boxes

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.210
and the pocket
protectors in the other.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.560
Now, I want you all to
be thinking, you know,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.270
what's the right strategy here?

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.020
Is it better to switch?

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.030
Does it matter?

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.960
What are the chances of winning?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.840
One in three?

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.570
One in two?

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.930
All right, so who's our
first volunteer here?

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:52.950
All right, come on over.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.741
We're going to write
your name on the board

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:57.590
because we're going to keep
track of what happens here.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.879
What's your name?

00:12:58.879 --> 00:12:59.670
TERRANCE: Terrance.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.503
PROFESSOR: Terrance.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.530
All right.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.960
Now, first thing
you've got to do,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.980
Terrance, is pick a box as
your basic choice to start.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.610
TERRANCE: Two.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.260
PROFESSOR: Number two, OK.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.106
All right, you
picked number two.

00:13:20.106 --> 00:13:23.070
Hm, interesting choice.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.695
Now, Carol, can you show
him one of the other boxes?

00:13:34.344 --> 00:13:36.260
All right, which on was
that you showed there?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.820
You revealed number three.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.832
And what was under number three?

00:13:43.832 --> 00:13:45.275
AUDIENCE: Pocket protector.

00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:46.718
PROFESSOR: Pocket protector.

00:13:46.718 --> 00:13:50.185
Oh, God, you may never
live this down, Carol.

00:13:50.185 --> 00:13:50.685
OK.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.740
Now, Terrance, as you
know, one of these

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.280
has the gift certificate.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.300
One of them has another
pocket protector.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.860
And now, you've got
to decide, are you

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.470
going to stick with number two,
or are you going to switch?

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.239
In fact, class,
you know, Terrance

00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:12.030
may need some help
here, figuring this out,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.420
so what do you recommend?

going to switch.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.865
All right, and Carol,
can you reveal his prize?

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:30.710
What did you get?

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.000
Ah, he gets the prize.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.320
So he wins.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.650
Very nice, OK.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.200
So you get $10 at Tosci's.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.570

got new prizes loaded in there?

seemed like the majority vote.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.365
PROFESSOR: The
majority knew what

00:17:10.365 --> 00:17:13.940
they were talking about, OK.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.425
You have faith in
these guys, huh?

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:16.910
All right.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.976
How about you, Chinua,
why did you switch?

00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:20.840
CHINUA: Um, I was
told that it's more

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.660
likely to be if you switch.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.576
PROFESSOR: And you believe
what you hear, huh?

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:26.007
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:28.392 --> 00:17:31.254
TY: I don't know who said
it, but it sounded good.

00:17:31.254 --> 00:17:32.535
PROFESSOR: Sounded good
Yeah, that two-thirds thing.

00:17:32.535 --> 00:17:34.160
Well, as you can see,
you're guaranteed

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.787
to win if you switch, right?

00:17:35.787 --> 00:17:36.286
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:36.286 --> 00:17:37.830
All right, Thank you very much.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.860
Enjoy the ice cream.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.460
OK.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:45.340
So how many people think
it helps to switch?

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.690
Raise your hand if you
think it helps to switch.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.400
How many people think it
does not help to switch?

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.960
Raise your hand.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.530
Anybody?

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.860
Oh, everybody likes
the switch thing here.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.450
Does this data help you decide?

00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.960
No.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.918
Anything could have
happened with three trials.

00:18:01.918 --> 00:18:03.895
In fact, we'll talk about
statistical inference

00:18:03.895 --> 00:18:05.610
and statistical sampling later.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.783
If you switch, what do you
think the odds of winning are?

00:18:10.783 --> 00:18:11.650
AUDIENCE: 100%

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:12.490
PROFESSOR: 100%?

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.630
OK, who likes 100%?

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.810
Raise your hand.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.410
Well, we've got a couple.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.940
How many people think
it's 50-50 if you switch?

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.810
Yeah, a lot.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.250
How many people think it's
worse than 50-50 if you switch?

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:26.990
Not many.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.426
How many people think
it's better than 50-50?

00:18:29.426 --> 00:18:33.250
Ah, that's I think most of
you there, pretty close.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.090
All right, now, the
answers to these questions

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.320
are very easy to work out--
and we're going to do it.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.700
We're going to figure out
the probability exactly--

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.960
if you use mathematics.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.500
But it's really
tricky if you try

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.490
to use intuition or
hand waving arguments.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.610
Now, for example,
this game-- Carol

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.220
wants to leave-- yeah, Carol,
let's give Carol a hand here.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.790
She did a wonderful job.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.526
Well done.

00:18:57.526 --> 00:18:58.804
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.249
Yikes.

00:19:02.249 --> 00:19:04.040
I'm going to get in
trouble here, too, now.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.590
You know?

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.770
OK.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.710
For example, this game, and
this particular version of it,

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:16.050
was the subject of a series of
articles in Parade Magazine.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.500
This is an old version
of Parade Magazine.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.260
And what I'm going to do is
hand out the series of articles.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.130
And the TAs are going to
help me hand these out.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.580
There was three of them with
a lot of write-ins here.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.724
I'm going to give
you a bundle here.

00:19:32.724 --> 00:19:34.859
There you go.

00:19:34.859 --> 00:19:35.400
There you go.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.707
I'll give the rest to Oscar.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.460
Great.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.030
Now, Marilyn has a column
every week in Parade.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.200
And people write in
questions, usually

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.700
about their love life
and weird things.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.350
And she answers them.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.210
And she's well
qualified to do this

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.890
because she's listed in the
Guinness Book of World Records

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:16.350
as having the highest IQ of
a human being ever, at 228.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.100
And so, you know
she's in some sense

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.600
qualified to answer any
question that is written in.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.390
Now, in September of 1990-- and
we're passing out the articles

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:32.880
now and it shows
the first article--

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.700
this guy named Craig
Whitaker writes in and asks

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.469
Marilyn if you should
switch in this game.

00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:41.510
So you can all read that.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.830
It says, suppose you're on
a game show and you're given

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.500
the choice of three doors.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.120
Behind one door is a car.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.180
Behind the others, goats.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.470
You pick a door, say
number one, and the host,

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.120
who knows what's
behind the doors,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.910
opens another one, say door
three, which has a goat.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.480
He says to you, do you want
to pick door number two?

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.055
Is it to your
advantage to switch?

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.670
Now, Marilyn writes back
saying, very plainly,

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.070
yes, you should switch.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.880
The first door had a
one-in-three chance of winning.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.530
The second door has a
two-in-three chance.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.320
Here's a good way to
visualize what's going on.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.540
Suppose there are
a million doors.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.780
You pick door number one.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.480
Then the host, who knows
what's behind the doors,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:36.710
reveals every other door
but one and 777,777.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.900
Well, it would sort
of look like 777,777

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.205
is the one with the car, and
you'd switch pretty fast.

00:21:43.205 --> 00:21:44.620
All right that's her argument.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.990
That is not exactly a
proof, OK, that the answer

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.450
is you should switch or
that the probability is 2/3.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.270
All right?

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.140
Now, because she's
giving another problem

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.070
with a million doors, but you've
got a problem with three doors.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.530
And as we'll see in recitation
tomorrow, the number of doors

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.980
actually matters in terms
of some strategies here.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.760
So people weren't
convinced by this.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.510
And so, if you look
to the next page,

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.930
you see people writing in.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.340
And there's a lot a write-ins.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.830
The first one's by Robert
Sachs, who's actually--

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.360
I looked him up on
Google, and he's

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.450
on the faculty at
George Mason University.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.390
I also noticed that
in his history,

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.400
he got his BA from Harvard.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.130
So that should tell you
something about the quality

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.400
of his response here.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.330
He says, since you seem to enjoy
coming straight to the point,

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.560
I'll do the same.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.890
You blew it.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.170
Let me explain.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.120
If one door is
shown to be a loser,

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.120
that information
changes the probability

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.940
of either remaining
choice, neither of which

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.210
has any reason to
be more likely.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.340
And so, the answer is one
half of having the car.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.830
Then he says, as a
professional mathematician,

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.830
I'm very concerned with
the general public's

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.760
lack of mathematical skills.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.545
Please help by
confessing your error.

00:23:04.545 --> 00:23:07.090
And in the future,
be more careful.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.810
Just a little gratuitous
extra statement there.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.270
Next we've got a PhD from
Florida, Scott Smith, who says,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.600
you blew it, and
you blew it big.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.210
Since you seem to
have difficulty

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.350
grasping the basic principles
at work here, I'll explain.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.440
After the host reveals
a goat, you now

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.890
have a one-in-two
chance of being correct.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.530
Whether you change
your selection or not,

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.150
the odds are the same.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.140
There is enough mathematical
illiteracy in this country,

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.560
and we don't need the world's
highest IQ propagating more.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.199
Shame.

00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:41.240
Well, now, this guy is
right about that one point

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.370
about mathematical
illiteracy in the country.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.290
The next guy, Barry
Pasternack, you know,

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.360
he lists himself as California
Faculty Association.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.050
He actually was president of the
California Faculty Association.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.870
He says, your answer to
the question is an error,

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.120
but if it's any constellation,
many of my academic colleagues

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.080
have also been stumped
by this problem.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.580
OK.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.360
So next page,
Marilyn writes back.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.510
And she says, you
know, good heavens,

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.572
with so much learned
opposition, I'll

00:24:11.572 --> 00:24:14.030
bet this is going to keep math
classes all over the country

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:14.960
busy on Monday.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.760
And it did.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.910
It was a huge uproar
at the time about this.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.230
So now she tries
to explain it some

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:26.430
more with shells and stuff
under the shells and so forth,

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.040
trying to argue it.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.750
And then she says, just try
the experiment six times

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.116
or something, and you'll see.

00:24:35.116 --> 00:24:38.300
You know, but, it's
not really convincing.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.640
It's not a proof.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.340
She's sort of waving hands at
it to give you some idea of why

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.686
she thinks she's right.

00:24:43.686 --> 00:24:45.310
But when I look at
the hand waving here

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.080
versus the hand waving
on those faculty,

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.460
well, it's all hand waving.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:50.960
All right.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.740
So you go to the next
page, and now the letters

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.910
are getting a little nastier.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.670
We got another University
of Florida guy.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.450
He says, may I suggest
you obtain and refer

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.860
to a standard textbook
on probability

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.720
before you try to answer a
question of this type again.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.380
Then Robert Smith,
Georgia State,

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.280
I am sure you will
receive many letters

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.780
on this topic from high
school and college students.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.970
Perhaps you should keep
a few addresses for help

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.380
with future columns.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.190
These are great.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.525
Now this next guy, Ray
Bobo, now, he's a real guy.

00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:27.400
I looked him up, too.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.150
It's not fake.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.820
That's his real name.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.190
And I've got to say,
if my name was Bobo,

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.630
I'd think twice before
writing into Parade Magazine,

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:39.070
you know, especially
if I'm wrong.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.080
Anyway, here's Bobo.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.260
You are utterly incorrect
about the game show question.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.170
And I hope this controversy
will call some public attention

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.415
to the serious national crisis
in mathematical education.

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:52.394
Well, that's fair.

00:25:52.394 --> 00:25:53.810
If you could admit
your error, you

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.310
will have contributed
constructively

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.091
towards a solution of
a deplorable situation.

00:25:58.091 --> 00:25:59.090
Now, here's [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.940
How many irate
mathematicians are needed

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.380
to get you to change your mind?

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.794
Well that's proof by
intimidation, right?

00:26:07.794 --> 00:26:08.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.420
You know, it's not,
here's the reason why.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.490
It's just, so many irate
mathematicians said

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.510
it, they must, must be right.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.550
Now the next guy.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.340
I am in shock that
after being corrected

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.110
by at least three
mathematicians,

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.300
you still did not
see your mistake.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.880
As if three
mathematicians, that's

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.340
sort of the criteria
for correctness.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.190
Oh, this guy is bad.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.970
Maybe women look at math
problems differently than men.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:36.550
Ooh.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.220
Well, maybe it's a good
thing in this case.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.740
I don't know.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:46.690
Oh, then we have Glen
Calkins, you are the goat.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:50.190
Finally, this guy, US
Army Research Institute,

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.550
a little scary.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:54.230
you made a mistake, but
look at the positive side.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.840
If all those PhD's
were wrong, the country

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.620
would be in some
very serious trouble.

00:27:01.481 --> 00:27:01.980
All right.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.620
Now Marilyn writes an
even longer response

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.970
because she's getting zillions
of letters, 90% voting

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.660
against her, that she's wrong.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.130
She begins now, suggests
a nationwide experiment,

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.490
so that, nationwide, you'd
do the sample a million times

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.414
and get the answer, which
really wouldn't prove it either.

00:27:21.414 --> 00:27:22.580
Then we go to the last page.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.630
There's one last letter.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:27.420
And this is what finished
the controversy in the press.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.350
Comes from MIT.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:30.590
You are indeed correct.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.110
My colleagues at work had
a ball with this problem,

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:36.280
and I dare say that most of
them, including me at first,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.480
thought you were wrong.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.870
So maybe that $50,000 a year
somebody's paying for education

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:47.260
is worth something, because MIT
came in and agreed with her.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.490
OK.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:52.650
It turns out that Marilyn
was correct in her statement

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.180
that you should switch.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.630
And if you switch, you have
a 2/3 chance of winning.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.050
So if you don't switch, you've
got a 1/3 chance of winning,

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.750
provided that
Monty is guaranteed

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.285
to open a door with goat.

00:28:05.285 --> 00:28:07.780
You know and that's
the assumption here.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.720
And the proof is simple.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.270
Although Marilyn's reasoning
wasn't so convincing,

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.590
I didn't think.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.500
And all those PhDs that wrote
in with those stupid letters,

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.220
they're probably
intelligent people.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.480
After all, they got advanced
degrees in mathematics,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.270
and most of them were
faculty teaching mathematics.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.880
A little scary.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.640
But they just weren't
following the basic principles.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.600
They were following
their intuition.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.220
They didn't go through
the basic steps

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.046
to figure out the probability.

00:28:37.046 --> 00:28:38.420
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.602
We're going to go
through the basic steps

00:28:39.602 --> 00:28:41.140
now and see how to solve it.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.210
And we will use these
steps to solve pretty much

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.320
every problem in probability.

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.840
OK?

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:52.860
So the key, the first step,
is to look at the sample

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.512
space of possible outcomes.

00:28:56.512 --> 00:28:58.710
Let me define sample
space and outcome.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:13.550
The sample space for an
experiment, or a probability

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:22.000
game-- you can treat this Monty
Hall game as an experiment--

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.990
is simply the set of
all possible outcomes,

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:30.790
things that could happen.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.660
In fact, let me
define an outcome,

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.040
also known as an atomic
event or a sample point.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:50.790
An outcome, also
known as a sample

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:59.470
point-- we'll use those
terms interchangeably--

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:21.320
consists of all the information
about the experiment,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.160
including-- and
that's after it's

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:42.940
been performed-- including the
values of all random choices.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:02.330
For example, say we want to
know the probability of winning

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.486
in Monty Hall if you switch.

00:31:05.486 --> 00:31:07.780
All right, let's
figure that out.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:13.230
So in that case, we're going to
define an outcome of the Monty

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:30.740
Hall game or a sample point--
and I'm assuming in this case,

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:47.434
we know you're going to switch
and the contestant switches--

00:31:47.434 --> 00:31:48.475
consists of three things.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:32:00.780
First, the box with the prize,
where did Carroll put it?

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.735
Second, the box chosen
by the contestant.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.960
And third, the box
that was revealed.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.720
Once you know
those three things,

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.150
you know everything
about what happened.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.880
All right?

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.450
For example, let's look
at a typical sample point.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:40.330
Say I took sample point,
or outcome, 2,1,3.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:53.490
This is the outcome where
the prize is the box 2.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:09.130
The player picks first box 1.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:16.150
And Carol reveals box 3.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.140
OK, now in this case,
in this outcome,

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.205
did the contestant win?

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:30.700
Yes, because we're
assuming-- for henceforth,

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.550
for most of the rest
of the day, we're

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.230
assuming the switch
case, because we're

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.360
going to analyze that.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.860
So that's fixed, they switch.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.470
They come in knowing
they're going to switch.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.900
So the prize is in 2, all right?

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.650
The prize is here.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.560
The player started here.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.770
Carol revealed 3.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.370
And when they switched,
they got the prize.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:56.310
So in this outcome,
the player won.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.950
OK.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:02.570
Now, does every 3-tuple here
correspond to a sample point,

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.601
to our possible outcome?

00:34:05.601 --> 00:34:06.100
No.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.909
What's an example of a sample
point with numbers 1, 2,

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:09.980
and 3 that's not.

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:12.989
Yeah?

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.199
Very good.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:27.010
Yeah, so for example, 1,
2, 1 is not a sample point,

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:31.500
is not in the set,
the sample space,

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:37.310
because we can't reveal
the box with the prize.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:42.060
Similarly, 2, 1, 1 is
not a sample point,

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.810
because we can't reveal the
box that the player picked.

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:47.351
Yeah?

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:49.976
AUDIENCE : I think the first two
pieces of data actually define

00:34:49.976 --> 00:34:54.732
the third one, because
once, or-- actually, no,

00:34:54.732 --> 00:34:57.210
if they're the same.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.490
PROFESSOR: Right,
so if the player

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.321
picked the box with
the prize, which

00:35:02.321 --> 00:35:04.110
never happened in our case.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:12.460
For example, 1, 1 2 and
1, 1, 3 are both possible

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.230
because you could put the prize
here, the player could pick it,

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.960
now Carol has a choice
of revealing 2 or 3.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.000
OK?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.790
So these are OK.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:34.030
All right, so let's figure out
a nice way of characterizing

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.400
all outcomes in
the sample space.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.920
Now, to do this, we're
going to set up a tree.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.980
And we're going to use
a thing called the tree

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:54.679
method to construct
the sample space,

00:35:54.679 --> 00:35:55.720
getting all the outcomes.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.360
All right.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.300
So the first thing we do is
figure out where the prize is.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.980
And we'll represent that as
sort of like a decision tree.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.060
There's three choices.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:26.320
It's in box 1, box 2, or box 3.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.971
Then the next thing is the
box that the player picked.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.640
And we'll continue our
decision tree here.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.200
Each of these now
has three branches.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.778
And they're labeled 1, 2, or 3.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.030
And then, the last step
is which box is revealed.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:03.620
Now, in this case, if
the prize is in one

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.680
and the player chose one,
there's two possibilities.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.090
We could reveal 2 or reveal 3.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:18.830
So we get 1, 2, 3
here and 1, 2, 3 here.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:20.880
What about here?

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.490
Prize is in box 1, box
2 is revealed-- sorry,

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.730
player picked box 2.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.850
Prize is in 1, player picks
2, how many choices for which

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:34.940
box is revealed?

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.660
One.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.390
And which box is
going to be revealed?

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.870
3.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:44.900
All right, this is
sample point 1, 2, 3.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:50.120
And here we've got 1,
3, 2 is the only choice.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.660
All right.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.625
And let's do--
maybe I'll, we ought

00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:58.140
to fill the whole
thing out here.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:08.060
2, 1, 3-- I'm going to run out
of space, but-- 2, 2, now this

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:13.110
splits into 1 and 3.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:13.790
All right?

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:23.120
So we have here
2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.420
Now let me do the last
one, 2, 3, 1 here.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:33.070
And now I'll bring
these up over here.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.135
I've got 3, 1, 2.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.770
Then I've got 3, 2, 1.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:53.780
And finally, I've got 3, 3
with two choices, 1 and 2.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:00.150
All right?

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:04.670
That is now the construction
of the entire sample space,

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.100
all the possible outcomes.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.850
How many sample
points are there here?

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.030
How many possible outcomes?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.690
AUDIENCE : 12

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:16.190
PROFESSOR: 12.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:22.100
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, OK.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:26.570
Let's see which ones correspond
to victory for the player.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:28.740
Let's label each one
as a win for the player

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.150
or a loss for the player.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.150
What's this one?

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.650
Yeah.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.040
Prize is in 1,
the player chose 1

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.690
where the prize was, and
then switched away from it.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.300
Loss.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.650
What about this one?

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.140
Loss, same reason.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.180
What about this one?

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:48.760
That's a win.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.560
The prize is here, the player
went there and switched,

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.520
so they wound up there.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.390
Win.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.050
And these are all wins
for the same reason.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.280
Whoop, not this one.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.080
2, 1, 1, the player got
it right to start with,

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.170
and then switched away.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.830
That's a loss.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:08.470
Loss.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:12.320
Win, win, win.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.955
And here the player got it
right, they switched away,

00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:16.350
it's a lose.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.680
All right, so we've
labeled every outcome

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:23.420
as to whether the player
who's switching wins or loses.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.940
How many sample points
lead to victory?

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.780
6.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.590
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out of 12.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.420
Uh-oh.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.290
Was Marilyn wrong?

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.590
Is it really Bobo was right?

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.890
It's 50-50?

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:44.814
Half the sample points
lead to victory.

00:40:44.814 --> 00:40:46.910
Hm, what's missing here?

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:47.932
Yeah?

00:40:47.932 --> 00:40:50.360
AUDIENCE : The first
two are identical,

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.360
the box with the prize
and the box chosen first.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.804
Each of those two sample
points coming from that

00:40:55.804 --> 00:40:59.876
are half as likely as
the single sample points.

00:40:59.876 --> 00:41:00.876
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:41:00.876 --> 00:41:04.060
What we're missing
here is the likelihood

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.160
of an outcome, the probability
that this is what happens.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.846
We're missing one more thing.

00:41:09.846 --> 00:41:11.470
And this is really
critical when you're

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.630
making your sample spaces.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.550
You need to make sure you get
the probabilities assigned

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.180
to each event.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.650
They're not necessarily
equally likely.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.060
In fact, what we need to do is
to construct the probability

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.400
space.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.440
So lets define that.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:44.300
Your probability space consists
of a sample space-- which

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.670
we've already talked about.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:42:02.140
That's just all these outcomes--
and a probability function

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:06.460
that maps-- and we call
this function, usually, PR.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:11.500
We'll have, sometimes it'll
be f or something like that--

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:21.325
but PR maps the sample
space, S, to the real numbers

00:42:21.325 --> 00:42:30.220
such that first, for every
outcome in the sample space,

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:37.590
the probability is between
0 and 1 of that outcome.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:40.570
And 2, if you sum
up the probabilities

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.870
of all the outcomes, you get 1.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:50.100
So the sum over all outcomes of
the probability of the outcome

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.541
is 1.

00:42:52.541 --> 00:42:53.040
All right?

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.750
So the sample space
is all the outcomes.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:58.850
The probability space adds
in-- has this extra thing--

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.410
the probability of each outcome.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:02.880
And really, it
could be anything,

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.290
as long is the probability
of every outcome

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:09.140
is between 0 and 1 and
they all add up to 1.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:09.710
That's it.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.690
All right.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.550
Now, there's a
natural interpretation

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.090
of what the probability
function is.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.812
And that is the probability
of a sample point,

00:43:20.812 --> 00:43:22.770
well, should be the
probability of its outcome.

00:43:28.967 --> 00:43:31.300
And this is sort of where you
get the to Marilyn saying,

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.000
hey, try it a million times
and you'll see 2/3 of the time,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.600
roughly, you get the
right, that you win.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.990
So for every outcome,
the probability

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:46.020
of that outcome,
that real number,

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:54.000
should be the probability that
when you run the experiment,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.045
w is what happens.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:00.580
w will be the outcome.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:08.690
In other words, if
probability of w

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:12.620
were a half, what
that means is you

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.670
should get that half the
time, roughly speaking.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:17.915
We'll get into really
details of that later.

00:44:17.915 --> 00:44:20.810
In other words, you toss
a fair coin, you flip it.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.260
Well, you might say, a
probability half of a heads.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:23.760
All right?

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.620
And so, this function, then,
the probability of heads is 1/2.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.540
Now, assigning the right
probabilities to the outcomes

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:36.029
is 95% of the work.

00:44:36.029 --> 00:44:37.570
In fact, if you
screw that up, you're

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.517
doomed because you can't
get the right answer.

00:44:40.517 --> 00:44:42.600
So for example, if we just
said, OK, each of these

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.571
is probability 1/12,
we'd get Bobo's answer

00:44:46.571 --> 00:44:47.820
as the probability of winning.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.009
So that's not too good.

00:44:51.009 --> 00:44:53.050
Now, to get the right
probabilities for the Monty

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.000
Hall problem, we have to
make some assumptions.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:00.254
So let's write those down.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.710
So the first assumption
we're going to make

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:30.170
is that Carol put the
prize in a random box.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:33.740
They're all equally likely.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:44.470
So the prize is in each
box with probability 1/3.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.380
The next assumption
we're going to make

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:54.200
is that the player didn't
see which box has the prize.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:54.700
OK?

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.110
In other words, and
more specifically,

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:08.350
no matter where the
prize is, the player

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:11.380
picks each box with
probability of 1/3.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.735
So the player's making,
effectively, a random choice.

00:46:27.449 --> 00:46:30.482
All right, and there's one more
assumption we're going to make.

00:46:30.482 --> 00:46:31.940
Anybody have any
ideas about what's

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.786
left to make as an
assumption here?

00:46:34.786 --> 00:46:35.286
Yeah?

00:46:37.724 --> 00:46:39.890
AUDIENCE : I guess, if
Carol's the one who's opening

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:42.290
the boxes, she knows
where all the prizes are.

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:43.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:43.740
OK.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.240
So what assumption
should I make?

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:55.077
Yeah, that she picks a box at
random if she has a choice.

00:46:55.077 --> 00:46:57.160
All right, so we're going
to make that assumption.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:04.220
So that no matter
where the prize

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:19.740
is, if Carol has a
choice, she picks

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.614
each box with probability 1/2.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.430
Now, why is this
third one important?

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.115
Why might that really matter?

00:47:41.115 --> 00:47:43.490
Can anybody think of a reason
why that could be relevant?

00:47:46.358 --> 00:47:50.182
What if Carol had
some strategy in mind

00:47:50.182 --> 00:47:52.572
that the contestant knew about?

00:47:52.572 --> 00:47:54.896
Can you think of why
that might be useful.

00:47:54.896 --> 00:47:57.794
AUDIENCE : If the contestant
were able to produce

00:47:57.794 --> 00:48:00.853
information based off of that,
then there's a higher chance

00:48:00.853 --> 00:48:03.107
a contestant could figure
out which one to choose.

00:48:03.107 --> 00:48:04.073
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:04.073 --> 00:48:09.010
In fact, several years
ago, when I was lecturing,

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:11.770
I said, in fact it
could make a difference.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.220
That there is a way that
Carol can convey information

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.930
to the player by of two she's
choosing, which one to pick.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:20.150
Like, if she has a
choice of 2 or 3,

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.790
say she always
picks bigger one, 3.

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:24.920
Well, that might tell
you information about,

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.370
she didn't pick 2, so
maybe it has to have,

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:30.460
or she-- well, I don't know.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.970
In fact, that's
wrong, and it doesn't

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:35.239
matter in the case of 2
boxes, this assumption.

00:48:35.239 --> 00:48:37.030
We're going to make
it, because we're going

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:38.900
to do the analysis with it.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.640
But for three boxes, you can
show that it really doesn't

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.650
matter for this assumption.

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:45.820
But if you go to
four boxes, it does.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.510
And so in recitation
tomorrow, you're

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:50.250
going to consider the four
box version of this game.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:53.810
And if Carol has a strategy
that the player knows about,

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:57.480
you could improve the
player's chances of winning.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.730
But not for three, it turns out.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:02.690
In any case, when you're
setting up a problem,

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.940
you've got to set
up your assumptions.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.530
Otherwise, you
don't get anywhere.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.900
These are sort of like
axioms, same kind of thing.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.150
It's fine to make assumptions.

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.304
Just state what they are.

00:49:15.304 --> 00:49:17.470
Now, of course, you also
want them to be reasonable.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:23.800
All right.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.530
So maybe we're going to
go back now and figure out

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:31.100
how to get the
probabilities of the sample

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:34.690
points, or the outcomes,
for Monty Hall.

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.762
Let's go do that.

00:49:36.762 --> 00:49:38.886
And maybe I'll draw them
in a different color here.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.790
What I'm going to do
is label every edge

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:50.990
with a probability associated
with taking that step.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:55.260
So if the prize is placed in
each box with a probability

00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:00.400
of 1/3, that says this happens
with probability 1/3, that's

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.370
1/3, and that's 1/3.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.570
Same thing here.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.410
Assumption two says
that no matter where

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:14.820
the prize is, say it's in box
1, the player chooses each box

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.680
with a probably of 1/3.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.110
So given that the
prize is in box 1,

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:24.330
the player chooses 1 with
1/3, 2 with 1/3, 3 with 1/3.

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.120
Same if the prize is in box 2.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.120
So I label every edge
here with the probability.

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.800
All right.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.850
Now I go to this level.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:40.248
And I'm, at this node, I'm
in the state where prize

00:50:40.248 --> 00:50:43.960
is in box 1, player
selected box 1,

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.420
so Carol has a choice
of 2 or 3 to reveal.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:53.110
And she's going to reveal
each one with probability 1/2.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:55.250
So I label 1/2 on each
of these, because that's

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.980
what we've assumed.

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.370
What probability do I
put on this edge here?

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.570
Probability 1, because
there's no choice.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:07.020
Carol has to do it.

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.430
The same here.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:17.520
And I get 1/2, 1/2,
1, 1, 1, 1/2, 1/2.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.670
All right, so I've labeled
every edge with its probability.

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:24.380
Pretty simple, because
it was all assumed.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.196
Now I've got to get a
probability for each outcome.

00:51:27.196 --> 00:51:28.820
And we do that with
the following rule.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:49.680
The probability
of a sample point

00:51:49.680 --> 00:52:08.210
is the product of
the probabilities

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.250
on the path leading
to the outcome,

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:24.675
the path in the tree leading
to the outcome or the sample

00:52:24.675 --> 00:52:25.175
point.

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:32.970
OK.

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:38.080
So what this says is just
really, really simple.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.410
The probability of this sample
point is 1/3 times 1/3 times

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.620
1/2, 1/18.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:52.470
The probability of this sample
point is 1/3 times 1/3 times

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:55.489
1/2, 1/18.

00:52:55.489 --> 00:52:58.030
What's the probability of this
sample point going to be here?

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:01.130
1/9.

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:06.200
I've got 1/3 times 1/3 times,
well, this g was 1, is 1/9.

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:16.630
The next one here is 1/3
times 1/3 times 1, 1/9.

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:18.310
Same thing here.

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:22.720
1/3 times 1/3 times 1 is 1/9.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.920
Then I get 1/3 times
1/3 times 1/2 for 1/18.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.940
And I can keep on going.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.970
This would be 1/9.

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.400
This one has a 1, so it's a 1/9.

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:42.116
An 1/18 and 1/18.

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:45.660
OK.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.840
Now, that's the rule.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.900
And you'll always do this.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.680
You can sort of
see why it works.

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.170
You'll understand
after another week why,

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:55.740
for sure, why it works.

00:53:55.740 --> 00:54:00.080
But intuitively, you know,
to get to this outcome,

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.170
these are the choices
we had to make.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:04.820
First, the box
had to be-- sorry,

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.760
the prize had to be in box 1.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.220
There's a one-in-three
chance of that happening.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.190
Now, in those
one-out-of-three chances,

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:16.250
the chance the player
also picked box 1,

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:19.990
1/3 of the time of 1/3
of the time that happens.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.950
All right?

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:22.360
1/3 of the time, you're here.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:26.200
And of that, 1/3 of those
times, you get to here.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.094
That's 1/3 times 1/3, or 1/9.

00:54:28.094 --> 00:54:32.590
And then, 1/2 of those times,
Carol happen to reveal box 2.

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:35.260
That's 1/18.

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.760
So do you see why
that might make sense,

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.580
why you're multiplying these?

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.400
Because at every step, you
have a chance to diverge.

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.150
And the probability
you take the step

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:47.850
that we're following
here-- say, in this case,

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.670
it was 1/2-- that cuts down
the chance you land here

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:55.320
by that probability, 1/2.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.770
Any questions about that?

00:54:58.770 --> 00:54:59.270
All right.

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:00.686
For now, you can
take it on faith.

00:55:00.686 --> 00:55:04.159
We'll see why after we
do a few more of these

00:55:04.159 --> 00:55:05.200
over the next week or so.

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.280
Any questions there?

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.100
Is that OK?

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:12.600
OK.

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.487
Oh, yeah, all right?

00:55:14.487 --> 00:55:15.425
AUDIENCE : [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.880
PROFESSOR: On this one?

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.160
Only one choice.

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.061
So it happens with
probability 1.

00:55:27.067 --> 00:55:27.900
Any other questions?

00:55:31.459 --> 00:55:32.860
OK.

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:33.970
All right.

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:38.780
So now we can figure out
the probability of winning.

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:42.790
Well, the probability of
winning is we have 1/9, 1/9,

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:46.801
there's 3 of them,
4 of them, 5, 6.

00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:47.300
All right?

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:52.131
So the probability of
winning here is 6 times 1/9.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:18.730
Because you just sum up the
probabilities of the winning

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:20.240
sample points.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.310
There's six of winning.

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:23.230
They're each 1/9.

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:26.250
And that's 2/3.

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:26.750
OK?

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:29.110
So Marilyn was right.

00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:31.660
There's a 2/3 chance of
winning if you switch.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.900
And now, this is
a formal argument

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.630
that gives you that answer.

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:37.980
The nice thing is it works
for pretty much every problem

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.880
you ever think about.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.430
Now, in general,
if you want to know

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:44.050
the probability
of any event, you

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:45.540
can follow this same method.

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.180
Let me define what an event is.

00:56:53.085 --> 00:56:58.880
An event is simply a
subset of outcomes,

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.136
a subset of the sample space.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.530
For example, we could
define the event of losing.

00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:20.840
Let's call EL, E sub-L, to be
the event that player loses,

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:26.950
the player loses, with
the switch strategy.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.890
All right?

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:38.110
Now, to compute the
probability of an event,

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:44.110
we just add the probabilities
of the outcomes in that set.

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:47.445
So let's get that down.

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:19.577
All right, so formally,
the probability

00:58:19.577 --> 00:58:36.805
that an event occurs is simply
the sum, we'll call an event,

00:58:36.805 --> 00:58:39.590
e, let's say, event, e.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:41.380
It's a subset of
the sample space.

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.710
The probability that
e occurs is the sum

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:49.920
over the sample points in e of
the probability of those sample

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.650
points.

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:56.280
So for example, the
probability of the event, EL,

00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.850
where the player
loses, well, there's

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:03.129
six sample points
where the player loses,

00:59:03.129 --> 00:59:04.420
each with the probability 1/18.

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:12.040
So it's 1/3 is the probability
the player loses on the switch

00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.140
strategy.

00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:16.250
And that's not surprising
because you either win

00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.880
or you lose.

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.970
The probabilities
have to add to 1.

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:22.820
So if won with probability 2/3,
you lose with probability 1/3.

00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:27.690
OK?

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:28.190
All right.

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:31.860
So Marilyn was right,
much better to switch.

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:34.810
We'll do a bunch more examples
with Monty Hall tomorrow.

00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:39.630
Are there any other questions
on Monty Hall before I change

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:40.590
gears?

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:42.572
Yeah?

00:59:42.572 --> 00:59:44.480
AUDIENCE: So you showed
that when you switch,

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.705
you are more likely
to win than to lose.

00:59:47.705 --> 00:59:49.580
But you didn't show that
that's not also true

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.020
when you don't switch.

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.409
PROFESSOR: Ah good question.

00:59:52.409 --> 00:59:54.450
What happens if you're
playing the stay strategy.

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:03.060
Right, maybe you win 2/3
of the time when you stay.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.190
Maybe.

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.590
Maybe not.

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:06.090
Right?

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:12.994
Because if I win
when I switch, what

01:00:12.994 --> 01:00:14.410
would have happened
if I'd stayed?

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.570
I'd have lost.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:21.080
Because if I win
when I switch, it

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.380
means the prize is over there.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.990
So if I stay, I'm going to lose.

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.680
Which means that if I
do the stay strategy,

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.220
I'm going to lose
2/3 of the time.

01:00:31.744 --> 01:00:32.410
So you're right.

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:33.750
I didn't cover that.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:34.420
But we can.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.160
It's not too hard in this
case because the probability

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.540
of winning on a switch
equals the probability

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:42.490
of losing on a stick.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:52.280
So the probability that
you win with switch

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:58.720
equals the probability you
lose with a stick strategy.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.080
All right?

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.080
And they're both 2/3,
because they're the same

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.950
and this is 2/3.

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:09.530
So in fact, what's,
then, the chance

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:10.780
you win with a stick strategy?

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:14.952
1/3.

01:01:14.952 --> 01:01:17.410
And that's sort of you know,
where Marilyn was coming from.

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:19.677
Because she said, well,
if you pick the box right

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:21.260
the first time, which
is what you need

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.870
to get to win with
a stick strategy,

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:26.810
the chance you pick the
right box is one-in-three.

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:29.060
And showing, you know, a
goat over here didn't matter.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:32.200
It's still one-in-three.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.330
Now that's gets a--
that's intuition,

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:38.260
but it can get you
trouble, because say

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.450
you picked this box and Carol
showed you both of these boxes,

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:43.519
and they had pocket protectors.

01:01:43.519 --> 01:01:45.310
Then what do you know
about the probability

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:47.750
you won with a stick?

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:48.710
It's 1.

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.900
Ooh, so things did change there.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:51.400
All right?

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.375
So you have to be a little
careful about how you reason,

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:55.740
OK?

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:58.300
You've got to do this.

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:03.630
Stay with that and you'll always
be fine for your strategy.

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:07.160
So really the key is to
resist the temptation

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.224
to just sort of use your
intuition to think about it.

01:02:12.224 --> 01:02:12.890
All right.

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:14.880
Now, this is a pretty
simple example.

01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:19.270
So now I'm going
to do one that's

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:24.200
a little more interesting and a
little more devious in a sense.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.540
So I need a volunteer.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.610
We're going to do
a gambling game.

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.700
So I need a volunteer.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.570
All right.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:32.330
Now, he's raised his
hands before I even

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:34.690
said what the criteria are.

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:37.065
First, you gotta be confident
you understand probability.

01:02:40.554 --> 01:02:41.470
Well, you can fake it.

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:43.170
But second, and more
importantly, you've

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:46.200
got to have some money in
your product or you've got

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.560
to borrow some on the way down.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.185
You got a few bucks there?

01:02:50.185 --> 01:02:50.769
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:02:50.769 --> 01:02:52.226
PROFESSOR: All
right, come on down.

01:02:52.226 --> 01:02:54.115
That's really all that
matters, you know.

01:03:03.735 --> 01:03:08.370
OK, now, in this game,
there's three dice.

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:10.700
Well, that's 'cause
you're smart.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.610
OK, so let me show you
the dice in this game.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.935
And these, of course,
are not normal dice.

01:03:38.071 --> 01:03:38.570
All right?

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:43.980
So dice A has a 2, a
6, and a 7, and they're

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.390
the same on the reverse side.

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:47.630
So it's a six-sided
die, and it's fair.

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:49.990
When you roll it,
the probability A

01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:51.970
comes up 2 is going to be 1/3.

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:52.490
All right?

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:55.640
Same for 6 and for 7.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.850
Ah, we're just getting started.

01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:07.552
Dice B has a 1, 5, and a 9 and
dice C has a 3, 4, and an 8.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.260
So I got-- they're
all different numbers,

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.760
the numbers from 1 to 9.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.190
So just so we're really
clear, the probability

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:20.100
that A comes up 3 is 1/3.

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:28.394
The same for the probability
A comes up 6 is 1/3 and so on.

01:04:28.394 --> 01:04:30.405
Ah, yes I do mean 2.

01:04:30.405 --> 01:04:31.110
Good.

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:31.955
All right, good, you're
paying attention.

01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:32.480
That's good.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.021
There's some hope.

01:04:35.021 --> 01:04:35.520
All right?

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.990
Now, here's the game.

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:38.610
We're each going to pick a die.

01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:40.760
And we're going to roll our die.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.890
And the higher die wins.

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:43.140
We're going to roll them once.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.600
The higher one wins.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.420
And the loser pays
the winner $1.

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.560
And no tears, OK?

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.250
You got that?

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:51.750
That's good.

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:53.916
He's already trying to
figure out which one to pick.

01:04:53.916 --> 01:04:57.290
So let's put your
dollar on the table.

01:04:57.290 --> 01:04:59.064
Here we go.

01:04:59.064 --> 01:04:59.980
AUDIENCE: I have a $5.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.260
Do you have change?

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.460
PROFESSOR: I might have change.

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.150
All right.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.630
Let's see here.

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:07.750
Yes, I do have change.

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:08.150
AUDIENCE: Oh, I
do have a dollar.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:09.358
PROFESSOR: You have a dollar.

01:05:09.358 --> 01:05:09.962
All right.

01:05:09.962 --> 01:05:11.020
Well, for now anyway.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:14.707
Let's put the dollar
there on the table.

01:05:14.707 --> 01:05:16.290
AUDIENCE: It's going
to be a $20 next.

01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:18.165
PROFESSOR: We're just
getting warmed up here.

01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:20.207
OK, now, there is-- what's
your name, by the way?

01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:20.831
AUDIENCE: Will.

01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:21.660
PROFESSOR: Will.

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.890
OK, nice to meet you, Will.

01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:24.790
There we go.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:25.290
All right.

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:27.830
Now, there is one problem here.

01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:30.595
I don't really have those dice.

01:05:30.595 --> 01:05:32.720
So we're going to have to
do a mathematical version

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.529
of this bet.

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:35.320
AUDIENCE: You're always
going to win, then.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.590
PROFESSOR: So what
we're going to do

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:40.710
is pretend that we did
a roll, head-to-head,

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:43.770
and whichever one is
more likely to win,

01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:47.460
we're going to assume the roll
came out that way, all right?

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.330
Now, I know you've been
studying those three guys there,

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:53.070
those three dice.

01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:56.620
I'm going to be fair and let you
pick first which one you like.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:00.910
Now, as you look at
this, you know, you guys

01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:04.140
can help him out here if you
can figure out which one's best.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.540
This has got a couple
good sized numbers.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.610
You know, two of
these beat these.

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:11.600
This has the biggest number,
but it also has the smallest.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.960
This has two small guys in it.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.427
You now and you want to pick
the one that's likely to--

01:06:17.427 --> 01:06:19.260
AUDIENCE: They all add
up to the same thing.

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.920
PROFESSOR: They do all add up
to the same thing, that's true.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.420
Yeah.

01:06:25.054 --> 01:06:25.970
Which one do you want?

01:06:38.606 --> 01:06:40.070
Which one do you want here Will?

01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:43.654
What's your best one there?

01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:49.418
A does look pretty good.

01:06:49.418 --> 01:06:52.286
You've got two
solid numbers there.

01:06:52.286 --> 01:06:53.242
It does.

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:57.560
A looks like it beats
up on C pretty good.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.060
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.554
I think I'm going
to lose a dollar.

01:07:00.554 --> 01:07:02.045
PROFESSOR: That's probably true.

01:07:02.045 --> 01:07:03.533
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:05.524
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

01:07:14.967 --> 01:07:15.509
I don't know.

01:07:15.509 --> 01:07:16.591
A looks pretty good to us.

01:07:16.591 --> 01:07:17.773
Which one do you like here?

01:07:17.773 --> 01:07:19.192
We'll try them out.

01:07:19.192 --> 01:07:21.560
We'll play more games here.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:29.134
A. All right, Will
likes A. All right.

01:07:29.134 --> 01:07:32.169
And I'm going to
pick-- I'm going

01:07:32.169 --> 01:07:34.710
to go with C. I'm going to give
you a fighting chance, right?

01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:37.190
Because we figured A
beat C for sure, right?

01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:39.450
Because you've got a couple
of 6 and 7 beat up 3 and 4

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:41.050
pretty good.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:44.597
Yeah, I'm going to
pick C. All right.

01:07:44.597 --> 01:07:46.430
And now we're going to
do-- figure out which

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:49.050
one's more likely to win.

01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:51.411
And we're going to
make the tree diagram.

01:07:51.411 --> 01:07:51.910
All right?

01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:58.265
So here's A. You've got 2,
6, and 7 are your choices.

01:07:58.265 --> 01:07:59.140
And they're each 1/3.

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:05.311
And then, for mine,
I've got 3, 4, and 8.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.590
3, 4, and 8.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.130
3, 4, and 8.

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:16.475
And they're all 1/3 chance.

01:08:19.925 --> 01:08:23.430
All right, so I
make my tree here.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:28.495
I got squished at the
bottom, but they're all 1/3.

01:08:28.495 --> 01:08:30.939
All right, now we're
going to see who wins,

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:34.640
C or A. There's nine outcomes.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.034
Who wins this outcome?

01:08:38.034 --> 01:08:38.740
Oh, I do.

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.584
Yeah, I get all these.

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:41.380
That's good.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.600
You're in trouble already.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.957
What happens here, though?

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:44.540
Who wins that?

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:50.010
Your 6 beats 3, 6 beats 4.

01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:51.240
You win those.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.609
I got you here.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:56.210
Then you win 7 beats 3.

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.350
A wins.

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:59.149
7 beats 4, A wins.

01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:01.370
It's tied, but, oh,
my 8 beat your 7.

01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:04.609
All right.

01:09:04.609 --> 01:09:07.939
So let's see here.

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:14.000
There's one, two, three, four,
five for me, each at 1/9.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.583
All right, so I'm going to win.

01:09:18.583 --> 01:09:20.180
All right?

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:24.510
Now, in this case, the
sample space is uniform.

01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:27.140
Every probability is the
same for the outcomes.

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.950
They're all 1/9.

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:29.700
1/3 times 1/3.

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.240
1/3 times 1/3.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:31.740
All right?

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:36.090
So that's the case where we say
the sample space is uniform.

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:36.960
Don't go anywhere.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.160
We're going to do
some more here.

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:53.689
The sample space is uniform
if every sample point

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:54.730
has the same probability.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.350
In which case, the probability
of the sample points

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:08.760
would be 1 in the cardinality
of the sample space.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.320
In this case,
there's nine points.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.270
They each have probability 1/9.

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:21.190
And in this case, C beats
A with probability of 5/9.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:27.070
That means I win the dollar.

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:29.058
All right.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:32.274
So do you have some
more money in there?

01:10:32.274 --> 01:10:33.300
In that wallet?

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.170
I'll make change for you.

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:38.220
So, what we're going
to do is play again.

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.910
And you've learned something
now, that C beats A.

01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:42.750
So we play again,
you're probably

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:46.070
not going to want
to pick A. In fact,

01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:49.050
C is surprisingly good there.

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:50.550
Now, I'll let you
wager more, if you

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:51.800
want, to win your dollar back.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.845
Do you want to do
double or nothing?

01:10:53.845 --> 01:10:55.745
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:59.335 --> 01:11:02.184
AUDIENCE: So you always
get to pick second, though?

01:11:02.184 --> 01:11:02.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:11:02.850 --> 01:11:04.092
I've got to be fair here.

01:11:04.092 --> 01:11:05.425
I'm going to let you pick first.

01:11:05.425 --> 01:11:07.470
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:09.866
All right, you got
a couple bucks?

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:10.990
We'll do double or nothing.

01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.656
What do you say?

01:11:11.656 --> 01:11:13.270
I'll make change for you.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:14.690
There you go.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:15.565
Here's $5.

01:11:15.565 --> 01:11:17.220
I'll change your $5.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.270
And then we'll bet $2.

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.390
How's that?

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:23.166
I've actually got
a $2 bill here.

01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:23.780
There we go.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.440
You've got $2.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.640
There we go.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.560
All right, double or nothing.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.924
Will, what do you like?

01:11:29.924 --> 01:11:31.340
You're obviously
not going to pick

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:34.245
A. That just got beat by C.
What do you like, B or C?

01:11:42.724 --> 01:11:44.801
Well, one of them's
got to be best.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:46.217
One of them's got
to be best here.

01:11:46.217 --> 01:11:48.712
You've just got to figure
out which one it is.

01:11:48.712 --> 01:11:51.970
AUDIENCE: I feel like everyone's
going to have [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:54.500
If I choose C, let me see.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.610
That would be
[INAUDIBLE] so I guess.

01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.604
PROFESSOR: I won't pick
A, that's for sure.

01:12:00.604 --> 01:12:02.354
AUDIENCE: If you pick
B, I get one from 4,

01:12:02.354 --> 01:12:03.854
I get two from the
8, which is four.

01:12:03.854 --> 01:12:05.318
And you get the other five.

01:12:05.318 --> 01:12:09.270
If I pick C and you pick A,
that means I get one from the 3,

01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:11.246
I get one from the 4.

01:12:11.246 --> 01:12:14.704
If I get two from the
8, you still get 5.

01:12:14.704 --> 01:12:16.186
PROFESSOR: That's good.

01:12:16.186 --> 01:12:19.644
You've figured out
you're screwed here.

01:12:19.644 --> 01:12:20.650
That's very good.

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:21.980
All right.

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.120
So, yeah, so he's sort
of-- he's doing great.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.245
He's figured out, because
he went through this sort

01:12:26.245 --> 01:12:28.800
of like this method, what all
the possible outcomes were.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.680
And he's discovered that,
no matter what he picks,

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.830
I'm going to beat him.

01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:35.340
So let's see why
that's the case.

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.440
So let's see.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.130
So because you figured it
out, I won't take your money

01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:39.990
this time.

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:41.770
But we'll do some
more in a minute.

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:46.900
So say Will picked--
say he picked C.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:52.000
And say that then I
will pick B. All right,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.220
so on C, there's three choices.

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:55.830
3.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.480
4, and 8.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.775
And then, on my choice of
B, there's 1, 5, and 9.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.120
All right, so I get 1, 5, and 9.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.070
And now we can
see who wins here.

01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:17.810
Well, C wins there,
loses here, loses there.

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:22.370
C wins here, and B
wins the next two.

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:24.000
And C wins these.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.650
And B wins the tiebreaker.

01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:30.280
So B beats C with
probability 5/9.

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:38.920
All right.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.650
So you don't want to pick
A, you don't want to pick C,

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:45.094
you want to try a bet with B?

01:13:48.363 --> 01:13:52.840
I mean, look, you've got B
beats C. We just showed that.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.847
C beats A. I mean, that's a
sure bet if I ever saw one.

01:13:57.847 --> 01:13:59.284
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:59.284 --> 01:14:01.200
PROFESSOR: What do you think?

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:06.268
AUDIENCE: So if I pick B and you
pick C, that means [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:12.172
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

01:14:12.172 --> 01:14:22.012
But if he picks A, then
I get [INAUDIBLE] Yeah,

01:14:22.012 --> 01:14:24.010
I'd still get 4, so--

01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:26.752
PROFESSOR: So if you pick
B, what am I going to do?

01:14:26.752 --> 01:14:28.499
AUDIENCE: Oh, you're
going to pick A.

01:14:28.499 --> 01:14:31.040
PROFESSOR: I'm going to pick A.
Let's see how that works out.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.850
All right, so B has 1, 5, and 9.

01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:40.685
A is, yeah, 2, 6, and 7.

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:50.670
OK, so you're going to
lose all three there.

01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:53.320
A wins those.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.950
A wins-- no, you win.

01:14:56.950 --> 01:15:00.967
B wins there, but A
wins the next couple.

01:15:00.967 --> 01:15:02.341
And then, you win
the last three.

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:13.090
So A wins, again,
5/9 of the time.

01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.880
So how is this possible?

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:26.040
We've got A beats B,
beats C, beats A. All 5/9.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.885
How is that possible?

01:15:27.885 --> 01:15:29.250
Did we make a mistake?

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.610
Well, why isn't it possible?

01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:40.050
Whoever said probabilities
were transitive?

01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:40.912
Right?

01:15:40.912 --> 01:15:42.370
I mean, you'd sort
of think there's

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:44.260
a best of the three die.

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.220
But for any one that
you pick, that he picks,

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.428
I can find one that's better.

01:15:47.428 --> 01:15:49.630
And it goes in a cycle.

01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:50.130
All right?

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:52.820
So you'd think picking
first, you've got a shot

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:53.780
to pick the best one.

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.890
But picking second
always wins this game,

01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:59.411
if you pick the right one.

01:15:59.411 --> 01:15:59.910
All right.

01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:02.280
You know, since you did
good and figured that out,

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.850
I'm going to give you a
special opportunity here.

01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:06.350
All right?

01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:11.540
Now, I'm going to
let you go second.

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.030
All right?

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:15.740
So I'm going to
pick one, and I'm

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.360
going to let you pick after me.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.480
And then we're going to bet.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.812
There's going to be
a little twist to it.

01:16:22.812 --> 01:16:24.270
But you want to
pick second, right?

01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:30.485
All right, well, let me tell
you what I'm going to do.

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:32.030
Just to make it-- I want
to do a different analysis.

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:34.155
We already did these three,
so what I'm going to do

01:16:34.155 --> 01:16:37.289
is an analysis where
we roll them twice.

01:16:37.289 --> 01:16:38.830
Otherwise, it's the
same basic thing,

01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:41.510
but I want to do an analysis
with more outcomes here.

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:43.310
We've sort of beat
this one to death.

01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:45.210
So I'm going to go first.

01:16:45.210 --> 01:16:52.860
And let's see, what
do I want to pick?

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:54.520
Hm.

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.720
Well, what should I pick,
if I'm going to do this?

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.330
I guess I'll pick B, all right?

01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:03.190
So I'm going to pick B here.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:07.440
All right.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:07.970
How much do you
want to bet here?

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:09.678
I'm going to let you
win your money back.

01:17:09.678 --> 01:17:11.630
I'll let you bet up to $10.

01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:12.245
Your choice.

01:17:15.179 --> 01:17:16.970
What do you-- what do
you want to bet here?

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:18.280
We've got to put some
money on the table,

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.488
make it a little interesting.

01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:23.314
Yeah, you pick--

01:17:23.314 --> 01:17:25.230
AUDIENCE: Do you roll a
different die or what?

01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:26.438
PROFESSOR: No, the same ones.

01:17:26.438 --> 01:17:27.680
The die don't change.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.220
I'm picking B. And I'm going
to roll it a couple times.

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.700
And I'm going to
add up my score.

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.700
And then, you get to pick
whatever die you want.

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:35.783
I'm going to let you pick.

01:17:35.783 --> 01:17:39.770
I mean, I'm going to let you
pick the one that beats it.

01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:41.620
You roll yours a couple times.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.310
And now we see which
one has the higher

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.393
sum, who's more likely to win.

01:17:45.393 --> 01:17:47.726
AUDIENCE: So it's the sum
total, like you roll a 9 and 9

01:17:47.726 --> 01:17:48.777
and I roll a 7 and 7.

01:17:48.777 --> 01:17:51.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah, then I'm
going to win, because I get 18

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:52.090
and you got 14.

01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:54.270
If I roll a 9 and
a 1, I get a 10.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:56.884
You roll a 6 and a
7, you beat me at 13.

01:17:56.884 --> 01:17:58.360
All right?

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.490
So which one do
you want to pick?

01:18:02.490 --> 01:18:05.740
You could pick C. But you've got
to put the money on the table

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:08.739
here, whatever you want to bet.

01:18:08.739 --> 01:18:11.280
You know, I want to give you a
chance to win your money back.

01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:18.032
What's the probability
he's going to lose?

01:18:18.032 --> 01:18:19.514
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:19.514 --> 01:18:20.449
You got a T-Card?

01:18:20.449 --> 01:18:21.490
What've you got in there?

01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:23.512
Ah, I'll take the
[INAUDIBLE] card.

01:18:23.512 --> 01:18:24.985
What's that worth?

01:18:24.985 --> 01:18:27.931
Ah, it's worth a few bucks here.

01:18:27.931 --> 01:18:33.390
All right, so I'm picking
B. Which are you picking?

01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:40.304
I've really got his
head messed up now.

01:18:40.304 --> 01:18:41.720
AUDIENCE: There's
$4 on the table.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.690
Take that and run.

01:18:43.690 --> 01:18:44.690
PROFESSOR: Yeah, really.

01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:46.570
We already saw-- I'll
give you a hint here.

01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:50.860
A beats B. 5/9 of the time,
A comes up higher than B.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:54.030
So if we roll them
twice, your odds

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:59.420
got even better that
A beats B. All right,

01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:03.850
so Will goes with A. Will,
that was a big mistake.

01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:05.020
All right.

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.020
How can it be a mistake?

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:09.220
A beats B 5/9 of the time.

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:12.220
Now what we're going to do
is make the decision tree.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:15.351
If we roll B twice,
if we roll A twice.

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:15.850
All right.

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:17.530
Let's see what happens.

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:19.090
This is a nasty
one to write down.

01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:20.840
In fact, you'll start
seeing this when you

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.100
do these tree method things.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.725
Sometimes the trees
get a little hairy,

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:27.520
so we've got to sort of
approximate it a little bit.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.140
So here's B, right?

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:33.950
I got 1, 5, and 9
for my first roll.

01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:36.430
And then I got 1, 5, and
9 for my second roll.

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.590
And I add these up.

01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:47.990
See, if you read the notes
ahead, sometimes that helps.

01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:49.495
6-- here are my outcomes.

01:19:49.495 --> 01:19:51.120
These are the numbers
I'm going to get.

01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:57.000
These are my nine values.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.360
Your nine values,
you got 2, 6, and 7.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.170
Then each 2, 6, and 7 again.

01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:15.165
So we add those up, you got 4,
8, 9, 8, 12, 13, 9, 13, and 14.

01:20:15.165 --> 01:20:17.290
And now, we have
each one of these

01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:19.130
against each one of these.

01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:20.830
Because there's 81 outcomes.

01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:22.230
I got four levels to the tree.

01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:25.370
And rather than draw four
levels of this [INAUDIBLE] tree

01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:27.250
to get 81 outcomes,
you're going to say

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:30.280
that each one of
these corresponds

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:34.330
to this tree, all right,
that has nine leaves.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:40.205
And now we can just count
up how many times I win.

01:20:40.205 --> 01:20:41.630
Well, 2 got nothing.

01:20:41.630 --> 01:20:44.270
That's a 0.

01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:46.120
Let's see how many times 6 wins.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:50.064
One-- one time.

01:20:50.064 --> 01:20:53.210
10-- one, two,
three, four, five.

01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:57.050
All right, we've got that.

01:20:57.050 --> 01:21:01.260
6 wins, we already
decided, once.

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:06.630
10, we decided already,
wins five times.

01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:09.612
14 wins one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

01:21:09.612 --> 01:21:12.290
eight, and ties once.

01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:15.390
Tie-- one.

01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:18.550
10, we already got was five.

01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:23.260
14, we already got,
was eight and a tie.

01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:28.000
And finally, I get
18 wins every time.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:28.780
Let's add this up.

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:36.210
I got 17, 22, 30,
35, 36, 41, 42 times

01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:42.370
plus half the ties out of 81.

01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:44.120
How much money's on
this [INAUDIBLE] card?

01:21:49.224 --> 01:21:50.440
Ah, smart guy.

01:21:53.919 --> 01:21:55.410
How did this happen?

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:58.550
A is more likely to
beat B, higher than B.

01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:00.160
But you roll them
twice, and it's

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.770
less likely to be
as large on the sum?

01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:05.020
Well, why not?

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.760
It's just our intuition's
all screwed up.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.160
But the math is straightforward.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.410
In fact, an amazing
thing happens.

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:17.710
If you roll them twice,
they reverse completely.

01:22:17.710 --> 01:22:22.590
A is worse than B, is worse
than C, is worse than A

01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:24.150
if you roll them twice.

01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:27.570
If you roll them three times,
something else happens.

01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:29.540
In fact, it was known
for a long time,

01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:31.665
this phenomenon
happens with one roll.

01:22:31.665 --> 01:22:34.070
And when I was making lecture
notes a few years ago,

01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:35.869
I noticed they reverse
with two rolls.

01:22:35.869 --> 01:22:37.660
And then we did a class
project to discover

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.830
what happens with k rolls.

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:44.034
And it turns out that you can
get every possible combination.

01:22:44.034 --> 01:22:45.450
You know, on some
number of rolls,

01:22:45.450 --> 01:22:50.230
A beats both B and C and B
beats C. Other number of rolls,

01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:53.010
A beats them both and C beats B.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:55.600
And then, motivated by
that, some researchers

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:59.330
out in San Diego showed
that there's arbitrarily

01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:03.600
strange dice, now, not
with just three sides,

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.830
but with more sides.

01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:09.025
Such that, for any tournaments--
remember a tournament

01:23:09.025 --> 01:23:11.410
from graph theory,
where everybody beats,

01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:14.580
you know, between a pair of
players, one player wins.

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:18.130
You can make the relation
for any tournament

01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:20.110
show up for a
particular set of dice

01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:22.489
by rolling a certain
number of times.

01:23:22.489 --> 01:23:24.280
All right, which is
just really fascinating

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.280
that you can prove that.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.660
So these dice can
get arbitrarily weird

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:30.900
in terms of which die is
likely to come up and be

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:32.989
better than another die.

01:23:32.989 --> 01:23:34.280
All right, that's it for today.

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.430
Let me give you your
money back here.

01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:37.055
And I've got a gift
certificate you can

01:23:37.055 --> 01:23:40.170
have for being a good sport.

01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:40.670
Here you go.

01:23:40.670 --> 01:23:42.160
How much money did I take here?

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.697
AUDIENCE: I think only like $2.

01:23:43.697 --> 01:23:44.280
PROFESSOR: $2?

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.620
All right, there you go.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.270
Very good.

01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.770
Thanks.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.140
So we'll do a lot more examples
over the next week or two.
