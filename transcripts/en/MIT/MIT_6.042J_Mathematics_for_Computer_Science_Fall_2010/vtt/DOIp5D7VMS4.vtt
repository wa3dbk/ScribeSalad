00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.680
PROFESSOR: So today
we're going to continue

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.960
our course on the graph theory.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.110
It's going to be a mixture
of all kinds of topics.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.729
We first start off
with Euler tour,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.810
and then we get
into directed graphs

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.500
and cover the definitions.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.850
And we'll talk about
a special type, which

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.030
are called tournament graphs.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.040
And we'll do a whole
bunch of proofs,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.220
and hopefully you will all
contribute to make this work

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.750
and think about how to do this.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.110
So next week we will
continue with graph theory,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.940
and we will discuss
a very special type.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.970
We will use directed graphs
in communication networks.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.070
And on Thursday, we'll actually
use these special types

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.330
of graphs that we'll talk
about in a moment, DAGs.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.250
So let's talk about Euler tour.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.280
Euler, a famous mathematician,
he asked the question

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.865
like-- he lived in Konigsberg.

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:26.180
And there were seven bridges.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.940
He was wondering, can you
traverse all the bridges

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.810
exactly once.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.980
So he would start walking and
try to cross all those bridges.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.310
And apparently this little
islands in sort of the river

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.620
as well, and so on.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.980
So how can you do that?

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.390
This is actually the
birth of graph theory.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.030
And this particular
problem is named after him.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.570
So what is an Euler tour?

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.920
It's actually defined
as a special walk.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.270
It's a walk that traverses
every edge exactly once.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.640
So it turns out the you
can actually characterize

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.210
these types of graphs.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.330
So we are talking here
about undirected graph,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.990
so continuation of last time.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.690
So the edges that we
consider have no direction.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.840
We'll come back to
that in a moment.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.210
We will start
defining those later.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.220
So Euler tour is a walk that
traverses every edge exactly

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.240
once.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.840
And at the same time,
it's also a tour.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.700
So that means that it
actually starts and finishes

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.980
at the same vertex.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.485
Now it turns out that
undirected graphs,

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:16.530
the graphs that we've
been talking about,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.680
those that Euler tours can
be easily characterized.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.460
And that's the theorem that
we're going to prove next.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.390
The theorem states
that actually,

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:42.590
if a connected graph
has an Euler tour,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:53.140
if and only if, every vertex
of the graph has even degree.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.730
So that's a very nice and
simple and straightforward

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.560
characterization.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.202
So how can we prove this?

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.070
So let's have a look.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.140
So first of all, we have an
if and only if statement.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.930
So we need to prove
two directions.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.200
We need to proof that if I
have a connected graph that

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.550
has an Euler tour, I need to
show that every vertex has

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.470
even degree.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.000
And also the reverse-- if I have
a graph for which every vertex

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.080
has even degree, I need to
show that it has an Euler tour.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.590
So the proof consists
of two parts.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.430
So let's first do
this implication,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.280
where we assure that
we have connected

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.660
graph that has an Euler tour.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.030
So assume we have a graph.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.370
So we have G with the
vertex at V, edge is at E,

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.810
and it has an Euler tour.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.730
So what does it mean?

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.810
Well, it's really
means that we can walk

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.960
from some start vertex, V0.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.440
We can go all the way around to
V1, and some more, and so on,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.170
to V, say, k minus 1.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.510
And then end vertex is the
same as the start vertex.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.060
So we have a walk that goes
all around the whole graph.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.770
So every edge in this
walk are exactly the edges

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.740
that are in the graph.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.700
And each edge in the graph
is offered exactly once.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.200
So what does it mean?

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.240
So let's write
this down actually.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:57.720
So since every edge is
traversed once-- every edge in E

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.020
is traversed once-- what
can we conclude from that?

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:11.980
Can we say something about,
given such as walk of length k,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.560
what can we say about the
number of edges, for example?

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.777
What can we say about the
degree of the vertices?

00:06:19.777 --> 00:06:21.610
Because that's what you
want to show, right?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.270
You want to show that every
vertex has even degree.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.690
Does anyone know how
to go ahead here?

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.670
So we know that every
single edge in E

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.097
is referred ones
within this whole walk.

00:06:34.097 --> 00:06:35.805
So what kind of
properties can we derive?

00:06:41.998 --> 00:06:44.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.291
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:47.166
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:54.152
PROFESSOR: Maybe someone
else can pick up here.

00:06:54.152 --> 00:06:59.467
So every vertex that I
have here, I will enter it.

00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:00.300
But I also leave it.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.760
So if I see a vertex
in here, I can

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.120
see at least two
contributing edges

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.235
that are coming from this.

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:12.360
AUDIENCE: Then you know
that that note has at least

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.440
degree 2, but it
can't be more than 2

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.147
because otherwise that
would be the endpoint.

00:07:17.147 --> 00:07:17.730
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:23.010
But is it true though
that-- so for example,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.120
this particular note here may
repeat itself somewhere else.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.830
I only have a condition
on the Euler tour

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.340
that every edge
occurs exactly ones.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.062
So how could I formally
sort of continue to prove?

00:07:37.062 --> 00:07:39.020
AUDIENCE: Well, it will
intersect itself again,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.360
and you'll leave again
and it will still

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.394
have the even number.

00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:43.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.770
That's true.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.410
That's right.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.895
Any other additions?

00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:48.875
AUDIENCE: You can define
the number of edges

00:07:48.875 --> 00:07:50.855
that it will test by
how many you enter it,

00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:52.835
so the number of
edges that it has

00:07:52.835 --> 00:07:56.129
is twice the number
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:56.795
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:07:56.795 --> 00:08:00.260
That's correct. [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:06.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] traverse
once, then every time you enter

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.685
a node you have to leave it.

00:08:07.685 --> 00:08:09.912
So you can say that
you're never going

00:08:09.912 --> 00:08:18.410
to leave a node for a node that
it already left for from there.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.410
And you're never going to enter
from a node you already entered

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.743
from or left to from there.

00:08:22.743 --> 00:08:24.742
So that's how you can say
that you're only going

00:08:24.742 --> 00:08:28.412
to increment your degree by 2.

00:08:28.412 --> 00:08:29.370
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.790
So what he's
essentially saying is

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.419
that every edge as
I start to count

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.299
here, in this particular tour,
well they're all different.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.179
So they all counts towards
a degree of the node.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:43.590
So everything that you have
been saying is right on.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:48.560
What we can conclude here is
that if you look at a vertex,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:09:00.230
say vertex U-- for example,
somewhere over here-- well,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.240
it may repeat itself over here.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.990
And it has an incoming and
outgoing edge, incoming

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.140
and outgoing edge.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.780
And I may have it
somewhere else,

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.040
but say it's just at those two.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.570
Well, I know that all
the edges are different.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.220
So I can clearly count this now.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.290
I can say that the
degree of U must

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:27.020
be equal to the number
of times that U actually

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.900
appears in this tour.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.540
So in the tour from V0
all the way to Vk minus 1.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.447
And then I have to
multiply times 2.

00:09:45.447 --> 00:09:47.780
And what I said, it's exactly
what you have been saying,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.640
all the edges occur exactly
once of the whole graph.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.470
So I just count the number
of times I see U in here.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.620
I come the number of edges that
go into it and leave from it.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.860
Well, that's twice times
the number of times

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.060
that U actually
appears in this tour.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.560
So this implication is
pretty straightforward

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.630
because now we actually note
that the degree of U is even.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.130
So that's great.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.390
So let's talk about
the other implication

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.490
and see whether we can find
a trick to make that happen.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.150
So what do we need
to start off with?

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.020
Well, now we have to assume that
every vertex has even degree.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.010
So let's write this down.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.210
So say we have the graph.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:40.010
And for this graph
we actually issue

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:45.805
that the degree of
every vertex V is even.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.780
Well, what can we do?

00:10:58.179 --> 00:10:59.720
Well, this is sort
of creative trick,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.970
so let me just continue here.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:07.870
So what we have is if you
start to consider a walk, W,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:15.830
that touches, say, a lot
of vertices in such a way

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.500
that W is actually
the longest walk.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.130
So that's often what
you do in graph theory.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.866
You think about, say,
the shortest path

00:11:25.866 --> 00:11:28.240
or whatever with a certain
property, or the longest walk,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.960
or whatever with a
certain property.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.760
So that's what
you're doing here.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.670
So let W be the longest walk.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.420
And well, we want to prove
something about an Euler tour.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.480
An Euler tour has a
very specific property

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.420
that all the edges
occur only once.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.220
So it makes sense
to look at walks

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:56.280
in which all the edges of
which it walks are unique,

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.980
are occurring only once.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:07.950
So we're interested in the
longest walk that traverses

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:15.930
no edge more than once.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.430
So that's important.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.510
Now, let's think about
this a little bit.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.230
So the first property that you
may want to consider it-- you

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.230
really want to show that W
is going to be an Euler tour.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.880
That's what we're going
to try to prove here.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.560
So the first thing
we may want to show

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.270
is that actually
it goes all around.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.090
So V0 is equal to Vk.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.540
That will be great
if we can do this.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.720
So we want to show
that this is true.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.645
So what would happen if
this would not be the case?

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.380
So suppose these two would
not be equal to one another.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.010
Well, actually, I'm skipping
a little bit ahead here

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.570
in the proof, I notice.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.380
So this will be the conclusion
of another observation.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.940
So let me start with
the first observation.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.820
So first of all, let us
consider this end node over

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.300
here, this end vertex, Vk.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:37.800
Now if there is an edge that
is not covered in this walk--

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.860
and I can lengthen
the walk, right?

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.080
So if I have, say,
another edge, which

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:51.730
looks like Vk, an edge
from Vk to some U, where

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:56.970
this edge is not in the walk.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.820
Or the other one
is not in the walk.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.450
Well, it doesn't matter in
an indirect graph, of course.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.630
So if this is not in the
walk, then what can I do?

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.140
I can just lengthen it, right?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.190
I can just say V0 goes
to V1 goes to Vk goes

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.590
to U. Now I have a longer walk.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.340
And that's a contradiction.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:31.660
So I know that all the edges
in which Vk is participating

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.910
are actually
covered by the walk.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.360
So that's a great property.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.930
So let's write this down.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:52.150
So all edges that
are incident to Vk

00:14:52.150 --> 00:15:00.370
are actually used--
traversed-- in the walk, W.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.950
So now let's have
a look whether we

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:08.710
can show that it's a walk
that goes all the way around.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.460
So let's try to
prove this statement.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.060
So let me repeat this over here.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:22.200
So what we want to show
is that Vk equals V0.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.260
So given this statement,
do you have any idea

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.210
how we could
possibly prove this,

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.170
also given what we have
been doing over here?

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.230
Suppose this would not
be the case, right?

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:42.240
So suppose the start and
the end node in this walk

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.970
are not equal to one another.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.180
So what can we do here?

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.500
So maybe there's
some suggestions?

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.560
I already had you once.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.430
Maybe someone else?

00:16:01.624 --> 00:16:05.060
AUDIENCE: It has to
attach to another vertex.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.460
And you know that all
the degrees are even.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:13.322
So it means that Vk
must attach to V0.

00:16:13.322 --> 00:16:15.280
PROFESSOR: So what you're
saying, first of all,

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.660
is that if this would
not be the case, then

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:26.006
you know that the
degrees must be even.

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:27.630
But suppose this
would not be the case.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:32.091
That would mean actually that
the degree would be odd, right?

00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:32.590
OK.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.600
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.380
So let's write this down.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:42.010
So otherwise the
Vk has odd degree.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.330
But the only node has odd
degree in this particular walk,

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.140
W. So that's what we do now.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:56.410
Because we really
consider this walk.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:07.260
So we see that if I have
V0 unequal to Vk and Vk

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.240
maybe repeated in this
walk a number of times,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.400
each time it is repeated
it has an incoming

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.390
and an outgoing edge.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.510
And all these edges are
different because they do not

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.790
occur more than once.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.680
So whenever Vk enters in
this middle part over here--

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.520
it's partaking over here--
it gives an even contribution

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.830
to the number of
edges in this walk,

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.050
and it has one extra
incoming edge over here.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:38.750
So if V0 is not
equal to Vk, we will

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:45.500
have an odd degree
of edges in W,

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.010
in which Vk is participating.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.500
So now we can go ahead and
we can have a look over here

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.100
because we just showed here that
all the edges incident to Vk

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.790
are actually used in W. So
we can now conclude that this

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.920
means that Vk also
has odd degree in G

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.540
because all the edges in G,
in which Vk is participating,

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.810
are actually used in the walk.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:12.920
So I hope that is clear.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.840
So let's write this down.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.070
So we'll use the first
statement over here, so by 1.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:32.410
We have that Vk has
odd degree in G.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.160
And now we come to
what you were saying.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.490
We have assumed over here
that the degree is even.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.000
So this cannot be the case,
so that's a contradiction.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.740
So we know that the otherwise
situation cannot occur.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.960
So we know that Vk
must be equal to V0.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.690
So that's proving
that we actually have

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.380
a walk that goes all around.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.710
Now, we are not yet done.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.790
Because why would
this be an Euler tour?

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.465
For an Euler tour,
we really want

00:19:02.465 --> 00:19:08.390
that every single
edge that G has

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.450
is actually used in the tour.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.850
So we need much more.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.608
So let's use this board.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:42.460
So suppose that W is
not an Euler tour.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.720
We're going to
use contradiction.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.630
But we already have shown
this particular property,

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.060
so we can use this.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.720
So suppose W is
not an Euler tour.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.710
Well, we know that
G is connected.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.020
So that's a good
thing because that

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.740
means that if it is
not an Euler tour,

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:12.050
there is an edge that is
not used in W, in the walk,

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:28.730
but it is incident to some
vertex that is used in W.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.510
So this is where the
connectivity here

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.800
comes in play.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.580
Now let us call
this edge-- so let

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.570
U-Vi be this particular edge.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:48.170
So U is not used in
the walk-- well, it's

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:52.130
maybe used in the walk, but the
edge is not used in the walk.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.350
And Vi is part of the walk.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.490
So what can we do here?

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.030
So does anybody see
what we could do here?

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.140
Can we somehow get
a contradiction?

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.760
So when we started
out here, we actually

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:12.480
assumed that W is the longest
walk in which the edges do not

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.270
occur more than once.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.660
Can we create a longer
walk by simply using this?

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:26.606
Now, notice that we did
prove that V0 goes all around

00:21:26.606 --> 00:21:30.410
to Vk, and so on.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.670
So can we find a longer walk
that uses this extra edge?

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.447
Any ideas?

00:21:40.447 --> 00:21:45.630
What would happen if we, for
example, started a walk with U?

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.610
Let's see how that
would work out.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:51.570
We can have U. We walk to Vi.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.720
Well, let's just simply
start walking all around.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.865
So essentially we have Vi
over here and U over here.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:08.620
So we could do is we can
start walking like this

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.290
and then end over here.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.310
And notice we have
used one extra edge.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.070
So we get a longer walk.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.940
So we go to Vi plus 1,
and we go all the way

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:23.230
up to Vk, which is equal to V0.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:27.870
And then we go up to V1,
all the way up to Vi.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:29.960
This is a longer walk.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.240
And therefore we
have a contradiction.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.600
And now the proof is
finished because that means

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.740
that this assumption was wrong.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.560
So W actually is an Euler tour.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.390
So now we have shown the
existence of an Euler tour,

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.390
and that was the other
direction of the theorem.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:56.130
So let's now start with a
new topic on directed graphs.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:01.140
And later on, we will talk
about how Hamiltonian paths.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.390
And these are
different from an Euler

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.990
tour in that in an Euler tour,
every edge is used exactly

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.490
once.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.270
In a Hamiltonian path, we
will have that every vertex

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.160
is used exactly once.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.100
So we'll do that a bit later.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.660
So what are directed graphs?

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.860
Directed graphs are
graphs where we have edges

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.410
that have a specific direction.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:29.030
So we can walk from one
vertex to the other.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.425
Let me just depict an example.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.420
For example, we could have
something that looks like this.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.960
We have V1.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.950
We have V2, V3.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.360
We may have an edge that
goes like this with an arrow.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.720
We use arrows in this case.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.710
I can go to V2 and V3.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:00.920
From V2 I may be able to go
to V3, and from V3 to V2.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.100
So this will be a directed
graph, as an example.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.640
We also call these digraphs.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.820
And as you can see, we may have
an edge that goes from V2 to V3

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.330
and also one that
goes from V3 to V2.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.690
So these are two separate edges.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.960
So every edge has a direction.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.140
And we usually say that
if we have an edge that

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:35.210
points from V2 to, say, V3,
then we call this the tail

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.530
and over here we have the head.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.600
So this is some notation
that you may use.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.520
We also have now
a different notion

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.420
for the degree of a vertex
because we have different types

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.260
of edges, essentially.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.330
Take, for example, V2.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.235
You have incoming edges
and outgoing edges.

00:24:56.235 --> 00:24:57.610
So that's why
we're going to talk

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:03.120
about an indegree
and an outdegree.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.210
So, for example, the indegree
of V2 is equal to, well, I

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.380
have one, two incoming edges.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:17.060
And the outdegree of V2 is
actually something different.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.790
It's just one outgoing edge.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.010
So this is equal to 1.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.560
So this is some notation.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.930
So let's talk about walks.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.850
Let's figure out
where we can enumerate

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:35.940
walks in a directed
graph and compute those.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.830
So how many walks
do I have, say,

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:43.180
of length k that go exactly
from, say, V1 to V3.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.290
How can I compute this?

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.840
So I'd like to introduce
adjacency matrices.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.540
You've probably
seen them before.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.510
But let's go over this once
more because induction is also

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.470
important.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.420
So let's do the theorem.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.110
So the theorem is this.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.260
Suppose we have a graph.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.495
And suppose it has end nodes.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:22.250
And we have the
vertices V1 up to Vn.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:33.650
And now we let the matrix that
contains the entries aij denote

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:46.860
the adjacency matrix for G.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.910
And what does it mean?

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.550
It's actually means
that in this case,

00:26:52.550 --> 00:27:01.360
we say that aij is equal
to 1 if we actually

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.520
have an edge that
goes from Vi to Vj--

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:15.000
so this is an edge-- and
0 if this is not the case.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.630
So this is the adjacency matrix.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:22.460
And now we can state something
about the number of directed

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:28.150
walks in a directed graph.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.300
So it turns out
that this is easily

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:36.455
computed by taking powers
of the adjacency matrix.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:53.800
Let aij with the
superscript k be

00:27:53.800 --> 00:28:06.130
equal to the number of
directed walks of length k

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:13.530
that go from Vi to Vj.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:18.110
So you want to compute
this and it turns out

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:22.000
that-- wait a minute.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.140
So what did I do here?

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.190
So actually let p
kij be the number

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:34.440
of directed walks of length
k from phi i to phi j.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.600
Then what you can show is
if you look at matrix A

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:44.110
to the power k, this
actually is the matrix that

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:50.190
contains all these numbers.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:51.710
So let me give a few examples.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.670
So let's take the
matrix over here.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.240
Look at this ajc matrix,
take a few powers

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.030
and see what happens.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.210
So the matrix looks like this.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:09.590
If you just label the rows
by, say, V1, V2, and V3.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.340
The columns by V1, V2, and V3.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.020
Well, V1 has an edge to V1.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.360
V1 has an edge to V2
and also one to V3.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.560
V2 has only one edge to
V3, so we have zeros here.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.710
And we have this.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:30.210
So this is the matrix A.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.180
For example, if you
compute a squared.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.510
So how do we do this?

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:37.210
How many of you know about
matrix multiplication?

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.160
Everybody knows?

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.005
Well anyway, so let's assume
that you do know actually.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.560
So that's pretty simple.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.580
So you take the column.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.110
You take the inners product
with the first row, and so on.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.840
And you can easily
compute this otherwise

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.810
you may want to do
it yourself later on.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:02.270
And you get this
particular matrix.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.410
And, for example,
a to the power of 3

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:12.900
is something very similar--
1, 3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.700
Well, it turns out that
if you look at this graph

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.970
and we, for example, want
to know the number of walks

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:22.380
of length 3 that go
from V1 to, say, V2,

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:29.370
let's see whether we
can see those over here.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:33.830
Well, if I travel from
V1 to V2 in three steps,

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.600
I can go like this.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.350
I can go one, two, three.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:41.010
So that's one option.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.240
I can go one, and
another one time,

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.470
so it's a second
step, and three.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.920
I can also go directly over here
and go back here, and back over

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.960
here.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.620
So it turns out that's
I can compute this.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.580
So how do we prove this?

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.370
We'll use induction.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:06.130
And the steps are
pretty straightforward.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.020
So let's first
define, because we

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.730
want to prove that kth power
of a is equal to that matrix

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:19.350
up there, where all the entries
represent the number of walks.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:32.690
So let's say that aijk,
that this denote the i jth

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:38.680
entry in a to the power k.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.510
And you want to show that
this number is actually

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:51.930
equal to pijk for
all the entries.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:55.620
So if you're going
to use induction,

00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:03.440
it makes sense to assume that
the theorem is true for k.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:10.000
So the induction hypothesis
could be something like this.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.700
The theorem is true for k.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.900
And this is really
the same as stating

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:32.370
that all these entries
for all i and j-- aij

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.208
is equal to the pijk.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.710
So this is what
you want to prove.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:41.780
And this is pretty
straightforward

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.220
because now what
we can do is we can

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:52.020
start to look at how we compute
walks of length k, or k plus 1.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.110
So let's first do the base case.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.680
That's how we always start.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.210
The base case is k equals 1.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.850
And we have essentially
two options.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.560
So we want to prove this,
so take an i and a j,

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.340
whatever you want.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:14.030
So suppose we has an
edge, Vi, that goes to Vj.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.820
Well in that case, we
know that the number

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:23.700
of walks of length
1, from i to j,

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.170
is exactly 1 because
there's this edge.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.510
So this is equal to 1.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:31.270
But this is also the definition
of my adjacency matrix.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.480
So I can just write
out here aij 1.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.380
So that's great.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.780
This case definitely works.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:45.530
Now, if there is no
edge of this type,

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:50.210
then you know that in one step,
we can never achieve Vj from Vi

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.630
because there's no edge.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.420
So we know this is equal to 0.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.050
There's no such walk.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.490
And this is, by definition
of the adjacency matrix,

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.045
also equal to the aij.

00:34:01.045 --> 00:34:01.860
So this works.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.000
So the base case it's easy.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.658
And induction step always
starts by issuing pk.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.443
As you can see,
these types of proofs

00:34:18.443 --> 00:34:19.734
always have the same structure.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:33.822
In this case, let
me again assume pk.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.300
We want to prove pk plus 1.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.770
So what you want
to know is what's

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.050
the number of walks
of length k plus 1.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.110
So how can we express those?

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:53.360
pij k plus 1.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.260
How can we use this
assumption over here?

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.550
Do you have an idea so we can--

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.450
AUDIENCE: Any walk
of length k plus 1

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:15.505
can be got by taking one
of-- let's say from Vs

00:35:15.505 --> 00:35:25.360
to Vx. [INAUDIBLE] You go
from Vs to V in k steps

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.312
and then V to Vf in one step.

00:35:27.312 --> 00:35:28.270
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.570
We could do that.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:31.960
So let's write it down.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.710
So what you're
essentially saying

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.150
is that you can
enumerate all the walks

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:43.390
by going of length k plus 1
by first going from i in, say,

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:49.620
k steps, to whatever
V, and then in one

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:55.791
step to, say, Vi to V in k steps
and then in one step to Vj.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.310
So let's write this down
because V can be anything.

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:05.320
So what to do is we have
a sum over all the Vs

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.600
such that-- well, we
will use indices here

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.030
let me do that a
little bit differently.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.800
So let's say I have
an h over here.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:20.110
So all the indices
h such that Vh to Vj

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:26.110
is actually an edge in G.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:32.020
So then we can write out here
that we go in k steps to Vh.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.110
So how many walks are there?

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.610
Well, we can use the induction
hypothesis now, right?

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:43.130
So we can say you go
from i to h in k steps.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:49.360
And then, well, we can
use this particular edge

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:55.960
to complete it to a k
plus 1th walk from i to j.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.110
So now what is this equal to?

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:00.550
Can we simplify this sum?

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:04.830
We can, right, because
we know that there's

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:09.310
an edge if and only if the
adjacency matrix has a 1

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.300
in a particular position.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:19.910
So we could rewrite it and
sum over all h from 1 to n.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:32.510
And write pij k times, and then
aj-- oh, this should be an h.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.100
So we have the same over here.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:39.610
And then we have one
edge from h to 2j.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:44.360
So I only count this number
over here if this is equal to 1,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.500
and that happens exactly
if there's an edge.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.230
I do not count this if
there's a 0 over here,

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.930
that is as if there's no edge.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:56.650
But now we can use induction
hypothesis because I know that

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.620
these numbers are
equal to the a's.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.040
So we rewrite this.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.760
And we see that we get aih k.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.920
So this is where we
use the induction step.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:18.110
So it's like we
assume pk over here.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.530
And I need to
finish this formula.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:21.970
So we have this.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:29.400
Now, by the definition
of matrix multiplication,

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:41.700
we actually see that this
is equal to a k plus 1 ij

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.390
to the ij-th entry in
the k plus oneth power

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.050
of the adjacency matrix.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.630
Here we have this represents
the matrix of the kth power.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:53.440
This represents the matrix of a.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.140
So we multiply essentially
a to the power k times a

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.190
and get a to the power k plus 1.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:00.260
And that's what we see here.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.000
So this is the induction step,
and so this proves the theorem

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.500
up here.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:11.670
So let's talk about a few
more definitions concerning

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.150
directed graphs.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:18.730
And then you go a step
into a very special type

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:23.480
of graph, which are the
tournament graphs up here.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.240
One of the things that
we have in undirected

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.750
graphs, so where we
have no directed edges,

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.720
we talked last time a lot about
cyclicity and stuff like that.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.530
And we talked about
acyclic connected graphs.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.350
And as we categorized those,
so we defined them as trees,

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:54.130
and they have a very
special structure.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:40:04.950
So what would happen here, if
we look at a directed graph,

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:08.260
and we wonder, what does
it mean to be connected.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.007
Can we really talk about that?

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:10.840
What does that mean?

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.720
For example, if I look at
this particular example

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.220
graph over here,
I can say, well,

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:24.200
V1 has an edge that
points towards V1 itself,

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.220
and towards V2, and towards V3.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.230
So maybe I would call
this graph connected.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:35.370
But if I look at V2,
I only see an edge

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.510
that goes from V2 to
V3, and not to V2.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.270
So maybe I do not
call it connected.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:48.610
So that's why we define a
stronger notion for a digraph.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:41:09.570
So a digraph, G, VE is
called strongly connected

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:18.180
if we know that for every
pair-- so if for all vertices

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:25.190
U and V in the vertex
set-- there exists

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:39.550
a directed path that starts
in U and ends up in V in G.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.940
So this is what we would
call strongly connected.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.900
So now in undirected
graphs, we had connectivity

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.540
and then we said, well, if a
connected, undirected graph

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.740
has no cycles.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.910
We have trees and they
have special properties

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:57.790
and all that.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.370
So what about this over here?

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:06.820
Suppose you have an acyclic
strongly connected digraph.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.064
What does that look like?

00:42:09.064 --> 00:42:10.105
So let's give an example.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:18.070
It's not completely clear
what kind of structure it has.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:25.940
So for example, I
may have a graph that

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.645
looks like this, for example.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:39.760
Say this is an acyclic graph.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:50.400
but It does not have at
all a tree structure.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.500
So actually, the type of
graph the we have here

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.872
is called a directed
acyclic graph.

00:42:57.872 --> 00:42:59.330
As you can see,
there are no cycles

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:01.970
because I only go
forward, essentially.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:05.180
I can never go backward
in this particular way

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.370
that I depicted the graph.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:12.930
So this is an example for
directed acyclic graph.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.540
But it doesn't look
like a tree at all.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.870
So it's worth to
define it separately,

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:23.600
and we will use this
on Thursday when we'll

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.700
talk about partial orderings.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.780
And it turns out that, as
you can see here-- well,

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.980
at that case, a
directed acyclic graph

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.790
has really nice
properties, and one of them

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:37.505
is that you can order these
vertices in such a way

00:43:37.505 --> 00:43:43.050
that you go from, say, left to
right in a directed fashion.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:44.930
And that will lead
to partial ordering.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.880
So that's something that
we will talk about as well.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.200
So what's the definition?

00:43:52.200 --> 00:44:09.890
A directed graph is called
a directed acyclic graph,

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:14.250
and we appreciate this by DAG.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.690
We call them DAGs.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.250
They're used
everywhere, actually.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:33.390
If it does not contain
any directed cycles.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:39.945
So these kinds of
graphs are used

00:44:39.945 --> 00:44:43.465
in scheduling and
optimization, and we

00:44:43.465 --> 00:44:47.310
will use them next week in the
lecture on partial orderings.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.510
Now we have done a
lot of definitions

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:57.330
concerning directed graphs.

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.080
So now let's talk about these
very special ones, tournament

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.230
graph, and see whether we
can prove a few really nice

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.280
theorems about them.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.040
Let's see whether we can
figure that out together.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:23.590
So what is a tournament graph?

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:39.760
In a tournament graph, I
have a bunch of vertices.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.930
And essentially we want to
represent like a tournament.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:47.770
So every vertex, say,
represents a team.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.070
And a team can play
against another team,

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.660
and beat them or lose
against the other team.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:58.670
So we want to use the
directed edges to indicate

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.050
who is winning from home.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.270
And such types of graphs
have very special property.

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:08.250
So let me first depict one.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:19.060
So for example, we have E
goes to A, goes through B,

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:26.700
incoming edge from
C, one coming from B.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.240
And over here we have
this directed edge.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.160
We have this one.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.790
We have this one.

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:44.020
Let me see [INAUDIBLE] don't
make any mistakes here.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.790
And this one.

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:47.025
And over here is another one.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.470
So what do we see in this graph?

00:46:51.470 --> 00:47:02.840
We see that either say,
team U, beats team V.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.600
And that means that we have a
directed edge from U pointing

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:12.200
at V. Or it's other way around.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:19.970
V actually beats U, and we have
a directed edge from V to U.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:25.140
Let's have a look at this
graph and see how this works.

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:30.360
So for example, we have
that B is beating E,

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.150
and E is beating A, and so on.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.030
So let's have a look.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:39.540
Maybe we can figure out who's
the best player in here.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.414
So this is sort of
a general question

00:47:41.414 --> 00:47:42.580
if who would like to answer.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.690
Maybe you cannot answer this.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.910
So let's have an example.

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:55.980
Has anybody seen an example
where we start with A,

00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.350
then we may beat another vertex,
and maybe another vertex,

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:04.540
and so on, until we have covered
all the different vertices.

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.530
Do you see a path
that works like that?

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:10.760
And that could gives
us an ordering on who

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.840
is the best player,
like the one at the top,

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:20.030
like A, is able to,
for example, beat B.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:27.170
And B is, for example, able
to beat D and this one, E,

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:30.660
and this one, C. So you
would say, OK, that's great.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.850
Now I know that this one
is the strongest player.

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:36.810
But there's a little
problem here, right?

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:39.600
Because I can produce
many such paths.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:45.060
And actually, if I look at
C, then C beats A as well.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.260
So that's kind of weird.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.565
So wait a minute.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:56.950
We have that there's a
directed edge from C to A.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:59.120
It's like teams
beats one another.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:05.800
And it's not very clear how we
can talk about a best player.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.180
Well, we would
have a best player

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:15.090
if one player sort of
wins from everybody else.

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:16.820
But there's many examples here.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.840
So let's look at another walk.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:25.550
For example, C can go to B,
to D, and then to E, and then

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:28.280
to A. So there are many
possibilities here.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.630
So this leads us to a concept.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:40.140
And we call that's a
directed Hamiltonian path.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.260
And we're going to show
that, in a tournament graph,

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.120
you can always find such a
directed Hamiltonian path.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.060
So what's a Hamiltonian path?

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.360
This is actually
an example of it.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.710
There's a walk that
goes around the graph

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:57.240
and visits every
vertex exactly once.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.870
So we're going to prove
that a tournament graph has

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:02.213
this beautiful property.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:21.190
So let's first write out
a definition of this.

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:48.140
A directed Hamiltonian
path is a directed walk

00:50:48.140 --> 00:51:05.570
that visits every
vertex exactly once.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:12.630
So as I said already, here
we have such an example.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:16.140
We can go from A to B,
to D to E, to C. Maybe

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.440
there are even other examples.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.160
I did not actually see them.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.540
Maybe you can have a
look at them as well.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:25.800
So maybe there's something that
starts with B going to E maybe.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:30.660
That's a very different
direction, like this.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:35.960
There will be one as
well, and so forth.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.960
So what's the theorem
that you want to prove?

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:49.160
The theorem in that you want
to show that every tournament

00:51:49.160 --> 00:52:00.260
graph actually contains such
a directed Hamiltonian path.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:19.190
So let's have a look at
how we can prove this.

00:52:38.849 --> 00:52:40.890
What kind of proof technique
are we going to use?

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.245
Do you have an idea?

00:52:48.595 --> 00:52:50.470
Well, usually we use
induction so that's what

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.310
we're going to do here as well.

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:55.770
But what kind of induction
hypothesis can we do?

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:57.990
So what would we
induct on, you think?

00:53:00.834 --> 00:53:01.782
Someone else?

00:53:01.782 --> 00:53:04.626
Maybe someone up there?

00:53:04.626 --> 00:53:06.060
AUDIENCE: The number of nodes.

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:08.670
PROFESSOR: The number of nodes.

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:16.050
So we use induction on
the number of nodes.

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:17.930
And why would that
be of interest?

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:21.130
So let's have a look at
how we can think of that.

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:24.500
So we start thinking about
such a problem, this really

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:29.070
sort of-- one parameter here
that's the number of nodes

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.960
in a tournament graph.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.580
I also have edges.

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:41.290
But if I think about
edges, then, the edges

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:45.340
is always directly
related to the number

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:47.430
of nodes in a tournament graph.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:50.640
So I really have just
that one parameter.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:55.040
So it makes sense to use
induction on number of nodes.

00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:03.947
So induct on n, where Pn
is going to be that every--

00:54:03.947 --> 00:54:06.280
and essentially, the theorem
holds true for a tournament

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:19.800
graph on n nodes-- so every
tournament graph on n nodes

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:30.270
actually contains a
directed Hamiltonian path.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.440
So this is semi
induction hypothesis.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.954
So when you think
about that, well, I

00:54:38.954 --> 00:54:40.370
feel pretty confident
because if I

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:45.430
look at the base case-- that's
how we always start-- well,

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:46.730
n equals 1.

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:49.440
If n equals 1, I have
just a single vertex.

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.420
There's no edges.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.130
Everything is fine
because the single edge

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.660
is a directed Hamiltonian path.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.280
So this is great.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.250
So this works.

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:00.570
So what about inductive step?

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.700
Now with inductive
step, we always

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.800
perceived in the same way.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:13.540
We start to assume
that Pn is true.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:16.000
Essentially, the theorem
holds for a tournament graph

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.524
on n vertices.

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:23.050
Actually, let me
keep this over here.

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:33.150
So now let's just think about
how we can prove this induction

00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:35.090
step.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:38.570
I need to prove P of n plus 1.

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:40.050
So how do I start?

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:42.640
I have to start with
a tournament graph

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.950
on n plus 1 vertices.

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:50.360
And somehow I got to be
able to use this property

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:53.060
because that's what I assume.

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.410
And the property only holds
for a tournament graph

00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:56.330
on end points.

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:57.930
So what will be a
really good strategy

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.900
to do here to sort
of proceed our proof?

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:08.380
So let me first write out
what we want to do here.

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:15.040
Maybe you can think about
how to advance here.

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.460
So we have shown Pn.

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:22.840
Now we want to actually
prove something

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.765
about tournament graphs
on n plus 1 nodes,

00:56:25.765 --> 00:56:28.250
so let's consider one.

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:41.310
Consider a tournament
graph on n plus 1 nodes.

00:56:41.310 --> 00:56:47.970
Now how can I use my
induction hypothesis?

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:52.390
So I start with this,
and I want to use

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:55.780
something that talks about the
tournament graph on n nodes.

00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.270
So how could I proceed here?

00:57:02.616 --> 00:57:04.560
Any suggestions?

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.130
So what do you
usually do, right?

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:09.850
If I have like an
n plus 1 nodes,

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:13.000
I have to somehow look
at least maybe there

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.240
exists a subgraph in
this bigger graph.

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.330
So this is really
how you always think

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:21.140
about these types of proofs
or also other problems.

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:23.340
So there must be
some kind of subgraph

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.400
that already has this property.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:31.440
Well, let's take
out one node and see

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.470
what happens because then
we have one node less

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:41.380
and maybe we will be able
to apply our induction step.

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:51.550
So let's take out one node V.

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.740
And what can we say
about remaining graph

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.040
if we take out one node?

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:59.670
For example, if I take
out the node E over here

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.400
and I just look
at all the rest, I

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:05.900
can still see that for all
the other nodes either,

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:09.100
say, U beats V or V
beats U. So I still

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:15.130
have an edge in one direction
between each two nodes.

00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:17.350
So actually I still
have a tournament graph,

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:18.140
so that's great.

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.995
So this gives a
tournament graph.

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:31.810
So essentially,
so far, we really

00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:35.660
haven't done anything
creative or anything

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:40.420
that we had to make a big leap
in order to prove this theorem.

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.890
We started out with, if
you want to prove something

00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:45.770
like this you have to really
look at the number of vertices.

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:49.140
And then we start to write
down this stuff over here

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.290
that makes total sense.

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:53.880
And then we are going
to figure out where

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:55.720
we can use this induction step.

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.150
And so we just
take out one node.

00:58:57.150 --> 00:59:04.180
And yes, it is a tournament
graph on n nodes.

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:05.630
So this is very systematic.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:07.850
That's what I try
to get at here.

00:59:07.850 --> 00:59:14.060
So by the induction step because
by the induction hypothesis,

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:20.120
we know now that we actually
have a directed Hamiltonian

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.070
path.

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:27.835
So let V1 to V2 to
Vn be such a path.

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:35.230
So now that we can use this,
we apply it and we get a path.

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:37.030
Now what do we want to do?

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:40.670
We want to show that we can
create a new path, which

00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:44.140
is also a directed Hamiltonian
path, but now one that also

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.460
includes V in the bigger graph.

00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.020
If we can do that, we are done.

00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.220
So now we have to
start really looking

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:52.580
at how we can make that happen.

00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:06.550
In order to do this, we have
to see how we can somehow

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:10.120
plug V, the vertex
that we have removed,

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.640
in this path over here.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.460
If you can do this, we
are in really good shape.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.200
So far, we haven't used at
all-- so there's also something

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.580
that you can look
at if you start

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:27.530
solving these types of
problems-- we haven't used

01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:30.430
at all the property that
the tournament graph has,

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:33.900
which I just wiped out.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.030
So let's figure out
what we can do here.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:41.070
We should be able
to use something.

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:43.740
So of course, we have
a few simple cases.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:51.170
For example, if V has a
directed edge into V1,

01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:55.970
and I have a Hamiltonian path
that goes from V to V1 to V2

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:59.500
all the way to Vn, and then I
cover all the vertices exactly

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.610
once.

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:03.540
And I will have a
direct Hamiltonian path.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.480
So this is great.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.420
So this is definitely easy.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:10.615
So this is case one.

01:01:10.615 --> 01:01:19.300
In case two, suppose that
V1 has a directed edge to V.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:24.790
And So now we have a little
problem because somehow there

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:30.470
is an edge like this to V,
but they cannot go like this.

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:31.870
This is not a Hamiltonian path.

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:35.530
I need to have a
directed walk that covers

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:36.980
all the vertices exactly once.

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.690
So now we have a little problem.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:40.400
So now we have to
start really thinking

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.550
about how we can solve this.

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:47.566
So are there any suggestions
to make this happen?

01:01:47.566 --> 01:01:49.190
So let's think a
little bit about this.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.160
So somehow if I start
thinking about this,

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.450
I would like to plug V
somewhere in this sequence.

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:02.955
That will be like a pretty
obvious way to-- go ahead.

01:02:02.955 --> 01:02:03.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:17.015
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:17.015 --> 01:02:18.440
That's true.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.160
So for example, I may
have that for example,

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.110
V2 beats V as well.

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:32.820
But suppose that I have V3 over
here, and this one beats V3.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.790
Then, as you say, I could
sort of plug V in here

01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:38.860
in this sequence and I may
have a longer sequence.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:46.250
Or if this is not the case,
then maybe the next one, V4,

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:49.450
may have the property
and I can plug V in here.

01:02:49.450 --> 01:02:54.620
So essentially what I want
to show is that I can plug V

01:02:54.620 --> 01:03:00.200
somewhere in the middle
of two of these Vi's.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.490
And the property
that you were using

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:07.040
is actually that you said,
well, I know that V2 either

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.730
beats V, or V beats V2.

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.320
So that's the property
of the tournament graph

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.600
that we're going to use
here in order to prove this.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.430
So yes, that's a
great observation.

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:23.220
So the way you formulated it,
we can maybe use induction,

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.770
for example, to prove this.

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:30.900
We can sort of go
recursively through this

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.850
until you find the right spot.

01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:38.390
Maybe they can immediately
precisely indicate such a spot.

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:39.750
So how do we usually do that?

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:43.690
If we are thinking
about other theorems

01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:44.978
that we have tried to prove.

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:53.540
AUDIENCE: What's the
smallest value of i

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.652
such that V beats Vi?

01:03:56.652 --> 01:03:57.600
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.350
So what's the smallest
value of i where V beats Vi.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:21.780
So usually we have words in our
mind like largest or smallest,

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:25.357
et cetera, and sort of
an extreme precision.

01:04:25.357 --> 01:04:27.690
And then we like to find out
that we can make it happen.

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:32.880
And then we say, well,
if something goes wrong,

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.090
we violate that
smallest condition.

01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:37.300
So let's do that here.

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:41.380
So let's indicate
a specific spot.

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:54.883
Let's considered the smallest
i such that V beats Vi.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.710
Well, let's have a look
how this would work.

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:07.760
So this is a little bit
of a different proof

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.129
than what I had but this
should work fine as well.

01:05:11.129 --> 01:05:12.420
So let's just see how it works.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.210
So we have V1.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.650
First of all, we notice that,
of course, if i equals 1,

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:30.970
which that cannot be the case,
so we know that i is larger

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:31.850
than 1.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:38.310
So there's really
somewhere a Vi minus 1--

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:39.560
we have to check that, right?

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.780
If that exists,
this index is not

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:46.050
equal to zero-- that goes to
Vi and then goes all the way up

01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:49.320
to Vn.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:06:03.680
So now we say we can use this,
that V actually beats Vi.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:09.870
Now what's about-- maybe
someone else can help me here--

01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:13.285
I would like to
have that Vi minus 1

01:06:13.285 --> 01:06:19.310
beats V. That would be fantastic
because then I have a path that

01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:21.300
goes from V1 all
the way up here,

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.470
goes here, goes there, and
all the way up to here.

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:26.535
So we have a directed
Hamiltonian path

01:06:26.535 --> 01:06:29.950
that covers all the
vertices exactly once,

01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:32.210
and that's what
you want to prove.

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:36.933
But why would there be an
edge that goes this way?

01:06:36.933 --> 01:06:38.224
So how do we reason about this?

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.300
Someone else?

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:52.270
AUDIENCE: Because Vi is the
smallest number that V beats,

01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:56.729
then anything smaller
than i must have beat V.

01:06:56.729 --> 01:06:58.780
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:04.110
So if V would beat
Vi minus 1, that

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:07.130
would contradict the
smallest property over here.

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:09.010
So that's a contradiction.

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:12.070
Now we use a property
of the tournament graph.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:16.150
So now I know that Vi
minus 1 must beat V.

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:19.920
So I really have
an edge over here.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.450
So that works.

01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:24.040
So that's the end of the proof.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.480
Now another version
could have been

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:31.280
in which we would do
something similar like this.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.800
But we could also
have used, say,

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:38.480
the largest i-- just something
that you may want to look at.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.580
You can also use
the largest i such

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:49.660
that Vi beats V. We have a
completely symmetrical argument

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.630
here, but you could use
this solution as well.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.570
So I'm just trying
to sketch here

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.920
the way of thinking that
you may want to consider

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:58.550
in these types of problems.

01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:00.220
So why would this
work, by the way?

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.780
Well, we have the same
kind of argument like this.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:06.610
We plug V right after Vi.

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:09.560
We know there's an edge
from V to Vi plus 1.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.340
Why?

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:14.400
If it's not the case, there
will be a large index, i,

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.490
that contradicts our
assumption that we

01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:18.470
have the largest i already.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:20.960
It's a tournament graph,
so we know that there's

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.890
an edge from V to Vi plus 1.

01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:27.534
And we get a directed
Hamiltonian path as well.

01:08:27.534 --> 01:08:29.200
So you may want to
look at that as well.

01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:36.370
So this is about
tournament graphs.

01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:41.439
So let's talk about an
interesting tournament graph

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:42.450
with a funny game.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:50.569
And this is actually
a chicken tournament,

01:08:50.569 --> 01:08:54.870
like the chickens here
represent the vertices

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:59.630
and they are pecking one
another, but in a certain rule

01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.643
that defines a chicken
to be the king chicken.

01:09:01.643 --> 01:09:02.809
So let's see how that works.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:11.159
So that's a great
application of graph theory.

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:17.210
So what do we have?

01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:30.130
We have that either a chicken,
U, pecks a chicken, V.

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:33.540
And we said that U has
a direct edge to V,

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:36.250
so we're actually defining
a tournament graph here.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:42.500
Or we have a chicken, V,
that pecks a chicken, U,

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.950
and we get V has a
direct edge to U.

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:47.000
So we have a tournament graph.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.680
But now we define something new.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:10:02.660
We say that U virtually pecks
V if one of the two conditions

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:06.710
holds-- one of these two
conditions-- either U,

01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:09.950
of course, pecks
V. That's great.

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:11.060
He's in good shape.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.660
Or there exists another
chicken, W, such

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:27.760
that U actually pecks
W and W, in turn,

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:35.740
pecks V. So this is very special
kind of first relationship.

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:45.350
So we are wondering now can
we now define something--

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:46.250
is there a question?

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:49.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
in between?

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:52.540
To be virtually
pecked, is one chicken

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.282
in between U and the other one?

01:10:56.282 --> 01:10:58.240
PROFESSOR: Well, there
can be multiple chickens

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.649
in between here.

01:11:01.649 --> 01:11:04.728
I have several friends who help
me out pecking someone else.

01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:15.080
So when we were looking at
these tournament graphs,

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:21.520
we were wondering, can we really
indicate a winning player?

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.440
Well in this case, if you start
to talk about virtual pecking,

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.580
we look at the pecking order.

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:33.350
Then we can actually define
something like a chicken king.

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:36.737
So let me write that down.

01:11:42.986 --> 01:11:47.040
Let me first explain
what I mean here.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.610
And I give an
example of a graph.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:07.180
So a chicken that is able
to virtually peck everyone

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.870
else, we will call a king.

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:28.670
So chicken that virtual
pecks every other chicken

01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:36.490
is called a king chicken.

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:45.340
So let's give an
example of a graph.

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:51.200
So, for example, suppose
I have four chickens that

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.655
know how to pick one
another in this order.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.668
So who in the pecking party
here is going to be king?

01:13:06.668 --> 01:13:11.350
Do you see some solutions here?

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.760
So take, for example, this one.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.220
So this one pecks this one.

01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:24.890
Because we talk about
virtually pecking,

01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:27.390
it can also peck
this one over here.

01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:28.780
It does, right?

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:32.000
It pecks this one and this
one helps out, and can peck

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.590
both this one and this one.

01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:34.610
That's cool.

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:37.480
So this one is king.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:41.650
And this one, actually--
let's have a look.

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:44.490
It pecks this one this
one, and it virtually

01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:45.450
also pecked this one.

01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:45.950
Yay.

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:49.640
He has a friend over here
that is doing that for him.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.730
So this one is
actually also a king.

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:55.740
So you can have multiple
king chickens in here.

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:56.820
What about this one?

01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:05.550
The same story-- pecks
this one, pecks this one,

01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:07.710
and virtually-- wait a minute.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:16.400
The one on the left--
oh yeah, over here.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.170
This, this.

01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:20.480
So this one is king as well.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.510
Now what about this one?

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:25.570
Well, it can peck this one.

01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:28.050
And then in one
more step from here,

01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:30.280
because there's only
one outgoing edge,

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.360
it can virtually peck this
one, but not this one.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.740
So this one is definitely
the loser of the four.

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:41.610
So he's not the king.

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:46.200
So now what we want to
prove this a theorem

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.221
sort of trans-identify
one of the chickens

01:14:49.221 --> 01:14:50.970
that we know for sure
is going to be king.

01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:52.950
So you can have multiple kings.

01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:56.060
But maybe there's one chicken
that, from our intuition,

01:14:56.060 --> 01:15:00.890
we may feel is definitely
going to be king.

01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:03.420
So what will be
a good intuition?

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.130
So we're talking here
about virtual pecking.

01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:07.670
We have this definition.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:13.560
So what kind of node
in a tournament graph

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:21.727
essentially would be-- can we
know for sure that it's a king?

01:15:21.727 --> 01:15:23.310
Do you have an
intuition for a theorem

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:25.830
that you may want to prove?

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:28.460
So that's often what
we do in mathematics.

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.080
We have some kind of
funny new structure,

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.741
and then we want to
find out whether we

01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:34.490
can prove interesting
properties about it.

01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:39.180
So we start to search for actual
nice properties and theorems.

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.350
So in this case, it makes
sense that the vertex

01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:49.490
that has the most outgoing
edges may be always king.

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:51.820
Can we prove this?

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.920
So that's what
we're going to do.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.950
So that's the theorem.

01:15:55.950 --> 01:16:03.050
And let's see whether we can
do this in an elegant way.

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:06.030
So the theorem is
that even though there

01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:07.730
are multiple
kings-- as indicated

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.970
in that particular
example, that may happen--

01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:19.592
but I certainly know that the
chicken that has the highest

01:16:19.592 --> 01:16:24.506
outdegree is definitely a king.

01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:35.820
And the way we're going to
prove this is by contradiction.

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:38.080
Let's assume that's
not the case.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.860
That must be really,
really weird.

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:43.140
If you are the one who
has the largest outdegree,

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.130
it means that you can
directly, just by yourself,

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:47.760
peck the most others.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.180
So suppose you're not king.

01:16:53.272 --> 01:17:03.440
So by contradiction,
first of all,

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.650
let U have the
highest outdegree.

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:16.010
And we want to show
that this U is king.

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:19.250
So let's assume the contrary.

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:24.475
So let's suppose
that U is not king.

01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:31.960
So what does that mean?

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.930
So let's look at a
definition over there

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:41.790
and see what it means
that U is not king.

01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:50.470
So that means that both
those conditions are violated

01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:55.390
because if one of
those two holds,

01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:57.880
I know there must
be one vertex, V,

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:03.050
such that U does not virtually
peck V. So I know that.

01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:07.860
So let's see what that implies.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.665
So I know that there
must be a V such

01:18:13.665 --> 01:18:22.060
that U does not virtually peck
V. So maybe can help me out.

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.900
What does that mean?

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.775
It means that both these
conditions are not true.

01:18:26.775 --> 01:18:27.900
So let's look at the first.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:31.320
So U pecks V. If
that's not true,

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.350
and we're in the
tournament graph,

01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:40.350
we know that V must
peck U. So we have this.

01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:43.560
and we also know that the
other condition, the second one

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.580
over here, does not hold.

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:51.120
So what's the negation
of this second condition?

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.500
Maybe you can help me out.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:57.720
So we have here, there
exists a W such that U pecks

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.470
W and W pecks V. So how do we
negate that logical expression?

01:19:06.059 --> 01:19:08.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:14.325
PROFESSOR: For all W, what's
over there is not through true.

01:19:14.325 --> 01:19:16.200
So can we formulate that
a little bit better?

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:23.820
So it's not true that U pecks
W and W pecks V. So that

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:32.520
means that either U
pecks W is not true,

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.579
or W pecks V is not true.

01:19:35.579 --> 01:19:36.620
So let's write that down.

01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:41.780
Let's just write it all out.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:54.460
So not U pecks W or
not W pecks V. Well,

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.520
how can we rewrite this?

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.110
Well, it's a
tournament graph, so we

01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:09.110
know that W pecks U. Or this
particular condition, which

01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:14.640
is V pecks W.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.649
So what do I have here?

01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:17.190
Is this going in
the right direction?

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:28.780
Well, I want to prove something
about-- if I use contradiction

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:32.110
and I suppose that
U is not the king,

01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:34.600
I've assumed that U has
the highest outdegree.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.690
So I want to show that
I somehow violated.

01:20:36.690 --> 01:20:41.680
So somehow I'm able to
construct some vertex, V.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.030
And by negating
that U is not a king

01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:47.880
it seems that this vertex, V,
makes a really good candidate

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.830
to show that there's a higher
degree outdegree than U.

01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:52.430
So let's see whether
we can do this.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.070
We can rewrite this logical
expression once more.

01:20:58.070 --> 01:21:05.990
We can also say that, well,
if U pecks W-- so this

01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:10.090
is not true-- then
it must be true

01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:15.700
that this one holds because
if that's not the case,

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:17.720
then this condition is not true.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:21.280
So if U pecks W, then
this is not true.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.200
So then it must be the
case that that is true.

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:28.960
So V pecks W. So now
let's have a look at V.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:35.130
We noticed that for all
outgoing edges from U,

01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:39.890
there exists a similar
outgoing edge for V.

01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:42.570
But V has one more
outgoing edge.

01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:45.030
V, actually, is an
outgoing edge to U.

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:46.870
So what do we see here?

01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:57.180
That the outdegree of V is
actually at least the outdegree

01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:02.040
of U-- which is this
particular condition over here

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.100
that we show here,
for all the W we

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:08.690
have that this is true-- plus
and we have an extra one.

01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:09.990
It's this one.

01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:11.500
Oh, but now we have
a contradiction

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:14.830
because we said that U
has the highest degree.

01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:16.750
But it turns out that
you have constructed one

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:18.750
that has a higher outdegree.

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:20.810
So that's a contradiction.

01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:25.260
That means that our original
assumption is actually wrong.

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:29.010
So suppose that U is not the
king was a wrong assumption,

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:31.387
and U must be king.

01:22:31.387 --> 01:22:32.720
So that's the end of this proof.

01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:38.780
This is the end of this lecture.

01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.710
So see you tomorrow
at recitation

01:22:40.710 --> 01:22:43.540
and next week we will continue
with communication graphs

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:45.970
and partial orderings.
