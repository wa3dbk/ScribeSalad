00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.670
MARTEN VAN DIJK: So today we're
going to talk about relations.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.380
We're going to talk
about partial orders.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.701
Wow this is loud.

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:34.950
Could you put it a bit softer?

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.870
So we're going to
talk about relations,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.590
partial orders, and then
parallel task scheduling.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.450
So well, we'll start out with
a few definitions as usual

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.760
and examples will explain what
you're talking about here.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.320
So what about relations?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.300
Well, relations are
very simple definition.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:15.880
A relation from a
set A to a set B

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.610
is really a subset of the
cross product of the two.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.270
So let me give an example.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.330
It's a subset R that has its
elements in a cross product

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.720
of A and B, which really
means that it has pairs where

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.010
the first element
is drawn from A

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.976
and the second
element is from B.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:45.700
So for example, if you're
thinking about the classes

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.650
that you're taking as say,
set B and all the students

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.140
set A, well, then
you can describe

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.160
this is as a relationship
where we have tuples

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:08.080
a, b where a student
a is taking class b.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.540
So a relation is really
just a set of pairs.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.440
The first part of the pair is
in set A, the second one in B.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.630
Now, we will use
different notation

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.740
for indicating that a
pair is in this subset,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.340
so we'll be talking
about further properties,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.460
then it will become more
clear, but we will also write

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.550
that a is to relate this to b.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.530
So instead of the pair
a, b is an element of R,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.390
you may write a R b,
or we say a and then

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.830
we use this symbol
with a subscript R b.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.810
So we use the relational
symbol in between a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.609
and b in these two cases.

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.150
And the reason for
that becomes clear

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.240
if you start talking
about the properties,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.080
but let me first give
a few more examples

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.015
and talk about the
types of relations

00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:16.390
that you're really
interested in.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.370
We really are interested
in a relation on a set A,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:31.250
and this is really
a subset R that

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.550
is a cross product
of A with itself.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.130
So essentially, A is equal
to B in the definition

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.420
right up here.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.110
Now, examples that we
have for this one is,

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.770
for example, we may have A
to B, all in the integers,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.400
positive and negative, and
then we can say, for example, x

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.810
is related to y if
and only if x is,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.560
for example, congruent
to y modulo 5.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.036
This would be a proper relation.

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:08.620
We have not yet talked
about special properties.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.320
We will come to that.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.200
Other examples
are, well, we could

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:20.029
take all the positive
integers, 0, 1, and so on

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.130
and so forth, and
then right so x

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.140
is related to y if and
only if, for example, you

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.070
could say that x defines y.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.660
That's another relationship
that we could use.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.250
Notice, by the way that
in the correct [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.530
that I put here, I already
used sort of relational symbols

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.990
right in the middle
between x and y over here.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.630
So that's already
indicating why we are using

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.670
a notation that I put up here.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.100
So another example
is, for example,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:03.570
we have that x is related to y
if and only if x is at most y.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.947
This is also a relation.

00:05:05.947 --> 00:05:07.780
So now what are the
special property that we

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.570
are interested in and those
that will make relations

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.100
special and then we can
talk about-- actually,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.520
I forgot one item
that we will talk

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.600
about as well, which
are equivalents

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:32.050
classes, equivalence relations.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.500
So we will see when we
talk about the properties

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.820
right now that we
will be defining

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.110
very special types
of relations and we

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.680
will talk about these
two, equivalents relations

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.781
and partial orders.

00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:46.905
So what are the properties?

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.180
Actually before we go
into those properties,

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.800
let us just first describe what
the relationship, how we can

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.160
describe it in a different way.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.190
Actually relation is nothing
more than a directed graph,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.940
like R over here is a subset
of a cross product with a.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.080
So that's pairs and you can
think of those as being edges.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.220
So let us write it down as well.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:32.120
So set A together with
R is a directed graph.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.456
And the idea is very simple.

00:06:39.456 --> 00:06:44.300
The directed graph has
vertices V and edge set

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:54.640
E where we take V to be equal to
A and the edge set equal to R.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.650
So for example, we could
create a small little graph,

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.380
for example, for three
persons, Julie and Bill

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.970
and another one, Rob.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.700
And suppose that
the directed edges

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.820
indicate whether one
person likes the other.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.620
So for example Julie likes
Bill and Bill likes himself,

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.830
but likes no one else.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.670
Julie also likes Rob,
but does not like herself

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.510
and Rob really likes Julie,
but does not like himself.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:35.530
So for example, you
could create a graph

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:42.980
where all the directed edge
really represent the relations

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.260
that you have described by R.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:51.207
So we will use this later on
and the special properties

00:07:51.207 --> 00:07:56.030
that we are interested
in are the following.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:03.620
So the properties are that
relations can be reflexive.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:16.970
So a relation R
on A is reflexive

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:34.900
if x is related to itself for
all x, so for all x in A. Well,

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.120
for example, in this particular
graph, that is not the case.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.200
If Julie and Rob would
also like themselves,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.220
then the relationship up here
would actually be reflexive.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:55.410
We have symmetry, so we call
a relationship symmetric

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:05.040
if x likes y, then that should
imply that y also likes x

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.550
and it should, of course,
hold for all x and y.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:20.760
We have a property that
we call antisymmetric,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.270
which is the opposite of this.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:36.540
Antisymmetric means that if x
likes y and y likes x, then x

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.990
and y must be the same.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.640
So this really
means that it's not

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.240
really possible to
like someone else

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.620
and that someone
else also likes x,

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.870
because according to the
antisymmetrical property,

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.080
that would then imply that
x is actually equal to y.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.950
So these two definitions are
opposite from one another.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.095
And the final one that we're
interested in is transitivity.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:24.880
So the relationship is
transitive if x likes y and y

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.420
likes z, then x also likes z.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.970
So let's have a look
at these few examples

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:41.020
and see whether we can figure
out what kind of properties

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.890
they have.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:49.990
So let's make a
table and let's first

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.310
consider that x
is congruent to y

00:10:52.310 --> 00:11:02.250
modulo 5 and next divisibility
and the other one is less than

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.830
or equal to.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.614
So are they reflexive
is the first question

00:11:08.614 --> 00:11:10.280
and they we want to
know whether they're

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:18.165
symmetric and antisymmetric
and transitive.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.810
So what about this
one over here?

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.770
So can you help me figure
out whether they're

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.170
reflexive and symmetric or
antisymmetric and transitive?

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.970
What kind of properties
does this one have?

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.795
So when we look at x is
congruent to y modulo 5,

00:11:39.795 --> 00:11:44.890
it really means that the
difference between x and y

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.180
is divisible by 5.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.120
So is it reflexive?

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.440
Is x congruent to x modulo 5?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.020
It is right.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.520
That's easy.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.430
So we have yes.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:04.000
Now, if x is congruent
to y module 5,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.630
is y also congruent
to x modulo 5?

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.410
It is because the
difference between x and y

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.810
is divisible by 5
and stays the same.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.840
So y is congruent to x as well.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.920
So it is symmetric.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.750
Now what about
the antisymmetric?

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.690
If x is congruent to
y modulo 5 and y is

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:35.084
congruent to x modulo 5, does
that mean that x is equal to y?

00:12:35.084 --> 00:12:36.250
It's not really true, right?

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.820
You can give a
counterexample for that.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:48.840
So for example, we could have
that 7 is congruent to 2 modulo

00:12:48.840 --> 00:13:03.220
5 and 2 is congruent to 7 modulo
5, but they're not the same.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.690
So this is not true.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.040
No.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.350
What about transitivity?

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.050
Is this true?

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.090
So let's consider
this example as well.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:20.030
So if I have that 2 and 7 are
congruent to one another modulo

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:24.780
5, well, 7 is also, for example,
congruent to 12 modulo 5.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.420
Does it mean that 2 and 12
are congruent to one another?

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:36.240
So we have 2 is
congruent to 7 modulo 5.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.100
We have, say 7 is
congruent to 12 modulo 5.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.700
Well, we can look at
the difference between 2

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.440
and 12, which is 10,
is also divisible by 5.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.690
So actually this does imply that
2 is congruent to 12 modulo 5.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:55.450
Now, this is, of
course, not a proof

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.900
because this is just
by example, but you

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.620
can check for yourself that
this relationship is actually

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.600
transitive.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.940
Now, what about divisibility.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.810
Maybe you can help
me with this one.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.905
So is it reflexive?

00:14:14.107 --> 00:14:14.690
Is this right?

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.520
I hear yes.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.980
That's correct because if x
and y equal to one another,

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:23.270
well, it's 1 times x, so x
divides x, so that's true.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.920
Is it symmetric?

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:32.310
So if x divides y and y
divides x, so let's just see.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.380
We are over here.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.150
So if x divides y, does
that imply that y divides x?

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.740
That's the relation
that we want to check.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.840
Is that true?

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.470
Not really.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:46.580
We can have like say 3 divides
9, but 9 does not divide 3,

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.840
so this is not true,
but antisymmetry.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.560
So if x defies y and
also y divides x,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.740
then they must be
equal to one another.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:04.150
So we can see that this
actually is antisymmetric,

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.400
so that's interesting.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:10.800
And transitivity, well, we
have, again, transitivity

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.850
because if x divides y and
y divides z, then x also

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:15.550
divides z.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:20.480
For example, if 2 divides,
say 4 and 4 divides 20,

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.570
then 2 also divides 20.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.490
Now this one over here has
actually the same properties

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.210
as divisibility.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:37.800
It's reflexive because x is
at least equal to itself.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.600
It's not symmetric
because if x is at most y,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.780
does not really imply
that y is at most x,

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:52.490
so this particular relation
does not hold, in general,

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.700
but it is, again,
antisymmetric because if I

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.120
have this inequality
and the other one, well,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.860
x and y must be equal to
one another in that case

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.280
and transitive as well.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.330
Now, it turns out that
in these examples,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.130
we have seen a certain
combination of properties

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.880
that we will be talking about.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.460
The kind of combination
that we see here

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.070
will lead to a definition
of equivalence classes,

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:32.170
equivalence relations, and this
is also a very usual pattern,

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.160
and this we will define
as partial orders.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.320
So this is what we are
going to talk about next.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:51.630
So we'll first start with
equivalence relations,

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.120
so let's do this.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.340
What is an equivalence relation?

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.190
An equivalence
relation is exactly

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.950
a relation that has those
few properties over there.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.569
So there's reflexive,
symmetric, and transitive.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:21.980
So an equivalence relation is
reflexive and also symmetric

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.989
and also transitive.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.360
So we've already
seen some examples

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.000
up there or one example, but
a very trivial relation, maybe

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.270
you can think of one that
is really straightforward.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.770
What will be an
equivalence relation

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.505
if you think about how we write
mathematical formulas down?

00:17:45.505 --> 00:17:47.910
We usually like the
equality sign also.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:18:02.620
So just equality the equal
sign itself is actually

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.120
one example and
the other example

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.770
is the one that we have
there and that's, of course,

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.500
more general.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.760
We can have x is
congruent to y modulo n.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:20.100
So for fixed n, we have
another equivalence relation.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.390
So now given those, we can start
defining equivalence classes.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:29.020
So what is an equivalence class?

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.460
That's actually everything
within that class

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.030
is related to itself.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:41.100
So the equivalence class
of an element, x in a

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:52.180
is equal to the set of
all the elements in a that

00:18:52.180 --> 00:19:05.720
are related to x
by our relation R.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.350
So we denote this
equivalence class.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.530
So this is denoted by x
with brackets around it.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.870
So let's put it into a formula
and give some examples.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.110
So the formula for
this in mathematics

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:31.280
would be the set of all the y
such that x is related to y.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:38.500
So as an example, we can do the
one that we started off with.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:46.040
So let's again look at x
is congruent to y modulo 5

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.300
and look at the
equivalence classes.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.310
So one of them, for
example, we could look

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.561
at the equivalence class of 7.

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.060
We were looking at
this one already.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.410
Well, what are all the
y's that are actually

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.030
congruence to 7 modulo 5?

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.570
Well, there are a whole bunch.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.420
We have minus 3
and we have 2, 7,

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:18.750
we have 12, 17,
and 22, and so on.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:23.105
And we add 5 to all these and
this is the equivalence class

00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:24.850
that belongs to 7.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.900
Now notice that the
equivalence class of 7

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.460
is actually equal to the
equivalence class of 12.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.750
It's the same set.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.380
Everything that is
congruent to 12 modulo 5

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.730
is also congruent to 7 module
5 and this is, again, equal

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.840
to say, 17, and so on.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.780
So now we can start talking
about a nice property

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.930
that equivalence
classes have, which

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.230
is that the equivalence classes
together partition the set A.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:05.270
So I will need to define
first what a partition is.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.530
And it's defined as follows.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:37.230
A partition of A is a collection
of this joint non-empty sets A1

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:44.010
up to An and they're
all subsets of A.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.850
And the union of all
of those is actually

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:54.057
equal to the set A.
So who's union is A.

00:21:54.057 --> 00:21:55.890
So let's have a look,
again, at this example

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.790
and see whether we
can figure out what

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.700
the equivalence classes are.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.940
So the example is, well,
we can have everything

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.110
that this actually
a multiple of 5.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.320
That's this one class.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.790
So we have minus 5, 0, 5,
10, and we go all the way up.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.620
Another equivalence
class is, well,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.310
we just add 1 to each of those
elements here, so if minus 4

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.356
is congruent to 1, modulo
5 is congruent to 6,

00:22:28.356 --> 00:22:32.590
modulo 5 congruent
to 11, and so on.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.610
And so we can continue and we
actually see that we minus 3

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:41.230
is congruent to 2, to
7, to 12, and so on.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.630
That's the one we had up there.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:53.320
Another one is
minus 2, 3, 8, 13,

00:22:53.320 --> 00:23:01.760
and we have minus 1,
4, 9, 14, and so forth.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.880
So these are all the
equivalence classes

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.900
because now we look around.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.380
If we add one more
2 minus 1, we get 0.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.250
So we get 0, 5, 15, and
so on and that's exactly

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.980
the same class as this one.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:21.220
So we see that for this
particular example,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.460
we notice that these equivalence
classes are a partition of all

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.980
the integers.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:32.150
Turns out that this
is a general property

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.090
and we're not going
to prove this.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.680
That's pretty straightforward,
so you should actually

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.860
think about it yourself.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:47.840
Let's keep this up
here and take this out.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:24:00.728
So the theorem is that every
equivalence relation on a set A

00:24:00.728 --> 00:24:04.220
can be partitioned in
its questions classes.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:23.500
So the theorem is
the equivalence class

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:46.970
of an equivalence relation on
a set A form a partition of A.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.590
Now, I'm not going
to prove this.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.430
It's actually really
straightforward.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.876
You should really look at this
and see that you can prove this

00:24:54.876 --> 00:24:56.250
with the properties,
the property

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:00.260
definitions, and the definition
of an equivalence relation.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.720
So this is as far as we go
is equivalence relations.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.040
And so now we will continue
with partial orders.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.000
Again, we go through
a few definitions

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.290
and then at some point,
we'll be able to prove

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.280
a few interesting properties.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.305
So let's talk about
partial orders.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:26.290
So notice that we have shifted
now from in this diagram

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.739
over here, in this table,
from this pattern that you

00:25:30.739 --> 00:25:31.780
were first interested in.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.760
Now, we go to partial
orders and the difference

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.270
is going to be that we
do not have symmetry,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.420
but we do have antisymmetry
and that brings out

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.110
a whole different structure.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:56.900
So a relation is-- it's in
brackets I put here-- weak,

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.520
I'll explain in a
moment why I do this.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:11.780
It's a weak partial
order if it is

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:16.855
reflexive, and antisymmetric
and transitive.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.020
So why do I put weak up here?

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.700
Well, if you look in the book,
there are two definitions,

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:42.200
one is a weak partial order,
which is with reflexivity

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.230
and another one is a
strong partial order.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.420
And that one has a
property that I did not

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.240
talk about here
called irreflexibility

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.650
and it's something that I will
not talk about in this lecture,

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.420
but you should read about
it and all these properties,

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.950
all the theorems that we talk
about right now also hold

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.250
for the strong version
of a partial order.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:09.280
But for now, let's just
call partial orders

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.810
those that are reflexive,
antisymmetric, and transitive.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.720
Well, we already saw a
few examples up here.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:29.440
We have divisibility, which has
this property and also the less

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.795
than or equal relationship.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.030
Now usually what
we do is, instead

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:43.470
of using a capital letter R,
we will use a relation symbol.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:58.550
So a partial order relation
is denoted differently,

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:13.900
is denoted with something
like that instead of R. Now

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:19.950
the reason for that is
because we have actually

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.450
will show that there's
a partial order,

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:28.990
so this name does
not come by itself.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:32.910
It turns out that we can give
an order to the order ranking

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:37.200
to the elements, one element
is less than another and so on.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:47.180
So let's keep this over
here and change up here.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:58.100
So an example that we will talk
about in the moment, but first

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.570
let me introduce
some more notations.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:12.240
So we call the pair A with
this relationship symbol

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.490
is actually called a
partially ordered set.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:30.005
And we also abbreviate
this by calling it a poset.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.300
Now, in a poset,
again, can be described

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.550
by means of a directed graph,
so we can do that as well.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:52.110
So poset is a
directed graph such

00:29:52.110 --> 00:30:01.360
that it has the vertex
set A and the edge set

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.060
is defined by the relationship.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:11.010
So the edge set is
actually this thing.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:14.040
Notice that in our definition,
this is actually a set, right?

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.810
It's still a set.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:24.050
It's a set of tuples, of
pairs, and we can, again,

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:28.690
create a directed graph by using
this, so nothing has changed.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:35.950
But for posets, we can actually
create a more sort of easier

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.080
to read sort of
representation, which we'll

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.870
call a Hesse diagram,
which is also a graph

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.470
and let me give an example
to explain how that works.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.023
So I think we can take this out.

00:30:57.436 --> 00:31:04.860
So the example is, imagine
that a guy is going to dress up

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.430
for something very formal.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:10.020
So how does he start out?

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:15.590
So let's have as vertices in
the graph, in this diagram

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:21.690
or the elements of A is going to
be all items that he will start

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.460
to put on and start wearing,
so his pants, his shirt,

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:24.990
and so on.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.250
So let's have a look.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.620
So what do you start off with?

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.970
Well, maybe your underwear
would be a good idea.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.620
So this could be a first
item that you want to put on.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:44.770
So let's have the relation that
we are interested in to be one

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.610
where we say, well, I first
need to put on my underwear

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:53.130
and only after that I can
put on my pants, for example.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.150
So that makes sense too.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.400
And since I'm doing something
very formal later on,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.970
I better first put
on my shirt because I

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.470
like to tuck that into
my pants, but it's not

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.130
really necessary to
first put on my underwear

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.190
or first put on my shirt.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.860
I can do either of the two.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.780
So we're getting sort of
the I don't care so much.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:22.800
I want to put on a tie,
put on a jacket as well,

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:30.240
and after the pants, I
need to put on my belt,

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.590
but I like to finish all that
before I put on my jacket.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:42.580
And I also have my right
sock that I like to put on

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:49.042
and I need to do this first
before I put on my right shoe.

00:32:49.042 --> 00:32:50.025
That makes sense.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.650
And I definitely like to
finish putting on my pants

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.380
before I put on my shoes.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:05.280
So let's have a preference
relationship over here as well.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.420
But I do not really
care, actually.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.930
I can put on my socks
first and then my underwear

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:12.890
and then my shirt.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.780
I don't mind so much.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:22.370
I also have my left
sock and my left shoe.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:31.530
And again, I like
this to be preceded

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.270
by putting on my pants.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.410
So this could be a relation,
a sort of a description

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.690
of a partial order.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:42.290
Well, because it's
a Hesse diagram,

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:45.370
so let's talk about
it a little bit

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:52.150
and then I will define what the
official definition of this is.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.450
So let's first look at this.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.440
So this is a partial order.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.160
It means [? a ?] percent
of partial order,

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.710
so it's reflexive.

00:34:07.676 --> 00:34:11.840
The pants are related to
themselves, so I put them on.

00:34:16.134 --> 00:34:18.550
Before I put on the pants, I
need to put on the underwear,

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:23.610
but if I need to put on my belt
after I put on my underwear,

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.159
then also I notice I first
need to put on my underwear

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:28.989
before I put on my belt.

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:33.329
So you have transitivity
in this example.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:43.610
It's also the other property
is that it is antisymmetric.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.980
It's not true that I can first
put on my right shoe and then

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:54.409
my right sock, so we only
have one direction over here.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:56.659
Now, I did not put
in all the edges

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.730
that are possible for
this partial order

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.080
because if I really
want to continue this,

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.840
if I really want to create the
complete directed graph that I

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:13.390
talked about over here-- I think
it talks about it somewhere--

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.670
over here, I can create
a directed graph that

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.610
has its vertex set A, which
are all the items that I want

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:20.490
to put on.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:28.800
And in that set that has all
the different relationships.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.620
Now, this is only
an abbreviated form.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.080
This is a Hesse
diagram, but if I

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.010
would look at a
directed graph, then I

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.260
would need to look at the
closure of this whole thing.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.500
That's how I would call it.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.610
And I know that, for
example, this underwear,

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.210
by transitivity,
is also less than

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.010
or equal than or
related to the belt.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:36:04.240
So in a full graph, I would
have another edge over here.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.570
And in a same way, I would
have an edge from here to here.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:13.510
I would have an edge over
here by transitivity.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.560
Also I can see that the
shirt goes before the pants,

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.840
before the right
shoe, so the shirt

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:24.190
is also related all the
way to the right shoe

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.210
and similarly to the left shoe.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:30.260
I also have that I have
self loops in here,

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:35.440
like a tie is related to itself,
a jacket as well, and so forth.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.800
So I can put in all these
extra edges and as you can see,

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.380
this will be quite a
mess, so the Hesse diagram

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.440
is a much nicer,
official interpretation

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.430
of what's going on.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:37:00.890
So let's define what this
really is and then we'll

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:04.436
continue with some nice
properties of this structure.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.430
So what is a Hesse diagram?

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:23.350
A Hesse diagram is
really one in which I

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:30.360
use the set A as the vertices.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.626
So it is a directed graph--
a different one than the one

00:37:38.626 --> 00:37:40.000
that we talked
about it up there.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:52.600
So it's a directed graph in
which we have the vertex set A,

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.350
but the edge set is a
little bit different.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:38:01.190
So it is the edge set
that corresponds to this,

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.230
but they subtract a whole bunch.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:09.330
First of all, we remove all
the self loops that we have,

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:16.750
so minus all the self
loops and we also

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:24.075
take out all the edges that
are implied by transitivity.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.510
So that's a definition
of a Hesse diagram.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:48.100
Now, when we look at the
Hesse diagram over here,

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.520
so let me take out these
nodes again or these edges.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.440
So looking at this
Hesse diagram,

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.920
you really see a nice
structure in there.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.880
It seems like we can talk about
smallest elements like a shirt,

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.000
just like a small element.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.720
It's sort of less
than or equal to

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.100
if you think about this
as being the 3%, then

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.190
the tie and the jacket and
the pants and the right shoe

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.260
and so on.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.910
So you can see a clear order
in this particular graph.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:35.470
So let's have a look at this.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:39.210
When I look at this graph, I
also do not see any cycles.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.953
I do not see that the
shirt is less than

00:39:41.953 --> 00:39:42.927
or equal to the pants.

00:39:42.927 --> 00:39:45.510
It's related to the right shoe
and then it's related to itself

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.210
again, so I do not
see any cycles.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:52.260
And this turns out to be
general property of posets

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.150
and that's what we are
going to prove next.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:02.140
So let's do that over here.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:19.470
So you see that
there are no cycles

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:20.850
and it's a general property.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:39.880
So the theorem is that a
poset has no directed cycles

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:45.210
other than self loops.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.400
Now, notice that this
property is really necessary

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.360
to have a proper representation
by using a Hesse diagram

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:07.740
because otherwise, if you have
a big, directed cycle, then only

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.260
one of those edges would be
part of the Hesse diagram

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.920
and all the others are implied
by transitivity sort of.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.060
And that is getting
a little bit messy

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.810
because then we do not really
have a unique representation.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.560
But luckily, there are
no directed cycles.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.465
So how do we prove this?

00:41:25.465 --> 00:41:32.350
Well, let's do this
by contradiction

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:37.560
and see what happens.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.460
So suppose the contrary.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:46.640
So suppose that actually
there exists at least two,

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:56.330
an integer, at least two, so
at least n distinct elements,

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.220
a1 all the way up
to an that form

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:18.720
a cycle, so such that you
have a directed cycle.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.220
So we would put it
in formula like this.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:35.600
a1 is related to a2 to a3 and so
on all the way up to an minus 1

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.643
an.

00:42:36.643 --> 00:42:42.480
And we have a cycle, so
this goes back to a1.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.560
So why would this
be a contradiction?

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.920
So maybe you can
help me out here.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.150
So what can I already
derive from those properties

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.140
that I have over here?

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:58.400
So I know that the partial
order is antisymmetric,

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.970
it is transitive,
it's reflexive.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:07.839
So how can I get to
a contradiction here?

00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:09.380
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:16.790
Is it possible, for example,
that we could violate

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:23.460
the antisymmetry of the poset?

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:27.720
So can we find maybe two
distinct elements such that

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.780
say x is related to y
and y is related to x,

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:38.810
but it's not true
that x is equal to y.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:43.080
For example, if you
have very small cycle,

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:52.940
say a1 is related to an and
then related to a1, again,

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.960
well, then I would
have that a1 is related

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.930
to an and an is related to a1.

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:02.900
We should have that an is
then equal to a1 but, that's

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:07.850
not true because the issue of
distinct elements over here.

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:09.610
So that seems to be
an interesting idea.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:15.340
So maybe we can prove
something of that type.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:21.970
So can we actually show
that a1 is related to an?

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.040
We can write what kind
of a property of a poset

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.080
do we use here to
make that happen?

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:35.650
I heard something
vaguely, a mumble.

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:37.600
Yeah, the transitive property.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.840
So how do we do it?

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.790
Well, we take those
three together

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:45.630
and we conclude that a1
is also related to a3.

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:51.940
We have a4 over here, so
together with this one,

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.420
so a1 is related to a3
and a3 is related to a4.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:00.920
We have that a1 is related to
a4 and you can use induction

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.310
if you want to be
very precise here,

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:07.740
which you should, actually,
but I will not do this.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.590
So you will use induction and
go all the way to the fact

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:15.110
that a1 is actually
related to an.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.710
But wait a minute.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:22.560
We also have this
particular property

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:28.330
and a1 is not equal to
an by our assumption.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:33.300
So we get a contradiction,
which means that what

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.150
we had over here is not true.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.720
So actually, for
all n, at least two,

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:45.440
n distinct elements
a1 up to an that--

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:51.220
well, we have the negative of
this, so there is no cycle.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.910
So this is a great
property, so now we

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:58.510
start to see why a
poset is actually called

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:00.530
a partial ordered, right?

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.870
Because there's
no directed cycles

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:06.360
other than the self
loops, so we sort of

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.210
have a ranking to the elements.

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:13.180
We can say that
really one element

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.170
is ranked less than another.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:16.890
So this one is ranked
less than this,

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.650
it's ranked less than that,
and it cannot circle back again

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:22.760
and say that this one is ranked
less than this because they

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:27.520
don't have cycles, so that
makes a really consistent story.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.270
Notice that this was different
when we talked about tournament

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:32.470
grass, for example.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.450
That was a very
different structure

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:39.920
and we could not think
of a winner in there.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:44.890
But in this case,
we have a ranking.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:53.220
And this leads us to a
more general discussion.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:57.860
But before we go into that,
I'd like to write down

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.500
a conclusion of this theorem.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:15.210
So after deleting the
self loops from a poset,

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:22.020
we actually get a
directed acyclic graph.

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.010
And that's what we
defined last week as well.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:31.650
So a directed acyclic graph
and we abbreviate this

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.895
as D-A-G, a DAG.

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:41.300
So that's a very special
property for the poset.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.650
Now a partial order has elements
that cannot be compared,

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:52.090
for example.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:57.890
Like in this case, these two
have absolutely no relationship

00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:59.130
with one another.

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:03.900
Even through transitivity, I
cannot conclude that either

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:08.970
the right sock is related to
the underwear or the underwear

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.970
related to the right sock.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:16.200
And that makes it
a partial order.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.580
It's possible that you have
elements, pairs of elements,

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.480
that are incomparable.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.920
So let me write this down.

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:36.650
So what we really
want to though,

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.480
is that we have some kind
of consistent ranking

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.620
that we can create for
a partial ordered set.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.980
But for now, we know that
certain pairs cannot be

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.710
compared to one another and we
would like to achieve something

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.170
like this.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:56.360
So that's why we start to
talk about what it means

00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:06.870
if a and b are
incomparable and this

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:19.880
is, if neither a is related
to b nor b is related to a.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:28.720
And we say that a and
b are comparable well,

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:34.148
if a is related to b
or b is related to a.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.920
Now we can have a
very special order

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.620
which we call total order.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:53.564
In a total order, it's
actually partial order, but all

00:49:53.564 --> 00:49:54.730
the elements and comparable.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:17.490
So it's a partial order in
which every pair of elements

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:18.170
is comparable.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.770
Now, maybe you can
think about the Hesse

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:24.570
diagram of a total order.

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:26.360
What would it look
like if we have

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.300
that all the elements
are actually comparable?

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:36.330
Do you have any idea what
kind of a graph would that be?

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:40.260
So in this case, we had the
partial order because we see

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:45.350
that certain items
cannot be compared,

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.500
but what happens if
you have a total order?

00:50:50.979 --> 00:50:51.770
For example-- yeah.

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:52.720
Do you have a--

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.084
AUDIENCE: It would
be a straight line.

00:50:55.084 --> 00:50:56.000
MARTEN VAN DIJK: Yeah.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:56.670
That's correct.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.330
It will be straight line.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:06.070
And it will look something
like this and it keeps on going

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:09.351
and over here also,
keeps on going like this.

00:51:09.351 --> 00:51:10.350
So it's a straight line.

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:15.660
If it's a finite set, we
have a finite line, so just

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:18.070
a finite number of vertices,
but otherwise, it's

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:22.940
just an infinite line or a
half or semi infinite line.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.510
So why is that?

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:29.350
with every two elements, it
can be compared to one another,

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:31.925
so you can rank them
essentially along this line.

00:51:31.925 --> 00:51:34.320
So if you think about
the integers and the less

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.490
than or equal to
relation, well, we

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.605
see that one is less
than or equal to 2

00:51:38.605 --> 00:51:40.750
and 2 is less than or
equal to 3 and so on.

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:46.880
So they all are put in Hesse
diagram as a straight line.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.960
So that's is very special order.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.510
We have a ranking
with the total order

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.015
through this straight line.

00:51:55.015 --> 00:51:57.670
It will be great if you
can also rank the elements

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:59.660
in a partial order
and that's what

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.950
we're going to talk about next.

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:07.030
We're going to talk about the
topological sort of a poset.

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:10.920
And what it really means is
that we're going to extend,

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:14.850
essentially the partial
order toward a total order.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.240
And by doing that,
we will manage

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.860
to put a ranking
to all the items.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.220
Let me define what's
happening here.

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:33.260
So this is about equivalence
classes and you remember this.

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:49.270
So what is a topological sort?

00:52:49.270 --> 00:53:01.780
So the idea is that
if the total order

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:14.110
is consistent with
a partial order,

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:19.620
then it is called
a topological sort.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.975
So let me redefine it
again more formally.

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:37.580
So what is it?

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:47.910
A topological sort of
a poset is formally

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:53.190
defined as a total order.

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:07.560
It's a total order that has the
same set of items of elements A

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:11.490
but has a different
relation that we

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:15.110
will denote by a subscript, t.

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:23.280
And this is such that
well, the original relation

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:28.320
is contained in the new one.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.315
Notice that these
also denote sets,

00:54:30.315 --> 00:54:31.940
so that's why I can
write it like this.

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:37.540
So this set that is
defined by this relation

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:41.430
is a subset of this relation.

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:46.420
So it simply means that
if x is related to y,

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:50.170
then it also implies
that x is related

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:53.050
to y in the total order.

00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.460
So we're interested
in figuring out

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.510
where we can find such
a topological sort.

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:03.210
Is it always possible to do so?

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:18.240
Now it turns out that
every finite poset actually

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.900
has a topological sort and
we're going to prove this.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.110
How do we do that?

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:33.860
So let me first write
out the theorem.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:53.290
The theorem is that every finite
poset has a topological sort.

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:56.470
The basic idea is that
in order to prove this,

00:55:56.470 --> 00:56:00.070
it's that we're going to look at
a minimal element in the poset.

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:03.370
For example, in the diagram,
we have four minimal elements.

00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:05.280
I will define what that means.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.480
The left sock and the right sock
and the underwear and the shirt

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.360
are all at the top
of the Hesse diagram.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.720
Those are minimal elements.

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:18.090
I just take one of them,
take it out of the poset

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:20.320
that I'm looking at.

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.550
I will get a smaller
poset and recursively, I'm

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:26.890
going to construct
my total order.

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:30.440
So it's a total order
on a smaller poset

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.700
and then I add the
minimal element back to it

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.490
and then I get a total
order for the whole thing.

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:37.890
So essentially I'm
going to use induction

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:42.770
and before I can do that, I'm
going to first talk about what

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:45.810
it means to have
a minimal element

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:47.630
because that's what we need.

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:57.160
So x in A is called
minimal if it's not true

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:03.810
that there exists a y in A,
which is different from x,

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:11.610
but such that y
is smaller than x.

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:18.380
So there exist no other y
in A that is smaller than x.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:20.560
Then if that's true, we
call x a minimal element.

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.060
And in the same
way, of course, we

00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:26.165
can talk about a
maximal element.

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:35.310
It's exactly the same,
but at the very end,

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:40.060
we will have the reverse,
so x is related to y.

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.260
Now, it turns out that not every
poset has a minimal element,

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.440
actually.

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:50.310
So as an example, we may
consider the integers,

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:53.820
the negative and positive
numbers and then less than

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:56.590
or equal to relation.

00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:58.430
There does not exist
a minimal element.

00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:00.960
You can always find
a smaller elements.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:04.030
So it's not really true
that every poset actually

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:05.420
has a minimal element.

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:08.360
It turns out though
that in a finite poset,

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.500
we do have minimal
elements and then we

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:15.020
can start doing the
proof by induction.

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:19.860
So let's prove this, that
every finite poset has

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.090
a minimal element.

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:27.620
So let's do that up here.

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.420
Actually, we do need
this theorem later on.

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:38.070
So let's start out here.

00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:41.460
So the limit that
we want to prove

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:55.910
is that every finite poset
has a minimal element.

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:57.645
And in order to do
that, we're going

00:58:57.645 --> 00:59:01.760
to define what is
called a chain.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:05.976
And a chain is this
sequence of elements that

00:59:05.976 --> 00:59:07.100
are related to one another.

00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:18.160
It's a sequence of
distinct elements

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:26.240
such that a1 is smaller
than a2, smaller than a3,

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.470
and so on up to some at.

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:32.500
And the length of a chain
we will denote by t.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.105
So this is going
to be the length.

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.960
So now let's have a proof of
this lemma and with that lemma,

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.410
we will then be able to prove
the theorem that we want

00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:46.960
to do on the topological sort.

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:59.660
So let's see how we can do this.

00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.895
So what's the proof going to be?

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.870
Well, you want to
construct a minimal element

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.700
that we think would be minimal
and how are we going to do it?

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:16.070
We're going to look at the
chain that has the largest

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:18.070
length, the maximum length.

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:34.600
So let a1 related to a2 and so
on to an be a maximum length

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.090
chain.

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:38.710
Now, I'm cheating
here a little bit

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:42.890
because how do I know that
such a chain actually exists?

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:45.770
Does there exist a
maximum length chain?

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.520
So that you may want
to think about it.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:55.030
So it actually does exist and
if you think about it yourself,

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:59.070
then you will
actually use the fact

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:01.010
that we use a finite poset.

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.985
If you have a finite
number of elements,

01:01:02.985 --> 01:01:05.300
well, the maximum
length chain can

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.340
be at most the number of
elements in the poset,

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.910
so you always have
a maximum number,

01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:12.370
but you can prove
it more formally

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:14.730
by using the
well-ordering principle.

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:19.550
But I will not do that here, so
we issue for now that this just

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:23.110
exists, but you can prove it.

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:24.620
So let's look at two cases.

01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:28.160
So what do we want to do?

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.790
We want to show that a1 is
actually minimum element.

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:35.130
So let us consider any
other element in the set

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:37.080
and then we have two case.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.270
Either a is actually
not a part of a1,

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:44.850
a2, all the way up to an.

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:56.180
Well, in that case, if a is less
than a1, well, what goes wrong?

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.146
I can put a up front here.

01:01:58.146 --> 01:02:00.020
It's a different element
from all the others.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.890
I get a longer chain.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.480
So that's not possible, right?

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:10.560
So we'll get a longer chain
and that's a contradiction.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.060
So this assumption is not true.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:16.000
So it's not true that
a is less than a1.

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:22.420
What's the other case?

01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:27.000
The other case is that a is
an element of one of those.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So it's one of
those in the chain.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.930
Now, let's have a
look what happens if a

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:40.870
is less than or equal to a1.

01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:41.620
But wait a minute.

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:48.100
If a is one of these and a
is less than or equal to a1,

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.433
then I will have a
cycle, a1 is less than

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:54.120
or equal to a is less
than or equal to a1,

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.380
but you just showed
in the theorem

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:59.990
that there are no other
exit cycles in a poset,

01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:04.670
so this would imply
that we have a cycle.

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:07.480
And according to the theorem up
there, we have a contradiction.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:14.080
So also in this case it's not
true that a is less than a1.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.150
Now this is the definition
of a minimal elements.

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:18.910
So let's have a look
at this definition.

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:26.880
We have proof now that for every
possibility every possible item

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:34.670
or element in set
A, it's not true

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:39.240
that that new element
is smaller than a1.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.520
So a1 is actually
a minimum element

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.780
according to the definition.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.640
So a1 is minimal, that's
what we have shown.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.245
So great.

01:03:49.245 --> 01:03:52.555
We have shown that there
exists a minimum element,

01:03:52.555 --> 01:03:55.430
so this is the
end of this proof.
