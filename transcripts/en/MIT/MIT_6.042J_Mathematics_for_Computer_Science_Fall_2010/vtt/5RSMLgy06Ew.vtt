00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.500
PROFESSOR: OK, on Tuesday
we talked about sex,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.520
so today we're going
to talk about marriage.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.770
Now, in terms of
graph theory, marriage

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.970
is expressed as a
matching problem,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.070
and today we're going to talk
about a matching algorithm that

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.070
is used in all sorts
of applications.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.000
It's used by online
dating agencies

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.720
to match compatible
people together.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.830
It's used for
assignment problems,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.900
for example, matching interns
to hospitals on match day.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.630
It's used for resource
allocation problems,

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.019
for example, load balancing
traffic on the internet.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.570
And we'll talk about
the applications

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.070
at the end of class.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.960
In its simplest form
of a matching problem,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.690
you have a graph where the
edges represent compatibility.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.290
Two nodes can be paired
together, or married,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.140
and the goal is to
create the maximum number

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.470
of compatible pairs.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:36.090
So let's define a
matching, given a graph, G,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.830
with nodes, V, and
edges, E. In matching,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.900
you can think of it as
a collection of edges,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:58.220
or a subgraph of G where
every node has degree 1.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.710
So everybody can be
married just to one person.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:36.575
So let's draw an example,
maybe not put that edge in.

00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:54.170
And let's label these nodes x1,
x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, and x8.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:06.630
Now x1, x6 and x2, x5 is a
matching, so x1, x6 and x2,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.560
x5 is a matching with two edges,
so we say it has size two.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.990
All right, so I can pair these
guys up and pair these guys up.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.890
Is there any bigger
matching in this graph?

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.270
So I found one with
two marriages, here

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.860
and here, two edges.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.844
Yeah?

00:03:36.844 --> 00:03:38.320
AUDIENCE: x1, x7.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.140
PROFESSOR: x1, x7.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.670
AUDIENCE: x2, x6.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.990
PROFESSOR: x2, x6.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.044
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:44.044 --> 00:03:44.710
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.330
All right, that's a
matching of size three.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.840
So I got three couples together.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.790
Good.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.168
Can I make a bigger matching,
one with size four--

00:03:58.168 --> 00:03:59.370
four marriages here?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.130
No.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.030
Why not?

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.620
Can anybody give me a
reason why it can't be done?

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.074
Yeah?

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:20.810
AUDIENCE: x8 and x7 would have
to be matched with someone.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.457
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so if-- Yeah?

00:04:22.457 --> 00:04:24.290
AUDIENCE: They could
only be paired with x1,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.824
but x1 can't be
paired with both.

00:04:25.824 --> 00:04:26.490
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.080
If I were to have a
matching with four edges,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.250
well, there's only
eight nodes, so I'd

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.800
have to have all eight nodes
involved in the matching.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.920
And that means x7 and x8 would
have to be in the matching,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.930
but they could only
be paired with x1,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.054
and so it's not
possible to do that.

00:04:45.054 --> 00:04:46.470
All right, so there
is no matching

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.810
of size four in this graph.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.310
Three is the best I can do.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.690
Now, when you get every
node in a matching,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.460
then it's called a
perfect matching.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.500
And so in this case, it doesn't
exist, but sometimes it does.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:15.460
So a matching is
perfect if it has

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.780
size half the number of nodes.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.050
In other words, if the
number of edges is v over 2,

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.650
then every node is
in the matching.

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.680
All right, so that one doesn't
have a perfect matching.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.600
What about this graph?

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:47.740
So I got b1, b2, b3,
b4, g1, g2, g3, g4,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.635
and I'll put in the
compatibility edges here.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:11.040
OK, Does that graph
have a perfect matching?

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.360
Can you pair up
every boy with a girl

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.610
here so that everybody is
compatible with their mate,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.948
and you have just one spouse?

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:21.995
Can you do that?

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:25.300
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.966
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:27.730
All right, who do
I start pairing up?

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.350
AUDIENCE: 1, 1.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.130
AUDIENCE: 1, 1.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.190
AUDIENCE: b2, g3.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.940
PROFESSOR: b2, g3.

00:06:36.762 --> 00:06:37.470
AUDIENCE: b3, g2.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.382
PROFESSOR: b3, g2

00:06:39.382 --> 00:06:40.090
AUDIENCE: b4, g4.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.048
PROFESSOR: There we go.

00:06:41.048 --> 00:06:44.100
All right, so there is a
perfect matching in this graph.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.000
Very good.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.790
Now, in some cases,
some pairings

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.560
are more desirable than
others, and this can

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.347
be represented with a weight.

00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:57.180
And so you might have
a weighted graph where

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.400
every edge has a weight on it.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:07.510
For example, we might
weight b1, g2 with 5,

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.170
and b1, g1 gets a 10.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.290
And usually when you
see weighted graphs

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.910
in the matching
context, a lower weight

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:21.000
means it's more desirable, so
that b1 and g2 would get along

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.510
better than b1 and g1.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.740
And then the goal is to find a
matching with minimum weight.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:44.740
Now, the weight of a
matching, call it M,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:08:01.400
is the sum of the weights
on the edges of M. Now,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.940
usually when you're looking
at weighted matchings,

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.130
you require yourself to
have a perfect matching so

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.930
that everybody gets paired up.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.830
And often in that case, you'll
see all the edges present,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.920
some of them with very big
weights, maybe even infinity

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.860
if they just can't
be put together.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.539
Because otherwise you just say,
don't match anybody together,

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:22.580
and you have weight zero.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.620
So for when you look at
minimum weight matchings,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.120
you're looking for the perfect
matching with minimum weight.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:47.180
So we say a min-weight
matching for a graph, G,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:59.410
is a perfect matching for
G with the minimum weight,

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.545
overall perfect matchings.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.690
Let's try an example.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:21.780
Say I've got this graph,
and call this node Brad,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:28.626
here's Billy Bob, here's
Jennifer, and then Angelina.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.870
And the weights are as
follows-- I put a 10 here,

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.710
a 10 down here, a 5
here, because Brad really

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.790
likes Angelina and vice versa,
and a 16 between Jennifer

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.070
and Billy Bob.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:50.980
What is the weight of the min
weight matching in that graph?

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.080
20.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.760
And who gets paired
with who there?

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.710
Who does Brad get
hooked up with?

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.210
AUDIENCE: Jan.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:08.480
PROFESSOR: Jan, and that
leaves Billy Bob with Angelina,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.030
and the weight is 20.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.700
So even though Brad really likes
Angelina, if I go that route,

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.730
my weight is 21,
which is not as good.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.240
So the min-weight matching
would be this one.

00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:24.620
OK.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.890
Now, it turns out that
finding the maximum matching--

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.580
the maximum number of edges
you can put together--

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.580
or finding the minimum
weight perfect matching,

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.110
those are both solvable,
tractable problems.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.910
You don't get a million
dollar prize for solving that.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.440
The algorithm is run in
quadratic to cubic time,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.330
so not terrible, but
they're not NP-complete,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.720
so people know how to do it.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.790
Now, they are
pretty complicated,

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.310
so we're not going to
cover them in 6042.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.180
What we're going to do is look
at a slightly different version

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.414
of the problem that
actually turns out

00:11:00.414 --> 00:11:02.330
to be more useful in
practice, because there's

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.970
a very nice algorithm for it.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.980
Now, in the version of
the problem that we're

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.720
going to look at, everybody
has preferences-- a preference

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.560
list.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.490
It's not weighted, but
it's a priority order

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.540
of who they want to get
mated to, or matched up with.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.654
So it would look
not quite like that,

00:11:21.654 --> 00:11:22.820
but it would look like this.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:40.480
So Brad, Billy Bob, Jennifer,
and Angelina-- same players,

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.050
but what we do is we know that
Brad really likes Angelina,

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.440
and Angelina really likes Brad,
so they are first choices,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.660
at least was.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.990
Number two for Brad is Jennifer,
but Jennifer really likes Brad

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.900
first, and Billy Bob second.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.200
Billy Bob likes Angelina
first, then Jennifer.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.370
Angelina thinks Billy
Bob is number two.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.740
So it's not
necessarily symmetric.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.720
Jennifer has Brad
as the first choice.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.350
Brad has Angelina
as the first choice.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.850
All right?

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.420
So it's an asymmetric situation.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.960
Now, what would happen if we set
up our marriages so that Brad

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.310
is married to Jen, and Billy
Bob is married to Angelina?

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.970
What might happen if we
made those as our pairings,

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.420
and we put them on a desert
island, all four of them?

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.469
What's likely to happen there?

00:12:36.469 --> 00:12:39.010
AUDIENCE: Brad and Angelina are
going to cheat on each other.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we're
going to have a problem.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.680
Because Brad and Angelina have
the hots for each other here,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.860
and they like each other
better than their spouse.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.360
So before you know
it, they're going

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.869
to be doing their 6042 homework
together late at night.

00:12:53.869 --> 00:12:55.170
All right?

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.330
Now, when this happens, we have
what's called a rogue couple.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:14.880
Given a matching, x and
y, a boy and a girl,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:39.640
say, form a rogue couple
if they prefer each other

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:53.470
over their mates
in M. All right.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.140
So here, if we married
Brad to Jennifer,

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.860
and Billy Bob to Angelina,
Brad and Angelina

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.280
form a rogue
couple, because they

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.759
like each other better than
who they were hooked up with.

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:05.050
And that's sort of a bad thing.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.810
It creates instability
if you were

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.530
to make the matchings that way.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:25.240
In fact, we say that
a matching is stable

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.235
if there aren't
any rogue couples.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.410
And now, one thing to make
clear is that your preferences

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.330
can't change over time.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.094
So it's not a situation where
you get bored with your spouse,

00:14:48.094 --> 00:14:49.510
and you change
your mind, and then

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.730
you go off and create
a rogue couple.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.840
You're fixed in your
preferences over all time,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.150
no playing the field, none
of that stuff here, OK?

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.590
So it's fixed once and for
all, and your goal, of course,

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:06.720
is to create or find a perfect
matching that's stable.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.410
That's the goal.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.070
So get everybody married
up and make it stable.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.750
All right, is it
doable in that example?

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.890
If I put those four
people on a desert island,

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:37.250
could I make a stable matching?

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.430
Yeah, who would I match Brad to?

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.330
AUDIENCE: Angelina.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.204
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:15:41.204 --> 00:15:43.650
Good, and then Billy
Bob gets Jennifer.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:48.250
Now, I'm not saying that
you make everybody happy,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.820
because Billy Bob and Jennifer
are probably not happy there.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.760
They each got their
number two choice.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.150
But it's stable, because
Brad and Angelina

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.277
aren't going anywhere.

00:15:58.277 --> 00:16:00.110
They are going to stay
together because they

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.232
like each other best, and so
there's no chance that Jennifer

00:16:03.232 --> 00:16:06.810
is going to-- that Angelina
is going to sneak off, sorry,

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.990
with Billy Bob, or
that Brad's going

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.500
to sneak off with Jennifer.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.000
All right?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.040
So it's stable.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.510
Not everybody's happy, but
it's a stable set of marriages.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.020
OK.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.360
Any questions about what
we're trying to do here now?

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.212
Yeah?

00:16:25.212 --> 00:16:30.292
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the edges?

00:16:30.292 --> 00:16:31.750
PROFESSOR: That's
a great question.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.200
You'll see it
referred to both ways.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.495
Technically, it's a subgraph,
so it has nodes and edges,

00:16:37.495 --> 00:16:39.870
but you'll see me, and you'll
see everybody say, oh, it's

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.165
a bunch of edges that
don't share any nodes,

00:16:42.165 --> 00:16:44.040
and you'll see them
refer to it as the edges.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.320
But really, underlying that,
it's a subgraph, technically.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.590
Any other questions
about what we're

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.100
trying to do here to find
stable, perfect matching?

00:16:57.842 --> 00:16:58.760
All right.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.900
Well, in this example, there
was a stable, perfect matching.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.288
But what about in general?

00:17:04.288 --> 00:17:05.829
If I have a lot more
people, and they

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.910
have arbitrary preferences,
how many people

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:14.099
think you can always find
a stable perfect matching?

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.774
There's one optimistic person.

00:17:15.774 --> 00:17:18.190
How many people think there's
some cases where you're just

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.790
not going to be able to do it?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.329
Wow.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.450
OK, it's a pessimistic view.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.099
Well, in some sense
you're both right.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:33.820
If you allow boys to prefer
boys and girls to prefer girls,

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.600
then it is not possible, and
I'll give you an example.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.560
You can find examples where
there's always a rogue couple,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.000
but if you require boys to only
get matched to girls and vice

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.920
versa, then it is possible to
always find stable marriages,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.294
stable matchings.

00:17:50.294 --> 00:17:52.460
And we're going to talk
about an algorithm for that.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.870
But before I show
you the algorithm,

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.040
let me show you the bad case
when boys can prefer boys,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.460
or what's sort of
a unisex scenario.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.130
So here's a bad example
with four people,

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.900
and the idea is to
create a love triangle.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:20.020
So we have Alex, who prefers
Bobby Joe, Bobby Joe prefers

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:25.620
Robin, and Robin prefers Alex.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.060
And their second choices
go in the opposite order

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:28.850
there, all right?

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.100
So Alex wants to
be with Bobby Joe.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.350
Bobby Joe wants be with Robin.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.750
Robin wants to be with Alex.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.417
And then there's Mergatoid--

00:18:35.417 --> 00:18:35.916
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.310
--and nobody likes Mergatoid.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:45.780
So that's choice three
for all of them here.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.520
And Mergatoid's
choices, preferences

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.670
don't really matter
in this case.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.220
I hope nobody is named
Mergatoid in the class.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.220
I would get complaints here.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.520
All right, so I want
to claim and prove

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.130
a theorem that says there
is no stable matching

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.960
for this group of preferences.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.336
So we'll state that
as the theorem.

00:19:11.336 --> 00:19:18.060
There does not exist a stable
matching for this graph.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.430
The proof is by contradiction--
assume there is one.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:40.212
All right, so assume there
exists a stable matching.

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:41.920
We're going to find
a rogue couple in it.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:54.790
So call the stable
matching M. Well,

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.940
if there's a stable
matching, Mergatoid's got

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.065
to get married to somebody.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.635
Mergatoid will be
matched with someone.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:20.130
All right.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.790
Now, here I'm going
to do something

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.540
that you can do in
your proofs, but you've

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.915
got to be careful
when you do it.

00:20:24.915 --> 00:20:28.450
I'm going to say, without
loss of generality,

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:34.250
assume Mergatoid is
matched to Alex, all right?

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.610
And I can do that.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.340
So this is the
abbreviation, without loss

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.175
of generality by symmetry.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.265
And really, I should explain
what I mean here in the proof.

00:20:46.265 --> 00:20:49.506
Well, that love
triangle is symmetric.

00:20:49.506 --> 00:20:51.380
Each one has a preference
for the next person

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.670
around the triangle.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.610
In terms of graph isomorphism,
with the weights on that,

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.030
every node looks the same.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.880
So I can use symmetry.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.570
So we're going to say,
without loss of generality,

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:12.015
we're going to assume
Mergatoid is matched to Alex.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.140
And I'm implying the argument
is going to be the same.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.730
What I say next is
the same no matter

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.665
who Mergatoid is matched
to, because it's symmetric.

00:21:25.665 --> 00:21:26.165
All right.

00:21:26.165 --> 00:21:28.510
If Mergatoid is
matched to Alex, do you

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.920
see a rogue couple up there?

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.520
So you have Robin
matched to Bobby Joe.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.476
Mergatoid is matched to Alex.

00:21:41.476 --> 00:21:43.330
AUDIENCE: Alex to Bobby Joe?

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.756
PROFESSOR: Alex
and Bobby Joe, no.

00:21:46.756 --> 00:21:48.130
AUDIENCE: Between
Alex and Robin.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.800
PROFESSOR: Alex and Robin, yeah.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:56.560
Alex and Bobby Joe aren't rogue,
because Bobby Joe likes Robin.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.040
He likes the person he
or she is married to.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.570
All right, so they're not
going to go off with Alex,

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.450
but Alex and Robin
are a rogue couple,

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:08.060
because Robin likes Alex
the best, and Alex for sure

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.630
likes Robin better
than Mergatoid.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:11.130
All right?

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.730
So they both prefer each
other to their mates,

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.820
and so they form a rogue couple.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:31.080
All right, so Alex and
Robin form a rogue couple,

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.760
and that means that
M was not stable.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.250
The matching was not stable.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.510
And that's a contradiction,
because we assumed it was.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.535
So we have a contradiction,
and the proof is done.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:55.210
Any questions about that?

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.370
And I'm sort of implying
here that you could match,

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.840
you could have had Mergatoid
matched to Bobby Joe,

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.960
and then Bobby Joe and Alex
would have been a rogue couple,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.490
or Mergatoid matched to Robin,
and then Robin and Bobby Joe

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.857
would be a rogue couple by the
without loss of generality.

00:23:13.857 --> 00:23:15.940
So it's OK to use that,
but you want to be careful

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.925
that you're doing it OK.

00:23:18.925 --> 00:23:19.425
Questions?

00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:22.740
Yeah?

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.030
AUDIENCE: So the without
loss of generality only

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.320
works if it's, like,
perfectly symmetric?

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.337
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:23:28.337 --> 00:23:30.170
Basically, the argument
you're going to make

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.710
is just going to be the same
argument done in all three

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.844
cases, and to save yourself
some effort, you're saying,

00:23:35.844 --> 00:23:38.010
don't do the three cases,
do one, the other two look

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:38.990
the same.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.630
So technically, you could add
case one, case two, case three,

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.240
and they would've
looked symmetric.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.300
OK?

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:46.800
All right.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.300
Now, this is not very
surprising, as you all voted.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.087
Almost all of you said it's
hard to find stable matchings.

00:23:53.087 --> 00:23:54.670
You might not be
able to do it always.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.880
And in fact, you can't
in the unisex world.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.250
The surprising thing is, you can
always find a stable matching

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.410
in the world where boys
could only be paired

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.340
with girls and vice versa.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.750
Now, this statement, this
result is pretty famous.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:19.300
The problem itself is known as
the stable marriage problem.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.130
So let me just define
it here, and then we'll

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:27.360
talk about an algorithm
to find the matching.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.785
So we have N boys and N girls.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.190
And it's important we have
the same number of each.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.110
Now, actually, tomorrow,
in recitation, you're

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.540
going to look at the
scenario where there's more

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.010
girls than boys, or vice versa.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.330
And you'll be using
a similar algorithm,

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.750
but it'll be a
different context,

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.530
and that's the
context that comes up

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:11.077
in matching interns to
hospitals, and stuff like that.

00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:13.535
But for our version it's an
equal number of boys and girls.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:28.960
Each boy has his own
ranked preference

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:35.190
list of all the girls.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.850
So every boy sort of
has his dance card

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.781
of the girls that
he likes in order.

00:25:40.781 --> 00:25:41.280
All right?

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.580
The orders can be different
for different boys.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.820
And each girl has
the same thing.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:52.510
She has her own list, ranked
1 to n of all the boys.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.390
The lists are complete,
and there's no ties,

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.930
so all the ties have
to be broken here.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.884
And the goal is to
find a perfect matching

00:26:03.884 --> 00:26:04.800
without rogue couples.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.150
OK, so let's try an example.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:32.730
Before we do the algorithm,
let me just do a bigger example

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.530
with five boys and
five girls, and we'll

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.870
get some feel for, this is
not completely obvious how

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:40.760
to find it.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:08.360
OK, so let's put
the boys over here.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:13.250
And here's boy 1, and
his preference list

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:23.140
is going to be-- the girls
will be C, B, E, A, D, and boy

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:28.460
2 is going to have
the preference list

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:47.720
A, B, E, C, D, and boy 3 is
going to have D, C, B, A, E.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:57.345
Boy 4 is going to be A,
C, D, B, E, and boy 5,

00:27:57.345 --> 00:28:04.100
I have to write his across
like this, A, B, D, E, C.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.970
And the girls also have their
lists, so let's put those up.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:25.480
So girl A likes the boys
in order 3, 5, 2, 1, 4.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:32.590
Girl B likes them in
order 5, 2, 1, 4, 3.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:45.000
Girl C has the
order 4, 3, 5, 1, 2.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:55.200
Girl D, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and then the last girl, E,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.130
has 2, 3, 4, 1, 5.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.220
All right, so say that's
our matching problem,

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.580
and those are the
preference lists.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.960
Any ideas for how we might
try to make an algorithm

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.460
to do this?

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.665
Any thoughts about
what you'd do?

00:29:11.665 --> 00:29:13.290
What are some approaches
we could take?

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:13.710
Yeah?

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.110
AUDIENCE: Use the
mating algorithm.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.170
PROFESSOR: Use the
greedy algorithm?

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.690
AUDIENCE: The mating algorithm.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:18.500
PROFESSOR: Oh, the
mating algorithm.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.020
Well, yeah, the mating algorithm
is going to do very well,

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.520
but I haven't told
you what that is,

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.320
and it's a little complicated.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.880
So I sort of want to explore
the things you might know

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.000
from what we've done so far.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.830
What approaches have we seen
so far for solving problems?

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:35.605
Yeah?

00:29:35.605 --> 00:29:37.030
AUDIENCE: The greedy algorithm?

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.910
PROFESSOR: The greedy
algorithm-- yep.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.500
And let's try that.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.990
So let's choose the
first boy, and we'll just

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.855
go down and give each boy
the best choice available

00:29:48.855 --> 00:29:49.730
and see what happens.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.540
First thing to try usually
is the greedy algorithm,

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.220
and about half the time
it'll work in life,

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.600
and half the time it won't.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.765
So let's try greedy.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:14.240
So boy 1 is going to get his
first choice, girl C. Who

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.310
does boy 2 get?

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.990
A. Who does boy 3 get?

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.340
D. Huh, this is going well.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.390
Who does boy 4 get?

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.450
Boy 4, oh yeah, boy 4 has got
to go all the way down to B,

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.860
because A, C, and D
got taken, so boy 4

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.840
gets B. And boy 5-- who's left?

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.790
E, fourth choice again.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:49.320
All right, well, maybe
that's a stable matching.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.745
All right, well let's see.

00:30:50.745 --> 00:30:52.370
To see if it's stable,
we've got to see

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.400
are there any rogue couples.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:00.030
Well, is there any rogue
couple involving boy 1?

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.070
No, boy 1 got his first choice.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.000
You're not going anywhere.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.670
Boy 2?

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.080
No-- first choice,
same with boy 3.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.650
These boys are quite happy.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.770
They're not doing anything.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.550
Boy 4 may not be
so happy though,

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:18.510
because boy 4 got paired
with B, so there's

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.950
possible rogue couples.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.090
Let's see, is 4,
A a rogue couple?

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:26.920
No.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.660
A hates boy 4, all right?

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.566
No chance she's
running off with boy 4.

00:31:32.566 --> 00:31:33.542
AUDIENCE: 4, C?

00:31:33.542 --> 00:31:34.720
PROFESSOR: 4, C?

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.330
All right, let's see that.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.570
Where's C-- whoa, yeah.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.510
C has the hots for
boy 4, so she likes

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.990
him better than
whoever her mate was,

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.380
and boy 4 likes C better
than who he got matched with,

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.840
boy B. That is now
a rogue couple,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.550
so the greedy
algorithm did not work.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.860
That's too bad.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.400
Well, it would be short
lecture, I guess, if it worked.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:57.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:06.850
Well, what would you do next,
sort of, if you were-- I mean,

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:11.760
you could try to match 4 with
C, and then try to patch things

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.070
up, and you could
start doing that,

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.300
but you might create
other rogue couples.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.318
In fact, I don't know
an approach-- yeah?

00:32:18.318 --> 00:32:20.026
AUDIENCE: You could
let it evolve and see

00:32:20.026 --> 00:32:21.370
if it gets it more stable.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:22.370
PROFESSOR: Say it again.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.853
AUDIENCE: You could
let it evolve,

00:32:22.853 --> 00:32:25.268
let all the rogue
couples evolve and see

00:32:25.268 --> 00:32:26.717
if it ends up any more stable.

00:32:26.717 --> 00:32:29.080
PROFESSOR: Yes, you could
start swapping around

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.360
to get rid of rogue couples.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.570
In doing that, you might
create other rogue couples.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.380
In fact, I don't know
of an algorithm that

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.650
works like this, that
works, that's known to work,

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.569
where you start
patching things up,

00:32:40.569 --> 00:32:42.110
because as you're
patching things up,

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:45.610
you might make other things
much worse by doing that.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:47.660
So I don't know of
an approach that way.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.040
What's another approach?

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:51.550
Yeah?

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:57.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
pertaining to what order

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:58.480
they have each other.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.965
PROFESSOR: And then do?

00:32:59.965 --> 00:33:02.440
AUDIENCE: And then do the
highest ordered [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.420
PROFESSOR: Min-weight
matching kind of thing?

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:04.915
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:33:04.915 --> 00:33:05.623
PROFESSOR: Maybe?

00:33:05.623 --> 00:33:09.200
I don't of an approach
like that that works.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.190
Also, min-weight
matching, that algorithm

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.880
is going to be more
complicated than the one I'm

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.130
going to show you, in the end.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.344
It takes more time to run.

00:33:16.344 --> 00:33:17.760
And I don't even
know if it works.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.770
Like, I don't know if you
can take these numbers

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.115
and make weights on the edges
get a min-weight matching.

00:33:22.115 --> 00:33:25.072
AUDIENCE: Could you do like
a merge sort [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:25.072 --> 00:33:27.660
PROFESSOR: Oh, a merge sort,
so you take the minimum weight

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.449
edge, put that in, and
recurse on that kind of thing.

00:33:31.449 --> 00:33:31.990
I don't know.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.857
It's possible.

00:33:33.857 --> 00:33:35.690
In fact, you know what,
a recursive approach

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.180
is a good idea.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.210
I don't know of a nice
recursive algorithm for this.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.450
It's true that if you
found a boy and a girl who

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.430
liked each other
best, you could then

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.989
match them safely and recurse,
because you know they're not

00:33:47.989 --> 00:33:49.780
going to be in a rogue
couple, because they

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.990
like each other best.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.610
Then you could recurse.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.835
But that might not exist here.

00:33:54.835 --> 00:33:56.210
You might not have
a boy and girl

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.450
that like each other best, in
which case it's hard to know.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.350
I don't know now if you pick the
minimum weight in some sense,

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.290
like add the preference list or
something to make a min-weight

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.240
and recurse on
that, if that works.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.670
I don't know of an
approach like that.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.638
But those are the kinds
of things you try.

00:34:11.638 --> 00:34:13.429
And as far as I know,
all the simple things

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.199
fail for this problem.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:19.889
But there is something that's
a little more involved,

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:22.980
but does work, and that's
the mating algorithm.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.437
And does everybody
have the handout?

00:34:25.437 --> 00:34:26.520
There, it's back up there.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.237
I got some copies down here if
you need it, but pull that out.

00:34:30.237 --> 00:34:32.559
So we're going to
read this and talk

00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.100
about what the
algorithm is, and then

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.540
prove that it performs well.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.199
So the initial condition is
you have each of the N boys

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:47.110
has an ordered list of the
N girls and vice versa,

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.460
and the ritual, we're going to
view this is a mating ritual,

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.136
and really, the
program is doing it.

00:34:52.136 --> 00:34:53.010
The code is doing it.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.060
But think of it as real life.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.130
It takes place
over several days.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.260
Now, the day is broken up into
three parts-- the morning,

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.760
the afternoon, and the evening.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.850
In the morning, each girl
comes out to her balcony

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:08.290
and stands on the balcony.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:14.190
Each boy goes to the balcony
of his favorite girl who

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.800
is still on his list that
hasn't been crossed off.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.550
Now, initially, every
girl is on his list.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.830
So he goes to his favorite
girl, goes under her balcony,

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.070
and serenades her.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:25.990
Now, if, over the
course of the algorithm,

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:30.470
the boy has nobody left on
his list, he's out of luck.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.330
He just stays home
and does homework.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:32.830
All right?

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.240
There's no serenade
anymore for him.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.320
Now, in the afternoon,
the girls who

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.420
have at least one suitor--
a boy down there serenading

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:46.130
her-- looks at all the
suitors, picks her favorite,

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:49.380
and to the favorite she
says, maybe I'll marry you.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.810
Come back tomorrow.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.720
Girls don't want to make it
too easy here for the boys.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.770
Now, to all the other boys who
are lower priority she says,

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.670
I will never marry you.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.060
Go away.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.390
So she writes them off for good.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:08.340
Now, that night, any boy who
heard a no-- like the girl

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.640
said no, I'll never marry you--
crosses that girl off his list.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.880
Because, you know, it's
the only practical thing

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.730
to do at that point.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:19.729
Now, if the boy heard
the maybe I'll marry you,

00:36:19.729 --> 00:36:21.270
well, he's going to
go back tomorrow,

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.700
because that's still
his favorite girl that's

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.740
not crossed off.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.450
So he goes back and
serenades her again

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:30.650
the next day in the hopes that
eventually, she'll say yes.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.150
Now, we keep doing
this every day, OK?

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:38.640
And if we ever encounter a
day where every girl has,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:43.650
at most, one suitor, the
algorithm stops, and then

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:47.860
every girl who has a suitor
says, yes, I will marry you.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.470
Now, if a girl
doesn't have a suitor,

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.050
there's no one to marry her.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.100
We're going to prove
that doesn't happen, OK?

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.880
But determination
condition is, you no longer

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.810
have a situation with two or
more boys under one balcony.

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:02.120
OK?

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:11.097
All right, so let's run that
algorithm on this example,

00:37:11.097 --> 00:37:12.680
just so we make sure
we understand it,

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.350
because I'm going to try
to prove theorems about it.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:20.390
So here are the serenades
that are going on,

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:26.140
and here's the
girls, and the days.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.840
It's going to work over
four days in this case.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.450
And then we're also going to
keep track of the boy's lists--

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:41.690
who's gotten crossed off.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.020
All right, so these will be
the cross outs down here.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.982
Actually, maybe I'll
fit it up here if I can.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:06.340
Girls, let's see, A, B-- no, I'm
going to have to space it out.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.880
And the boys have
their lists here,

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.050
and we have boys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.080
And here I'm going to
record the cross outs.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.220
All right, so let's
look at day one.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:39.878
Who is under girl A's
balcony on day one?

00:38:39.878 --> 00:38:40.794
AUDIENCE: 2, 4, and 5?

00:38:40.794 --> 00:38:43.480
PROFESSOR: 2, 4, and 5--
each like girl A the best,

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.800
so she's got a lot of activity.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.900
These three boys show up.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.470
Anybody under girl B's balcony?

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:54.380
No, nope, no, nothing there.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:58.370
C, does C have anybody?

00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.450
Boy 1, yeah.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.600
D?

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.850
3, and E, I don't think
there's any action, right?

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:07.966
Nope.

00:39:07.966 --> 00:39:12.220
All right, so that's
the status on day one.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.732
So the action is all up here.

00:39:15.732 --> 00:39:19.670
All right, so what
does girl A do?

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.713
Who does she tell
to hang around?

00:39:21.713 --> 00:39:22.879
AUDIENCE: Number 5.

00:39:22.879 --> 00:39:23.920
PROFESSOR: Number 5, yes.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.210
She's got 5, 4, and 2,
and she likes 5 the best.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.330
She tells 5 to come back,
and she says to these guys,

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.180
we're not going to marry him.

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:38.710
That means that boys 2 and 4
cross girl A off their list.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:43.445
So they say A is no
longer possible for them.

00:39:43.445 --> 00:39:48.610
All right, now we go to
day two, and 5 goes back

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.760
to girl A, and, of course,
boys 1 and 3 stay there.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.030
Where does boy 2 go on day two?

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.330
B.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.462
All right, so boy 2
shows up here on day two,

00:40:01.462 --> 00:40:04.900
and, let's see, boy
5 is already there,

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.545
and then we've got to get boy 4.

00:40:06.545 --> 00:40:08.860
Where does he go now?

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:14.160
C. All right, boy
4 shows up here.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.580
All right, so now the
action is with girl C.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.233
And what does she do?

00:40:20.233 --> 00:40:22.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, she keeps
4, and she boots poor 1.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.180
You know, led him
along for a day,

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.520
and then he gets the boot
because boy 4 showed up, right?

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:36.400
Because girl C likes 4
better than 1, so bad

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.450
luck for 1 there.

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:46.370
So now one goes home that
night and crosses off girl C.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:48.100
OK.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:52.340
All right, and where
does 1 go on day three?

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:57.020
All right, so he goes to-- he
crossed off C-- he goes to B.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.500
All right, so this is left over.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:07.820
We have 5, 2, 4, 3-- boy
1 now goes to B, right?

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.610
OK.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.090
And then what does girl B do?

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.030
Who does she keep around?

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:20.580
Keeps 2, boots poor 1.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.130
All right, so 1 says, all right,
I'm crossing B off my list,

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.370
got the message.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.670
And now where does
boy 1 go on day four?

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:30.080
AUDIENCE: Girl E?

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.440
PROFESSOR: E-- third choice.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.470
OK.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:38.200
So 1 shows up down here, and
these guys keep returning.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.660
Wow, so on day four
there's no more fighting.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.700
Every girl has at most one.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.110
The termination
condition is invoked,

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.490
and these are the
marriages that take place.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:50.550
The girls say yes.

00:41:53.712 --> 00:41:54.920
All right, now is everybody--

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.140
--does everybody understand
the algorithm we used?

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.520
Any questions on the algorithm?

00:42:04.026 --> 00:42:04.525
Yeah?

00:42:04.525 --> 00:42:07.886
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
first case [INAUDIBLE] or

00:42:07.886 --> 00:42:11.080
is that just in
case the [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.945
PROFESSOR: That's in case
the algorithm doesn't work.

00:42:13.945 --> 00:42:15.570
Because we haven't
proved it works yet,

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:18.830
and I gotta have
a possibility for,

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:20.560
a boy crosses every
girl off his list,

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.274
he gets rejected everywhere.

00:42:22.274 --> 00:42:23.690
That is a possibility,
so I've got

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.150
to say what would happen
in that possibility.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.250
Now, we will prove
in a few minutes

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:32.430
that condition never arises, OK?

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.080
But I'm giving you
what might happen,

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.580
in which so it never
does, so no boy ends up

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.610
having to stay home
and do homework here.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.100
All right, so that's
the algorithm.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.770
Now let's see if we can see
if there's any rogue couples.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:52.920
All right, so, for example,
let's look at boy 1.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.405
Boy 1 got paired to his
third choice, E, so 1,

00:42:57.405 --> 00:43:01.260
C might be a rogue couple.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.100
Is that possible?

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:08.590
No, because C got 4 here,
which is her first choice.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.250
She's not going with boy 1.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.450
That's not working.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.190
What about 1, B?

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:16.470
Could that be rogue?

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:23.745
No, B got 2, and B likes 2
better than 1, so 1, C and 1,

00:43:23.745 --> 00:43:24.510
B are not rogue.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.810
And 1 got E, so there's no
other possibility for boy 1,

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.840
so boy 1 is not
in a rogue couple.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.342
What about boy 2?

00:43:33.342 --> 00:43:39.410
2 got B, and that's
2's second choice.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:40.240
What about 2, A?

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:52.180
Let's see, A got 5, and
A likes 5 better than 2,

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.240
so that's not rogue.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.710
Boy 2 is not rogue.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:04.840
All right, boy 3-- boy 3
got his first choice, right?

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:09.720
3 got D, so 3 is
not going anywhere.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:19.034
Boy 4 got-- who did boy 4 get--
got C. 4 got his second choice.

00:44:19.034 --> 00:44:19.700
What about 4, A?

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.040
A hates 4.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.760
A is not gonna get caught dead
with 4, so that's not rogue.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.766
So 4 is OK.

00:44:29.766 --> 00:44:30.890
4 is not in a rogue couple.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:37.295
And finally, boy 5--
boy 5 is paired with A,

00:44:37.295 --> 00:44:40.260
and that is boy
5's first choice,

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.760
so he's not wandering off here.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.260
All right?

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.060
So in fact, we've
just argued that this

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:52.720
is a stable set of marriages,
a stable matching in this case.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.351
Any questions now about
what we're trying to do?

00:44:56.351 --> 00:44:58.100
OK, because we're going
to try to show now

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:02.040
it always produces
a stable matching.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.020
And to do that, we need
to do a few things.

00:45:16.355 --> 00:45:17.730
All right, so what
are the things

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.450
we need to show to
prove everything

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:23.357
is going to be good here?

00:45:23.357 --> 00:45:24.690
What are some facts we to prove?

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:25.462
Yeah?

00:45:25.462 --> 00:45:28.415
AUDIENCE: Don't we need to show
that the algorithm, it does

00:45:28.415 --> 00:45:29.045
come to an end?

00:45:29.045 --> 00:45:29.670
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.169
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:33.650
The algorithm
terminates, so we need

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:39.080
to show that the marriage
algorithm, TMA, terminates.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.490
Otherwise, the boys
are serenading forever,

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:44.360
and that's not too good.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.100
All right, what else
do we want to show?

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.055
Yeah?

00:45:47.055 --> 00:45:49.909
AUDIENCE: If it does terminate,
then one is left empty.

00:45:49.909 --> 00:45:50.575
PROFESSOR: Then?

00:45:50.575 --> 00:45:52.170
AUDIENCE: Everyone gets someone.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.163
PROFESSOR: Everyone
gets married.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.700
Yep.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.550
Stability is easy if
nobody gets married.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.910
All right, what else do
we want to show here?

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:08.185
Yeah?

00:46:08.185 --> 00:46:09.390
AUDIENCE: There are
no rogue couples.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:10.640
PROFESSOR: No rogue couples.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.280
All right, what else
might we like to show?

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.710
These are the three main ones.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:25.230
There's a couple of other
things you might like.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:25.668
Yeah?

00:46:25.668 --> 00:46:26.751
AUDIENCE: It runs quickly.

00:46:26.751 --> 00:46:28.659
PROFESSOR: It runs quickly.

00:46:28.659 --> 00:46:30.325
Well, you can only
serenade for so long.

00:46:35.174 --> 00:46:36.840
In fact, it does run
quickly, and that's

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.850
why it's useful in practice.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.992
Anything else you might want
to show about this algorithm?

00:46:41.992 --> 00:46:43.756
AUDIENCE: How many
people you crossed out?

00:46:43.756 --> 00:46:46.190
PROFESSOR: How many people
you crossed out-- yeah,

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:49.370
you could, and that'll tie
into how long it takes.

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.267
Yeah.

00:46:51.267 --> 00:46:51.850
Anything else?

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:52.349
Yeah?

00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:58.230
AUDIENCE: The average
likeness between the couples.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.970
PROFESSOR: The
average likeness, oh.

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:02.985
So yeah, we haven't
had a notion here

00:47:02.985 --> 00:47:05.610
of how happy people
are at the end,

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.716
because we don't have a
weighting on the edges,

00:47:07.716 --> 00:47:09.340
but you might want
to think about that.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.548
That's actually a good point.

00:47:10.548 --> 00:47:11.567
Yeah?

00:47:11.567 --> 00:47:13.352
AUDIENCE: If they
[INAUDIBLE] if it

00:47:13.352 --> 00:47:16.437
matters who serenades
[INAUDIBLE] girls or boys

00:47:16.437 --> 00:47:17.411
to get her.

00:47:17.411 --> 00:47:19.120
PROFESSOR: That's a great point.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.360
Is this algorithm good for
girls, or good for boys?

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.760
Yeah, that's a good
point-- fairness.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.910
All right, so we'll take
a look at fairness also.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.760
Is it better to be a serenader,
or be on the balcony making

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.060
your choices?

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.680
OK, so this is what
we've got to do.

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.415
So let's start by
showing TMA terminates,

00:47:42.415 --> 00:47:43.998
and that it terminates
pretty quickly.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.860
Now, in fact, I'm going to
prove a fairly crude bound

00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:01.560
on the time, but it
actually does fairly well.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.180
So our first theorem
is going to be

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:15.070
that TMA terminates in, at
most, N squared plus 1 days.

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.583
N is the number
of boys and girls.

00:48:20.583 --> 00:48:22.333
The proof is going to
be by contradiction.

00:48:25.252 --> 00:48:26.710
This is probably
the only day where

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.126
we'll do a bunch of proofs and
none of them use induction.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.750
They're pretty much
all by contradiction.

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:50.649
Suppose TMA does not terminate
in N squared plus 1 days,

00:48:50.649 --> 00:48:53.065
because we're going to show
that leads to a contradiction.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:03.670
We need to show that
some kind of progress

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.420
is made each day to
show that it terminates.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.206
Yeah?

00:49:07.206 --> 00:49:09.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
number of causes that have

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.682
[INAUDIBLE], so if it
has not terminated,

00:49:12.682 --> 00:49:15.787
then at least one girl is seeing
a group of at least one guy--

00:49:15.787 --> 00:49:16.412
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:18.822
AUDIENCE: --so the number
of crosses cannot be defined

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:19.786
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:19.786 --> 00:49:20.750
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.460
OK, let's state that
as a claim, and you've

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.890
given the proof of the
claim, which is great.

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:38.160
If we don't terminate,
on a day, that

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:42.770
must be because a girl had two
boys there, or more, therefore

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:45.230
she rejected some, at least one.

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:49.720
And that night, the rejected
boy crosses a girl off his list.

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:56.160
So if we don't terminate,
then at least one boy

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.730
crosses at least one
girl off his list.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.820
And so we're going to measure
progress by the cross outs.

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.150
So every day we don't
terminate, a boy

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:20.670
crossed a girl off his list,
so if we didn't terminate

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:22.650
at N squared plus
1 days, we must

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:30.390
have crossed off N squared plus
1 girls across all the lists.

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:33.390
Well, is that possible?

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:35.670
To have done N squared
plus 1 cross outs?

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:41.600
What do you think?

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.510
How many names are on each list?

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:44.900
AUDIENCE: N.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.766
PROFESSOR: N, and how
many lists are there?

00:50:47.766 --> 00:50:48.620
AUDIENCE: N.

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:56.120
PROFESSOR: N, so there's N
lists with N names implies

00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:00.870
there's, at most, N
squared cross outs ever.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:03.530
But we just said we had N
squared plus 1 cross outs.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.566
But we have also N
squared plus 1 cross outs,

00:51:11.566 --> 00:51:12.690
and that's a contradiction.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:17.210
All right?

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.720
So we're done.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:23.282
It has to terminate within
N squared plus 1 days.

00:51:23.282 --> 00:51:23.865
Any questions?

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.630
This is a very common proof
technique in computer science.

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:33.560
You're analyzing some
system, and every step

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.100
or every day or
every time period,

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.434
you want to argue
progress got made,

00:51:38.434 --> 00:51:40.350
and then after you've
made enough progress you

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:46.130
have to be done, and therefore,
the algorithm is completed.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.967
All right, so we know
that TMA terminates.

00:51:48.967 --> 00:51:50.800
Now, we've still got
to get everyone married

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.690
and have them all be
happy, or at least stable.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.140
Now, to do this, we're
going to use an invariant.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.583
Yeah?

00:52:00.583 --> 00:52:03.308
AUDIENCE: If a girl
has some guy in front

00:52:03.308 --> 00:52:05.874
of [INAUDIBLE] on
something, then she

00:52:05.874 --> 00:52:08.770
will always have [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.400
PROFESSOR: That is true.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.060
Something even stronger is true.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.490
AUDIENCE: All the [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:17.556
PROFESSOR: Have a--

00:52:17.556 --> 00:52:19.916
PROFESSOR: If she has a
preference for someone who

00:52:19.916 --> 00:52:24.170
[INAUDIBLE] only better guys.

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:26.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
a great invariant.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.390
As the girl is sitting
there on her balcony,

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.730
things only get better,
because she always

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:35.920
keeps the best one
around that's there.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.610
And when new ones
come in, they've

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:41.110
got to be better than the
last one for her to keep them.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:44.810
So as she rejects boys, she
only does that because she's

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:47.330
got better ones there, and
whoever she says maybe to

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.780
always comes back.

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.420
So an invariant
of this algorithm

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:56.400
is that when a girl has
a suitor, going forward,

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.720
she only has suitors she
likes at least as well.

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.310
And if she ever rejects
a boy, then she's

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:05.780
got somebody better
there forever.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.421
All right, so let's state that
as an invariant and prove that.

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.980
OK, so we're going to let
P be our invariant here.

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:43.690
P is the statement that if a
girl, G, ever rejected a boy,

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:53.214
B, then the girl,
G, has a suitor,

00:53:53.214 --> 00:53:54.630
or if the algorithm
is terminated,

00:53:54.630 --> 00:54:08.696
a husband who she
prefers to B. All right,

00:54:08.696 --> 00:54:10.070
that's going to
be our invariant,

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:12.500
and now we've got to
prove it's an invariant.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:15.220
So we'll do that with a
lemma called lemma one.

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:23.900
P is an invariant for TMA.

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:32.074
All right, let's prove that.

00:54:32.074 --> 00:54:33.490
Now, what's the
first thing you've

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:37.680
got to prove when you're proving
something as an invariant?

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.680
There's two things you've got
to do to establish a variant.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.900
What's the first one?

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:42.733
AUDIENCE: Base case?

00:54:42.733 --> 00:54:43.680
PROFESSOR: Base case.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.310
Show it holds true
at the beginning.

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:49.380
Proof is going to
be by induction,

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:52.304
and so we've got to show that
P holds true at the beginning.

00:54:52.304 --> 00:54:53.970
But what are we going
to induct on here?

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:55.950
What's the parameter
we're inducting on?

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:56.690
AUDIENCE: Time?

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.189
PROFESSOR: Time,
the number of days.

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:03.040
Good.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:07.500
The base case is day
zero, the beginning.

00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:15.340
All right.

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:19.115
Well, is that statement
true on day zero?

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.760
Yeah, it's true for
sort of a weird reason.

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.790
Nobody's been
rejected yet, so it's

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:29.900
what's called vacuously true.

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:34.940
Because no girl, G, has
rejected any boy, so it's true.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.000
So no one is rejected yet.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.760
So it's vacuously true.

00:55:52.293 --> 00:55:54.280
All right, next we have
the induction step.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:16.660
So we'll assume P holds
at the end of day d,

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.230
and we need to argue
that it holds now

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:22.850
at the end of day d plus 1.

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:25.570
So say it's true up
to now, up to day d.

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:28.130
Why Is it true at the
end of the next day?

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:33.320
Well, there's two cases
to look at here, depending

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:46.410
on when G rejected B. So if
she rejects B on this day, day

00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:54.817
d plus 1, well, why would
she reject B on day d plus 1?

00:56:54.817 --> 00:56:55.900
There's only one scenario.

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:56.828
Yeah?

00:56:56.828 --> 00:56:58.220
AUDIENCE: There's a better boy.

00:56:58.220 --> 00:56:59.850
PROFESSOR: There's a better boy.

00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:03.880
And so she says maybe to him,
and he becomes her suitor.

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:08.010
So, in fact, P is true.

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:20.670
So then there was
someone better,

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:27.950
and that implies P is
true on day d plus 1.

00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:29.910
Case two is very similar.

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:33.160
It's a very simple proof.

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:41.320
G rejected B before
day d, before d plus 1.

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:50.130
Well, now we use the fact that
P was true at the end of day

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:57.625
d, which means P now implies
that G had at least as good

00:57:57.625 --> 00:57:58.125
a suitor.

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:03.335
Actually, it's better,
because it was rejected.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:18.340
A better suitor on day d,
that's what the hypothesis says,

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.810
the invariant says.

00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:22.535
And now we just have to look
at what happens on d plus 1.

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.780
Well, either she has the
same suitor on d plus 1,

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.784
or somebody better came along.

00:58:31.784 --> 00:58:33.034
And so we're going to be done.

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:55.850
She has the same or better
suitor on day d plus 1,

00:58:55.850 --> 00:59:03.330
and that implies P is true
on d plus 1, and we're done.

00:59:05.954 --> 00:59:07.620
All right, so I went
through this proof.

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:09.620
It was sort of
obvious, but this is

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.630
the careful way
you'd write it down

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:14.630
to show that the
invariant holds.

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:18.015
Any questions about
the invariant dilemma?

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:23.070
All right, so things only
get better for the girls.

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:26.260
If she ever rejected somebody,
she's got somebody better.

00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:31.230
So now we can prove
the main result,

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:32.360
that everyone is married.

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.255
And again the proof will
be by contradiction.

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.380
So we assume not
everyone was married.

01:00:00.362 --> 01:00:02.070
Assume, for the purpose
of contradiction,

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:11.650
that some boy, B, we'll
call him, is not married.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.280
Because if everyone is not
married then some boy is not.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.850
If not everyone is married
then some boy is not married.

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:21.950
So when it terminates,
B is not married.

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:27.720
Well, what do you know
about B if he was not

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.710
married at the end?

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.670
PROFESSOR: He was
rejected by everyone.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.980
PROFESSOR: He was
rejected by everyone,

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.800
because if at the end,
he's still under a balcony,

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.640
if he still had somebody
on his list, he'd be there.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.840
And he'd be getting married,
because it's the end.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.235
So this means that
if B is not married,

01:00:51.235 --> 01:00:52.360
he's rejected by everybody.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:52.860
Yeah?

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.504
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] list?

01:00:55.504 --> 01:00:57.170
PROFESSOR: Oh, he's
on everybody's list.

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:59.534
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:59.534 --> 01:01:00.950
PROFESSOR: Everybody
has everybody

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.240
of the opposite
sex on their list,

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.860
but he had to cross
everybody off.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.730
That's true.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:07.230
Yeah?

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.122
AUDIENCE: That would mean
that everyone had somebody

01:01:09.122 --> 01:01:11.487
better on the same day that
[INAUDIBLE] telling him she

01:01:11.487 --> 01:01:13.052
didn't want to be with him.

01:01:13.052 --> 01:01:14.010
PROFESSOR: That's true.

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:17.390
That means that B
crossed every girl off.

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:19.640
B is rejected by
every girl, which

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.270
means every girl
has somebody better

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:25.020
than B, which is not
possible, because that would

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:29.206
mean every girl was married.

01:01:29.206 --> 01:01:31.830
And therefore, the equal number
of boys and girls, that means B

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:33.190
would have been married.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:33.690
Good.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.090
All right, let's
write that down.

01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:39.280
This means that B was
rejected by every girl.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:53.320
OK, that means that
every girl, by lemma 1,

01:01:53.320 --> 01:02:02.065
has a better suitor, and
that's where we use lemma 1.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:16.640
And that means that
every girl is married,

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.497
and that means that every
boy is married, including B,

01:02:23.497 --> 01:02:25.080
and that's a
contradiction, because we

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.220
said B wasn't married.

01:02:28.983 --> 01:02:29.482
OK?

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.643
Everybody buy that proof?

01:02:34.643 --> 01:02:35.684
Any questions about that?

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:41.717
Yeah, proof by contradiction
is a pretty powerful technique.

01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:43.800
Once you assume something
is not going to be true,

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.570
it gives you a lot of power
to find a contradiction.

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:53.306
All right, so now we know
that the algorithm ends,

01:02:53.306 --> 01:02:54.430
and everybody gets married.

01:02:54.430 --> 01:03:00.180
All's we got to do is show
that there's no rogue couples,

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.230
so let's do that.

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:14.845
TMA produces a stable matching.

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:25.180
Now, how do you suppose
we're going to prove this?

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:27.382
What's going to be the
approach to prove this?

01:03:27.382 --> 01:03:27.882
Yeah?

01:03:27.882 --> 01:03:29.340
AUDIENCE: Assume that
there's a rogue couple.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.256
PROFESSOR: Assume that
there's a rogue couple,

01:03:31.256 --> 01:03:35.280
that namely this is not true,
so there must be rogue couple.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:50.710
So let Bob and Gail be any
pair that are not married.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.552
I need to prove the Bob
and Gail are not rogue,

01:04:01.552 --> 01:04:02.510
and then we'll be fine.

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:05.260
Because if it says everybody
who is not married is not rogue,

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:09.361
then we know we have
a stable matching.

01:04:09.361 --> 01:04:10.860
Now, there's a
couple of cases here.

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:14.239
Bob and Gail weren't
married, so there's two ways

01:04:14.239 --> 01:04:15.280
that could have happened.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.780
What's one of them?

01:04:21.392 --> 01:04:22.850
What's one reason
they might not be

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:25.580
married, something that happened
that made that impossible?

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.010
Yeah?

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:28.480
AUDIENCE: Gail rejected Bob.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.146
PROFESSOR: Good.

01:04:29.146 --> 01:04:30.680
Case one-- Gail rejected Bob.

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:45.654
Well, what do we know in that
case, if Gail rejected Bob?

01:04:45.654 --> 01:04:47.070
AUDIENCE: Gail had
better suitors.

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:51.430
PROFESSOR: Gail has another
suitor that she likes better.

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:56.674
And, in fact, what do we
know about who Gail married?

01:04:56.674 --> 01:04:57.834
AUDIENCE: Better than Bob.

01:04:57.834 --> 01:04:59.500
PROFESSOR: Better
than Bob-- things only

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.780
get better for the girls.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.630
That's the lemma one.

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:15.260
All right, so this means that
Gail marries someone that she

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.460
thinks is better than Bob.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.370
And that's by lemma one.

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:31.310
Well, can Gail and Bob
be a rogue couple here?

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:34.970
No, because Gail likes her
spouse better than Bob,

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:37.680
so she's not going to be
in a rogue affair with Bob.

01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:49.950
So that means that Gail
and Bob are not rogue.

01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:04.890
All right, case two is
Gail did not reject Bob.

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:05.580
She never did.

01:06:09.792 --> 01:06:13.500
That's the other case,
she didn't reject Bob.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:18.100
Could Bob have ever
serenaded Gail in this case?

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.220
No, because if he did and
he was never rejected,

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.870
they would have
ended up married.

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:24.790
All right?

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:34.495
So that means the Bob
never serenaded Gail.

01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:45.003
What does that mean about
how Bob feels about Gail?

01:06:45.003 --> 01:06:45.502
Yeah?

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:48.670
AUDIENCE: Bob must have
never serenaded for Gail.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah, Bob
never got far enough down

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.780
on his list to serenade Gail.

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:59.830
He got married before
he got down there.

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:06.850
All right, so that
means that Gail is lower

01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:11.930
on Bob's list than Bob's wife.

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:20.940
And that means that
they're not rogue,

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.860
because Bob likes his
wife better than Gail.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.420
All right, so in each case, the
cases clearly cover everything.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.570
Gail rejected Bob,
or she didn't.

01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:42.030
Either way, Gail and
Bob are not rogue.

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:49.800
So that means there's
no rogue couples,

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:53.190
and that implies M is
stable, TMA is stable.

01:07:56.336 --> 01:07:59.230
OK?

01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:01.700
All right, so TMA
terminates, everyone

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:06.537
gets married, no rogue
couples, nice outlook.

01:08:06.537 --> 01:08:07.120
So we're done.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.370
We actually proved it works.

01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:11.990
One issue left to
think about here.

01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:16.048
Any questions on that before we
launch off into the last issue?

01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:17.024
AUDIENCE: Is it unique?

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.649
PROFESSOR: Is it unique?

01:08:21.649 --> 01:08:27.430
TMA gives you a unique answer
because it's an algorithm.

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.310
It's deterministic.

01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:33.649
But there may be other
stable matchings.

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:36.729
OK, so there's not just one
stable matching, necessarily.

01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:40.170
You could make examples with
multiple stable matchings.

01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:42.524
That's a great question.

01:08:42.524 --> 01:08:43.494
Any other questions?

01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:47.156
All right.

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:47.656
Oh, yeah?

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:49.888
AUDIENCE: Is there
generally any other way

01:08:49.888 --> 01:08:53.608
to assess optimality besides
the fact that it's stable, or--

01:08:53.608 --> 01:08:56.594
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can
make up lots of them.

01:08:56.594 --> 01:08:58.010
You could put
weights on the edges

01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:59.750
and get a min-weight matching.

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:04.800
You could try to get
the perfect matching

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.060
with the least unfavorable
marriage kind of thing.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.649
There's a lot of
criteria you can make.

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:14.720
This one turns out to be useful
in practice in a variety ways

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.609
that we'll talk
about, and also have

01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:19.319
a nice, fast, simple
algorithm that can actually

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:21.069
run in a distributed
environment, which

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:22.830
is really nice.

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:25.529
So it is probably the
most practical approach

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:28.279
to matching out there.

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:29.330
Any other questions?

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:33.746
OK, the last
issue-- I don't know

01:09:33.746 --> 01:09:38.649
if we still have the issues
up there-- is fairness.

01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:43.394
So who thinks the TMA is
favorable to the boys?

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:46.630
Just a couple.

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:49.990
Who thinks it's
favorable to the girls?

01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:51.899
More, that's the
common response.

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:54.510
Who thinks you can't even
define it one way or the other?

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:57.450
It's unclear and
hopeless to decide.

01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:02.270
OK, well, it seems like
maybe the girls, because they

01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:04.170
get the best of their suitors.

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:05.920
They sit back, and
they just take the best

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.770
as they come along.

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:09.700
On the other hand,
the boys do try

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.690
to go out and get
their first choice.

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:13.080
The girls have to wait.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.402
And Mr. Right may
never come along.

01:10:15.402 --> 01:10:16.360
The boys are out there.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.160
I'm going to my first choice,
and they get denied, OK, they

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.670
just move right on
to the next choice.

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:24.620
So this is actually
one of these questions

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.780
of study in sociology.

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:31.550
In the animal species, which is
better, proposers or acceptors?

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:33.800
What's the more powerful result?

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.490
Who has the better
power in courtship?

01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:40.000
It turns out that we can
answer this question in a very

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.540
clear way, and prove it here.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:46.570
And the answer is the boys
have all the power here.

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:50.300
This is very favorable to
the boys, and we'll see why.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:53.260
Now, to prove that, we
need some definitions.

01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.029
OK, so I've got to define
a couple things here

01:11:18.029 --> 01:11:19.070
to be able to prove this.

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:22.540
The first is, for any
collection of preference lists,

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:29.280
we're going to let S be the
set of all stable matchings.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.090
Now, we know that S
is not empty, right?

01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:43.014
How do we know that
S is not empty here?

01:11:43.014 --> 01:11:44.907
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] stable.

01:11:44.907 --> 01:11:47.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because TMA
produces a stable matching,

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.350
so we know that S is not empty.

01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:51.780
There's at least one.

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.890
And, in fact, there
could be many.

01:11:54.890 --> 01:12:19.310
Now, for each person, P, we
define the realm of possibility

01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:27.530
for P to be the set of
mates that you might

01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:30.040
have in a stable matching.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.520
So it's a set queue
of people for which

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.660
there exists a matching
that's stable such that you're

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.890
mated to that person.

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:42.560
So I've written this
in some-- that's

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.490
sort of complicated
mathematics, but somebody

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:49.450
is in your realm of possibility
if there is a stable matching

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:50.540
where you married them.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.165
If it exists, there's
a stable matching

01:12:52.165 --> 01:12:53.830
where you could marry them.

01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:57.539
And this is vaguely like
you see sometimes, you're

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:00.080
going out with somebody and your
parents say, oh, they're not

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.350
in your league, or something.

01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:04.060
This is a mathematical
formulation

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:08.540
for that, that there is some way
in the world to marry everybody

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.610
up, so it's all
stable, and you could

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:12.680
be married to that person.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.760
OK?

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.595
Let's do an example
with four people.

01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:39.920
All right, so for example, say
we have Brad, Jen, and Angelina

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.420
again.

01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:45.800
And of course Brad likes
Angelina and vice versa.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.360
Gen likes Brad, and then
there's Billy Bob here.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.790
All right.

01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:58.330
Now, Brad is not
realistic for Jen.

01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:02.350
Brad Is not in Jen's
realm of possibility,

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:07.120
because in any perfect matching
where Brad marries Jen,

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.490
you're going to
have a rogue couple.

01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:12.820
Brad's going to go for Angelina.

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:17.170
So Brad is not within
Jen's realm of possibility.

01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:19.350
And similarly, vice
versa-- Jen is not

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:22.679
in Brad's realm of possibility,
because there's no stable

01:14:22.679 --> 01:14:24.720
matching where they're
married, in this scenario,

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.910
for this problem.

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:29.300
All right?

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:30.900
Now that we have
that notion, we can

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:35.828
define who your optimal mate is,
and who your pessimal mate is,

01:14:35.828 --> 01:14:36.804
the worst case.

01:14:51.950 --> 01:15:06.800
All right, so we define
a person's optimal mate

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:12.290
is his or her favorite in
the realm of possibility.

01:15:22.890 --> 01:15:26.730
So your optimal mate is
not your favorite overall,

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:29.730
it's just your favorite
among those who are possible,

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:32.160
that there is a stable
matching that you could

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.330
be matched to that person.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:43.860
And similarly, you have
a person's pessimal mate

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:51.450
is your least favorite from
the realm of possibility.

01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:51.950
OK?

01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:53.480
Because you have
all the people you

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.789
might be married to
in stable matchings.

01:15:56.789 --> 01:15:58.830
Your favorite is the
optimal, your least favorite

01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:00.590
is the pessimal.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:02.090
Any questions about that?

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.247
Does that make sense?

01:16:04.247 --> 01:16:05.830
And you don't count
the ones you can't

01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:08.310
be married to, because if you
were, it would be unstable.

01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:16.800
OK, now we can state the
blockbuster theorems here.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:28.370
Theorem four says
TMA marries every boy

01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:31.600
with his optimal mate.

01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:41.140
Theorem five,
probably can guess,

01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:48.230
TMA marries every girl
with her pessimal mate.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.610
All right, so it is
optimal for every boy.

01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:59.960
They get the best possible they
could have in stable marriages,

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.306
and every girl gets the
worst possible mate.

01:17:03.306 --> 01:17:06.110
Now, you wouldn't necessarily
think that when you first

01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:09.320
look at that algorithm, where
the boys are working down

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.070
their list, and the girls are
just getting better and better.

01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:13.090
But that's the case.

01:17:13.090 --> 01:17:16.220
Now, let's see, I'm not going
to have time to prove them both,

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:19.715
but I will prove theorem five.

01:17:19.715 --> 01:17:21.340
And I'm going to
assume theorem four is

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:23.860
true to prove theorem five.

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.660
Maybe we'll do theorem four
tomorrow in recitation.

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:27.660
I don't know.

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.339
So let's do theorem five so
you can see how this works.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:47.667
The proof is by
contradiction, so we'll

01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:49.250
assume theorem four
is true, and we'll

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:55.010
prove the proof of theorem
five by contradiction.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:09.040
So assume there was a stable
matching where a girl got

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.290
worse off than in TMA.

01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:14.060
All right?

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.900
Assume three and
five is not true,

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.680
then there's some girl
in some stable matching.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.270
So suppose, for the
purpose of contradiction,

01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:30.230
that there exists
a stable matching,

01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:40.760
we'll call it M,
where some girl,

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.615
and she fares worse than in TMA.

01:18:48.202 --> 01:18:50.160
I want to show that
results in a contradiction.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.982
And the proof is pretty
simple, just a simple picture.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:04.295
So G did worse in M than in TMA.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:24.475
All right, so let's let B
prime be the mate of G in M.

01:19:24.475 --> 01:19:30.550
So girl G did worse in M than
in TMA, so here's her mate in M,

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:32.935
and let B be her mate in TMA.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.510
Who does she like
better, B or B prime?

01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:45.600
B, because we're saying that
she did worse in M than she did

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.870
in TMA, so she likes B better.

01:19:51.540 --> 01:20:00.580
And let G prime be the mate
of B in M. Now, who does

01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.907
B like better, G or G prime?

01:20:02.907 --> 01:20:03.740
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.840
PROFESSOR: Not G prime.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:15.740
B got married to G prime in M,
but what does theorem four say?

01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:19.560
Yeah, G. Theorem four
says that across all

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:24.780
the stable matchings, B gets
his favorite mate in TMA.

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:28.480
So G prime is in the realm
of possibility, and so is G,

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.890
and we know from
theorem four B likes G

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:35.100
best, better than G prime,
because of theorem four.

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:38.260
So what happened here?

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:49.620
There's a rogue couple in M. B
and G are a rogue couple in M.

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:53.259
And that means that
M is not stable,

01:20:53.259 --> 01:20:54.425
and that is a contradiction.

01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:58.050
All right?

01:20:58.050 --> 01:21:04.010
And so theorem five
is true, because we

01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:07.090
assumed we had a stable
matching M where there's

01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:10.810
a girl who did worse off.

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:14.560
So it really pays off to be
aggressive party in courtship.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.220
Everybody lives
happily ever after,

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:19.030
especially the boys in TMA.

01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:22.060
Now, TMA arises in
lots of applications.

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.910
The most famous is
the matching program

01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:28.480
that's used to match MDs
to residency programs.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.590
So how many pre-meds are here?

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:33.380
There's one, at least.

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.576
So you're going to go to
medical school some day,

01:21:35.576 --> 01:21:36.950
and at the end of
medical school,

01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:38.980
there's a big day
called match day,

01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:42.490
where you get assigned to a
hospital for your internship,

01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:46.070
and the way that works
is using this algorithm.

01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:48.390
And who do you suppose is
the boy in this algorithm?

01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:49.348
AUDIENCE: The hospital.

01:21:49.348 --> 01:21:51.040
PROFESSOR: The hospital.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.560
And they want it so that
when they make the matchings,

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.560
that there's not some pair of an
intern or doctor in a hospital

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.810
where they'd like each other
better than what they got.

01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:04.250
This is used in online dating
for the obvious reasons,

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:06.670
and we actually use this
algorithm lot at Akamai

01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:09.330
to load balance
traffic on the web.

01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:13.420
And here you have the
boys are web servers,

01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:17.200
and the girls are
requests for service.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.960
And the goals are to
balance performance,

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.360
getting a server that's
nearby you that's fast.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.190
And on the other side,
our cost, and by who

01:22:27.190 --> 01:22:31.690
we make a boy and a girl, we can
trade off cost for performance

01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:33.210
in a very nice, distributed way.

01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:35.900
All right, so
that's it for today.
