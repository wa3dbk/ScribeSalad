00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.740
Today we're going to start
with a simple problem

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.670
that many of you may
have already encountered.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.840
For example, when you
got a student loan

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.564
or if your family took a
loan out on your house,

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:35.310
you know, a home mortgage
loan, and it's the problem

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.420
of pricing an annuity.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.720
An annuity is a
financial instrument

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.660
that pays a fixed
amount of money

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.910
every year for some
number of years,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.015
and it has a value
associated with it.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:48.390
For example, with
a student loan,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.540
the value is the amount of
money they gave you to pay MIT,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.180
then later in life-- every
year or every month-- you're

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.860
going to send them a check.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.821
And you want to sort of equate
those two things to find out,

00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:02.570
are you getting enough
money for the money

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.489
you're going to pay back
monthly sometime in the future?

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.990
So let's define this, and
there's a lot of variations

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.430
on annuities, but we'll
start with one that's called

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:30.450
an n-year $m-dollar
payment annuity,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:46.950
and it works by paying m dollars
at the start of each year,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.582
and it lasts for n years.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.244
Now, usually n is
finite, but not always,

00:01:55.244 --> 00:01:57.160
and in a few minutes
we'll talk about the case

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.150
when it's infinite.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.850
But this includes
home mortgages,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.690
where you pay every
month for 30 years.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.800
Megabucks, the lottery.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.890
They don't actually give
you the million dollars.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.030
They give you $50,000
per year for 20 years,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.250
and call it a million bucks.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.880
Retirement plans.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.270
You pay in every
year, and then you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.620
get some big lump sum later.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.880
Life insurance benefits,
you know, and so forth.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.940
Now, if you go to Wall
Street, this is a big deal.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.080
A lot of the stuff that
happens on Wall Street

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.580
involves annuities in
one form or another,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.230
packaging them all up
and, in fact, we'll

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.120
look at later when
we do probability.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.380
It was how these things
were packaged and sold

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.270
that led to the sub-prime
mortgage disaster,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.270
and we'll see how some confusion
over independents, when

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.680
you look at random variables,
led to the global recession,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.971
a real disaster.

00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:51.220
Of course, some people
understood how all that worked,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.820
made hundreds of billions
of dollars at the same time.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.260
So it was sort of money went
from one place to another.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.790
So it's pretty
important to understand

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.930
how much this is worth.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.120
What is this
instrument-- a piece

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.620
of paper that says
it will pay you

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.160
m dollars at the beginning of
each year for n years, what

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.430
is that worth today?

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.650
For example, say I
gave you a choice--

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.580
the Megabucks choice--
$50,000 a year

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.950
for 20 years or a
million dollars today.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.430
How many people would prefer
the $50,000 a year for 20 years?

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.030
A few of you.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.840
How many would prefer the
million bucks right up front?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.670
Much better.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.630
OK.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.970
Always better to have
the cash in hand,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.900
because there's things
like inflation--

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.680
pretty low now-- interest.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.160
You can put the
money in the bank

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.980
or invest it and make
some money hopefully.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.170
So the million dollars
today is a lot better,

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.960
which is why the State pays you
50 grand a year for 20 years.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.614
It's better for them, and
they call it a million bucks.

00:03:53.614 --> 00:03:55.030
So that was pretty
clear, but what

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.950
if I gave you this option-- 700
grand today or 50 grand a year

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.700
for 20 years?

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.090
How many people want the cash
upfront-- 700 grand only.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.660
A few.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.310
How many people want 50
grand a year for 20 years?

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.770
All right, we're almost--
that's pretty close to half way.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.750
How about 500 grand today versus
50 grand a year for 20 years?

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.511
How many want half
a million today?

00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:25.760
A lot of people like the cash.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.218
You know, it's this kind of a
time, you have the recession,

00:04:28.218 --> 00:04:29.617
it's a disaster on Wall Street.

00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:31.700
You know, Street Wall
Street didn't like the cash.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.100
How many want, instead
of a half a million

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.252
up front, 50 grand
a year for 20 years?

00:04:37.252 --> 00:04:38.710
All right, now
we're about halfway.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.850
All right, well
that's pretty good.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.815
So we're going to find
out what you should pay,

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:44.750
or at least one way
of estimating that.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.460
Now, to do that, we've
got to figure out what

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.670
$1 today is worth in a year.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:00.364
And to do that, we
make an assumption,

00:05:00.364 --> 00:05:01.780
and the assumption
is that there's

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.600
a fixed-- we'll call
it an interest rate.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.610
It's sort of the devaluation
of the money per year.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.490
And we're going to call it p.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.000
Later we'll plug
in values for p,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.672
but you can think of
it as like 6%, 1%.

00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:20.880
You know, it's the money,
if you put money in a bank,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.650
they'll give you some
percent back every year.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.639
And, of course, the fact
that different people

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.430
have different ideas
of what this would be,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.950
allows people to make
money on Wall Street.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.440
As we'll see, a
slight difference in p

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.460
can make big differences in
what the annuity is worth.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:48.380
So for example, $1 today
is going to equal 1 plus p

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.662
dollars in one year.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.290
Similarly, $1 today--
how much is that

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.645
going to be worth in two years?

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.528
Say that p stays fixed,
the same over all time.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.360
One plus p squared,
because every year you

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.970
multiply what you got by
1 plus p, because that's

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.560
the interest you're getting.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.940
All right, we'll think of
it in terms of interest.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:28.070
In three years, $1 today
is worth 1 plus p cubed in

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.660
three years and so forth.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.160
All right.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.750
Now, what we really care about
is what's $1, or m dollars,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.090
worth today if you're
getting it next year?

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.026
So we need to sort of flip
this back the other way.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:56.510
So what is $1 in a year
worth today in terms of p?

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.722
So if I'm going to
be paid $1 in a year,

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:03.930
what would be the equivalent
amount to be paid today?

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.480
One over 1 plus p, because
what's happening here

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.690
is, as you go forward in a year,
you just multiply by 1 plus p.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:24.510
So 1 over 1 plus p turns
into $1 in a year-- being

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.270
paid in a year.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.130
All right.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:35.027
What is $1 a year in
two years worth today?

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.610
One over 1 plus p squared.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:48.060
So $1 in two years is
worth this much today.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.800
Well, now we can use
this to go figure

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.080
out the current value
of that annuity.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.060
We just figure out what every
payment is worth today and then

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.380
add it up.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.220
So we'll put the
payments over here,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.890
and we'll compute
the current value

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.500
of every payment on this side.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.580
So with the annuity,
the way we've

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.630
set it up is it pays n dollars
at the start of every year,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.970
so the first payment is now.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.710
So the first of the
n payments is now,

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.130
and since it's being paid
now, that's worth m dollars.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.320
There's no devaluation.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:36.789
The next payment is m
dollars in one year,

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:43.360
and so that's going to be
worth m over 1 plus p today.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.850
And the next payment is
m dollars in two years.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.870
That's worth m over
1 plus p squared,

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.880
and we keep on going
until the last payment.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.647
It's the n-th payment, so it's
m dollars in n minus 1 years.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:13.260
And so that's going to
be worth m over 1 plus p

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.437
to the n minus 1.

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:17.390
All right.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.440
So we can compute the current
value of all those payments,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.430
then the annuity is computed--
the value is computed just

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.820
by adding these up, of
all the current values.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:39.012
So the total current value is
the sum i equals 0 to n minus 1

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:44.490
of m over 1 plus p to the i.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.273
And that is the
total current value.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:56.830
That's what you should
pay today for the annuity.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.590
Any questions?

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.150
What we did here?

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.890
All right.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.370
Well, of course, what we'd like
is a closed form expression

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.427
here.

00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:10.260
Something that's simple
so we could actually

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.980
get a feel without having
to add up all those terms,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.520
and that's not hard to get.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.560
In fact, let's put
this sum in a form

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.420
that might be more familiar.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.310
This equals-- we'll pull
the m out in front--

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.370
and let's use x to be 1
over 1 plus p to the i.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:47.330
And so x equals 1 over 1 plus
p, and I wrote it this way

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.249
because this might be familiar.

00:10:51.249 --> 00:10:53.040
Does everybody remember
that from-- I think

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.112
it was the second recitation?

00:10:57.862 --> 00:10:59.070
Anybody remember the formula?

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.180
What this evaluates to?

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:09.380
The sum of x to the i, where
i goes from 0 to n minus 1?

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.170
Remember that?

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.970
One minus x to the n.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.820
Remember 1 minus x.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.550
In the second
recitation, I think,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.550
we proved that this equals that.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.370
What was the proof
technique we used?

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.391
Induction.

00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:27.890
OK?

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.476
So, in fact, there's
a theorem here.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.730
For all n bigger and equal
to 1 and x not equal to 1,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:52.360
we proved the sum from i equals
0 to n minus 1 x to the i

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.270
equals 1 minus x to
the n over 1 minus x.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.870
And so this is a
nice, closed form.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:04.040
No sum any more, just
that, which is nice.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.960
Now, induction proved
it was the right answer.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.450
Once you knew it-- we gave
it to you-- using induction

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.100
to prove that
theorem wasn't hard.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.310
What we're going to look at
doing this week and next week

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.580
is figuring out how
to figure out this

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.550
was the answer in
the first place.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:28.240
Methods for doing that-- to
evaluate the sum-- and there's

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.050
a lot of ways that you can
do that particular sum.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.480
Probably the easiest is known
as the perturbation method.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.090
This sometimes works.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.200
Certainly with sums like
that, it often works.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.460
The idea is as follows.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.460
We're trying to compute
the sum S, which is 1

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:57.500
plus x plus x squared
plus x to the n minus 1,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.230
and what we're going to do
is perturb it a little bit

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.210
and then subtract to
get big cancellation.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.620
In this case, it's
pretty simple.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:19.130
We multiply the sum by x to get
x plus x squared plus-- I've

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.380
defined S to be that,
x times S-- well, I

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:28.450
get x plus x squared and
so forth, up to x to the n,

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.673
and now I can subtract one from
the other and almost everything

00:13:32.673 --> 00:13:33.173
cancels.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:42.220
So I get 1 minus x
times S equals 1.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.450
These cancel, cancel, cancel.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.750
Minus x to the n.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:54.310
And therefore S equals 1 minus
x to the n over 1 minus x.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.820
So that's a vague method.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.930
This gets used all the time
in applied mathematics,

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.930
and they call it the
perturbation method.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.150
Take your sum, wiggle
it around a little bit,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.990
get something that looks
close, subtract it,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.201
everything cancels,
life is nice,

00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:16.284
and all of a sudden you've
figured out the answer.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:26.930
So getting back to
our annuity problem,

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:31.660
we can plug that
formula back in here.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:39.030
So the value of the annuity
is m times 1 minus x to the n

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.080
over 1 minus x.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:47.570
We'll plug in x equals
1 over 1 plus p,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:54.670
and we get m 1 minus
1 over 1 plus p

00:14:54.670 --> 00:15:01.830
to the n over 1 minus 1 over
1 plus p, just plugging in.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.150
And now to simplify this, I'll
multiply the top and bottom

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:11.920
by 1 plus p, and I'll get 1
plus p minus 1 on the bottom.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.080
Just gives me a p on the bottom.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.040
I have a 1 plus p on
the top minus 1 over 1

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.680
plus p to the n
minus 1, all over p.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.850
So now we have a formula--
closed form expression

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.840
formula-- for the
value of the annuity.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.400
All's we've got to plug in
is m, the payment every year,

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.560
n, the number of years, and
then p, the interest rate.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:51.540
And so, for example, if
we made m be $50,000,

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.390
as in the lottery.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:58.640
We made n be 20 years, and
say we took 6% interest, which

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.710
is actually very good these
days, and I plug those in here,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:12.710
the value is going
to be $607,906.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.210
All right.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.680
So those of you that preferred
700 grand-- if you assume 6%

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.560
interest-- you're right.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.920
Those of you who
preferred 500 grand, no,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.360
you're better off waiting and
getting your 50 grand a year.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.500
Now, of course, if the
interest rate is lower,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.020
well, that changes things.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.800
That shifts it even more.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.360
The annuity is worth even more
if the interest rate is lower--

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.540
if p is smaller.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.400
In fact, say p was 0.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.310
Say the interest rate is 0, so
$1 today equals $1 tomorrow,

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.350
then what is the lottery worth?

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.130
A million dollars.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.230
And the bigger p gets, the
less your payment is worth.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.915
Any questions about that?

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.320
OK.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:11.170
What if you were paid $50,000 a
year forever-- you live forever

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.950
or it goes to your
estate and your heirs,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:18.960
$50,000 a year forever or
a million dollars today.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:25.200
How many people want the
million dollars today?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.530
How many want 50
grand a year forever?

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.730
Sounds good.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.560
You know, that's an infinite
amount of money, sort of.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.190
It's not as good as it sounds.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.290
Let's see why.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:45.150
So this is a case where
n equals infinity,

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:50.840
and so I'll claim that
if n equals infinity,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:56.100
then the value of this
annuity is just m times 1

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.180
plus p over p.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.789
Let's see why that's the case.

00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:04.330
You know, it sounds
hard to evaluate,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.930
because it's an infinite
number of payments,

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:12.250
but what happens here
when n goes to infinity?

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.300
What happens to this thing?

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.530
That goes to 0 as
n goes to infinity,

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.000
as long as p is bigger than 0.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.800
So we're going to
assume 6% interest.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.340
So that goes away, so
the annuity is worth just

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:31.000
that, m times 1 plus p over
p, because the limit as n

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.550
goes to infinity of 1 over
1 plus p to the n minus 1,

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.890
that's going to 0.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:19:02.390
So the value for m is $50,000,
and at 6% V is only $883,000.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.450
So you're better off
taking a million dollars

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.704
today than $50,000
a year forever.

00:19:08.704 --> 00:19:10.620
Now, if you think about
it, and think about it

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.350
as an interest
rate, why should it

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.950
be obvious that you're better
off with a million dollars

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:19.179
today than 50 grand
a year forever?

00:19:19.179 --> 00:19:21.470
Think about what you could
do with that million dollars

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:27.790
if you had it today
at 6% interest.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.710
What would you do with it to
make more money than 50 grand

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.360
a year forever?

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.478
Yeah.

00:19:33.478 --> 00:19:36.102
AUDIENCE: You could have like--
you could make $50,000 per year

00:19:36.102 --> 00:19:37.754
just off of [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:37.754 --> 00:19:38.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.820
In this model, if the
interest rate is 6%,

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.820
you can put in the bank.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.300
It makes 6% every year, that's
60 grand a year forever.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.150
Better than 50 grand
a year forever.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.294
So maybe it's-- even
without doing the math,

00:19:50.294 --> 00:19:51.960
you can tell which
way it's going to go,

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.396
but this tells you
exactly what it's worth.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.102
Any questions?

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.362
OK.

00:20:04.362 --> 00:20:04.862
Yeah.

00:20:04.862 --> 00:20:06.428
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
current value--

00:20:06.428 --> 00:20:08.554
that's how much it's
worth to you right now.

00:20:08.554 --> 00:20:09.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:14.010
AUDIENCE: So and, like, if
you have $1 in the future--

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.086
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:15.086 --> 00:20:17.869
AUDIENCE: --where S right
now is m over 1 plus p--

00:20:17.869 --> 00:20:18.535
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:21.118
AUDIENCE: --is it worth less to
you [INAUDIBLE] then later on,

00:20:21.118 --> 00:20:23.000
it's going to be
worth more to you.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.930
PROFESSOR: Ah, so
if you move yourself

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.584
forward in time, $1 a year, in
a year it'll worth $1 to you--

00:20:28.584 --> 00:20:29.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.490
PROFESSOR: --but today it's
worth less than $1 to you,

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.070
because you could take the
dollar today and invest

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.180
in the bank, and it's worth more
in a year, because the money

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.700
grows in value, as a
way to think of it,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.510
because you can
earn interest on it.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.104
What's that?

00:20:44.104 --> 00:20:45.760
AUDIENCE: You could spend it.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.030
Yeah, if you just
spend it, well,

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.571
then at least you
had the use of what

00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:51.009
you spent it on for the year.

00:20:51.009 --> 00:20:52.800
So there's some other
kind of value, right?

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.660
Maybe you bought a
house or something

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.410
that-- maybe something that
even appreciated in value.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.610
OK.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.396
But these things
get sort of squishy,

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:05.770
and that is where
a lot of people

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.890
make money on Wall Street, is
because different companies

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.330
have different needs for money.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:11.860
They have different views of
what the interest rates are

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.180
going to be, and you
can play in the middle

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.170
and make a lot of
money that way.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.620
So more generally, there's
a corollary to the theorem,

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.030
and that is that if the absolute
value of x is less than 1,

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:51.650
then the sum i equals 0
to infinity x to the i

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:56.080
is just 1 over 1 minus x.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.350
We didn't prove this back
in the second recitation,

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.130
because there's no
n to induct on here,

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.220
but the proof is simple
from the theorem.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.060
And it's simply because
if x is less than 1,

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.330
an absolute value, as n goes
to infinity, that goes to 0,

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.410
and so you're just left
with 1 over 1 minus x.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:31.680
So, for example,
what's this sum?

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.075
This one you all know, I'm sure.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.880
Out to infinity.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.970
What's that sum to?

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:41.600
To 2.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.250
Yeah.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:47.710
It's 1 over 1 minus
1/2, which is 2.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:55.370
What about this sum
out to infinity?

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.505
What does that sum to?

00:22:59.263 --> 00:23:01.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:07.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, 3/2, 1
over 1 minus 1/3 is 3/2.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.920
So, easy corollaries.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.460
These are all examples
of geometric series.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.600
That's what a definition
of a geometric series is.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.810
Something that's going
down by a fixed-- each term

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.490
goes down by the same
fixed amount every time.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.580
And geometric
series, generally sum

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:26.140
to something that is very
close to the largest term.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.590
In this case, it's 1.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.380
Very common, because
of that formula.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.772
It's 1 over 1 minus x.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.720
Any questions about this
or geometric series?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.280
All right.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.140
Well, those are
straight geometric sums.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.500
Sometimes you run into things
that are a little bit more

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.930
complicated.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.570
For example, say I have this
kind of a sum, i equals 1 to n,

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:05.030
i times x to the i.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:11.100
Now, those are adding up x
plus 2x squared plus 3x cubed,

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.369
and so forth, up
to n x to the n.

00:24:16.369 --> 00:24:18.160
You know, that's a
little more complicated.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.480
The terms are
getting-- decreasing

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.680
by a factor of x, increasing by
1 in terms of the coefficient

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.420
every time.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.200
A little trickier.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.280
So say we wanted to get a
closed form expression for that?

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.130
There are several
ways we can do it.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.190
The first would be to try to use
perturbation-- the perturbation

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.900
method.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.730
Let's try that.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:48.370
So we write S equals x plus 2x
squared plus 3x cubed plus nx

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.920
to the n, and let's try
the same perturbation.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:57.610
Multiply by x, I
get that x squared

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:09.420
plus 2x cubed plus n minus 1x to
the n, plus nx to the n plus 1.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.370
And then I subtract to try
to get all the cancellation.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.410
So then I do that.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:24.540
I get 1 minus x times S. Well, I
didn't quite cancel everything.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:31.960
X plus x squared
plus x cubed plus x

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:37.960
to the n plus n-- or
minus nx to the n plus 1.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.010
Ah, it didn't quite work.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.708
Anybody see a way that
I can fix this up?

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.610
What about this piece?

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.020
That's still a mess here.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.240
Can I simplify that?

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.522
Yeah?

00:25:57.522 --> 00:25:58.474
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:06.761
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:06.761 --> 00:26:07.260
There's

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.990
a simpler way.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.721
Yeah.

00:26:09.721 --> 00:26:11.220
AUDIENCE: That's a
geometric series.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.160
PROFESSOR: That's
a geometric series.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.360
We just got the formula
for it, so that's easy.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:25.140
This equals 1 minus x to the
n over 1 minus x minus the 1,

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.910
because I'm missing the 1 here.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.040
So we can rewrite this
whole thing over here.

00:26:39.551 --> 00:26:40.050
Oops.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:40.550
Yikes.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.481
Got attacked.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.560
What's that?

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.960
AUDIENCE: Would it be 1
minus x should be n plus 1?

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.710
PROFESSOR: Yes it would.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:57.360
That's right.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.630
I've got to add 1 to there.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:00.200
OK.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.630
So that's good.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:08.040
So that says that
1 minus x times S

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:15.317
equals 1 minus x to the n
plus 1 over 1 minus x minus 1,

00:27:15.317 --> 00:27:17.650
and then I've got to remember
to subtract that term too.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:21.630
Minus nx to the n plus 1.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.700
That means now I
just divide through,

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.990
and I simplify-- divide through
by 1 minus x-- and simplify,

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.070
and I get the following formula.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.390
I won't go through all the
details, but it's not hard.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.590
Let's see if I got that right.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.450
Yeah, that looks right.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.780
OK, so that is the
closed form expression

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.839
for that sum, which we can
get from the perturbation

00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:57.380
method and the fact
that we'd already

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.940
done the geometric series.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:05.700
There's another way to
compute these kinds of sums,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.267
which I want to show you,
because it can be useful.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.180
So we're going to do the same
sum and derive the formula

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.180
a different way.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:31.720
This method is called
the derivative method,

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.440
and the idea is to start
with a geometric series which

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:39.280
it's close to and then
take a derivative.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.700
So for x not equal to 1, we
already know from the theorem

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:50.080
that i equals 0 to n, x to the
i equals 1 minus x to the n

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.170
plus 1 over 1 minus x.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.120
That was the theorem.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.010
We already know that.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.670
Now, I can take the
derivative of both sides,

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.220
and let's see what we get
by taking the derivative.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.440
Well, here I get the sum.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.320
The derivative of x to the
i is just i times x to the i

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.020
minus 1.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.310
The derivative over here
is a little messier.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.400
I've got to have--
well, I take 1 minus x

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.570
times a derivative of that.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:33.020
Derivative of this is now
minus n plus 1, x to the n.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.980
Then I take this times
the derivative of that

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:44.790
is now minus minus 1, 1
minus x to the n plus 1,

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.120
and then I divide
by that squared.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:58.390
Now, when we compute all that
out, we get this, 1 minus n

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:06.690
plus 1, x to the n plus
nx to the n plus 1 over 1

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.689
minus x squared.

00:30:09.689 --> 00:30:11.230
I won't drag you
through the algebra,

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.480
but it's not hard to
go from there to there.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.020
This is pretty close
to what we wanted.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:25.540
We're trying to figure out
this, and we almost got there.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.470
What do I do to finish it up?

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.470
AUDIENCE: Multiply by x.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.900
PROFESSOR: Multiply by x.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.730
Good.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:40.140
So if I take this and multiply
by x, i equals zero to n,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:49.060
ix to the i equals x minus
n plus 1, x to the n plus 1,

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:56.240
plus nx to the n plus 2,
all over 1 minus x squared.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.887
OK?

00:30:57.887 --> 00:30:59.970
Which should be the same--
yeah-- the same formula

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.776
we had up there.

00:31:01.776 --> 00:31:03.400
So that's called the
derivative method.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.525
You can start manipulating--
you treat these things

00:31:05.525 --> 00:31:09.230
as polynomials-- these sums--
and you start manipulating them

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.930
like you would polynomials.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.670
In fact, there's a whole
branch of mathematics

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:15.830
called generating functions
that we won't have time

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:20.560
to do in this class that's
in chapter 12 of the text.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.426
But you do things
like that to get sums.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.430
Any questions about
what we did there?

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.800
You can also do a version where
you take integrals of this

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.260
if you want, and
then you get the i's

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.708
in the denominator instead
of those coefficients.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.980
For homework, I
think we've given you

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.761
the sum of i squared x to the i.

00:31:52.761 --> 00:31:56.640
How do you think you're
going to do that?

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.220
Any thoughts about how
you're going to solve that?

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.440
Get the sum, a closed
form for the sum of i

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.160
squared x to the i?

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.060
AUDIENCE: Do the
derivative method twice.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.268
PROFESSOR: Yeah, do it twice.

00:32:07.268 --> 00:32:08.946
Take this, which now you know.

00:32:08.946 --> 00:32:11.700
Take the derivative again.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.880
Won't be too hard.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:23.980
You can also take the version of
this where n goes to infinity.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.655
Let's do that.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.900
If the absolute value of x
is less than 1, the sum i

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:41.820
equals 1 to infinity of ix to
the i, what does that equal?

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.356
This one, you can see
it easier up here.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:53.890
What happens when
n goes to infinity?

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:54.750
What does this do?

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.570
X is less than 1,
an absolute value.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.920
What happens to this
as n goes to infinity?

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.420
This term.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.010
Goes to 0, right?

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.930
This gets big, but this
gets smaller faster.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:16.230
What happens to this term
as n goes to infinity?

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.500
Same thing, 0.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.920
All I'm left with is x
over 1 minus x squared.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.930
Now, this formula
is useful if you're

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:37.410
trying to, say, get
the value of a company,

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.490
and the company is growing.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:44.850
Every year the company grows
its bottom line by m dollars.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.240
So the first year, the
company generates m dollars,

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.060
the next year it generates
two m dollars in profit,

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.136
the next year is
three m dollars.

00:33:52.136 --> 00:33:53.760
So you've got an
entity that every year

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.260
is growing by a fixed amount.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.870
It's not doubling every
year, but every year

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.760
adds in m dollars
more of profit.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.400
What would you pay
to buy that company?

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.550
What is that worth?

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:08.305
So you can think of this
as, again, an annuity.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:25.090
Here the annuity pays im
dollars, in this case,

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:32.250
at the end, not the beginning,
say, of the year i forever.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:43.409
This company is-- or this
annuity-- is worth, well,

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:46.190
we just plug into the formula.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:50.469
Instead of $1 each year, it's
m so there's an m out front.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:58.490
x is 1 over 1 plus p, and
then we have 1 minus 1 over 1

00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:59.714
plus p squared.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:06.840
And if we multiply the top and
bottom by 1 plus p squared,

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.954
we get m 1 plus
p over p squared.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:17.816
So it's possible with
a very simple formula

00:35:17.816 --> 00:35:19.190
to figure out how
much you should

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.730
spend to buy this company,
what its value is today.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:29.590
So, for example, say the company
was adding $50,000 a year

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.650
in profit.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:37.300
The interest rate was 6%,
the value of this company

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:45.510
is $14 million-- $14.7
million, just plugging

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.960
into that formula.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.380
So people that buy
companies and stuff,

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.494
they use formulas like this
to figure out what it's worth.

00:35:55.494 --> 00:35:56.910
Of course, you've
got to make sure

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:01.704
it's really going to keep paying
the $50,000 more every year

00:36:01.704 --> 00:36:03.370
and that this is the
right interest rate

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.465
to be thinking about.

00:36:05.465 --> 00:36:07.090
You know, and the
guys on Wall Street--

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:08.631
the bankers on Wall
Street-- they all

00:36:08.631 --> 00:36:12.670
have their estimations for
what these things are--

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.200
the value of p they would
put into these formulas.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.410
Any questions about that?

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.715
Yeah.

00:36:20.715 --> 00:36:22.247
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:22.247 --> 00:36:22.830
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.290
Good.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.170
So this one is OK?

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.040
OK.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.910
I plugged x equals
1 over 1 plus p,

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.920
like we did before--
remember for the annuity--

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.090
because every year
you're degrading it,

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.430
devaluing by 1 over 1 plus p.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:47.160
So that's the x term, and it's
paying-- in the i-th year,

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.400
it's paying im dollars.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.250
All right?

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:56.470
So the first year it pays n
dollars, the next year 2 m,

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:00.830
the next year 3 m,
the next year 4 m,

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:03.310
but every year you're
knocking it down by 1 plus 1

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:06.070
over p to the number of years.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:11.520
So what you get-- the sum
you've really got here--

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.130
is i equals 1 to infinity,
im dollars are paid,

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.300
but those dollars are
worth 1 over 1 plus p

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.152
to the i today,
the current value.

00:37:21.152 --> 00:37:22.110
That's a good question.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.350
I should've said that.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.572
That's a great question.

00:37:26.572 --> 00:37:28.030
So that's how we
connected this up,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.130
because you're getting paid
this much in our years,

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.390
and that's worth
that much degradation

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.740
or that much devaluation
today, and now we

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.930
add up a total current value.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.190
So even a company that is
paying you more and more

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:47.220
every year still has a finite
value, because the extra--

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.990
the payments are increasing
but only linearly.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:52.670
The value today is
decreasing geometrically,

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.040
and the geometric decrease
wipes out the value

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.600
of the company in the future.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.100
Yeah.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:01.810
AUDIENCE: Are you [? squaring ?]
quantity of [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.780
PROFESSOR: What did I do?

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.030
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.380
I screwed up here too.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.661
Is that what you're
asking about?

00:38:14.661 --> 00:38:15.160
Yeah.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.743
That's what I should
have done, right?

00:38:16.743 --> 00:38:20.600
Because I got 1 minus x is
1 minus 1 over 1 plus p.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.970
That gets squared, and now when
I multiply 1 plus p squared,

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.310
it's multiplying
this by 1 plus p.

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:30.630
It's 1 plus p minus 1 is p.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.342
So I have p squared.

00:38:32.342 --> 00:38:33.550
All right, so this part's OK.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.610
That part I wrote wrong.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:36.280
That's good.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.130
Any other questions?

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:47.771
So let's do a simple example.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.710
What is this sum?

00:39:14.026 --> 00:39:23.580
A 1/2 plus 2/4 plus
3/8 plus 4/16 forever.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.585
What's that sum equal?

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.975
You can plug that
in the formula.

00:39:35.975 --> 00:39:38.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.260
That's right.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.350
Good.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.310
These details.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.156
Otherwise that
sum would be what?

00:39:48.156 --> 00:39:50.640
If I didn't put
the negative here,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.510
it's going to be infinity,
and that's not so interesting.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.970
The negative makes it more
interesting, so I got 1 over 2

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.810
to the i in there.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:58.785
What's it worth then?

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:04.030
Well, I can plug in the formula.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.650
What's x?

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:07.760
One half.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:16.740
So I get 1/2 over 1 minus
1/2 squared is 1/2 over 1/4,

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:17.690
and that's 2.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:28.925
Any questions on that formula?

00:40:28.925 --> 00:40:31.280
It's amazing how useful
these things get to be later.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:39.130
So that's sort of the
geometric kinds of things.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:43.160
Next I want to talk about more
of the arithmetic kinds of sums

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.440
and what you do there.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.210
In fact, we've already
seen one that we've done.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:55.100
If I sum i equals 1 to n of
i-- I think we've already

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.500
done this one-- that's just
n times n plus 1 over 2,

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.170
and probably most
of you even learned

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.380
that formula back
in middle school,

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.220
I'm guessing-- maybe before.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.825
How many people know
the answer for this sum?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.765
The sum of the squares--
the first n squares.

00:41:17.765 --> 00:41:18.390
Somebody knows.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:19.720
What is it?

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:26.595
AUDIENCE: n times n plus 1
times 2n plus 1, all over 6.

00:41:26.595 --> 00:41:27.470
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.160
That is correct.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.450
Most people don't
remember that one.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:35.140
It's a little harder to derive.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:39.410
How would you prove
this by induction?

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.200
Unfortunately, induction
doesn't tell you

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.260
how to remember what
the formula was,

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.700
and there's a couple of
ways you can go about that.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.460
One is, you can
remember or guess

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.222
that the answer is
a polynomial in n.

00:41:53.222 --> 00:41:55.710
In fact, because
you're summing squares,

00:41:55.710 --> 00:42:00.100
you might guess that it's
a cubic polynomial in n,

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.890
and if you remember just that
or guess just that, then you

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:08.540
could actually plug in
values and get the answer.

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.870
And this is-- you
know, a common method

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:12.850
of solving these sums
is you sort of guess

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.010
the form of the solution.

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:23.760
In this case you might
guess that for all n,

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:29.166
the sum i equals 1 to n of
i squared equals a cubic.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:41.380
And then what you would do is
plug in the value n equals 1,

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.860
n equals 2, maybe
even-- we'll make

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.350
it n equals 0-- make
it simple and start

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:51.380
getting some constraints
on the coefficients.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:59.176
If you would plug in n
equals 0, the sum is 0.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.250
The polynomial evaluates to d.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:10.160
That tells you what d has got
to be right away. n equals 1.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.050
The sum is 1, and when you
plug into the polynomial,

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:18.760
you get a plus b plus c plus d.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.540
n equals 2.

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:26.710
Well, that's 1 plus
4 is 5, 2 cubed is 8,

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:32.680
so you have 8a plus
4b plus 2c plus d,

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.720
and you'll need one more since
you've got four variables.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.950
Let's see, 1 plus
4 plus 9 is 14.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:50.690
I've now got 3 cubed is
27a plus 9b plus 3c plus d.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:54.120
So now I've got four
equations and four variables

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.360
and, with any luck, I can
solve that system of equations

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.930
and get the answer.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.090
And, in fact, you can.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:07.300
When you solve this system, you
get a equals 1/3, b equals 1/2,

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:11.460
c equals 1/6, and d equals 0.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.970
And that's exactly what
you get in that formula.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:19.650
So that's a way to reproduce
the formula if you forgot it.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:23.410
Now, this method--
really to be sure you

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.920
got the right answer--
you've got to go prove it

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.572
by induction, because I
derived the answer-- if it

00:44:30.572 --> 00:44:32.530
was a polynomial, I would
have gotten it right,

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.169
but I might be
wrong in my guess.

00:44:34.169 --> 00:44:35.710
And to make sure
your guess is right,

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.335
you've got to go back
and use induction

00:44:37.335 --> 00:44:38.762
to prove it for this approach.

00:44:38.762 --> 00:44:39.262
Yeah.

00:44:39.262 --> 00:44:41.981
AUDIENCE: How do you know that
it would be [INAUDIBLE] and not

00:44:41.981 --> 00:44:43.160
some higher power?

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.710
PROFESSOR: Well, it turns
out that anytime you're

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:49.630
summing powers, the answer
is a polynomial to one

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.540
higher degree.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.750
So if you just remembered that
fact, or you guessed that fact.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:58.000
Another way to sort of
imagine that might be true

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.120
is that I'm getting
n of them, so I

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.500
might be multiplying--
the top one is n squared,

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.900
so I'm going to have n
of them about n squared.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:11.370
Might be something like n cubed.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:16.660
That's another way you could
think of it, to guess that.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.186
Any other questions on this?

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:29.970
So far, all these sums had nice
closed forms, and a lot of them

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:33.410
do that you'll encounter
later on, but not all,

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:37.580
and sometimes you get sums that
don't have a nice closed form--

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.670
at least nobody has
ever figured out one,

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.560
and probably doesn't
always exist.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.820
For example, what if I
want to sum the first n

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.840
square roots of integers?

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.774
Let's write that down.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.618
So say I want a closed
form for this guy.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.340
Nobody knows an answer
for that, but there

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:22.000
are ways of getting very
good, close bounds on it that

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.950
are closed form, and
these are very important,

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:26.060
and we're going to use
this the rest of today

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.890
and the rest of next time.

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:32.740
And they're based on replacing
the sum with an integral,

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.140
and the integral is very
close to the right answer,

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.820
and then we can see what
the error terms are.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.580
So let's first look
at the case when

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.560
we've got a sum where the
terms are increasing as i

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:54.240
grows, and we'll call
these integration bounds,

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.790
and a general sum will look
like this-- i equals 1 to n

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:04.870
of f of i, and the first case is
when f is a positive increasing

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:13.150
function, increasing in i.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.960
Integration bounds, and so
we're increasing function.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.530
So let me draw a picture
that will hopefully

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:34.060
make the bounds that we're
going to get pretty easy.

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:53.590
So let's draw the
sum here as follows.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:48:04.360
I've got 0, 1, 2, 3, n
minus 2, n minus 1, n,

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.840
and draw the values of f here.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:17.260
Here's f of 1, f of 2--
it's increasing-- f of 3,

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.550
f of n minus 1, and f of n.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:27.630
Then I'll draw the
rectangles here.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:38.620
So this has area of f of
1, this has area f of 2,

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:43.630
this has area f of 3,
and we keep on going.

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:47.070
Let's see, this will
be f of n minus 2

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:50.775
on this one-- I'll just do f of
n minus 1, draw this guy here.

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:56.670
So its unit width, its
height is f of n minus 1,

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:03.136
so its area is f of n
minus 1, and then f of n.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:11.240
And let me also--
so the sum of f of i

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.500
is the areas in the rectangles.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.760
That's what the
sum is, and I want

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:21.120
to get bounds on this
sum using the integral,

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.510
because integrals are
easier to compute.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:28.740
So let's draw the function
f of x from 1 to n.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:39.765
All right, so this is
f of x as a function.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:51.910
Now I claim that the sum
i equals 1 to n of f of i

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:57.610
is at least f of 1 plus
the integral from 1 to n,

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:58.870
f of x, dx.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:07.590
Now, the integral
from 1 to n of f of x

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:10.786
is this stuff, the
stuff under the curve.

00:50:10.786 --> 00:50:14.930
It comes down here,
starts at 1, and it's

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.760
the stuff under the curve.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.410
And what I'm saying
here is that if you

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:21.490
take that stuff under
the curve and add

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:25.000
f of 1, which is
this piece, that's

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.230
a lower bound on our sum.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:31.140
The sum's bigger than that.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:34.620
So what I'm saying is the
area in the rectangles

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:38.440
is at least as big as the
area in the first rectangle

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.250
plus the area under the curve.

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:45.190
Does everybody see why that is?

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:49.340
I'm saying the sum is the
area in the rectangles, right?

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.050
That's pretty clear.

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:56.760
And that is at least as big
as the first rectangle f of 1

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.730
plus the stuff under the
curve, which is the integral,

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:03.040
and I've left-- I've
chopped off these guys.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.500
That's extra.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.410
OK?

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.710
Is that all right?

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:10.200
So lower bound.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.510
Any questions on
the lower bound?

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:16.120
This is a picture proof, which
we always tell you not to do,

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.456
but we're going to do one here.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:26.119
And, of course, it totally hides
why did I need f is increasing,

00:51:26.119 --> 00:51:27.410
but we'll see that in a minute.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.936
The proof would not work
unless it is increasing here.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.340
Any questions,
because now going I'm

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.390
going to do the other
bound, the other side.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:41.300
I also claim-- this will be
a little trickier to see--

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:49.230
that the sum is at most f of n
plus the integral from 1 to n.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.110
So this is the lower
bound add in f of 1,

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:57.810
the upper bound
just add in f of n.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.440
So let's see why that's true.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.140
Now, to see that,
this is-- I'm not

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.400
going to be able to draw it.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.420
I want you to imagine taking
this curve and the area

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:16.480
under it, down to here, and
sliding it left one unit.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:23.967
sliding it left to here, sliding
it left one unit over to here.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:30.980
Now, when I slide it left one
unit, did the area under it

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.750
change?

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:34.280
No.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.860
It's the same area
under it, just where

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.790
it sits on the picture
is now out here.

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.320
It's this area under this
guy, but it's the same thing,

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.300
its the same integral.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.680
And you can see that
it's more than what's

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:55.110
in these rectangles, because
I got all this stuff.

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:57.050
And, of course, I didn't
even include this,

00:52:57.050 --> 00:53:01.040
so now I add the f n.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:04.640
So if I take the area under the
curve, which is the integral,

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.450
shift it left one,
so it only goes up

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:11.100
to here now, and then add in
this rectangle, that dominates

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.590
the area in the rectangles.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:15.110
Bigger than.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:19.791
Do you see that?

00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:25.020
I could do a lot of
equations on the board

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:29.550
but, for sure, that would
be hopeless to follow.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.160
Any questions about this?

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:31.896
Yeah.

00:53:31.896 --> 00:53:35.088
AUDIENCE: I guess I understand
the lower amounts because we're

00:53:35.088 --> 00:53:36.460
cutting off the triangles.

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:38.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.760
But is there-- is it
a lot of hand waving,

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.660
or am I just missing something,
that it's always going to be

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.004
the f of n is what we--

00:53:48.004 --> 00:53:48.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.750
There's a little
hand waving going on,

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:53.076
but I do believe it is true.

00:53:53.076 --> 00:53:54.700
With equations you
can make it precise.

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.876
Let's look at it again,
do this one more time.

00:53:57.876 --> 00:53:59.482
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:59.482 --> 00:54:01.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'm
waving hands a little bit,

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.940
but it also-- hopefully
the intuition comes across,

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:10.220
because when I
shift left by one,

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:13.230
this point becomes this
point, and that point becomes

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:16.300
that point, and
I'm catching sort

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:24.300
of the cusp of these rectangles,
and now I take this curve here,

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:28.120
shifting the whole
curve left one unit,

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.430
and the area doesn't change.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:33.010
It would be equivalent of
taking the integral from 0

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:35.170
to n minus 1.

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:38.809
You notice what I'm
doing-- of f of x plus 1.

00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:40.850
There's another way to
look at it mathematically,

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:43.410
maybe-- probably the
formal way to do it--

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:46.060
but the idea is that
this now contains

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.580
all these first n
minus 1 rectangles,

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.180
are contained underneath it.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:55.580
And then I just add this
in, and I'm good to go.

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.370
I've contained all
the rectangles now

00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:00.577
for the upper bounds.

00:55:00.577 --> 00:55:02.035
All right,
mathematically what this

00:55:02.035 --> 00:55:06.270
is, this curve is
0 to n minus 1,

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:10.570
fx plus 1, which is the
same thing as what that is.

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:19.180
Any questions for that?

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:23.160
But now I have good
bounds on the sum.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.100
We know that the sum is at
least this and at most that,

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:33.990
and those two bounds only differ
by a single term in the sum,

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:36.124
so they're very close.

00:55:36.124 --> 00:55:38.040
These actually are good
formulas to write down

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:38.873
for your crib sheet.

00:55:38.873 --> 00:55:48.880
That is worth doing on the test,
and we'll use them more today,

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.333
and we'll also use
them on Thursday.

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:59.400
So now we can actually
get close bounds

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.850
on the sum of the square roots.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:06.365
So let's see how
this works for f

00:56:06.365 --> 00:56:11.120
of i equal to the square root
of i, which is increasing.

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:17.470
So I compute the integral from
1 to n of square root of x dx,

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:24.960
and that's just x to the 3/2
over 3/2, evaluated at n and 1,

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:32.660
and that just equals 2/3
n to the 3/2 minus 1.

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.820
And now I can compute
the bounds on the sum

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.160
of the first n square roots.

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:47.750
So I know that square root
i equals 1 to n-- well,

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:57.000
the upper bound is f
n plus the integral,

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.204
and the lower bound is f
of 1 plus the integral.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.390
What is f of n?

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.150
That's the square root of n.

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:18.330
What is f of 1?

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:21.860
The square root
of 1, which is 1.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.310
So I'll plug that in here.

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:34.440
I get 2/3 n to the 3/2 plus
1 minus 2/3 is plus 1/3,

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:41.020
and here I get 2/3 n to the
3/2 plus the square root

00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.798
of n minus 2/3.

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:49.840
So now I have pretty good
bounds on the sum of the first n

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.320
square roots using this method.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:58:03.180
So for example,
take n equals 100.

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:07.270
This number evaluates to 667.

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:12.130
This number evaluates to
676, and the difference

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:16.290
is 9, which is the square
root of 100 minus 1.

00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:20.010
This is the square
root of n, this is 1,

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:24.210
so the gap here, square root
of n minus 1, and n equals 100.

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.430
Square root of 100 minus
1 is 9, so I shouldn't be

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:28.642
surprised my gap here is nine.

00:58:28.642 --> 00:58:30.350
So I didn't get exactly
the right answer,

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:33.055
but I'm pretty close here.

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:44.670
Now, as n grows, what happens to
the gap between the upper bound

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:47.820
and the lower bound?

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:49.370
What does it do?

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:51.000
It gets bigger.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.010
So my gap gets bigger.

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:54.490
That's not so nice.

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:59.610
Doesn't always stay 9
forever, but somehow

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:04.890
though this is still pretty
good, because the gap grows

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:09.420
but the gap only grows
as square root of n,

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:14.670
where the answer-- the bounds--
are growing as n to the 3/2.

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:19.500
In other words, my error
is somewhere around here,

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:23.150
and that gets smaller
compared to my answer, which

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:25.970
is somewhere around there.

00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:30.010
And there's a special
notation that people use.

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:33.491
In fact, let's write that
down and then do the notation.

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:54.440
Another way of writing this is
that the sum i equals 1 to n

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.820
of square root of i.

00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:02.670
The leading term here
is 2/3 n to the 3/2,

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:05.630
and then there's some error
term-- delta term here.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:09.830
We'll call that
delta n, and we know

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:19.169
that the error term is at
least 1/3 and, at most,

01:00:19.169 --> 01:00:20.460
the square root of n minus 2/3.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.090
So this delta term is bound
by the square root of n.

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:31.220
That's getting
bigger as n gets big,

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:36.920
but this value compared to
your answer is getting small.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.969
That's nice, and so the way that
gets represented is as follows.

01:00:41.969 --> 01:00:43.885
We would say-- it's using
that tilde notation.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:51.960
We write tilde 2/3
times n to the 3/2,

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.620
and now we've gotten
rid of the delta,

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.830
because this tilde is
telling us that everything

01:00:55.830 --> 01:01:01.500
else out here gets small
compared to this as n gets big.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.260
And the formal definition--
Let's write out

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.031
the formal definition for it.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.670
Now, a lot of times
you'll see people

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:27.170
use this symbol to mean about.

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:28.790
That's informal.

01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:31.975
When I'm using it here,
it's a very formal meaning

01:01:31.975 --> 01:01:32.600
mathematically.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:42.930
A function g of x is
tilde, a function h of x

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:56.840
means that the limit as x goes
to infinity of g over h is 1.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.750
In other words, that
as x goes to infinity--

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:04.480
as x gets big-- the ratio
of these guys becomes 1.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.990
And let's see if
that's true here.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.930
Well, square root
of i equals this,

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:17.730
so I need to show the limit
of this over that is 1.

01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:20.550
So let's check that.

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:26.360
A limit as n goes to
infinity of 2/3 n to the 3/2

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:33.710
plus that delta term
over 2/3 n to the 3/2.

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:38.565
Well, that equals-- divide out
by 2/3 n to the 3/2, I get a 1.

01:02:45.776 --> 01:02:47.150
Did I-- should I
have subtracted?

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:49.830
No, that's OK.

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:57.850
One plus delta n over
2/3 n to the 3/2.

01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:02.090
If I can pull the 1 out front,
that's 1 plus the limit,

01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:05.840
and this is now delta n is
at most square root of n,

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.860
so I get square root of
n over 2/3 n to the 3/2.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:17.110
Square root of n over n to
the 3/2, that goes to 0.

01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:18.530
So this equals 1.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.440
So this limit is 1,
and so therefore I

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.140
can say that the sum of
the first n square roots

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:32.500
is tilde 2/3 n to the 3/2.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.320
Any questions about this?

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:38.050
We're going to do a lot of this
kind of notation next time.

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:39.190
Yeah.

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:40.690
AUDIENCE: When you
took the integral

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:44.460
and got 2/3 into
the 3/2 minus 1,

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:49.050
why did the minus 1 not become
part of the actual solution

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.317
and become part of the delta?

01:03:51.317 --> 01:03:51.900
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.500
So you brought it
up to here, right?

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.360
OK.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.410
So then I plug that
into the integral that

01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:01.790
appears on both sides here,
and here I add the f 1,

01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:06.439
here I add f n, and now I
have the lower bound here

01:04:06.439 --> 01:04:07.480
and the upper bound here.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.090
Are you good with those?

01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:09.590
All right.

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:12.880
Now some judgment takes
place, and what I'm really

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.590
trying to do here is figure out
what are the important terms

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:20.250
in these bounds as n gets big?

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:23.440
How big is this
growing as n gets big?

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.350
Well, as n gets big, the
1/3 is not doing much.

01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:30.730
As n gets big, the
square root of n

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:34.370
grows, but it's nothing
like what's happening here.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:35.820
If you had to
describe to somebody

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.491
what's going on in this bound,
would you start here or here?

01:04:40.491 --> 01:04:40.990
No.

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.698
You'd start here.

01:04:41.698 --> 01:04:44.750
This is the action, and there's
a little bit-- the rest is just

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.600
in the slop, in the air.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.080
And so now I've used judgement
to say that delta is somewhere

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.414
in this stuff here.

01:04:53.414 --> 01:04:55.830
What's really happening, and
the nice thing is they match.

01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:59.770
The lower bound and the upper
bound match on that term.

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:04.750
So what I do is I write
it equals this term

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:10.390
plus something that's
smaller and, in particular,

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:14.080
it's between 1/3 and
square root of n minus 2/3.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:14.780
All right.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.890
So what I'm trying
to capture here

01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:20.730
is just the guts of what's
happening to this function

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:24.530
as n grows, and the
guts of it is this.

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:28.210
It's not exactly equal to
2/3 times n to the 3/2,

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:30.440
but it's close
and, in fact, if I

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.930
take the limit of this over
that, that limit goes to 1.

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:39.260
It's a way of saying they're
approximately the same that's

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.980
called asymptotically
the same, and we'll

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:45.150
talk a lot more about
asymptotic notation next time.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:49.214
We'll give you five more symbols
besides tilde that people use.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.670
Any questions about-- maybe
start with the bounds.

01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:57.110
Any question on the
bounds that we got?

01:05:57.110 --> 01:06:01.790
That's the integration method,
first getting the bounds.

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:05.650
You take the integral, you add
f of 1 for the lower bound,

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:07.974
you add f of n for
the upper bound,

01:06:07.974 --> 01:06:09.640
and it's in between,
somewhere in there.

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.960
Questions there?

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.470
All right.

01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:18.590
Then we plugged
it in, and now we

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:22.149
look at this tilde notation
that says-- well, first we'd

01:06:22.149 --> 01:06:22.940
write it like this.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:27.390
The sum is this value plus an
error term and, lo and behold,

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:30.840
that error term is small.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.480
If I take the limit of the whole
thing divided by the big term,

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.780
I get 1, which means this
thing is really not important.

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:39.732
So I write this.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.840
Questions on that?

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.500
All right.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.375
There's one more
case to consider,

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.750
and now we're going to go back
to the integration bounds,

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:57.557
and that is when f is
a decreasing function,

01:06:57.557 --> 01:06:59.390
and we're going to do
the analysis for that,

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:00.515
and then we'll be all done.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.740
So we're going to look
at integration bounds

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:13.670
when f is decreasing
and positive still.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:34.810
The example here might
be, for example, the sum i

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:40.260
equals 1 to n, 1 over
the square root of i.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.550
Say you had to get some idea
of how fast that function is

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:45.970
growing as a function of n.

01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:52.996
I'm summing the first n
inverse as the square roots.

01:07:52.996 --> 01:07:54.370
What is that
roughly going to be?

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:57.860
How fast does that grow
as a function of n?

01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:58.981
So let's do that.

01:08:02.256 --> 01:08:03.880
And, of course, 1
over square root of i

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.500
decreases as i gets bigger.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:15.990
So let's do the general picture
again and see what happens.

01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:28.790
So we have 0, 1, 2, 3, n minus
2, n minus 1, n, and now f of n

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:43.090
is the small term and f of n
minus 1, f of 3 here, f of 1.

01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:45.250
Now, I'm going to
draw the rectangle.

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:49.470
This has area f of 1.

01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:52.182
This one has area f of 2.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:03.130
This one has area f of
3, and then this one

01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:14.279
has area f of n minus 1 here,
and then, lastly, area f of n.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:18.819
So the sum is the area in the
rectangles, just like before,

01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:22.020
except now the rectangles
are getting smaller.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:27.350
Let's draw the integral
like we did before.

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:32.380
The integral is the area
under this curve, f of x here,

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.362
just like before.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.114
So this is f of x,
only it's decreasing.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:49.670
Now, let's take the area under
this curve, and add f of 1

01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:51.540
to it.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.910
If I take the area under
this curve, all the way

01:09:54.910 --> 01:10:00.780
down to here and then add
f of 1, what do I get?

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.791
Upper bound on my sum.

01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:08.290
OK.

01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:13.460
So the sum i equals
1 to n f of i

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:19.610
is upper bounded by that
guy, which is f of 1,

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:27.520
plus my integral, which is
the area under the curve.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.400
The integral is the area under
that curve, starting here,

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.110
and that contains
all these rectangles,

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:38.126
and then I just add in f
of 1 to get an upper bound.

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:44.750
Now, for the lower bound,
think about shifting

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.830
the whole curve left by one.

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:51.190
That goes to there,
this goes to here,

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:56.740
that goes to here, that goes to
there, and that goes to there.

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.200
The area under the
curve did not change

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.710
when I shifted it left by one.

01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:06.760
This is now my area
under the curve.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.830
Stops here.

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:12.800
What do I get when I take that
area and add in this last box,

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.570
f of n?

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:19.699
A lower bound,
because it's contained

01:11:19.699 --> 01:11:20.615
in all the rectangles.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:36.492
Now, what's really weird
about these formulas,

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.408
do they look familiar?

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.780
Yeah.

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.300
Yeah.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.961
I switched them.

01:11:44.961 --> 01:11:45.460
Yeah.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.870
They're the same formulas
we had over here,

01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:51.730
except we switched the direction
on the less than and greater

01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:53.970
than signs.

01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:56.000
Well, I swapped f of 1
and f of n, however you

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.280
want to think about it.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.570
The lower bound
here in that case

01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:05.000
became the upper
bound in this case.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.330
Is that possible that the lower
bound became the upper bound?

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:09.880
Yeah.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.910
Yeah, because what
really happened here--

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:15.240
which is the big term
in this case, fn or f1?

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.290
f1 is the big term
because it's decreasing,

01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:19.650
so it's totally symmetric.

01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:20.680
All right?

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.970
The proof was very
similar, so the nice thing

01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:25.710
is you've only got to remember
the bounds are now simple

01:12:25.710 --> 01:12:28.730
for any sum as long as an
increasing or decreasing, it's

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:30.490
the same as the integral.

01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:33.920
The lower bound is the smaller
of the first and last term,

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.650
and the upper bounds are larger
of the first and last term.

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:37.930
Very easy to remember.

01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:39.554
Probably don't even
need the crib sheet

01:12:39.554 --> 01:12:46.200
for it, although to be safe,
want to write that down.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:50.060
So now it's easy to compute
good bounds on the sum

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:51.550
of the inverse square roots.

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:08.530
Any questions there
before I go do it?

01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:11.440
So let's take the case
where we're summing 1

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.600
over square root of i.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:22.970
So we compute the integral of
1 over square root of x dx.

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:29.500
That equals the square root of x
over 1/2, evaluated at n and 1.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:33.650
That equals 2 square
root of n minus 1,

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:40.465
or two square root of n minus
2, and now we can bound the sum.

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:54.380
The upper bound is f
of 1 plus the integral.

01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:58.975
The lower bound is f
of n plus the integral.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.770
What is f of 1?

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:08.070
One?

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:09.530
One over the square
root of 1 is 1.

01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:10.440
What is f of n?

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.400
One over the square root of n.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.350
Small.

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:20.290
So these bounds are
pretty close here, right?

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.355
In fact, this gets really
tiny as n gets big,

01:14:22.355 --> 01:14:23.730
so I'm just going
to replace this

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:26.570
with 2 square root of n minus
2 and make it a strict lower

01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:30.185
bound, and this--
cancel there-- I

01:14:30.185 --> 01:14:34.350
get 2 square root of n minus 1.

01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:36.050
Wow, these bounds are great.

01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:40.280
They're within one for all n.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.260
That's really good.

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:48.570
So we can rewrite this in
terms of what really matters.

01:14:48.570 --> 01:14:52.510
What really matters
in these bounds?

01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:54.560
How fast is this
function growing?

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.420
AUDIENCE: 2 root n.

01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:56.000
PROFESSOR: 2 root n.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.208
That's what really matters,
so let's write that down.

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:09.506
So this says that the
sum i equals 1 to n

01:15:09.506 --> 01:15:16.926
of 1 over square root i
equals 2 square root of n-- we

01:15:16.926 --> 01:15:26.990
have a minus delta n, where
delta is between 1 and 2.

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:33.990
And so if I use the tilde
notation, what would I

01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:36.210
write down here for the tilde?

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:39.054
Past the tilde?

01:15:39.054 --> 01:15:39.970
I don't want to mess--

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:40.110
AUDIENCE: Tilde.

01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:41.026
PROFESSOR: --I don't
want to keep track of all

01:15:41.026 --> 01:15:42.599
the delta stuff as n gets big.

01:15:42.599 --> 01:15:43.390
AUDIENCE: 2 root n.

01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:48.420
PROFESSOR: 2 root
n, because this term

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:52.310
over that goes to 0 as
n gets large, so let's

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:53.090
just check that.

01:15:56.630 --> 01:16:01.530
So we take the limit as n
goes to infinity of 2 root

01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:06.235
n minus delta n over 2 root n.

01:16:06.235 --> 01:16:08.150
I'm just checking
the definition now.

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:11.020
That's what the
definition would be.

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:17.380
Equals 1 minus the
limit as n goes

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:21.200
to infinity of 2 over 2 root n.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.250
This is 0.

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:25.750
So it equals 1.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:29.740
And so now you know that the
sum of the first n inverse

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.858
square roots grows as 2 root
n, which is the integral.

01:16:32.858 --> 01:16:33.357
Yeah.

01:16:33.357 --> 01:16:37.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] dropped
off the lower bound that f of n

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:38.610
was 1 over root n?

01:16:38.610 --> 01:16:42.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I dropped it
off, because it was so tiny

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:45.150
and going to zero, I just
made a strict less than.

01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:45.850
In fact, yes.

01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:48.810
I don't hurt myself
by dropping it off.

01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:51.040
In fact, the lower
bound was a little bit--

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.210
I made a little
weaker lower bound.

01:16:53.210 --> 01:16:54.836
So this is still true.

01:16:54.836 --> 01:16:56.710
I just-- it wasn't as
tight as it used to be,

01:16:56.710 --> 01:16:59.474
so I could keep it around.

01:16:59.474 --> 01:17:01.140
Yeah, it doesn't hurt
to keep it around,

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:04.280
then it's a less
than or equal there.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:10.765
And now this would be
something like that.

01:17:10.765 --> 01:17:13.140
So I could keep it around,
but I'm going to get rid of it

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:16.430
anyway, because I'm going
to go to the tilde notation,

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:19.877
and as n gets big,
this is really tiny.

01:17:19.877 --> 01:17:21.460
So in this case, the
bounds are great.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:26.540
You can nail it
pretty much right on.

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.290
Yeah.

01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:30.290
AUDIENCE: You said one
over n still there,

01:17:30.290 --> 01:17:32.290
the number is bigger than
it would normally be,

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:34.540
so when you take it
out, it becomes smaller,

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:38.635
so how could you go to
a less than [INAUDIBLE]?

01:17:38.635 --> 01:17:40.510
PROFESSOR: Well, you're
saying you don't like

01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:42.146
the fact I dropped it here?

01:17:42.146 --> 01:17:42.729
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:17:42.729 --> 01:17:45.127
When you drop it, why do you
go to a less than instead of

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:45.627
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:51.610
PROFESSOR: Oh, because I've got
a bigger bound that I made less

01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:52.480
when I dropped it.

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.550
I took something away, so I
know I could never equal this,

01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:58.760
because I know it's
bigger than this.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.710
I know that the real answer
has to be at least this big,

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:04.937
and so it has to be bigger
than something smaller.

01:18:04.937 --> 01:18:05.770
That's why I did it.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.240
Any other questions?

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.030
We'll get more practice tomorrow
and next time with this stuff.
