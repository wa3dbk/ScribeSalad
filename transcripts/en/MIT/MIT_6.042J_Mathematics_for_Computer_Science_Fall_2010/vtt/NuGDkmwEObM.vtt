00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:24.290
PROFESSOR: Now
generally speaking,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.226
a proof is going to have
seven characteristics

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:29.650
that you want to keep in mind.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.470
Good proofs are correct--
that's obviously important--

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.930
complete-- you've got to
have all the details there.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.680
All of the key steps
have to be there.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.580
They should be clear so we can
understand what's going on.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.300
Brief is good.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.630
You don't want to crush
somebody with all the details.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.570
You want to get to the
key points, and be crisp.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.330
It's really nice
if they're elegant.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.320
Now, that means clever.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.397
It's the mathematician's
notion of beauty.

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:21.730
Like you go to the art museum,
and the artists will say,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.210
wow, that's a
beautiful painting.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.160
In mathematics, you say,
wow, that's an elegant proof.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.410
It's crisp, clever,
short, to the point.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.040
And it's really the
highest compliment

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.770
you can get from a
mathematician, anyway.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.882
And there's a lot of
judgment that goes into that.

00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:42.340
Just like in art--
there's judgment

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.382
over what is great art.

00:01:44.382 --> 00:01:45.840
The proof should
be well organized.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.950
For example, use
lemmas the same way

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.500
you would use
subroutines in writing

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.400
code-- helps to make it clear.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.105
And the proof
should be in order.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.030
Sometimes you'll see
proofs where things are

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.950
done in a haphazard fashion.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.810
All the pieces are there, but
they're in the wrong order.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.120
Sometimes-- and they teach
this in some high schools--

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.790
they teach you to
do proofs backwards.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.850
And the classic thing
there is, say you're

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.600
trying to prove a equals b.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.530
Well, the proof sometimes
will start with what

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.080
you're trying to prove.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.200
And then they'll do
a bunch of steps.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.270
And then you'll end
up with 1 equals 1,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.900
and you'll write a
check, because you went

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.440
from a equals b to 1 equals 1.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.510
And that's, of course, true.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.250
Now, that's not a
good thing to do.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.400
It can be correct if the
implications go this way.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.520
Because really, you're starting
with a fact-- 1 equals 1--

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.160
and deriving a equals b.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.000
So if, in fact, the
implications work this way,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.720
then your proof is right.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.930
But most people, especially
as you get farther along,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.470
think about it going
from top to bottom.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.330
So don't use this technique,
because it'll confuse people.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.940
You're liable to make a mistake.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.790
Just start with 1 equals 1
and work your way from there--

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.210
top down for being in order.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.090
Now, good proofs are
very much like good code.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.750
In fact, one of the reasons we
care so much about teaching you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.990
how to write a good
proof in computer science

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.180
is so that later on,
you'll be able to prove

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.550
that your programs are doing
what you expect-- what they're

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.680
supposed to do.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.325
Now, there are many famous
examples where programs did not

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:40.700
do what they were
supposed to do,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.340
with disastrous consequences.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.800
The Airbus A300 was one of the
first commercial jets totally

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.720
operated by software.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.140
It could take off, fly, and
land totally by software.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.600
It was a major advance
in the airline industry.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.110
The only problem
was, that on one

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.140
of the first
flights of the A300,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.240
the software accidentally
opened the rear door just

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.580
before landing.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.940
And the plane
crashed as a result.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.740
It was the first plane crash
in commercial history because

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.130
of a software bug.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.589
There's a famous radiation
device for cancer patients

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.970
called the Therac-25.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.350
It's famous because it
got into a race condition

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.070
occasionally, which
caused the device

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.310
to just slam the patient
with radiation-- so much so,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.700
it killed the patient.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.960
And they had multiple examples
of this, and of course,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.490
a lot of lawsuits afterwards.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.764
How many of you all
remember the 2000 election?

00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:40.430
A few of you do.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.320
OK, this will probably be the
last class that remembers that.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.030
But that's where Al Gore was
going up against George Bush--

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.930
very close election-- all
came down to recounting

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.060
the votes in Florida.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.370
But in fact, Al Gore got
negative 16,000 votes

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.590
in one county because
of a software bug

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.150
in the electronic
voting booths, which

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.501
I think they got rid of a
lot of them in the election

00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:05.000
after that.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.010
Because the software was buggy.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.840
So poor Al had enough
problem which chads

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.090
and funny business in Florida.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.580
But getting negative
16,000 votes certainly

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.890
didn't help his chances.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.820
Several years ago, a
single faulty command

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.320
in a computer system used by
United and American Airlines

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.800
grounded the entire fleets
to both airlines for close

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.210
to a day.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.050
Because they
couldn't do anything.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.480
They're all run by computer, and
the whole thing was screwed up.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.400
So there's lots more examples.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.790
We run into this issue
all the time at Akamai.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.760
Akamai is a company started
by MIT folks-- by myself,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.850
and Danny Lewin, and a dozen
undergrads in the late 1990s.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.720
And we deliver a
lot of the content

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.850
you get on the web-- Facebook,
all the search engines.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.790
A lot of the stuff you go
to comes from our servers.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.710
So we've got to be
very careful that we

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.039
don't have software bugs.

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:58.830
Now, in fact we do.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.710
And we catch them
every once in awhile.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.594
But if we got a bad
one, it would bring down

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:03.760
all the sites you go to you.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.855
You wouldn't be able to
go to those sites anymore.

00:06:05.855 --> 00:06:06.980
And everybody would notice.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.355
It would be sort
of embarrassing.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.680
Now, this really does matter.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.380
And this is going to sound a
little scary, but someday--

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.620
probably 30, 20 years
from now, somewhere

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.080
in there-- it's possible
that all of us, our lives

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.490
may depend on the software
that some of you write.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.010
In fact, to bring this
home how scary it is,

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.550
look at the person
sitting next to you.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.750
And imagine that in 25
years, your life depends on

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.280
whether their code
does what it's

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.820
supposed to do-- little scary.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.340
That's why we are
very motivated to help

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.660
you learn how to make
rock-solid arguments,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.290
so you don't have code that
fries one of your classmates

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.040
someday, or puts him in
a bad plane situation.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.100
Now unfortunately,
writing rock-solid proofs

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.910
is a very hard thing to do.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.380
Even the world's
best mathematicians

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.550
mess them up on a regular basis.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.570
In fact, it's estimated that one
third of all published proofs

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.330
have bugs, have flaws, that
render the proof incorrect.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.040
The trouble often arises
because we get lazy.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.570
We don't write down all the
details or all the steps.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.880
Because, wow, it's clear.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.740
Let's just move on.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.330
Now, this can be OK.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.010
Not such a good practice,
but it dramatically

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.100
increases the chances
of making a mistake.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.650
And there's some
very famous examples

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.274
in the math literature
from the world's

00:07:48.274 --> 00:07:50.320
most famous mathematicians.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.837
Gauss-- and we'll
talk about Gauss

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:53.670
later during the term--
he's one of the most

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.420
famous mathematicians ever.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.640
He wrote his PhD thesis in 1799.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.440
And it's usually referred to
as the first rigorous proof

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.350
of the fundamental
theorem of algebra.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.130
And that says that
every polynomial

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.410
has a 0 over the complex
numbers-- something

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.325
probably a lot of you
learned in high school.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.200
You get a polynomial.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.700
You can find roots
of the polynomial

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.100
over the complex numbers.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.580
But his thesis contains
the following quote,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.730
"If a branch of an algebraic
curve enters a bounded region,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.870
it must necessarily leave again.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.480
Nobody, to my knowledge,
has ever doubted this fact."

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.679
Warning signs-- buzzers-- should
be going off in your brain.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.090
"But if anybody desires it,
then on another occasion,

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.100
I intend to give a demonstration
which will leave no doubt."

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.620
So he's using something
that he believes to be true.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.420
He sort of thinks it's clear,
that everybody knows it.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.530
But he writes this down.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.946
And when you're
writing that down,

00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:52.730
you know there's a problem.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.700
And in fact, there's
another Fields medalist--

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.800
we talked about Fields medals
last week-- Stephen Smale

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.650
writes that this was an immense
gap in the proof that was not

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.500
filled until 1920-- more
than 100 years later.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.310
So Gauss never could
give the proof,

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.870
and nobody did for
over a century more.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.830
Remember the Poincare
conjecture from last week?

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.210
We had Colbert
talking about that.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:22.440
In 1900, Poincare claimed
it was a simple fact.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.790
Four years later, he
decided it wasn't so simple,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.600
and he demoted his claim to
the status of a conjecture.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.240
And of course, this became the
famous Poincare conjecture,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.480
which took another
century to solve.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.380
So when you think you
see yourself doing this,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.714
famous mathematicians do it
too, and it catches them.

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.130
So you want to not
try to do that.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.260
Now, in fact, just to
really bring home the point,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.940
we've made a top 10
list of proof techniques

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.330
you should not use in 6.042.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.624
So everybody go to
the handout here.

00:09:54.624 --> 00:09:56.540
In fact, there's lot of
them on the back, too,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.730
but on the front page,
there's the top 10.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.220
So we're going to
go through these.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.910
These are the ones
we've most observed

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.020
in 6.042 over the years.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.270
Number 10-- proof by
throwing in the kitchen sink.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.930
The author writes down every
theorem known to mankind,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.445
and then adds a few
more for good measure.

00:10:14.445 --> 00:10:16.820
Now, this is good, because
when you're questioned later--

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.780
you're trying to get a
better score on your exam--

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.810
you say, look, the proof
contains all the key facts.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.010
They're all here.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.030
And so that does help.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.030
You get extra credit if
all the facts are there.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.267
We are literally seen students
copy over their crib sheet,

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:33.350
if they got enough time,
for a problem they're not

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.250
knowing how to solve, just to
get all of the facts in there.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.590
Number nine-- proof by example--
the author gives the case n

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.290
equals 2 and
suggests it contains

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.166
most of the ideas of
the general proof.

00:10:44.166 --> 00:10:45.540
In fact, a student
before a class

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.690
was telling me on one of
the homework problems,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.410
he talked about it to
his non-math friends,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:54.220
and they gave examples,
not the proof.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.210
Number eight-- proof by
vigorous hand-waving-- one

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.440
of my favorites-- I get
up here and wave my hands.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.575
And it must be true.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.890
Number seven-- proof by
cumbersome notation--

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.080
here the reader gets
hopelessly confused,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.060
gives up, and says OK.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.130
In fact, I once
had a grad student,

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.740
and we called him the
encryptor, because he

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.900
could take the simplest proof
and so encrypt it in notation

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.170
and God knows what, you could
never understand the proof

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.990
and figure out if it was
really right or wrong.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.520
That goes well with number
six-- proof by exhaustion--

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.850
so does throwing in
the kitchen sink.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.870
Number five--
proof by omission--

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.680
you will see that a lot,
also by faculty-- "The reader

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.300
may easily supply the details.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.150
The other cases are
analogous-- trivial."

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.400
Experts use that all the time.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.340
You can find a lot
of my papers online.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.840
"The proof is
trivial"-- very bad.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.920
Every once in a while, it
turned out not to be so trivial.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.170
Number four-- proof by
picture-- we've seen those,

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.000
saw one on Tuesday.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.230
Number three-- proof by
vehement assertion-- sort

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.800
of like the hand-waving.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.780
The more forceful you
are in your argument,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.400
the higher you raise your
voice, the more intimidating

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.160
you become, doesn't
make it more true.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.350
Number two-- proof by appeal
to intuition-- you say,

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.230
"any moron knows that."

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.480
Well, you're sort of
reluctant to now question it.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.430
And then number one-- proof by
reference to eminent authority.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.480
I saw Fermat on the elevator
and he said he had a proof.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.330
I don't think so.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.420
Fermat's been dead
for over 300 years.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.840
And he was not so reliable
in the first place.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.940
In fact, he has one of
the most famous assertions

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.860
that turned into a conjecture,
called Fermat's last theorem.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.425
And it was not really a
theorem by the time he died.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.860
How many people have heard
of Fermat's last theorem?

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.010
Raise your hand.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.920
Yeah, pretty famous.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.935
It's the one theorem he proved
that actually, he didn't prove.

00:12:56.935 --> 00:12:59.850
It says, for all
n bigger than 2,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:08.220
there does not exist an x, y,
and z in the natural numbers

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.040
plus the positive natural
numbers such that x to the n

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.540
plus y to the n
equals z to the n.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.370
Now of course, for
n equals 2, that's

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.580
just the Pythagorean theorem.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.180
You can find three,
four, and five, when

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.860
you square them satisfy that.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.970
But it says this does not
work for any higher value,

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.360
any higher power, than 2.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.030
Now in 1637, Fermat wrote
in the margin of a block

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.410
that he had discovered
a proof of this result,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.510
but the proof was too
long to fit in the margin.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.870
And so he wasn't going to
supply the details there.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.730
And he never did
supply the details.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.750
And it took 350 years and
100s and 100s of pages.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.860
A fellow named Andrew
Wiles-- took him personally

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.710
over 10 years.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.620
He more or less locked
himself in his room

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.360
for 10 years, produced
100s of pages,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.350
and he finally did prove
Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.520
So Fermat was right
about one thing--

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.224
it would not fit in the margin.

00:14:08.224 --> 00:14:09.640
At least, there's
no proof that we

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.990
know of that would fit
in the margin of a book.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.480
Any questions on
proof technique?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.840
We're going to pound a lot on
this over the next few weeks.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.650
All right, next
we're going to look

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:31.850
at a class of puzzles that was
very popular in the late 1800s.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:36.390
Now, in these puzzles, you have
a grid of letters or numbers.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.130
And you've got to slide the
letters and numbers around

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.750
to put them in order.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.440
And so as an example, here's
the problem on a three

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.050
by three grid, or
an eight puzzle.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:15:00.570
You want to find a
sequence of moves

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:07.160
to go from this configuration.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.370
I'll do a three by three case.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.060
I have a here, b
here, c, d, e, f.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.530
And I've put g and
h out of order.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.820
And that square is blank, and
I can move tiles or letters

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.600
into it.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.670
I'm going to start here.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:29.170
And I eventually want to
get to the configuration

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.620
where the letters are all
in alphabetical order.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.270
So g and h are in order.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.430
Now, a legal move means
you slide a letter

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.910
into an adjacent blank square.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.100
And you can go in
a row or a column.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.870
OK, everybody
understand the game,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.680
what you're supposed to do?

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.810
You slide these things.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:15.680
That could go down.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.600
That could go across.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.450
How many people played
a game like this before?

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.040
Good, a lot of you.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.270
OK, so I need some
volunteers who

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.120
are good at solving
puzzles that can do this,

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.500
have played games like this,
that are pretty quick at it.

00:16:34.447 --> 00:16:35.280
So I've got it here.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.166
Who would like to come down?

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:40.790
There are prizes if
you can solve this.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.655
What we're going to
do is solve this.

00:16:42.655 --> 00:16:44.530
And see if you can solve
it in three minutes.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.170
But I need three students
to come on down and do this.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.360
Who'd like to volunteer?

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.665
Who thinks they can handle
puzzles under pressure?

00:16:52.665 --> 00:16:54.470
So you have the g
and h out of order.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.695
So it's not so hard.

00:16:55.695 --> 00:16:58.960
You move the f down there.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.977
I don't know, play
around like that.

00:17:02.977 --> 00:17:04.060
So I need some volunteers.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.210
Who'd like to come
down and do this?

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.089
You can win candy.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.589
I've got candy here.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.609
There's even a prize if you
don't make it in three minutes.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:17.109
Who wants some candy?

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:17.610
Nobody?

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.150
Is there a prize if
we don't make it?

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.940
What's that?

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.170
Is there a prize if
we don't make it?

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.670
There is.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.750
Come on down.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.250
All right, now, who's
going to help him out?

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.490
I need a couple more people
here just to mess him up,

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.434
because by himself--
there we go-- good.

00:17:31.434 --> 00:17:32.850
Anybody else like
to come on down?

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.266
Because if we get
three, it really

00:17:34.266 --> 00:17:37.070
gets hard, because you fight
over what moves to make.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.370
Now, what I'd like you
all to do is sort of

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.746
scream out
possibilities for him.

00:17:40.746 --> 00:17:42.620
Like he figures it out
there, you scream out,

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.000
that'll really screw him up.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.339
OK, now, you can't pick them up.

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:47.880
You've just got to
slide them around.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.324
And you can go, and
we'll go to 2:56,

00:17:50.324 --> 00:17:51.490
and see if you can solve it.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:54.470
If you can solve it,
you guys get candy.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.723
And if you can figure it out
out there, let them know.

00:17:59.723 --> 00:18:02.190
Slide to the gray area.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.780
No, you can't use the gray area.

00:18:06.604 --> 00:18:08.270
All right, you've got
about two minutes.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.477
They have the g and h in order.

00:18:10.477 --> 00:18:12.560
Everything else is pretty
well screwed up, though.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:15.760
What do you got?

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.900
A, b, c, d, e, f, h g-- no, no,
no, that's where you started,

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.400
guys.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.750
That's not it.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.790
It was close, just one
was out of order is all.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.850
Just one letter at a time.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:30.430
There you go.

00:18:43.102 --> 00:18:44.060
I think they need help.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.710
We got about a minute ago.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.892
Cannot see anything.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:47.850
You can't see anything.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.350
Well, I don't know
if it would help.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.330
You want to show
them where you are?

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.570
This is not looking good.

00:19:10.947 --> 00:19:12.655
We're pretty close to
the end here, guys.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:23.020
A, b, c, f, e, d,
g, h-- g, h is good.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.070
F is not so good.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.965
All right, you got
about 30 seconds.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.530
Whoa, what are you guys doing?

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.740
One at a time here.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.566
One at the time.

00:19:49.566 --> 00:19:53.520
In fact, I think
time is up here.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.640
All right, 2:56.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.020
Oh, no, no.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.110
That we don't do.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:12.020
No diagonal moves--
no, no, no, no.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.680
All right, well, you
guys were good sports,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.950
so you do get a prize.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.200
It's not the candy, but I have
these wonderful plastic Nerd

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.139
Pride pocket protectors for you.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.430
There you go, very good sports.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.570
Thank you, well done.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.400
All right.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.780
Now, I was a little
cruel to these guys,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.780
for a lot of reasons.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.830
It's impossible?

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.162
You think?

00:20:41.162 --> 00:20:42.930
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.590
Yeah it is impossible.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.610
This is impossible to do.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.470
Let's see if we can
prove it's impossible.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.230
Because it doesn't seem
so hard, necessarily.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.940
But let's take
that as a theorem.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:16.990
There is no sequence
of legal moves--

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:26.680
diagonal moves makes this a
lot easier-- to invert g and h

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:37.530
and also return all the other
letters to their original order

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.106
or position.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.790
Now, to prove this,
we're going to use

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.530
what's called an invariant.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.910
It's a very powerful
and commonly used

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.470
concept in computer science,
very closely tied to induction,

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.500
as we'll see.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.800
In order to show that
your system can never

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.580
reach a particular
special state,

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.900
it is sufficient to show
there's some property called

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.880
the invariant that holds
at the initial state,

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.540
and that is preserved
by every legal move,

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.770
and is not present-- does not
hold-- in that special state.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.230
The idea is, if you get
this magic property called

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.540
the invariant and it
holds at the start,

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.150
and it holds across
every step, then

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.640
the only states
you can reach have

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.450
to have to have the
property, be invariant.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.850
And if the special state
doesn't have that property,

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.060
you can't reach it.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.970
All right, so there
is going to be

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.130
some property we're going
to look for that held

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.110
at the beginning here-- and
the beginning had this set

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:59.420
up-- that holds, is
preserved, by every move,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.800
every legal move, but does
not hold in this state.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.527
And therefore, you can never
reach this state legally.

00:23:06.527 --> 00:23:07.360
So they were doomed.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.710
So we've got to figure
out what that property is.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.730
And that's always the
trick in analyzing

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.790
systems or
algorithms-- is what's

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.930
that key property, the
invariant property?

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.680
So to figure out the
invariant, we sort of

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.700
have to look at what
happens during a move

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.080
in this system-- a transition.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.130
Well, there's two
kinds of moves.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.080
There's a row move.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:45.590
And an example of a
row move is you might

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:53.560
have a, b, c, d, g, e, f, h.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.810
And I'm going to move the g
its row to the blank square.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.812
So it would become this state.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.720
So g moves rightward
into the blank,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.020
and the rest stays the same.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:16.150
Now, when I make a row
move, did the relative order

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.135
of the items change?

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.624
No.

00:24:21.624 --> 00:24:23.040
Of course, to be
precise, I better

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.280
define what relative order
means, or the natural order.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:39.210
So by the natural order, I mean
this ordering-- 1, 2 3, 4, 5,

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.100
6, 7, 8, 9.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:47.070
So if I look at the order
here, g moved from 5 to 6,

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.090
but didn't change
order with respect

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.150
to any of the other guys.

00:24:52.874 --> 00:24:54.040
Let's state that as a lemma.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.490
Because that'll be very useful.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:21.920
Lemma 1-- a row move
does not change the order

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.940
of the items or the letters.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.590
Proof-- well, it's obvious.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.640
No, you can't let me get
away with that, right?

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.490
Because I'm not to let you get
away with that on homework.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.120
That's not so good.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.140
So we've got to be a little
more careful in the proof here.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.580
Otherwise, we just head
down the path to trouble.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.520
So let's sort of specify,
what does a row move

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:03.450
mean-- just get a little bit
of math and specification

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.140
around it.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:13.720
Well, in a row move,
we move an item--

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:23.680
a letter-- from some
cell i, whatever

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:30.170
i-- it could be anything 1
to 9-- into an adjacent cell.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.720
What are the possibilities
for the adjacent cell?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:50.120
Plus or minus 1, yeah, into
cell i minus 1 or i plus 1.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.085
Nothing else moves.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:05.920
Hence, the order of
the items is preserved.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.600
Because if you're going
with i to i plus 1,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.450
everything else is in i minus
1 or less, i plus 2 or more.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.790
Relative order does not
change in this case.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.570
And I'll claim that's enough.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.910
You know that I've thought
about it a little bit.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.820
I've really quantified that i
goes to i minus 1 or i plus 1.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.460
Nothing else moves.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.780
Therefore, we're done.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.920
Now, I could've added
some more sentences here,

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.400
like I talked about.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.050
But this is probably enough
in this case, for this guy.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:53.400
So in fact, if we
only had row moves,

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.650
there's not much that happens.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.184
The order never
changes with row moves.

00:27:57.184 --> 00:27:58.100
So we never get there.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.683
But column moves are
more interesting.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:19.042
So as an example of a column
move, a, b, c, d, f, h, e,

00:28:19.042 --> 00:28:23.220
g-- say I move the g up.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:33.000
Then I would get this one--
a, b, c, d, f, g-- because g

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.420
moved up-- h, e.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.550
So g went to there.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.690
Did the ordering
change for this move?

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.300
Yeah.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.450
How so?

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.570
What things changed order?

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.630
Which pairs of
letters changed order?

00:28:54.576 --> 00:28:56.540
AUDIENCE: G changed [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.450
PROFESSOR: G changed by three--
moved three in the order.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.837
And what letters did it
change relative order with?

00:29:04.837 --> 00:29:07.831
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:07.831 --> 00:29:09.830
AUDIENCE: The two preceding it.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
two preceding it.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.790
g used to be after h and e.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.070
Now it's before h and e.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:21.750
All right, so it changed
relative order with two items.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.300
It changed its
position by three.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.100
It moved up three
in the ordering.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.020
And so it changed order
with the two in between.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.630
Let's look at another one.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.760
Because we're really
doing these examples

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.190
to hunt for an
invariant, is what

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.530
we're trying to do
here-- something

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.710
that will let us prove we can
never get to the desired state.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.750
Let's look at this one.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:54.050
a, b, c, d, g, h,
e, f goes to-- I'm

00:29:54.050 --> 00:30:05.680
going to move b down this
time-- a, c, d, b, g, h, e, f.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.225
So b moves down.

00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:12.470
The relative order changes.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.120
Which pairs got changed
in the relative order?

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.820
AUDIENCE: b.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.264
PROFESSOR: b changed with--

00:30:22.264 --> 00:30:23.430
AUDIENCE: c and [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:27.070
PROFESSOR: c and d.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:30.380
b used to be before c and
d. when it moves down here,

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.160
it goes after c and d.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.580
Any guess about what
Lemma Two is going to be?

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.544
What happens when we
make a column move?

00:30:40.544 --> 00:30:41.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.192
PROFESSOR: Change the order of--

00:30:44.192 --> 00:30:45.108
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.770
PROFESSOR: Good,
so a column move

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.971
changes the order of a
guy with the previous two

00:30:55.971 --> 00:30:58.470
or the next two, which means
the relative order of two pairs

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:59.887
change.

00:30:59.887 --> 00:31:01.220
So let's take that as Lemma Two.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.660
When we say don't
do proof by example,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.220
we don't mean
don't try examples.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.300
Because by trying
examples, you find out

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.370
what you're trying to prove.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.680
So that's good to do.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:39.600
A column move changes the
relative order of precisely two

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.670
pairs of items.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.750
So let's prove that.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:32:12.010
In a column move, we move
an item in cell i for some i

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:22.642
to a blank spot in cell what?

00:32:22.642 --> 00:32:24.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.334
PROFESSOR: i minus
3 or i plus 3?

00:32:27.334 --> 00:32:28.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.590
PROFESSOR: OK, and just to
see that, let's draw out

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.340
the natural order.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.890
I've got 1 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:46.690
Column moves could be here--
1 to 4, and 4 to 1, 2 and 5,

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:51.880
3 and 6, 4 and 7,
5 and 8, 6 and 9.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.810
All 12 possible column
moves, this works for.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.310
They're always separated by 3.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:17.080
And when an item
moves three positions,

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.540
it changes relative order
with two other items.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.950
And you can even write
down what they are.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:36.942
It's i minus 1, i minus
2, or i plus 1, i plus 2.

00:33:36.942 --> 00:33:38.650
Those are the guys it
changes order with.

00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:44.100
All right, we've
got two lemmas here.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.380
That one's done now.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.100
In a row move, order
does not change.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:55.070
In a column move, two pairs
of letters get flipped.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:58.240
That's all you can do
with this puzzle now.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.950
So can anybody
think of something

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.890
we can work with to get an
invariant here-- something

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.460
that won't change?

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.710
What we should be focusing on?

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.070
Yeah.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.990
AUDIENCE: You can only switch
two pairs of items at a time.

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:18.380
So if you don't have an
even number [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.850
switch [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.199
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's good.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:24.139
So really, to focus
in on there is,

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.600
if you have an even number
of things out of order

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.620
to start, you're going to
have an even number forever,

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.860
because you can only
change two at a time.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.820
That's a great idea.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:38.159
Let's really specify that
now, and define that.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:52.420
A pair of letters or items,
call them L1 and L2--

00:34:52.420 --> 00:35:12.520
they form an inversion, also
known as an inverted pair,

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:24.160
if L1 precedes L2
in the alphabet,

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.140
but L1 appears after
L2 in the puzzle.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.470
All right, so that
is an inversion.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.960
So for example, let's
see how many inversions

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.060
do we have in this case?

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:57.850
We've got a, b,
c, f, d, g, e, h.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.550
How many inversions are there
in that state of the puzzle?

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.070
Yeah?

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:14.950
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.908
PROFESSOR: Three, good.

00:36:15.908 --> 00:36:17.866
And what are they?

00:36:17.866 --> 00:36:20.130
AUDIENCE: d is after f.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah, d,
f is an inversion.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.600
e, f is an inversion.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.480
And what's the last one?

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.250
AUDIENCE: e, g.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.320
PROFESSOR: e, g is an inversion.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.430
Yes, so the answer is
there's three inversions

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:39.680
in this puzzle.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.960
And if I keep doing
row and column

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.200
moves to this, what do
I know about the parity

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.746
of the number of inversions?

00:36:47.746 --> 00:36:50.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.040
PROFESSOR: Will always be odd--
that's sort of interesting.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:02.180
OK, now, how many inverted pairs
are there in the start state

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.100
way back over here?

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.440
How many inverted pairs here?

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.215
One inversion.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.986
How many inversions here?

00:37:17.986 --> 00:37:18.485
Zero.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:27.350
All right, and can you see where
we're going to head here now?

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:32.080
If I started with
one, that's odd.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.190
And every time I do a
row move or column move,

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.750
it's going to stay odd.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.930
And I can never get here.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.190
Is that clear what
we're trying to do?

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.380
So let's keep doing it.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.350
Let's go over here.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:02.510
All right, so now we'll
use Lemma One and Lemma Two

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.820
create this notion that we only
change the number of inversions

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.883
by an even number.

00:38:07.883 --> 00:38:28.130
And Lemma Three-- during a
move, the number of inversions

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:42.500
can only increase by
two, decrease by two,

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.230
or stay the same.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.210
And this proof is pretty easy.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.060
There's a couple of cases.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:01.250
In a row move, what happens?

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.380
How does the number
of inversions

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.629
change in a row move?

00:39:05.629 --> 00:39:06.670
AUDIENCE: Stays the same.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.770
PROFESSOR: Stays the
same-- no changes--

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.090
and that's by Lemma One.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.725
Now, in a column move,
there's three cases.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.432
But we know two pairs
change order-- that we know.

00:39:29.432 --> 00:39:30.140
That's Lemma Two.

00:39:34.117 --> 00:39:35.700
All right, by Lemma
Two, we know that.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.857
But the three cases are-- let
me start on the next board.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:07.850
So Case A is that both
of the inverted pairs

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:14.030
were in order originally,
before the column move.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:17.720
What happens to the number
of inversions in this case,

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.588
as a result of the column move?

00:40:20.588 --> 00:40:21.777
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:21.777 --> 00:40:22.860
PROFESSOR: Goes up by two.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:31.080
Case B is that both
pairs were inverted

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.250
before I made the column move.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.994
What happens to the number
of inversions in that case?

00:40:37.994 --> 00:40:39.179
AUDIENCE: Decreases by two.

00:40:39.179 --> 00:40:41.220
PROFESSOR: Decreases by
two-- they were in order,

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.700
so they were inverted.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.010
Now when I flop them,
they become in order.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.470
So inversions drops by two.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:51.650
And Case C is
there's one of each.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.010
One of the pairs was inverted.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:58.870
The other wasn't.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:02.040
What happens to the number
of inversions in that case?

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.321
PROFESSOR: Yes, stays the same.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.339
All right, and we're done.

00:41:11.339 --> 00:41:13.880
That's what the lemma says-- I
can go up by two, down by two,

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.990
or stay the same.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.820
All right, now a simple
corollary of this

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.200
is that during a move, the
parity-- i.e. even or odd

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.750
of the number of
inversions stays the same.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:30.870
It can't change at all.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:45.840
During a move, the parity--
and the parity means even, odd.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.590
Sometimes it's called
0, 1, but the evenness

00:41:50.590 --> 00:42:01.460
and the oddness of the number
of inversions does not change.

00:42:08.456 --> 00:42:11.420
AUDIENCE: Instead of two pairs
you mean one pair, right?

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.902
PROFESSOR: Where?

00:42:12.902 --> 00:42:15.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] pairs.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.530
PROFESSOR: Oops, I mean
one pair's inverted,

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:19.984
one pair's not.

00:42:19.984 --> 00:42:20.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.860
PROFESSOR: No, I mean two pairs
change order in a column move.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.600
Let's go back and look at that.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.980
So I'm doing a column move.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.490
For example, g goes up.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.470
g, h changes order.

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.320
g, e changes order.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.610
g changes order
with these two guys,

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.830
so there's two pairs
that got flipped.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:51.230
So in a column move, two
pairs reverse their order.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.240
If they were in order,
they become inverted.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.792
If they were inverted,
they become in order.

00:42:56.792 --> 00:42:57.625
Any other questions?

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:01.350
Yeah.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.270
AUDIENCE: So we're saying
that letters can be

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:06.160
numbers in more than one pair?

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.470
PROFESSOR: Yes, a letter
can be in-- a letter

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:13.250
is in seven pairs, because
there's seven other letters.

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:19.000
And in fact, we're looking
at a space of 8 times 7

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.195
divided by 2-- 28
pairs of letters.

00:43:22.195 --> 00:43:26.237
So there could be 28 inversions
if they're all out of order.

00:43:26.237 --> 00:43:27.070
Any other questions?

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.230
OK, well, we're getting there.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.980
We're almost done.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.720
I've got to prove this
corollary that during a move,

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.210
the evenness or oddness of
the number of inversions

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.920
does not change.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:46.410
And that's because adding or
subtracting 2 from a number

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.440
does not change its parity.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.780
It stays odd or stays even.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:44:03.450
So adding or subtracting 2
does not change the parity.

00:44:11.987 --> 00:44:14.070
All right, now we're ready
to state the invariant.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:27.930
Anybody tell me what the
invariant is going to be?

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:31.805
What's the invariant going
to be in this system?

00:44:31.805 --> 00:44:33.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:37.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the parity
of the number of inversions

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:41.650
is odd, because it
starts that way.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:42.960
It's preserved.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.720
And it won't hold in
the desired end state

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.182
that we're looking at.

00:44:47.182 --> 00:44:48.515
So we can state that as follows.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:05.810
In every state or
configuration reachable

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:13.530
from the start
state, which is a,

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:21.160
b, c, d, e, f, h, g--
which are out of order--

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:30.690
the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.440
And the proof will
be by induction.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.750
And invariant proofs
are always by induction.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:50.100
And the inductive
hypothesis-- and this

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.270
is very typical in
a proof by using

00:45:52.270 --> 00:46:11.910
invariants-- is, so P of n is
after any sequence of n moves

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:17.260
from the start state-- in
fact, just the rest of this

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.020
is what it is.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.280
All right, so our inductive
hypothesis is P of n,

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.510
after any sequence of n moves--
so n is the number of moves

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:37.510
you took to get there--
from the start state,

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:41.550
the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.180
That is the
inductive hypothesis.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.680
This is the invariant.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.380
And they become
one and the same.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.960
And the parameter n is the
number of moves you've taken.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.625
And that's how you set up
a proof using an invariant.

00:46:53.625 --> 00:46:55.774
It always looks just like this.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.220
OK, so we're doing a
proof by induction.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.720
We've got the
inductive hypothesis.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.837
What's the next step?

00:47:24.837 --> 00:47:25.670
AUDIENCE: Base case.

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.545
PROFESSOR: Base case.

00:47:32.456 --> 00:47:34.830
And in these circumstances,
where the proof by invariant,

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:37.590
the base case is always 0.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:40.020
We haven't made any moves yet.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.860
Now in this case, if
we haven't made moves,

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:48.870
the number of inversions in
the start state now is 1.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:55.380
That means the parity is
odd, and the hypothesis

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.230
is satisfied.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:00.650
P of 0 is true, because in
any sequence of zero moves,

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:02.092
after this-- i.e.

00:48:02.092 --> 00:48:03.800
in this state-- you've
got one inversion.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.602
That's odd.

00:48:06.602 --> 00:48:08.815
The last step is
the inductive step.

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:22.510
And here we need to show for
any n bigger or equal to 0,

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:29.980
we need to show P of n implies
p of n plus 1 is true--

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.990
the standard thing.

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:35.770
So let's look at P n plus 1.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:38.260
That's talking
about where we are

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.550
after a sequence of n plus
1 moves in the puzzle,

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:45.610
from the start state.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:58.790
So let's consider any
sequence of n plus 1 moves.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:00.545
And call these
moves-- label them

00:49:00.545 --> 00:49:05.394
by M1 all the way to M n plus 1.

00:49:05.394 --> 00:49:06.560
Those are the moves we made.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.680
Now, by the inductive
hypothesis, because of P n,

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.720
we know that after the first n
moves, the parity is still odd.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.170
That's what P n says.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:20.980
That's P n.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.774
After any sequence
of n moves from here,

00:49:24.774 --> 00:49:26.690
the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.460
So we could say by the
inductive hypothesis,

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:48.450
or we could say by P n, we know
that the parity after moves

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:54.340
M1 out to M n is odd.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:05.240
Now, by Corollary One-- do
we still have Corollary One?

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.724
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:06.724 --> 00:50:07.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.140
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE], yeah,
good, we've got Corollary One.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.650
During any move, the
parity doesn't change.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:19.190
That says from after the nth
move to after the n plus 1st

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:22.141
move-- one extra move--
doesn't change the parity.

00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:22.890
So it's still odd.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:50.080
So next, by Corollary
One, we know

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:59.010
that the parity of the
number of inversions

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.840
does not change
during M n plus 1.

00:51:14.744 --> 00:51:25.710
Therefore, this implies that
the parity after all n plus 1

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:35.340
moves-- these guys-- is odd.

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.180
It started odd.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.150
It stayed odd after the first n.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:41.580
It stayed odd during
the n plus 1st.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.940
So it's odd.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:48.780
And that's exactly the
statement of P n plus 1.

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.740
So we've completed
the induction.

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.247
We've shown that P n
implies P n plus 1.

00:51:56.450 --> 00:52:01.241
All right, so now, any
questions so far on this?

00:52:01.241 --> 00:52:01.989
Yeah.

00:52:01.989 --> 00:52:03.947
AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between a lemma

00:52:03.947 --> 00:52:05.300
and a corollary?

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.440
PROFESSOR: Really, there's
not a lot of difference.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.450
Corollary usually
is something that's

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.870
a simple consequence
of something else.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:16.734
And the corollary had
a pretty short proof.

00:52:16.734 --> 00:52:19.150
Usually when you see corollary,
that's not a 10-page proof

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.770
there.

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.410
A lemma is something
that you're going

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.010
to use as a tool for
a bigger thing, often

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.060
a theorem or another lemma.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.970
In fact, now we're going to
get to the theorem, which

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:32.820
is sort of the final thing--
the thing we're really after.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.315
And that's sort of the big deal.

00:52:34.315 --> 00:52:35.690
And now the proof
will be simple,

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:38.512
because we've done all these
lemmas and corollaries.

00:52:38.512 --> 00:52:39.345
Any other questions?

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.840
All right.

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:49.170
In fact, the theorem
is up here, right?

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:52.040
There is no sequence of legal
moves to invert g and h.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.950
In other words, the
students were screwed.

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:57.060
They couldn't do it fairly.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:58.400
So let's prove the theorem now.

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:39.030
The parity of the
number of inversions

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:42.520
in the desired state-- i.e.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:51.050
in order-- the target
state-- is even.

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:52.160
Nothing's out of order.

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.320
There's zero inversions.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:07.030
By Lemma Four, the desired
state cannot be reached from

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:26.450
the start state, because
its parity is odd,

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:27.750
using legal moves.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:28.420
So we're done.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.290
So the proof of the
theorem-- by now,

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:34.200
it's short, because we did four
lemmas, a corollary, and lots

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:34.790
of argument.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:43.010
Could you have solved the puzzle
if I allow the blank to be

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:46.680
somewhere else at the end?

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.250
Is the puzzle solvable then?

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.250
No.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.790
Why not?

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:58.105
Doesn't impact the parity at
all, so you can't do that.

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.300
Again, the idea
here-- and you'll

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.850
get some practice
in homework-- is

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:12.140
you're looking for a property
that holds at the beginning,

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:15.400
is preserved by every
step, but is not

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:19.190
present in the target state.

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:22.980
Now actually, this puzzle
was enormously popular

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.260
in the late 1880s.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:29.260
In fact there was $1,000
prize offered for anybody

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.640
who could solve
the larger version.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.310
Back then, it was the 15
puzzle, which you can still

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:37.740
buy today-- same problem
on a 4 by 4 grid--

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:39.150
exactly the same problem.

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:40.470
A pair is out of order.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.430
You've got to get them in order.

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.510
You can't do it.

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:46.460
Now, the proof
you can't do it is

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:50.210
a little harder-- same
idea-- one extra idea

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.570
in it-- one extra lemma.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.080
And that's for homework.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.700
So you'll go through and
see exactly the structure

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.360
with one extra little trick it.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.177
But back then, I guess most
people didn't-- of course,

00:56:02.177 --> 00:56:04.010
most people didn't
realize it wasn't doable.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.250
So they could offer
this price safely.

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:11.130
$1,000 then is probably worth a
quarter million dollars today.

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.440
Any questions on
the eight puzzle?

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.624
Yeah.

00:56:15.624 --> 00:56:19.261
AUDIENCE: The
inductive steps-- when

00:56:19.261 --> 00:56:23.064
you said, "by inductive
hypothesis," [INAUDIBLE] parity

00:56:23.064 --> 00:56:27.465
after, shouldn't the
first term be M0?

00:56:27.465 --> 00:56:28.340
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:31.250
No, the first move is M1.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.410
The second is M2.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:36.859
Now, when I talk
about zero moves,

00:56:36.859 --> 00:56:38.400
that means no moves
are taking place.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.970
I'm still in the start state.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.920
So a move is a transition
between states.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.160
So you could have state 0.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.556
That's the start state.

00:56:45.556 --> 00:56:49.685
State one would be the
move after move one.

00:56:49.685 --> 00:56:50.810
Have I got that right here?

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:56.550
So the inductive step, I need
to show P0 zero implies P1.

00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:59.070
P1 implies P2, and so forth.

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:03.620
And P n is the parity of
inversions after n moves.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.670
So you could have state s0.

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:12.835
We didn't label the states here,
but you could have state s0.

00:57:12.835 --> 00:57:13.817
Yeah.

00:57:13.817 --> 00:57:17.499
AUDIENCE: So in this problem,
we assume that everything should

00:57:17.499 --> 00:57:20.830
be defined as rows or columns.

00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:25.454
How do we know when the
assumptions are valid?

00:57:25.454 --> 00:57:26.870
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:31.071
OK, so really,
there's two cases.

00:57:31.071 --> 00:57:32.570
To be really precise,
we should have

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:35.510
argued there's only two types of
moves, a row move and a column

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:36.037
move.

00:57:36.037 --> 00:57:38.620
And in fact, if you look at what
can move into a blank square,

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.919
there's four guys that
can do it-- the guy above,

00:57:40.919 --> 00:57:43.460
the guy to the right, the guy
to the left, and the guy below.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.549
Two of those are row
moves, two are columns.

00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:47.590
So that's right-- to really
pin down the details,

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:50.696
we should have checked those
are the only two possible moves.

00:57:50.696 --> 00:57:53.320
And if there was a third kind of
move that I hadn't considered,

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.860
this proof would be bogus.

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.290
That's a good question.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:57:59.141
Any other questions?

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:04.880
OK.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.142
Now, I think
probably, you see why

00:58:07.142 --> 00:58:08.350
the invariants are important.

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:12.290
But say that someday,
you're building software

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:14.762
to run a nuclear reactor.

00:58:14.762 --> 00:58:16.470
Now, there's a certain
state you'd really

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:19.530
like to avoid-- meltdown.

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:21.310
And you'd like to
be able to prove

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:25.220
that, in any sequence of moves
that happen in your reactor

00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:28.800
program, you never reach
the meltdown state.

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.160
Well you'd use
invariants to do that.

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:34.950
Or if you're building
software for an airplane,

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.400
you'd like to never
reach the crash state.

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.860
Or if you're building
a radiation device,

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:44.330
you never want to get in the
state that fries the patient.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:48.425
So this is an important notion.

00:58:48.425 --> 00:58:49.800
So for the rest
of the day, we're

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.470
going to talk about a
different kind of induction

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:55.390
called strong induction.

00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:58.020
It's very similar to
ordinary induction,

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:02.970
but it's a little easier to use
when solving certain problems.

00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:05.820
Now like regular
induction, strong induction

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:07.908
can be expressed with an axiom.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:14.594
So let me show you the
strong induction axiom.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.420
You have a predicate,
P n, like before.

00:59:54.570 --> 01:00:04.840
If P0 is true-- your base
case-- and for all n,

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:10.330
it's not P n implies P
n plus 1, it's P0 and P1

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:19.430
and dot, dot, dot, and P n
are all true, then P n plus 1.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:29.242
If this is true for all n,
then P n is true for all n.

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:41.470
Now, the only difference
between strong induction

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:46.380
and ordinary induction that
we did last time is this part.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:52.220
In ordinary induction,
you're showing

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.830
that P n implies P n plus 1.

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:58.360
In strong induction, you're
showing that all these facts

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.880
put together imply P n plus 1.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.810
Now, to show
implication, remember,

01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:08.234
you get to assume that
all these things are true.

01:01:08.234 --> 01:01:10.150
So you know how in
ordinary induction, we say,

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:13.890
"assume P n is true and you're
going to prove P n plus 1?"

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:17.440
In strong induction, you get
to say, "assume P n is true,

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.070
P n minus 1 is true, dot,
dot, dot, P1 is true,

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.840
and P0 is true.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.650
You get to assume a lot more.

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:26.810
So it's a stronger
proof technique,

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:30.520
because it allows you to do
more-- or so you would think.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.162
Now in fact, any proof you
can do with strong induction,

01:01:34.162 --> 01:01:35.620
you can do with
ordinary induction.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.990
It just might be harder.

01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:38.600
So you can't prove
any more with it,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.300
but it makes your
proofs much easier.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.133
And we're going to do
an example in a minute

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:44.320
where the proof is
much easier by getting

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.330
to assume all of these
things are true in order

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:50.880
to prove P n plus 1.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.990
Are there any questions
about the difference here

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:57.150
with strong induction-- that
now you get to assume all these

01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:01.910
are true as part of
the inductive step?

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:02.410
All right.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:07.410
Our first example of
a strong induction

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:10.210
is going to be a simple game.

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:13.380
We've got a stack of
eight blocks here.

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.680
Now, in this game,
what you're going to do

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:21.490
is divide the stack
into two sub-stacks.

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:25.470
So I just took eight, and
split it into three and five.

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:30.390
For that move, you get
15 points-- 3 times 5.

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:31.490
Let's write that down.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.450
OK, so this is called
the Unstacking Game.

01:02:54.810 --> 01:03:02.140
And in the first move, we
went 8 split to 5 and 3.

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:03.940
And that's worth 15 points.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:12.100
Now in the next move, I'm going
to split the stack of five

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.160
into four and one.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.760
And for that, you get
4 points-- 4 times 1.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:26.610
And I keep on going until I
have a stacks of height one.

01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:29.270
And the last move, I'll be
splitting a two into two ones.

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:30.810
That'll give me one point.

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:35.080
Then I add up all the points,
and that's your score.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.630
And the goal is to get
the most number of points

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:41.200
when you add up
the entire score.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.730
Now, just so this game is
clear, we're going to play it.

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:48.049
And I'm going to
raise the stakes here.

01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:49.590
What we're going to
do is we're going

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:51.980
to have a competition
between three members

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:55.610
of the class and the TAs.

01:03:55.610 --> 01:04:00.020
Now, if the class team
wins-- they get more points--

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.720
we're going to give
everybody in the class candy.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.340
And I've got lots of candy here.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.668
If the TAs beat you,
they get the candy.

01:04:09.668 --> 01:04:11.610
AUDIENCE: What if it's a tie?

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:13.679
PROFESSOR: We'll
figure that out.

01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:14.720
We'll come to that later.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.140
But you want to win this thing.

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.216
So I need some
volunteers from the class

01:04:18.216 --> 01:04:19.340
who think they can do well.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.030
Yeah, come on down.

01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:23.740
You two guys come on down.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:25.000
All right, TAs come on up.

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:31.760
Now, I want you
to make some noise

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.796
if you think your three class
reps here can beat the TAs.

01:04:35.796 --> 01:04:38.102
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

01:04:38.102 --> 01:04:40.970
All right, how many
people-- make some noise you

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:42.540
think the TAs are going to win.

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:43.212
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:44.420
PROFESSOR: Ooh, that's nasty.

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:47.180
It must've been a rough
recitation last week

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.930
on Wednesday.

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.884
All right, so let's see.

01:04:50.884 --> 01:04:52.800
I think we're going to
let the class go first.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.160
This is your stack.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.270
Now think about what move
you want to make first,

01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:57.750
because that matters.

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.630
And you guys can give them
some advice if you want,

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.887
as to the move they
should make first.

01:05:02.887 --> 01:05:04.470
And I'm going to
keep score over here.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.070
Oh, OK, they went
for the maximum move.

01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:11.580
That's good.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:16.160
They realized 4 times
4 is 16-- very good.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.705
So let's write that up here.

01:05:19.705 --> 01:05:23.380
You're Off to a good start.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.370
In fact, that's the
maximum number of points

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:28.720
for the first move,
I think-- good job.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.490
All right, so here's
the class here.

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:37.640
And here are the TAs.

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:48.135
And the class went 8 into
4 by 4, and they got 16.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:55.340
Now, the TAs are working
hard here, as you can see.

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.890
And they've got a move.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:59.910
That's a pretty pathetic
first move for the TAs.

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:03.230
Looking good for the
candy for you guys.

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:06.980
They got 7 points for the TAs.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.672
Class, what would you like
to do for your next move?

01:06:09.672 --> 01:06:10.588

Oh, no, no, one at a time.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.990
No, just one.

01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:33.866
One stack gets
split-- either one.

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.200
PROFESSOR: There you go.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.668
Oh, well, what do you do now?

01:06:39.668 --> 01:06:42.656
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

01:06:42.656 --> 01:06:45.146
AUDIENCE: Their strategy's
obviously better than ours.

01:06:45.146 --> 01:06:46.142
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but we've
figured it out already.

01:06:46.142 --> 01:06:46.640
AUDIENCE: We're going to lose.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.931
PROFESSOR: The TAs are
convinced they're going to lose.

01:06:48.931 --> 01:06:52.279
Three and one, OK,
good, interesting.

01:06:52.279 --> 01:06:53.320
So we have three and one.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.110
That gives you 3 points.

01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:58.000
All right, TAs, we need a move.

01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:08.000
All right, so they've gone
six and one-- 6 points.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.330
Class, you think
you're dead already?

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:17.130
So you've gotten three
and one now, again, for 3.

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.160
So you're up to 22.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.570
You're way ahead-- 22 to 13.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:23.307
All right, TAs.

01:07:23.307 --> 01:07:24.890
They look a little
disorganized to me.

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:25.694
What do you think?

01:07:25.694 --> 01:07:26.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:31.315
PROFESSOR: Another one--
you can tell where they're

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:32.970
headed here-- five and one.

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:33.792
They have 5 points.

01:07:33.792 --> 01:07:34.500
They're up to 18.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.300
They're 4 behind you.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.146
All right, class.

01:07:39.146 --> 01:07:43.640
All right, you got 2 points.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:53.290
TAs-- you really think they
know how to do this best?

01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:53.854
I don't know.

change in strategy there.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.520
All that thinking, and
that's what we got.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.371
OK, 4 points.

01:08:13.371 --> 01:08:13.870

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.939
All right, they
pick up 2 more here.

01:08:22.939 --> 01:08:27.620
The three just got split into
two and one for 2 points.

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.370
How are you doing?

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:32.729
You've got 19, 22, 24, up to 26.

13, 18, 22-- you're
still doing good.

TAs are behind.

Let's see what they've
got up their sleeves here.

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:45.950
All right, they definitely
have a strategy going here.

01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:49.109
That's 3 points.

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:53.029
Ooh, there's not much
option left for you guys.

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:53.851

no, that'll be a 0.

All right, that gave
you a point-- two

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.580
went to one and one-- 1 point.

Not a lot of choice for
you guys either, I guess.

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:15.418
There's only one way
to split that stack.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:22.010
All right, 2 points,
and your final move

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:25.979
for the class and all the candy.

01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:29.132
You get 1 more point.

You've got 22, 24, 26, 27, 28.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:37.700
And the TAs are going to get
one last move for the TAs.

got 2, 1, 1, 2.

but then they caught up.

Now, your class reps had an
interesting thought here.

01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:44.325
They ask, is it possible
that any strategy gives 28?

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.590
Hmm.

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:51.110
I wouldn't do that
to you, would I?

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:53.082

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:56.670
Yeah, probably.

Any ideas?

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:01.110
Can you beat 28?

01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:02.520
They're already
eating the candy.

In fact, you can't beat 28.

And you can't do
worse than 28, either.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.399
Because every strategy gives 28.

01:11:14.399 --> 01:11:16.690

have to throw it to the class

get the candy.

unless somebody got really
hungry down here in front.

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:01.340
OK, so while you're
doing that, let's

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.590
try to prove this theorem.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:21.830
So the theorem is that all
strategies for the n-block game

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:25.460
produce the same score.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.765
It wasn't a coincidence for 8.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.070
And the score, we'll call it
S of n for the n-block game.

01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:41.420
So for example, we're trying
to show that S of 8 was 28.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.380
So what strategy
do you think we're

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.505
going to use for the proof?

01:13:49.146 --> 01:13:50.270
AUDIENCE: Strong induction.

01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:51.784
PROFESSOR: Strong
induction-- so you

01:13:51.784 --> 01:13:53.950
want to write that down--
proof by strong induction.

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:07.430
What's the next step in a
proof by any kind of induction?

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:08.650
AUDIENCE: Base case.

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:11.230
PROFESSOR: Base case-- not yet.

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:12.230
AUDIENCE: The predicate.

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:15.880
PROFESSOR: The predicate--
what's the predicate here?

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.460
All right, so for the
inductive hypothesis,

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:24.118
the predicate-- any guesses as
to what P of n is going to be?

01:14:24.118 --> 01:14:26.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:27.288
PROFESSOR: What's that?

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:31.070
AUDIENCE: n should
be 2n minus 1 by 2.

01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:33.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's part of it,

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.680
but we're going to use this
as a predicate to start with.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.882
You've gone a step ahead there.

01:14:38.882 --> 01:14:41.090
So I'm going to start with
this as being a predicate,

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:43.150
because I'm trying to
show they're all the same.

01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:45.400
And I haven't figured out
what the scores going to be.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.970
But I think you're already
on a good track here for what

01:14:47.970 --> 01:14:50.410
the score is going to be.

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:51.948
Now we do the base case.

01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:02.770
So we take n equals
1-- the one-block game.

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:05.130
S of 1 is 0.

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:06.170
We never took a move.

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:07.080
We never got a score.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.150
There was only one block.

01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:10.560
We ended before we started.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.680
So that's OK.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.235
And now we have
the inductive step.

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:29.510
And here we get to assume P1,
P2, all the way up to P n,

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:31.610
to prove P n plus 1.

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:41.791
And so now we look
at n plus 1 blocks,

01:15:41.791 --> 01:15:43.040
because that's we're starting.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:51.890
So we have n plus 1,
and we split it somehow.

01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:53.500
And it could be any split.

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.700
We might have K on one
side, then n plus 1 minus K

01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:01.727
on the other side for
any K between 1 and n.

01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:08.660
And let's figure out our
score for that scenario.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.170
Well, we get the
product of these numbers

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:18.060
for the first step.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:24.100
We get K times n plus 1
minus K for the first step.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.750
And then as we recurse,
and we split up

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:31.300
that block of K blocks,
how many points do we

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.030
get for splitting
that all the way down?

01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.900
AUDIENCE: P of K.

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:37.191
PROFESSOR: P of K, because
that's the induction.

01:16:37.191 --> 01:16:39.315
We assume that as part of
the induction hypothesis.

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:45.080
And how many points do
we get for splitting

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.260
this stack all the way down?

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:55.590
Yeah, P of n plus 1 minus K.

01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:57.330
And you see why
strong induction's

01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:00.310
coming in handy here?

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:02.990
For the TA's strategy,
K would be 1.

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:05.099
We know P of 1 is 0.

01:17:05.099 --> 01:17:06.890
And you would just need
ordinary induction.

01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:08.760
This would be P of n.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.300
But for a general strategy,
it could be any split.

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.110
So we need to have all
these assumed here.

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:18.330
It makes it much easier
when using strong induction.

01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:20.310
All right, so this
is our total score

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:23.180
for the game for
n plus 1 blocks.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:28.240
And we're trying to show
it just depends on n,

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:33.149
and that it doesn't depend
on K. Does that depend on K?

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:40.210
Looks like it to me, right?

01:17:40.210 --> 01:17:44.020
I got K in every single term.

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:44.740
So I'm not there.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.240
I'm stuck.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.939
You see why I'm stuck?

01:17:48.939 --> 01:17:51.230
Because I'd like to be able
to say that the score I get

01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:54.120
for the n plus one
block game-- this

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.520
is S n plus 1-- is the same
for any sequence of moves.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.260
It doesn't even depend on
K. But I can't do that.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.310
What do you do when you're
stuck with an induction proof?

01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:06.460
What's one of the tricks?

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:07.584
AUDIENCE: Make it stronger.

01:18:07.584 --> 01:18:09.800
PROFESSOR: Make
it stronger, which

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.360
means I get a stronger
induction hypothesis.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.030
Now, somebody gave me
one up there before.

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:19.196
How could I strengthen my
induction hypothesis here?

01:18:22.052 --> 01:18:23.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.320
PROFESSOR: Give the
formula for S n-- that

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.360
would make it stronger.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.140
I tell you what it is.

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:32.760
What's a good guess
for the formula here?

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:33.700
AUDIENCE: Factorial.

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:41.580
PROFESSOR: Factorial-- Well,
is S of 8 equal 8 factorial?

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:44.234
No, not so good.

01:18:44.234 --> 01:18:46.631
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

01:18:46.631 --> 01:18:48.130
AUDIENCE: n equals
n minus 1 over 2.

01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:51.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a better guess--

01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:56.160
equals n times n minus 1 over 2.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.750
And in fact, what's
8 times 7 over 2?

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:00.330
It's 28.

01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:01.770
It works here.

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:02.770
Let's check another one.

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.520
What's S of 2?

01:19:07.171 --> 01:19:07.670
AUDIENCE: 1.

01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:12.740
PROFESSOR: 1-- well, 2
times 1 over 2-- it works.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.690
What's S of 3?

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.130
2 the first move, then 1 more.

01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:26.340
3-- 3 times 2 over
2 is 3-- looks good.

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.430
So now I've got a stronger
induction hypothesis.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.220
Not only is it
always the same, it

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.710
is that number is your score.

01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:35.190
Let's see if that works.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:38.000
Let's plug that in now.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.560
So base case--
let's check it out--

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:47.520
is 1 times 1 minus
1 over 2 equal to 0.

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.750
Yes.

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:53.040
Let's plug it in here now.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:58.570
P of K would be now
K, K minus 1 over 2.

01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:08.220
This would be n plus 1 minus K,
n minus K over 2 plus this one

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:08.720
here.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:15.850
All right, I've got to add
all these things up, and see

01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:19.473
if it equals that
expression for n plus 1.

01:20:19.473 --> 01:20:20.435
Let's do that.

01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:29.780
All right, I get 2 K n
plus 2 K minus 2 K squared.

01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:34.920
I'm putting all this over 2--
one giant mess over 2 here--

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:43.120
plus K squared minus
K plus n squared.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:52.940
Well, let's write it just as
n plus 1 times n, minus K n,

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:57.860
minus K, minus K n, all over 2.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.770
And now let's cancel.

01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:04.420
Two K n's here cancel K n, K n.

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:12.310
2K cancels K and K. 2K
squared minus 2 K squared

01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:14.070
cancels K squared.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:20.970
And I forgot, plus K
squared from here and here.

01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:25.040
So I'm left with n
plus 1 times n over 2.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.450
That is S n plus 1.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.770
And the K disappears.

01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:34.740
We've established, now, the
stronger induction hypothesis.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:38.980
So not only did we prove
that every set of unstackings

01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:40.960
gives you the same score.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:46.010
We proved the score is, for
n blocks, n times n minus 1

01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.570
over 2.

01:21:49.787 --> 01:21:51.620
That's was pretty good
for strong induction.

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.710
It lets you do some
pretty powerful things.

01:21:53.710 --> 01:21:56.820
OK, very good,
that's it for today.
