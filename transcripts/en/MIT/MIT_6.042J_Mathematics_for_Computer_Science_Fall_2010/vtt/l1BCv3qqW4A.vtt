00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:25.030
TOM LEIGHTON: Today
we're going to talk

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.560
about the concept
of independence.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:41.760
In probability, we
say that an event A

00:00:41.760 --> 00:01:00.210
is independent of an event B
if one of two conditions hold.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.910
First, if the
probability of A given B

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.910
is just the same as
the probability of A

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:16.470
or if B can't happen, namely
the probability of B is 0.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.450
In other words, A is independent
of B if knowing that B happened

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.060
doesn't change the probability
that A is going to happen.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.720
So knowing that
this event occurs

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.460
doesn't influence the
probability that A occurs.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.700
And there's a special case where
they're independent because you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.820
know that B can't happen.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.020
If the probability
of B happening is 0,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.271
then everything is
independent of B.

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.260
Now, the typical
example that gets used

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.515
is when you flip two coins.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.525
So say we flip two
fair, independent coins.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:21.090
And let's let B be the event
that the first coin is heads

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.930
and that means that the
probability of B happening

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.040
is 1/2, because we've
assumed it's a fair coin,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.110
and we'll let A be the event
that the second coin comes out

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.120
heads.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.145
So we know the probability of
A is 1/2 because it's fair.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.300
And because they're
independent, we

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.460
can conclude that the
probability of A given B

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.780
is 1/2, which is the probability
of A. In other words,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.830
seeing the result
of the second coin

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.190
doesn't tell you anything about
the result of the first coin.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.300
Now actually, when
you flip two coins,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.520
it's not just always the
case if they're independent.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.240
Can anybody think
of an example where

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.550
you can flip a pair of coins
and they are dependent somehow,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.771
they're not independent?

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:26.270
Yeah.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.640
AUDIENCE: Well, if you have to
get two heads and two tails?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.500
TOM LEIGHTON: If you have to
get two heads or two tails.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.200
Well, how would you have to get?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.426
AUDIENCE: The probability
of getting two heads

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:42.092
should be 1/4 [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:42.092 --> 00:03:43.550
TOM LEIGHTON: Well,
then they would

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.015
be independent in that case.

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:45.515
Yeah.

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:47.223
AUDIENCE: If you glue
the coins together.

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:48.150
TOM LEIGHTON: Yeah.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.160
I mean, this is a silly example,
but I got two fair coins here.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.866
I could clip them together
and now I flip them

00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:00.490
and odds are pretty good they're
both going to be heads or both

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.990
be tails.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.230
If you know what happened
to the right coin,

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.040
it will tell you what
happened to the left coin.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.600
Now, that's a pretty
contrived example,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.000
but it is illustrative of
what happens in practice.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.610
In practice, we
assume independence

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.329
even though there can
be subtle dependencies

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.620
and this could lead to trouble.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.650
In fact, we're going to
give a lot of examples

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.090
where it leads to
trouble today and also

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.560
for the rest of the course.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.390
Because we're always going to
want to assume independence

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.400
and when we do, we're going
to get very nice results,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.820
but things aren't always
independent in practice

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.860
and establishing independence
is a hard thing to do.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.930
For that matter, while
we're on the subject,

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.450
we always talk about fair coins.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.650
You flip a coin and it's fair.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.450
You know, that's not
always to either.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.130
There's actually a
famous mathematician

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.100
named Persi Diaconis who used
to down the street at Harvard

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.070
and he came and
gave a talk one day

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.540
at MIT in the math department
and he's a probabalist.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.830
He does probability theory
and is a very cool guy.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.890
And so he flipped a coin,
got a quarter from somebody

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.400
in the audience and
flipped it and he

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.360
flip that I think 10 or
20 straight times all

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.900
the way to the roof,
caught it, turned it over.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.812
Every time it was heads.

00:05:18.812 --> 00:05:22.190
And he goes, now what's the
probability of that happening?

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.800
Well, you know, it's 1/2
to the 20th or whatever,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.130
not very likely.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.730
How could he always
make it come out heads?

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.780
Well, Persi was an unusual
guy and in fact, he'd

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.480
spent months in the strobe
lab over at Harvard practicing

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.794
to make it always rotate seven
times, three of them on the way

00:05:41.794 --> 00:05:43.460
up, one at the top,
and then three down.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.280
And he could actually
see how many rotations it

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.420
had done to make
sure it was seven,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.950
so it always came out heads.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.560
Now, he is an unusual fellow.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.360
He was 1 of 10 people
in the world that

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.482
could do a perfect shuffle
reliably on a deck of cards

00:06:00.482 --> 00:06:01.940
and that's a very
hard thing to do.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.330
He said he had to practice 8
hours a day for over six months

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.722
to be able to do it every time.

00:06:07.722 --> 00:06:09.930
In fact, he gave another
talk at MIT where he came in

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.520
and he made magic tricks,
actually based on mathematics.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.440
And you would cut a deck,
he would feel it like this

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.500
and tell you where you
cut, how many cards

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.390
were in the part you picked
up and then do his eight

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.215
perfect shuffles, which
is enough to return

00:06:24.215 --> 00:06:28.720
a normal 52-card deck back
to its original order.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.170
And then using this,
he could play the game

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.360
where pick any card,
you stick it in,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.719
he feels where the card went,
and then using mathematics,

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:39.260
he could shuffle
the deck eight times

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.670
and make the card come out
anywhere he wanted in the deck.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.000
So he had a lot going
on upstairs too.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.910
He had an interesting
life history.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.880
He ran away from
home as a young child

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.150
and joined the traveling circus.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.580
And then somehow from there, he
joined the faculty at Harvard.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.190
You know, there's
an amazing story.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.897
And actually your
story about Persi

00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:06.190
is he was the first
guy to get kicked out

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.060
of casinos for card counting.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.970
He figured that out way before
the MIT team and the movie 21.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.720
Down in Puerto Rico,
he used to play

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.470
and then they finally figured
him out and he got booted.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:26.230
So back to independence, let's
do another picture example.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.720
Say that my sample
space looks like this

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.650
and I've got two events, A
and B and they look like this,

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.456
so they're dis-joined.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:40.340
Are A and B independent?

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.410
No.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:47.780
In fact what is the probability
of A given B as I've drawn it?

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.560
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.940
TOM LEIGHTON: 0.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.371
Because if B occurs,
you're outside of A.

00:07:54.371 --> 00:07:57.175
And so this does not
equal the probability of A

00:07:57.175 --> 00:07:59.860
as long as it's not 0.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.000
So disjoint events don't imply
that they're independent.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.840
Now, what's the picture
look like for them

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.630
to be independent?

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.926
What is the right
picture to draw here?

00:08:19.926 --> 00:08:22.880
So I got my sample
space and say I

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.070
make this half the sample
space be A. Well, then B

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.110
to be independent,
would look something--

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.175
I didn't quite draw it.

00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:35.309
I actually have it be 50-50.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:41.860
So if a is 50% of S,
like this half, then

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.360
for A to be independent of
B, A intersect B, this part,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.920
has to be 50% of B. Because
the probability of A given B

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.081
must equal the probability
of A to be independent.

00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:00.330
So this would be a picture
where they are independent.

00:09:03.534 --> 00:09:04.950
Now, independent
events are really

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.490
nice to work with and
in part because they

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.170
have a very simple
rule for computing

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.070
the probability of an
intersection of events

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.015
and it's called the product
rule for independent events.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:44.620
And that says that if
A is independent of B,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:51.000
then the probability of
A and B or A intersect B

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.680
is just the product
of their probabilities

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.290
separately, the probability of
A times the probability of B.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.530
So let's prove this.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.390
And there's two cases, depending
on whether or not B can happen,

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.490
if the probability
of B is 0 or not.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:18.880
So case 1 is B can't happen.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.220
The probability of B is 0.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.980
In this case, what's the
probability of A and B?

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.330
B can't happen.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.170
0.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.620
If B can't happen,
then they both can't.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.800
You can't have both
of them happening

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:47.080
and that equals the probability
of A times the probability of B

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.670
because the
probability of B is 0.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.730
So that case works.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:58.010
Case 2 is the probability
of B is bigger than 0.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.490
In that case, we have
the probability of A

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.980
and B, A intersect B,
well, from the definition,

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.390
is the probability of B times
the probability of A given

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.270
B. We did that last time.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:24.370
And by independence, this
is just the probability of A

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.270
because A is independent
of B, so we're done.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.420
In fact, many texts
will define independence

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.460
by this product rule.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.990
Many texts will say
that A and B are

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.320
independent if this is true.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.070
And it's equivalent,
it turns out.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.810
We won't prove that here, but if
you use this as the definition,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.084
then you can derive our
definition as a result.

00:11:54.084 --> 00:11:56.250
So this is an equivalent
definition of independence.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.570
Another nice fact about
independent events

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.695
is that it's a
symmetric relationship.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.925
It's called the symmetry
of independence.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:34.540
That says that if they
A is independent of B,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.440
then the reverse is true.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:46.240
B is independent of A.
Now, we won't prove that.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.590
It's actually easier
to see that it's true

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.380
if this were the
definition of independence

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.810
because A intersect
B is the same

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.750
as B intersect A and
multiplication is commutative.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.980
So it's easier to see it if
we had used that definition.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.150
So because of this
we often just say

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.760
A and B are independent
because it doesn't matter which

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.450
order you're taking them in.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:19.171
All right, any questions
about the definition so far?

00:13:19.171 --> 00:13:19.970
All right.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.520
Let's do some examples.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.380
Let's say I have two
independent fair coins.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.970
And I'm going to
have the event A be

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:57.520
the situation when the coins
match, both heads, both tails.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.190
And B is going to be the event
that the first coin is heads.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.350
And I want to know, are
A and B independent?

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.896
Are those independent events?

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:27.650
Well, what's the
first answer to this?

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.290
I mean, A is event
the coins match.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.670
B tells me what
the first coin was.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.650
So the first inclination
here is that these

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.960
are dependent events
because I know something

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.760
about the first coin,
so that might tell me

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.510
something about the
probability they match.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.080
There could be some
dependence here.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.110
Now, in fact, because it's
set up, they're independent

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.390
and we can check that by
just doing the calculation,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:59.220
computing the probability of A
given B. Maybe I can do that.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.910
I'll do that here.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:09.320
The probability of
A given B is, well,

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.190
the condition that they're
going to match given

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.370
that the first
point is heads means

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.280
it's the same as the
second coin being heads.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:25.630
This is the probability the
second coin is heads and that's

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:30.732
just 1/2 because it's a
fair coin and independent

00:15:30.732 --> 00:15:31.440
of the first one.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:38.370
Now, the probability of A, by
itself, the events the coins

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.860
match, what's that?

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.670
How much is that?

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.855
What's the probability
the coins match?

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.945
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:53.945 --> 00:15:55.680
TOM LEIGHTON: 1/4 plus 1/4.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.020
I've got 1/4 chance
of heads, heads

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:03.670
1/4 chance of tails, tails,
so it's 1/2, so it works out.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.340
The probability of A given B
equals the probability of A.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.200
They're both 1/2.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.770
So A and B are
independent events

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.400
because that's
just the definition

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.066
even though it looked like there
might have been some dependence

00:16:19.066 --> 00:16:21.170
lurking around here.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.630
Now, this example that I just
did is a little misleading.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.950
The intuition they
probably are dependent

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.970
actually is good
intuition in this case

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:37.351
because if I don't have fair
coins, they are dependent.

00:16:37.351 --> 00:16:37.850
All right.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.700
So in particular,
let's look at what

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:45.220
happens if the probability
of a heads is p

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.560
and the probability of tails
is 1 minus p for both coins.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.730
So let's compute the
probability of A given

00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.070
B. What is it in this case?

00:17:02.214 --> 00:17:04.380
Well, it's the probability
the second coin is heads.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:04.940
What's that?

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.700
p because both of them are
heads with probability, p.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.109
They're independent still.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.130
The two coins are independent.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.369
And now let's look
at the probability

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:20.859
that the coins match.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.530
Well, it's a probability
of heads, heads

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.520
and the probability
of tails, tails.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.180
Heads, heads is p times p.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.790
Tails, tails is 1
minus p squared.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.840
So to independent, I
need this to equal that

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.330
or to have the
probability of B be 0.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:50.730
So A and B are
independent if and only

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.880
if-- the first
case is probability

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:02.970
B is 0, which means
that p equals 0,

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.510
or that has to equal this.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:15.770
So p would have to equal 1
minus 2p plus 2p squared,

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.420
just square that out there.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.750
So let's solve this.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:26.590
That happens if and only
if 0 equals 1 minus 3p

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.630
plus 2p squared.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:34.090
That's true if and only if
0 equals-- I factor this--

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:40.170
it's 1 minus 2p times 1 minus
p and that's if and only

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:48.510
if p is 1/2 or p
is 1, two roots.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.160
So if the coins are always
heads, they're independent.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.040
If they're always tails,
the events are independent

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.300
or if they're fair coins, these
two events are independent.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:04.280
But anything else, they're
not independent anymore.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.320
Any questions?

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.970
And now you can sort
of see if the coins are

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.290
likely to be tails
and the first one

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.350
comes up heads, that should
influence the probability

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.361
the coins match.

00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:18.245
It should change.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.290
Questions?

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:22.790
All right.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.790
So there's a nice application
of this to getting

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.860
an edge in ultimate Frisbee.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.400
Now, when you're
playing ultimate,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.740
you've got to decide who
gets the Frisbee first.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.590
And sometimes you don't have
a coin to flip, call heads

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.860
or tails, but you
do have the Frisbee.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.950
Now, you could flip the Frisbee
and call right side up or not,

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.690
but the problem is the Frisbee
is known not to be a fair coin.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.190
When you toss it
up in the air, it's

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.980
likely to wind up on, I
guess, the curved edge down.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.690
So that wouldn't be fair
to call heads or tails.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.240
So the standard solution
is to flip the two

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.520
Frisbees at the same
time or one Frisbee twice

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.570
and somebody calls
same or different,

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.440
that the two Frisbees both
come up on the same way

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.040
or they come up
different ways and then

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.000
if you called it right, you
get to start with a Frisbee.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.700
And the idea behind this is
that that simulates a fair coin,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.640
that the probability that
they're the same is 50-50.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.390
What do you think.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:32.060
Is that a fair way to
decide who starts first?

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.560
Yeah.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.452
AUDIENCE: No.

00:20:33.452 --> 00:20:34.510
TOM LEIGHTON: No.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.500
Yeah, that's right.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.740
It's not.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:43.590
Now, it is in the case
when the coin was fair,

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.610
but we know the
Frisbee is not fair.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:50.040
And in fact, you can see
this from this probability.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.590
This is the probability
of a match, which

00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:01.190
is fine at p equal
1/2, but in fact,

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.190
if you analyze
this equation, you

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:07.950
find out its minimum
value is at p equals 1/2

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.860
and as p starts moving away
from 1/2 towards 0 or to 1,

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.520
it gets bigger.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.610
And we know that for
Frisbees, p is not 1/2.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:23.562
This means that the probability
of a match is better than 50%.

00:21:23.562 --> 00:21:25.020
So if you're ever
playing ultimate,

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.343
always call same
because you're going

00:21:27.343 --> 00:21:29.260
to have a better than
50-50 chance of getting

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.720
to start with the Frisbee.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.610
It's not a fair example.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.000
There is another example
of how to make a fair coin

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.230
from a biased coin to an
unbiased coin in homework, ways

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.760
of doing this that are fair.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.650
Because often you have
biased random numbers

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.827
and you want to get unbiased
or maybe you got a fair coin

00:21:50.827 --> 00:21:52.660
and you want to make
something that comes up

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.570
heads with probability 1/3.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.720
How do you actually do
that in a way that works?

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.880
Any questions on that?

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:09.190
The next example is from
the first OJ Simpson trial.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.930
How many people here
know who OJ Simpson is?

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.610
OK, so he's still pretty famous.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.340
Now, as you probably
know then he

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.040
was a famous football player.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.500
Back when I was a kid, he
was a famous college player,

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.850
then he was a famous
pro player and then he

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.100
was an actor, famous actor.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:34.430
And then he was accused of
murdering his wife in a gory

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:37.570
knifing and a friend
of his wife's.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.060
And ultimately, the jury
found him not guilty,

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.820
but pretty much everybody in
the country thought he did it.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.050
He looked really guilty.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.870
And it was a big media event,
one of the first big trial

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.280
events on TV.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.070
And so all the proceedings
were on TV and everybody

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.930
watched them.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.580
We'd all go home to
watch the OJ hearing.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.930
It was amazing.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:03.270
Now, during the
indictment proceedings,

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.920
there was a huge dispute
over what independence

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.650
was and does it matter.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.810
The issue arose when the
prosecution witness claimed

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.900
that only 1 in 200 Americans
had a certain blood type that

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.080
matched the blood type found at
the scene of the crime, which

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.450
was alleged to be OJ's blood.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.030
And this was during
the indictment

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.720
and back then DNA
tests took a long time

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.590
and they weren't ready yet.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.380
And the witness presented
the following facts and this

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.320
was the crime lab
guy, the police guy.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:59.355
He said that 1 in 10 people,
roughly, matched type O blood.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.355
And that 1 in 5 people matched
the Rh factor positive.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:20.402
And that 1 in 4 people match a
certain kind of marker, which

00:24:20.402 --> 00:24:21.610
I don't remember what it was.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:26.920
We'll just call it marker XYZ,
some other factor of the blood.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:33.370
And then this conclusion was
that this means that 1 in 200

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:40.720
match all three factors.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.970
And this seems reasonable
because there's

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:49.920
1/10 of the people have O, if 15
of them have positive Rh factor

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.400
and then 1/4 of
all of those have

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.430
this marker, that's 1 in 200.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.810
Now, it's important
because OJ's blood

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:07.310
and the blood at the crime
scene both matched all three.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.720
So the implication,
of course, is

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.620
that OJ is looking like
the guy who did it.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.670
And the question was, well,
is the 1 in 200 really true?

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.060
We can sample these
three in the populations

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.850
and see they're true, but
is 1 in 200 really true?

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.660
Now, it would be if,
in fact, we verified

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.700
that 1/5 of the
type O people have

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.480
positive and 1/4 of
the O positive people

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.500
have the XYZ marker.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.230
But well, we don't necessarily
know that unless we

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.820
go figure that out.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.030
If you assume
they're independent,

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.192
then it would be true.

00:25:46.192 --> 00:25:47.900
The product rule will
tell us that if you

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.280
assume they're independent.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:55.290
So during the trial, a special
math defense counsel showed up,

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.790
not part of the
normal defense team,

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:00.480
but he was brought in as
a mathematician and lawyer

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.570
and he crosses the
police guy on the stand.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.480
And he asked the
police guy, the lab guy

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.350
if it is known that these
three factors are independent.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.162
Well, the poor
police lab guy never

00:26:15.162 --> 00:26:16.870
heard the word
independent before, didn't

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.380
know what it meant and the
defense counsel proceeded

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.310
to crucify him on the stand.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.310
And then in the end, all
he could say was, look,

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.226
we just get these things
and we multiply them.

00:26:26.226 --> 00:26:29.500
That's what we're
supposed to do.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.950
It was a little scary.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.120
The actual transcript--
you can still get it--

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.620
is a little scary.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.990
The same problem arises
today with DNA testing.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.880
Only there, you've got
lots of these things

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.720
and you multiply
them all together

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.210
and you get
probabilities like one

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:50.260
in many billion
probability of a match.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.410
Now, there's probably a higher
level of science going on

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.370
with DNA testing,
but it's even harder

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.440
to really establish
independence.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.560
If you assume it, fine.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.690
The math works out great.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.280
You just multiply them together.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.840
But how do you know
it's really true?

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.330
How do you know that maybe a lot
of people that have those four

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:14.120
markers and DNA don't happen
to just have the fifth also,

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.160
but it really is
totally unrelated.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.210
And to know that
for sure, you got

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:23.060
to test hundreds of millions of
people, which we really haven't

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.320
done yet, and not just
a few guys in Detroit

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.280
to be able to conclude
independence of 1

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.800
in a billion probabilities.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.160
So for us, this is a lot easier.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.826
In the classroom, we
assume independence

00:27:34.826 --> 00:27:37.550
and we'll keep doing
that left and right,

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.620
but it doesn't mean
it's true in reality.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.380
In fact, in the
last week of class.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.720
We'll talk about how false
assumption of independence

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.490
on mortgage failures led to
the subprime mortgage disaster

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.780
in the recession.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.162
It was all because of
some mathematics mistakes

00:27:54.162 --> 00:27:54.870
that people made.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.910
Now, this example
raises the question of,

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:04.319
what does independence mean when
you have more than two events?

00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:06.360
We defined independence
when there is two events,

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.280
but here there's three.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.450
And so to be careful, we
got to actually define

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:16.010
dependence among more than
two events and in this case,

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.990
we talk about the events as
being mutually independent.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.090
So let me define that.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:44.330
So if I've got events
A1, A2, up to An,

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:56.120
we say they are
mutually independent if,

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:02.490
and this is a little complicated
notation, but for all i

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:10.740
and for all sets j that
are subsets of the events,

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:19.380
but not including i,
then the probability

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.890
that the i-th event occurs
given that all the events

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:29.010
in the subset
occurred, is the same

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.280
as the probability of the i-th
event occurring by itself.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.570
Or there's a special
case where the chance

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.100
the other events occur is 0.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.740
In other words, a
collection of events

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.220
is mutually independent
if any knowledge

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.960
about any of the rest of the
events, happening or not,

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.470
does not influence the
event you're looking

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.970
at for each of those events.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.080
So no information about
any of the other markers

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.980
the blood influences the
i-th marker for any i.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.770
The probabilities are unchanged.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.710
Now, there's an equivalent
definitions based

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.691
and the product rule.

00:30:14.691 --> 00:30:16.860
Let me show you that version
because that's easier

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.734
to work with usually.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:43.880
This is the product
rule form and it

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:50.550
says that A1, A2, up
to An are mutually

00:30:50.550 --> 00:31:07.560
independent if for any
subset of the events

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.880
the probability of each of those
events in the subset happening,

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:18.364
all them happening,
is simply the product

00:31:18.364 --> 00:31:19.780
of their individual
probabilities.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:30.910
So independence
means that if you

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.430
want the probability of a
bunch of events occurring,

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.996
just multiply them
out individually.

00:31:35.996 --> 00:31:37.370
And that follows
for independence

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.600
or it could be the
definition of independence,

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.080
depending on how
you want to do it.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.496
So either of these
are good enough

00:31:42.496 --> 00:31:47.200
for you to use as a definition
or a result for independence.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.030
And so the blood guy, of course,
is just multiplying them out

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.390
because they're assumed
to be independent,

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.180
so it's OK that way.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.125
Let's do an example.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.900
So for example, say
we have three events.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:25.430
A1, A2, and A3 are
mutually independent

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.450
if, these are the things
you have to check,

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:35.144
probability A1 and A2
is just the probability

00:32:35.144 --> 00:32:36.560
of A1 times the
probability of A2.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.900
Then you'd check that the
probability of A1 and A3

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.390
is the product of their
probabilities, A1 and A3.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.250
And you'd check the
probability of A2

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.460
and A3 is the product
of their probabilities.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.550
And there's one
more thing to check.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.290
What's that?

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.120
All of them.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:23.090
The probability of all of them
is the product of each of them

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.845
together here.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.870
So if you want to show
the three events are

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:33.410
mutually independent, these
are the four things you check.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:37.598
That's one way to do it, which
is the case of the blood typing

00:33:37.598 --> 00:33:38.306
in the situation.

00:33:40.816 --> 00:33:41.530
All right.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.630
Let's do an example.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:53.510
Well, for example, if
I flip three unbiased,

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.290
mutually independent coins.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.170
The probability of two of
them being heads is 1/4.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.760
The probability of three being
heads is 1/8 and so forth.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.750
Let's do a trickier example.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:12.000
This is a question that was on
the final exam a few years ago

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.340
and a lot of the
class missed it.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.630
So now we'll do it here.

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:36.719
Say I flip three fair, mutually
independent coins and my events

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:45.380
are going to be A1 is the
event coin 1 matches coin 2.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:54.730
The second event,
A2, is the event

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:59.420
that coin 2 matches coin 3.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.750
And the third event,
A3, is the event

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:06.865
that coin 3 matches coin 1.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:15.180
And the question was,
are these three events

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.040
mutually independent?

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.040
Prove your answer.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.345
Let's try to figure that out.

00:35:31.852 --> 00:35:33.810
The coins, of course,
are mutually independent,

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:36.150
but what about these events?

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.640
So let's start doing it.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.370
What's the probability one
of the events occurring?

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:49.829
Well, you got to get the
two coins at hand to match,

00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:51.370
so that's the
probability of a heads,

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:56.710
heads plus the probability
of a tails, tails.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:00.580
That's 1/4 plus 1/4 equals 1/2.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:13.280
Now, the probability of Ai
and Aj, i and j are 1 to 3,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.740
they're different,
but what is a way

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.120
of characterizing that case?

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.520
Say event 1 occurred
and event 2 occurred,

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.770
how would I characterize that?

00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:28.610
Yeah.

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:29.782
AUDIENCE: All the same.

00:36:29.782 --> 00:36:30.913
TOM LEIGHTON: All of them.

00:36:30.913 --> 00:36:31.412
Yeah.

00:36:31.412 --> 00:36:34.410
All of the coins are the same
because if A1 and A2 occur,

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.290
I know 1 matches
2 a 2 matches 3.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.910
If A1 and A3 happen, 1
matches 2 and 1 matches 3,

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.830
so they're all the same
and the same for A2 and A3.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.630
If 2 matches 3 and 3 matches
1, they're all the same.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:50.430
So this is the same as saying
all three coins are the same.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.160
It could all be heads
or all be tails.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.290
And that's an 8
plus 8, which is 1/4

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:07.900
and that means equals
the probability of Ai

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.780
times the probability
of Aj, which is

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.850
what I need for independence.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:19.070
And then they said they're done.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.520
They are independent,
the three events.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.640
You like that answer?

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.260
What's missing?

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.410
The last case.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.889
They didn't check
the last case and we

00:37:31.889 --> 00:37:33.680
got to do that to have
mutual independence.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.681
So let's look at that.

00:37:35.681 --> 00:37:42.060
The last case is probability
A1 intersect A2 intersect A3.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.180
What is the probability
that all three events occur?

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:55.560
Well, the coins all
have to match, right?

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.816
If all the coins match, all
three events occur, right?

00:37:59.816 --> 00:38:01.690
And what's the probability
all 3 coins match?

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.770
1/4, just the same
as this, is 1/4.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.090
Does that equal probability
of A1 times the probability

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.520
of A2 times the
probability of A3?

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.120
What's that?

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.680
1/8.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.620
This is 1/8.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.590
They are not equal.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:32.779
They are not mutually
independent events.

00:38:32.779 --> 00:38:33.725
All right?

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.702
Any questions about that?

00:38:39.702 --> 00:38:42.810
It might well be something like
this on the final this year,

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.960
a good, decent chance.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.610
So if you start going along,
looks like they're independent,

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:49.735
but you forget to check
that last case, which shows

00:38:49.735 --> 00:38:52.580
they're not mutual independent.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.140
So you've got to check for all
pairs and all subsets of events

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.140
for mutual independence.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.960
Any questions about that?

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.960
Now, this is actually
an interesting example

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.690
because in this case, all
pairs were independent

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:18.800
and when that happens, we give
that a special name and it's

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.415
called pairwise independence,
not too surprising.

00:39:22.415 --> 00:39:26.180
And that can be
useful because there's

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.340
many times where you do
get pairwise independence,

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.502
but not mutual independence.

00:39:30.502 --> 00:39:31.960
So let me give you
that definition.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:44.460
So a collection of
events A1 through An

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:55.610
are said to be
pairwise independent

00:39:55.610 --> 00:40:04.980
if for all i and j,
where i doesn't equal j,

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.330
Ai and Aj are independent.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.620
Now, as we saw in this
example, in this example,

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.660
it was pairwise independence
because the probability

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.490
of Ai and Aj equaled the
probability of Ai times

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.460
the probably of Aj.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.130
For any pair, it was true.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:32.130
But it doesn't imply
mutual independence.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.160
So pairwise does
not imply mutual.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.240
Mutual would imply
pairwise because it's

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.515
true for every subset of events.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:47.050
All right.

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:53.670
So let's go back for OJ and
see what would have happened.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.990
What can you say about
the probability of a blood

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.420
match for a random
person if you only

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.230
knew that these factors
were pairwise independent?

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:06.182
Say you only knew that.

00:41:06.182 --> 00:41:08.140
You didn't know they were
mutually independent,

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.723
but you knew they were pairwise
independent in the population.

00:41:14.959 --> 00:41:17.000
What's the best you can
say about the probability

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.130
a random person matches that
blood profile, an upper bound

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.315
on the probability?

00:41:23.315 --> 00:41:23.815
Yeah.

00:41:23.815 --> 00:41:24.776
AUDIENCE: 1 in 50.

00:41:24.776 --> 00:41:26.100
TOM LEIGHTON: 1 in 50.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.050
Yeah.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:30.810
So what you can say is 1
in 50, but nothing better.

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:32.785
So let's see why 1 in 50 works.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:43.370
So let's let M1 be the
event you match here,

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.490
M2 be the event you
match their, and M3

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.300
be the event you match that.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:55.000
The probability you
match all three is

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.600
upper bounded by
the probability you

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:03.360
match the first two
because matching all three

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.230
is a subset of this.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:11.390
Pairwise independence
means that this is true.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:13.690
This equals the
probability of matching

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.719
the first times the probability
of matching the second.

00:42:16.719 --> 00:42:18.260
The probability of
matching the first

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.690
is 1/10, probably of
matching the second is 1/5,

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:23.465
so this is 1/50.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.880
And you picked the best two.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.810
You could have picked these two
and said it was at most 1/20

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.070
or those two and said
it's at most 1/40.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.760
But you were clever and said,
OK, I'm going to take these two

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.590
and use that as my upper
bound, which is 1/50.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:51.450
And it might well be that 1
in 50 people match all three.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.010
That can well be.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:57.910
Because maybe whenever you're O
positive, you have marker XYZ.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.725
That's possible, potentially,
unless we find out otherwise.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:10.149
What if I tell you can't
assume any independence at all?

00:43:10.149 --> 00:43:12.440
What can you say about the
probability of a blood match

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.400
here for a random person?

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:14.900
Yeah.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:15.525
AUDIENCE: 1/10.

00:43:15.525 --> 00:43:16.566
TOM LEIGHTON: What is it?

00:43:16.566 --> 00:43:17.270
AUDIENCE: 1/10.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.500
TOM LEIGHTON: 1/10.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.230
Because if they
match all three, they

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:26.470
match this and that probability
is 1/10, so it's at most 1/10.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:27.970
And it could be
that everybody who's

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:31.810
O is O positive and has XYZ.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.704
So unless you have
more information,

00:43:34.704 --> 00:43:35.870
that's the best you can say.

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:38.822
It might well be
that's the answer.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:46.120
Any questions about that?

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.600
So the assumptions
really matter.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.200
The more independence
you assume,

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.370
the better bounds and the
probability you get of a match.

00:43:57.106 --> 00:43:58.660
It's a little bit
unrelated to this,

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.990
but there was another
mathematics dispute

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.380
at the OJ trial.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.750
It turned out the that
OJ had been beating up

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.479
Nicole on a fairly regular basis
and there were police records

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.020
because after he'd
beat her up, she'd

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.250
go in and complain
to the police.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:18.410
And the prosecution wanted this
evidence admitted at the trial

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:22.410
because if the guy
is a wife beater,

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:25.030
it makes you think that
maybe he killed her.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:28.810
And the defense lawyers argued
against admitting that evidence

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:33.070
because it wasn't tied to the
actual murder scene in any way

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.900
and they argued it would
be prejudicial to the jury

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.380
because, of course, if the jury
hears that OJ was beating her,

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.650
they might be more likely
to include to convict him

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.690
for murdering her.

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:46.620
Now, they got the
math council again

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:50.420
to argue that the reason
you shouldn't admit this

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.160
is because the
probability that you

00:44:54.160 --> 00:45:02.350
kill your wife, that's K, given
that you batter your wife,

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:07.622
that's B, is 1 in 2,000.

00:45:07.622 --> 00:45:09.080
I would have guessed
it was higher,

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.680
but the evidence did show that.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.250
And so they said, look, there's
only a 1 in 2,000 chance

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:19.640
that this evidence of
wife beating is relevant

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.190
and therefore, it should not
be admitted because there's

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.170
a pretty decent chance
if the jury hears this,

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.340
they're going to convict him.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.702
That's a pretty good argument.

00:45:28.702 --> 00:45:30.660
And usually that kind of
thing, you exclude it.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.090
Yeah.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.455
AUDIENCE: Where did
that number come from?

00:45:32.455 --> 00:45:34.880
TOM LEIGHTON: They got
some study and some experts

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.932
to come in and say that for
every 2,000 wife beaters,

00:45:38.932 --> 00:45:40.640
only one of them
actually kills his wife.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.179
Now, what do you suppose
the prosecution argued back?

00:45:48.179 --> 00:45:49.970
They actually argued
back very effectively,

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:53.031
because that's a tough
argument to get by.

00:45:53.031 --> 00:45:53.530
Yeah.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:56.105
AUDIENCE: What's the probability
that you kill your wife

00:45:56.105 --> 00:46:00.545
in the first place, that could
be 100 times larger than usual.

00:46:00.545 --> 00:46:02.900
TOM LEIGHTON: Well,
that's a good point.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.210
So maybe the probability
of killing your wife

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:11.370
not knowing B, I hope is
pretty small, probably

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:15.534
that's very small,
but I don't know.

00:46:15.534 --> 00:46:17.450
But in any case, this
thing you're going from,

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:20.650
say it's 1 in 1 million
to 1 in 2,000, 1 in 2,000

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:25.084
is still too small to be used
as evidence that OJ did it.

00:46:25.084 --> 00:46:27.137
AUDIENCE: Frequency he did it.

00:46:27.137 --> 00:46:29.220
TOM LEIGHTON: Frequency,
they didn't get into that

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.840
because I guess he'd done it a
bunch, but that's a good point.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.720
It could be there's
multiple beatings is higher.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.285
Maybe that's 1 in 200 then.

00:46:37.285 --> 00:46:39.160
In fact, that may be
the case because I think

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.326
there's probably they say
because if you do it once,

00:46:41.326 --> 00:46:42.870
you do it multiple times.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.940
So there's not much more
to be gaining there.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.760
There's a critical
piece of information

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.276
we've left out of our
conditional probabilities here.

00:46:50.276 --> 00:46:54.297
In fact, the most glaring
piece of all of evidence.

00:46:54.297 --> 00:46:55.130
What's missing here?

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:56.440
What haven't we factored in?

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:56.940
Yeah.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.840
AUDIENCE: The probability of B.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.490
TOM LEIGHTON: The probability
of B, that's the battering.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.550
Battering, I don't know what
it is, probably a large number.

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:09.450
Defense would argue
it's large, I guess,

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:13.664
but it shouldn't
matter that much.

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:17.010
AUDIENCE: The probability
that he actually beat her,

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:18.755
given that she threatened him?

00:47:18.755 --> 00:47:20.130
TOM LEIGHTON:
Well, there's that,

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.949
but they have police--
well, that's true.

00:47:21.949 --> 00:47:23.740
They didn't see him
doing it, but let's say

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.820
that they had good
evidence that he did it

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:30.750
and defense wasn't arguing
that he didn't really beat her.

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:35.770
The key thing we're missing
here is Nicole wound up dead.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.780
She was dead.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.790
And there's another stat here
that the prosecution argued.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.730
So they argued this fact.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.570
The probability the
husband kills his wife,

00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:00.980
given that he batters her
and she wound up dead,

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:05.100
that somebody murder
her is bigger than 1/2.

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:08.950
So here M is somebody
murdered the wife.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.030
Here, the husband beats her.

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:13.110
Now, the conditional
probability that he

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:16.540
killed her is bigger than
1/2 and that's a whopper.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.504
Now, it's very relevant.

00:48:18.504 --> 00:48:19.920
The probability
he killed her just

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.290
given that he beat her
is only 1 in 2,000,

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.230
but if you add the fact, which
is very relevant in this case,

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:30.085
that the wife was murdered,
this is now very compelling.

00:48:30.085 --> 00:48:31.960
Now, in fact, they should
have really compare

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:39.840
this to probability he kills
her given that she's dead.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.430
And so that would determine now
the relevance of the battering,

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.218
the wife beating.

00:48:45.218 --> 00:48:47.342
That's what they should
have done, but they didn't.

00:48:47.342 --> 00:48:49.845
They got this far and they
had that and the judge said,

00:48:49.845 --> 00:48:51.610
I'm letting it in.

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.450
So it came in at that point.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.600
But this would be the
right comparison, I think.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.058
Because you look
at the probability

00:48:57.058 --> 00:49:00.287
that you killed her
given that she's dead,

00:49:00.287 --> 00:49:02.120
but now the additional
information, the wife

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.227
battering, how does that
change the probability?

00:49:04.227 --> 00:49:05.810
And it probably
changes it materially.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.450
So it's all a little
gory, but it's

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.624
interesting to see how
mathematics played out

00:49:13.624 --> 00:49:14.790
in this kind of environment.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:15.289
Yeah.

00:49:15.289 --> 00:49:17.455
AUDIENCE: Are we supposed
to assume that he did

00:49:17.455 --> 00:49:18.814
kill his wife?

00:49:18.814 --> 00:49:20.700
TOM LEIGHTON: Yes,
and they assumed that,

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.170
but when you decide whether
or not to admit evidence,

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:27.850
if it's prejudicial, you've got
to have a really good grounds

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:28.410
to get it in.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.710
Like if the evidence is going to
make the jury think he did it,

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:35.480
then you really got to argue the
evidence is relevant somehow.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.649
There's material
information and that's

00:49:37.649 --> 00:49:38.690
what the fight was about.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.740
A 1 in 2,000 relevance
isn't going to cut it.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.569
1 in 2, that's probably
pretty relevant.

00:49:45.569 --> 00:49:47.110
And that will be
the grounds on which

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.349
the judge makes his decision.

00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:50.890
But yeah, you assume
he didn't do it.

00:49:56.256 --> 00:49:56.860
All right.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.830
Back to independence.

00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:03.410
So the last example today is
derived from a famous paradox

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.470
and has several actually
important applications

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:06.880
in computer science.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.340
And this problem is known
as the birthday problem

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.340
or the birthday paradox.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.040
It's a paradox because it sort
of has a surprising answer.

00:50:20.091 --> 00:50:21.590
Probably a lot of
you have seen this

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.318
before in some form or another.

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:45.180
In the birthday problem,
there are N birthdays

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.680
and typically
we're going to look

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:53.290
at the case where N is
365, the days of the year,

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:54.350
and there is M people.

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:02.570
And for example, know maybe
there's 100 people here.

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:15.480
And what we want to know
is, what is the probability

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:21.770
that two or more people
have the same birthday.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.260
For example, how
many people think

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.450
there's at least a 50%
chance that a pair of you

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:41.460
in the audience here
have the same birthday?

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.870
That's good.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:48.030
How many people think there's
a better than 90% chance?

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.382
A few of you.

00:51:49.382 --> 00:51:49.930
All right.

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:53.410
How many people think there's
a better than a 99% chance

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.700
that there's a pair
of matching birthdays?

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.950
A couple left.

00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:01.060
How many think it's better
than a 99.9% chance?

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:01.974
We've got one, two.

00:52:01.974 --> 00:52:03.390
You guys are going
to be stubborn.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.990
Another one.

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.500
All right.

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:11.770
How many people think it's
more than 99.999% chance?

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:13.340
Actually it's six 9's.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.440
It's incredible.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.120
It is a virtual certainty.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.200
So let's see.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.170
In fact, the chance that
you're all different is about 1

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:27.290
in 3 million chance that
you're all different.

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:30.810
And we're going to see
why that's true here.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.410
But to do that, we're
going to need to make

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:36.720
two important assumptions.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.850
Any ideas about what assumptions
you're going to need?

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:40.350
Yeah.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:42.170
AUDIENCE: Birthdays are
uniformly distributed.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:43.585
TOM LEIGHTON: Birthdays
are uniformly distributed.

00:52:43.585 --> 00:52:44.718
Any other ideas?

00:52:44.718 --> 00:52:45.218
Yes.

00:52:45.218 --> 00:52:46.496
AUDIENCE: He stole my answer.

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:47.870
TOM LEIGHTON: Oh,
he stole yours.

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:50.724
What else are you going
to need to assume?

00:52:50.724 --> 00:52:51.700
Yeah.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.319
AUDIENCE: All birthdays are
independent of each other.

00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:55.110
TOM LEIGHTON: Yeah.

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:56.410
Mutually independent.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:58.380
We're going to
need that as well.

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:03.020
Now, in actuality, neither
is true in reality.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.870
It's well known
that birthdays tend

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.700
to follow seasonal
patterns and they're

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.070
related to major events.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:13.590
Now, do you all remember the big
blackout that hit the Northeast

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:14.830
several years ago?

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:16.710
Do you remember that?

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.660
Well, it turns out,
this is a true fact,

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.850
there were a lot of babies
born nine months later.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:23.020
In fact, they had a name.

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.730
They're called blackout babies.

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:27.950
If you were born in that period
in the Northeast and there's

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:31.770
all these news stories about
the life of the blackout babies.

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:34.370
And the same thing happens
after cold snaps in the winter

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:36.860
and you get a blizzard
or this kind of a thing.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.150
Nine months later,
you get babies.

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:44.040
In fact, I had a personal
experience with this.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:51.090
Well, my son was born
on October 18, 1996.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:54.100
And on the day he was born,
we're going to the hospital

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.720
and it was a zoo.

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.190
The maternity ward
was totally full.

00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:01.050
We had to go at some other
wing of the hospital.

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:05.300
And babies were popping
out all over the place.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.040
And I asked, what is going on?

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.520
Why don't you have enough
room for all the mothers here?

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.520
And they said, oh, it's
all the blizzard babies.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.790
And I go, what?

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:16.100
And they go, well, remember
the blizzard of '96?

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.562
It's like, oh yeah.

00:54:18.562 --> 00:54:19.528
I remember.

00:54:19.528 --> 00:54:20.980
Yeah.

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.930
It was nine months prior
is the big blizzard

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:28.000
and so it's all the
blizzard babies coming.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.122
So they're not uniform.

00:54:30.122 --> 00:54:31.830
They're all different
probabilities here,

00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:33.965
but we're going to assume
they're equally likely.

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:41.920
Now, independence is also
not true, in general.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:47.210
What's one way that birthdays
might not be independent?

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.935
What is it?

00:54:47.935 --> 00:54:48.601
AUDIENCE: Twins.

00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:49.540
TOM LEIGHTON: Twins.

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:52.500
So if they're twins, they
have the same birthday.

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.500
Now, there's other ways.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.990
In fact, my only
sibling, my brother,

00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:00.880
has the same birthday I do,
but I'm two years older,

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.680
so we weren't twins.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.780
Now, you say, what
are the odds of that?

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:10.200
Well, 1 in 365, you think.

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.800
Well, one day I'm
in middle school,

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.040
about the age you start
thinking about these things,

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.060
and you get the idea to
count back nine months

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.160
from your birthday.

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.940
Probably some of
you have done that.

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:24.490
And I did that and
that's my dad's birthday.

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:25.914
I was like, oh.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.100
May is not 1 in 365.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.810
It's like, Happy Birthday.

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:36.860
I don't know.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.160
Anyway, I almost needed to
go into therapy after that,

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.800
you know.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.810
So now you all got to count back
nine months from your birthday.

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:49.100
Anybody whose birthday is on
September 30 or October 1,

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.360
nine months back
is New Year's Eve.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.100
That's dangerous.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:57.100
So in reality, birthdays
are not independent

00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.610
and they are not
randomly distributed,

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.280
but we're going to
assume that because we're

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.510
going to use this same analysis
for computer science problems

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:09.831
where things are, hopefully,
more independent and random.

00:56:09.831 --> 00:56:11.330
Now, we're going
to do an experiment

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:14.502
to see how many people
it takes us to get

00:56:14.502 --> 00:56:15.710
a pair of matching birthdays.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:18.220
So I'm going to run through
people in order in the rows

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.440
here, get your birthday
and we're going to record

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.680
and we're going to see how
far we go until there's

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.880
a match in that group.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.370
So I will write up
the months here.

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:55.950
And we'll start with my
birthday is October 28.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:57.180
So let's go right across.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:57.830
What yours?

00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:59.120
AUDIENCE: April 1.

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.230
TOM LEIGHTON: April 1.

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:07.260
OK.

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.810
We won't embarrass you here.

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:10.930
OK, who's next?

00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:12.283
What's your birthday?

00:57:12.283 --> 00:57:13.672
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:57:13.672 --> 00:57:14.600
September 2.

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.910
TOM LEIGHTON: September 2.

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.020
All right.

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:18.907
Yours.

00:57:18.907 --> 00:57:19.615
AUDIENCE: June 1.

00:57:19.615 --> 00:57:22.380
TOM LEIGHTON: June 1.

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:22.880
OK.

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.560
We'll come back.

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.310
AUDIENCE: April 8.

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:24.940
TOM LEIGHTON: What is it?

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.880
AUDIENCE: April 8.

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.481
TOM LEIGHTON: April 8.

00:57:27.481 --> 00:57:28.954
All right.

00:57:28.954 --> 00:57:30.427
AUDIENCE: November 20.

00:57:30.427 --> 00:57:32.992
TOM LEIGHTON: November 20.

00:57:32.992 --> 00:57:34.796
AUDIENCE: June 12.

00:57:34.796 --> 00:57:37.736
TOM LEIGHTON: June 12.

00:57:37.736 --> 00:57:39.640
AUDIENCE: December 29.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.952
TOM LEIGHTON: December 29.

00:57:41.952 --> 00:57:44.162
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:44.162 --> 00:57:45.260
TOM LEIGHTON: What is it?

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.009
AUDIENCE: June 14.

00:57:46.009 --> 00:57:47.480
TOM LEIGHTON: June 14.

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.820
Ooh, I almost got one there.

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.045
That one's close.

00:57:50.045 --> 00:57:51.229
All right.

00:57:51.229 --> 00:57:51.770
What's yours?

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:53.260
AUDIENCE: March 6.

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.000
TOM LEIGHTON: March 6.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.344
AUDIENCE: May 2.

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:18.410
What is the probability

AUDIENCE: The 24th of August.

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.740
TOM LEIGHTON: 24th August.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.864
I'm going to have to ask
the same person to tell me

01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:37.110
twice here to get a match.

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:38.150
We got over there now?

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:39.460
AUDIENCE: April 6.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.141
TOM LEIGHTON: April 6.

01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:44.396
AUDIENCE: October 16.

01:00:44.396 --> 01:00:45.588
TOM LEIGHTON: October 16.

01:00:45.588 --> 01:00:47.500
AUDIENCE: Did ask how many--

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.452
AUDIENCE: September 3.

01:00:48.452 --> 01:00:50.460
TOM LEIGHTON: September 3.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.545
All right.

01:00:52.545 --> 01:00:55.275
Very good.

01:00:55.275 --> 01:00:56.190
All right.

01:00:56.190 --> 01:01:00.230
Let's count and see
how many we got here.

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:02.912
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

01:01:02.912 --> 01:01:08.960
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:19.060
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:22.630
37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:24.360
That is a record.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:29.230
So it took 42 people
to get a match.

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:32.750
Now it turns out that
for N equals 365,

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:36.840
the magic number for N
is 23, that by 23 people,

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.180
we got a 50-50 chance.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:44.260
In fact, the probability of a
match on 23 people is 0.506.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.537
It's a little bit better
than 50-50 chance at 23.

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.870
Now, maybe we should figure out.

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:50.536
It's too late for
homework to figure out

01:01:50.536 --> 01:01:53.340
what the chances are of going
this long without a match.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.910
That maybe worth
figuring that out.

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:58.830
Now, it may seem
surprising at first

01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:01.530
that 23 people is
enough to have a 50/50

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:06.000
chance because the chance of
any pair matching is 1 in 365,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.770
by our assumption.

01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:12.330
And that's small, but there's
lots of pairs of people

01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:15.950
and every pair of people
have a chance to match

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:20.420
and that's why 23 turns out
to be enough to get to 50-50.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.790
Now, we're going to do the
analysis for general M and N

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:26.490
to the figure out the
probability of a match

01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:31.230
if there's M people
and N birthdays.

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:32.990
There's lots of ways to do it.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:41.220
The easiest is to sort of well,
we'll draw the sample space.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.110
It will be too big to
draw the whole thing,

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.080
but we can sort of
model the sample space

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.538
and then look at
the sample points.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:08.710
So you've got the first person
and there's N birthdays here,

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:14.630
so it could be anywhere from
January 1 out to December 31

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:18.480
and in general this
will be N. And then you

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:29.280
have the second person and
they have N possibilities

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.510
for their birthday.

01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:38.400
And you take the tree down M
levels to the very last person

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:38.900
here.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:50.530
So each node has degree N and
there's M levels on this tree.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:04:03.560
So the sample space is the set
of all n-tuples b1, b2, to bm,

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:10.880
these are the birthdays
where every value of bi

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:17.270
is between 1 and N. So a sample
point is all the birthdays

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:18.925
of the M people.

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.095
How many sample
points are there here?

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:32.610
Remember how to
count these things?

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:35.739
Number of leaves on an
N-ary tree of depth M or you

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:36.780
can think of it this way.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:41.950
I've got N choices for each
bi and there's M of them.

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:42.884
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:42.884 --> 01:04:45.050
TOM LEIGHTON: So what's the
number of sample points?

01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:47.020
AUDIENCE: N to the M.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:54.720
TOM LEIGHTON: N to the M.
Because N choices here,

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.820
N choices here, N
choices there, so you

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:02.220
have N times N times N M times.

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:07.160
And what's the probability
of each outcome?

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.645
For a set of possible birthdays,
what's its probability?

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:19.160
What's the probability
of b1, b2, bM?

01:05:27.409 --> 01:05:28.950
So the probability
of a sample point.

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:31.491
What's the probability that the
first person has birthday b1,

01:05:31.491 --> 01:05:36.810
the second has b2,
and the N-th has bM?

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:37.546
Remember that?

01:05:37.546 --> 01:05:38.046
Yeah.

01:05:38.046 --> 01:05:39.330
AUDIENCE: 1 over N to the M.

01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:42.410
TOM LEIGHTON: 1 over N to
the M because each edge

01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:46.309
is probability of 1
over N and the paths

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.600
are length M, so you've got
1 over N to the M-th power.

01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:55.500
Probability of the first
birthday matching is 1 in N

01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:01.420
times 1 in N times 1 in N.
And this actually makes sense

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.890
because I've got N to
the M sample points,

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:08.000
each a probability
1 over N to the M.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.920
So they all add up
to 1, which is good.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.550
What kind of sample
space is this

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:15.530
where this happens where all
the probabilities are the same?

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:16.302
AUDIENCE: Uniform.

01:06:16.302 --> 01:06:17.580
TOM LEIGHTON: Uniform.

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.080
Makes it very easy to work with.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.240
All we got to do
now is just count

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.940
the number of
sample points where

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:27.130
there's a matching birthday and
then we multiply by that one

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:30.830
probability 1 over N to the M.

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:33.780
Now, it turns out that
rather than counting

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.500
the number of sample
points where there's

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.920
a matching birthday,
it's easier to count

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.430
the number of sample points
for all the birthdays are

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:43.095
different.

01:06:43.095 --> 01:06:45.450
And this is often the case
when you're doing a counting

01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:49.740
problem, it's easier
to count the opposite

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:52.100
of what you're after.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.420
That can be the case
and it is the case here.

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.260
So we're going to do that.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:06.600
So let's count how many
sample points are all

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:12.130
different birthdays, so no
pair of bi's is the same.

01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:13.180
Let's do that.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.724
How many choices
are there for b1?

01:07:15.724 --> 01:07:20.480
365 or N. Let's do
this in terms of N

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.400
because we're going to
use this for general N.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.470
How many choices for b2?

01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:26.360
N minus 1.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.950
Given you are the first
one, you can't match it.

01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:33.570
And then N minus 2 all the
way over to the last one

01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:37.360
is N minus M plus 1.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.050
And this is a formula
you should all remember.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:46.430
That's just N factorial
over N minus M factorial.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:49.300
You did this sort of stuff a
couple weeks ago with counting

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:54.250
sets and probability is really--
a lot of it's about counting.

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.280
So now we can compute
the probability

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.990
that all the birthdays
are different.

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:08.660
It's just adding up all the
sample points of which there's

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:14.080
n factorial over N minus
M factorial and multiply

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.630
by the probability
of each one, which is

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:22.430
1 over N to the M. All right.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.630
So we've actually now
answered the question.

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:28.670
This is the probability that
all the birthdays are different.

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:32.560
The only problem is,
it's not so clear

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.720
what the answer is to
actually compute this

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.250
or how fast it grows.

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:40.410
So if I wanted to get
a closed form for this

01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:42.979
without the factorials,
what do I do?

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:45.200
What do I use?

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.310
Stirling's formula.

01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:49.460
So let's remember that.

01:08:57.630 --> 01:09:01.870
It says that N factorial
is asymptotically equal

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:09.830
to square root 2 pi N
times N over e to the N.

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:15.529
And that is accurate within
0.1% when N is at least 100.

01:09:15.529 --> 01:09:18.240
So not only is it
asymptotically equal,

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:25.020
it's right on track for
a reasonable size N.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:27.899
Now, I won't drag you
through all the calculations.

01:09:27.899 --> 01:09:30.850
I used to actually try
plugging that formula

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:33.024
in for here and
here and then going

01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:35.440
through all the calculations,
but we won't do it in class.

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.300
It's in the text.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.102
But I will tell you
where that winds up.

01:09:40.102 --> 01:09:42.310
It's not hard, you've just
got to do the calculation.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.430
So this is means the probability
that all birthdays are

01:09:51.430 --> 01:10:04.830
different turns out to be
asymptotically equal to e

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:15.530
to the N minus M plus 1/2 times
the natural log of N over N

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:23.670
minus M minus M. And that's
accurate to within 0.2%,

01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:25.950
if N and N minus M are
large, larger than 100.

01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:29.830
So in fact, it's almost equal.

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:36.650
And now you could plug in N
equals 365 and M equals 100.

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:41.950
So if you do that, in fact,
if somebody has a calculator,

01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:45.950
we should plug in,
what do we have, 42.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:48.020
You should plug in
M equals 42 and see

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.300
what the probability is.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:56.330
But if M is 100, the chance
that we're all different,

01:10:56.330 --> 01:11:05.150
this equals 3.07 dot, dot,
dot times 10 to the minus 7.

01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:07.720
And we should check
for M equals 42.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.080
My guess is it's pretty
small, but I don't know.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.351
We'll have to check that.

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:14.648
AUDIENCE: 0.0859.

01:11:14.648 --> 01:11:15.540
TOM LEIGHTON: Great.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:22.190
So a 9% chance of having 42
people all miss is a 9% chance.

01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:23.480
So we were little unlucky.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.770
That won't happen very often.

01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:29.720
But when you go from 42 to
100, it gets really small.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.020
1 in 3 million or so.

01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:39.840
Now, if N is 365 and M
is 23, the probability

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:44.190
comes out to be about
0.49, so about 50-50,

01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:46.094
they're all different.

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.040
Now.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.210
For general M and
N, we'd like to know

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.640
when do you get to
the 50-50 point?

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.550
We'd like to derive an
equation for M in terms of N

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:04.350
where the probability of being
all different is about 1/2.

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:04.850
All right.

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:05.558
So let's do that.

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:21.490
So as long as we assume--
and this will turn out

01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:24.830
to be true-- that M is a
little o of N to the 2/3

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:30.190
and remember little o means it
grows slower than N to the 2/3.

01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:32.230
Then we can simplify
that expression

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:35.240
in asymptotic notation.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:40.405
And when you do it, I won't
drag it through on the board.

01:12:40.405 --> 01:12:45.030
It's also in the text, it
turns out to be much simpler.

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:49.900
It's just e to the
minus M squared over 2N.

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:51.820
So I take that
thing up there and I

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:57.400
assume that M is growing less
fast than the 2/3 power of N

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.500
and that whole upper
expression reduces down

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.110
to M squared over 2N.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:04.310
Everything else goes
to 0 in the exponent.

01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:06.260
Doesn't matter.

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:11.970
Now, if I set this
to be 1/2, I can

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:17.610
solve this to find out what M
has to be to make that be 1/2.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:18.110
All right.

01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:24.710
So this will be true if and
only if minus M squared over 2N

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:26.270
is equal to the
natural log of 1/2.

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:31.040
And that's true.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.820
Take the minus sign, put it
inside to make a log of 2,

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:36.580
multiply by 2N.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:43.590
That's true if M squared
equals 2N natural log of 2.

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:46.800
And now I can solve
for M really easily.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:53.090
That's true if and
only if M equals

01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:58.360
the square root of 2
natural log of 2N, which

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:08.560
is about 1.177 square root
of N. So for general N,

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:14.020
you get a 50% probability of
having a matching birthday when

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:21.920
M is in this range, pretty
close to 1.2 square root of N.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.024
Now, this square root N
phenomenon, this thing here,

01:14:25.024 --> 01:14:26.940
that's what's known as
the birthday principle.

01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:33.250
It says if you've got roughly
square root of N randomly

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:39.580
allocated items into N
boxes or bins or birthdays,

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.940
there's a decent
chance two of the items

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:47.120
will go into the same bin
if the randomly allocated.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.130
In this case, the bins
are the possible days

01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:53.150
of the year that we put each
person into for their birthday.

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:55.525
Any questions about that?

01:14:58.860 --> 01:14:59.360
Yeah.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.328
AUDIENCE: M and N
are like numbers

01:15:01.328 --> 01:15:03.460
like they're defined up
there or does it mean

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.756
to say M equals [INAUDIBLE]?

01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:06.980
TOM LEIGHTON: Yeah.

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:10.370
So here I looked at a
special case where N was 365,

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:13.360
M was 100, but we
can imagine them

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:17.350
as arbitrary numbers that
could be getting large.

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:22.480
And so over here and I say M
is little o of N to the 2/3,

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.250
I mean, well, M equals square
root of N would qualify.

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:29.950
Square root of N is
little o of N to the 2/3.

01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:33.320
So as long as M is
not growing too fast,

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.950
I can simplify that expression
up there, which is what I did.

01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:40.890
And then we go back
and we find, in fact,

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:42.980
the square root of
N the right answer

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:45.650
and that is little
o of N to the 2/3.

01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:48.400
And I have to use a
different argument

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.750
if I assumed M was
bigger, which I didn't do.

01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:53.140
I didn't drag it for that.

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:56.340
But I would have to
go check that case.

01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.320
So we can think of general
is M and N as being

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.730
arbitrary variables and
potentially growing.

01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:03.710
M can be a function
of N. And in fact,

01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:06.170
when M is the square
root function of N, then

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:07.830
we got a 50% chance of a match.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:15.420
Now, the birthday
principle comes up all

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.700
over the place in
computer science

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.215
and it's worth remembering.

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.286
For example, the
generic form for this

01:16:26.286 --> 01:16:27.660
is when you have
a hash function.

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:34.040
Let's say I have a
hash function, h,

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:39.280
from a large set of items
into a small set of items.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.200
For example, say I'm
computing digital signatures.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.640
This is the space
of all messages,

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:49.030
this is the space of all
1,000-bit digital signatures,

01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:51.750
and h is a digital
signature outcome.

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:53.720
Say I'm doing
memory allocations.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:57.190
So all the things I might
be sticking into a register,

01:16:57.190 --> 01:16:58.640
here's all the
places it could go.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.360
Here's all the registers.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.760
Error checking.

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:04.490
This is all the garbled
messages in the world.

01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:07.360
This is the set of
messages that make sense,

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.770
all handled by functions,
random kind of functions often.

01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:17.830
Now, what you worry about when
you're hashing is collisions.

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:20.240
Let me define that.

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:29.840
We say that x collides
with y if the hash of x

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.710
equals the hash of y, but
x and y are different.

01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:39.930
For example, say you're
looking at digital signatures.

01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:43.905
You would not want the
signature for a $100 check

01:17:43.905 --> 01:17:49.692
to your mom to match your
signature for $100,000 check

01:17:49.692 --> 01:17:50.430
to Boris.

01:17:52.717 --> 01:17:54.550
Because that would be
bad because then Boris

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:58.590
could come in and take that
check to your mom for $100,

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:01.960
converted to a
$100,000 check to him

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.370
and the signature is
authentic if there's

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:06.040
a collision in the signatures.

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.200
So very important when
you're doing hash functions

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.850
and in many applications,
you don't want collisions

01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:14.160
because all the whole
thing start breaking.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.020
Memory allocation.

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.770
You don't want to assign two
things in the same place.

01:18:17.770 --> 01:18:18.880
Error correction.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.100
There's only one answer you
want to get out at the end.

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.810
Now, from the pigeon
hole principle,

01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:27.525
you know if this set is
bigger than that set,

01:18:27.525 --> 01:18:28.900
there is going to
be a collision.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:30.720
That's what the pigeon
hole principle says.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.490
Two guys will get mapped
to the same thing.

01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:38.270
However, often in practice what
we care about is a subset L

01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:43.330
prime of L that's pretty small
because the set of messages we

01:18:43.330 --> 01:18:46.370
really assign is pretty small
compared to all 1,000-bit

01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:48.370
signatures that are possible.

01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:51.580
And what you'd like is that for
this smaller set of messages,

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:56.210
you might want to assign, they
all get mapped one to one.

01:18:56.210 --> 01:19:01.560
And the birthday principle
says life is not so nice.

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:04.391
So let me write that
down then we'll be done.

01:19:10.592 --> 01:19:11.560
All right.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:29.870
So the birthday principle says
that if S is at least 100,

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:36.590
L prime is a subset of L that is
at least the square root of S.

01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:39.740
So the cardinality of the
things you want to hash

01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:45.800
is bigger than 1.2 square
root the cardinality of S.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:57.290
And if the values of the
function h on L prime

01:19:57.290 --> 01:20:14.260
are randomly chosen, uniform,
and mutually independent,

01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:16.630
then there's at least
a 50% chance, so

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:24.310
with probability at least
1/2, there's a collision.

01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:29.340
There exists an x and a y
such that x does not equal y--

01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:37.621
and these are in L prime--
but h of x equals h of y.

01:20:37.621 --> 01:20:38.120
All right.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.910
The proof is not hard, it's
just we more or less did it.

01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:44.880
You just plug in the
cardinality of L prime for M

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:48.680
and the cardinality of S
for N. And it's bad news

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.450
because it means it doesn't
take very many messages,

01:20:52.450 --> 01:20:57.940
just square root the number of
signatures to get a collision.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.422
You'd hope you could get that
you could have L prime be

01:21:01.422 --> 01:21:02.880
as big as S and
that somehow they'd

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.637
all go one to one, that
everybody in this room

01:21:05.637 --> 01:21:06.970
would have a different birthday.

01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:09.380
That is not how it works
if things are random,

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.750
which is the case you
usually like to have.

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:16.000
Now, this technique is used to
crack cryptographic protocols

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.720
and it's called the birthday
attack based on the birthday

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:19.474
principle.

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:20.890
So what you do is,
you get a bunch

01:21:20.890 --> 01:21:25.190
of messages that are
encrypted and pretty soon you

01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:28.350
find two that get maybe
encrypted the same way.

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.700
And once you have that,
now you can go back

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:33.640
and crack the crypto system.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.680
For example, you break schemes
like RSA with a birthday attack

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.630
if this space is not
big enough and that's

01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:46.310
one reason why now RSA, the
keys have thousands of digits

01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:48.720
because otherwise you
can use attacks like this

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.450
and crack them more easily.

01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:55.610
Any questions about that?

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:56.110
OK.

01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.610
Very good.

01:21:56.610 --> 01:21:58.710
We're done for today.
