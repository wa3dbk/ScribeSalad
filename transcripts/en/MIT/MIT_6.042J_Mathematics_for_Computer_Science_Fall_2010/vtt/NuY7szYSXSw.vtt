00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.490
PROFESSOR: So
welcome to this week.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.980
We are going to talk
about number theory.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.560
Actually, before I
forget, there are

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.450
some handouts at the very back.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.670
Please raise you hand if you
don't have any, then one of us

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.802
can actually come
over and hand you

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:41.070
out this sheet, which
contain some facts

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.900
about the visibility.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.824
Thanks a lot.

00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:50.780
And we will be using these
throughout the lecture.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.330
So today we're going to
talk about number theory.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.420
And this is a really different
way of thinking, actually.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.170
But we will use
the same concepts

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.280
as you have learned before,
like induction, and invariance,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.179
stuff like that, to
prove whole theorems.

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:05.220
So what is number theory?

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.050
Well, first of all,
it's a very old science.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.940
One of the oldest
mathematical disciplines.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.340
And only recently
it actually got

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.480
to have some more
practical applications.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.450
So what this number theory--

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.200
it's actually the
study of the integers.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.160
And what are the integers?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.950
Well, these are the numbers
0, 1, 2 3, and so on.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.260
So number theory got--

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.430
Oh, there's some more over here.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.555
Another handout over there.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.870
So number theory got used
actually in cryptography

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.890
only about 40 years ago.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.880
And at the end of
the second lecture,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.150
we will be talking about this
application into cryptography.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.970
There are many application
in cryptography.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.700
But we'll be talking
about one of them

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.500
to show you how useful
this actually is.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.110
Now cryptography is the study
and practice of hiding numbers.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.230
So you can imagine
how important that is.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.090
We have like medical
data that we need

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.360
to store outside in the cloud.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.860
Right?

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.500
So, gee.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.490
Do we really want that?

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.200
We actually want to
hide our information.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.680
We do not want
others who are not

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.030
allowed to see my private
information to see it.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.850
So this art of
hiding information

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.080
is extremely important,
especially nowadays.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.020
And number theory actually
will help us with this.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.530
So number theory is something,
you'll be very surprised,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.680
that can be used to save--

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.520
oops.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.110
I have to put this on.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.550
To save New York City in the
Die Hard number 3, I believe.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.960
So let me start up again.

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:17.505
So let's see where it plays.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.265
Maybe not.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.539

How do we turn this thing off?

00:04:28.908 --> 00:04:30.830
-On the front there
should be two jugs.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.270
Do you see them?

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.850
A give gallon, and
a three gallon.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.510
Fill on of the jugs with
exactly four gallons of water

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.880
and place it on the scale,
and the timer will stop.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.970

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.429
-No.

00:04:59.067 --> 00:04:59.650
-Get the jugs.

00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:04.490
Obviously, we can't fill
the three gallon jug will

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.096
four gallons of water, right?

00:05:06.096 --> 00:05:06.690
-Obviously.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.190
-I know.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.610
There we go.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.210
We fill the three gallon jug
exactly to the top, right?

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.710
-Uh-huh.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.210
-OK.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.760
Now we pour that three gallons
into the five gallon jugs,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.180
giving us exactly 3 gallons
in the five gallon jug, right?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.680
-Right.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.640
Then what?

-Now, we take the
three gallon jug,

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:22.090

-No, no.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.380
So who has an idea
of what we can do?

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.880
So.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:07.196 --> 00:06:08.680
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.690
Let's first do that.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.180
Fill up the three gallons.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.680
AUDIENCE: And pout
it into the five.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.170
PROFESSOR: Let's
pour it into five.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.880
Maybe someone else can--

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.010
can continue.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.700
Over there.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.450
AUDIENCE: If we
do the same again,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.000
we'll end up with just one
gallon in the three gallon.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.750
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.405
So, let's do that.

00:06:28.405 --> 00:06:29.530
Because that's true, right.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.010
You can only fill it
up to five gallons.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.030
So only, at more,
two gallons can add

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.190
to this, exactly two gallons.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.780
And one gallon is left.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.877
All right, next one.

00:06:38.877 --> 00:06:39.377

00:06:39.377 --> 00:06:40.168
Would you like to--

00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:41.335
AUDIENCE: Take out the five.

00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:42.542
PROFESSOR: Take out the five.

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:43.120
All right.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.424
And then what?

00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:49.840
AUDIENCE: Pour the
one over there.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.256
PROFESSOR: Pour
the one over here?

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:58.310
AUDIENCE: Then fill
the three gallon,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.042
and put it into the five.

00:07:00.042 --> 00:07:01.399
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:01.940
That's great.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.380
And I fill it up right here.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.720
Fantastic.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.690
So we actually have
four gallons here.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.870
And luckily, they are safe.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:09.370
Right?

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.730
So you say, thank god.

00:07:13.354 --> 00:07:14.145
So we can continue.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.230
So this is actually
pretty amazing, though.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.770
How can we get four gallon
out of three gallon jug,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.750
and a five gallon jug?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.370
And that's what we are
going to talk about in more

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.190
generality, actually.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.250
And if you would just change
it a little bit, right?

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.060
Then things would get more
difficult. For example,

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.850
if you would change the five
gallon jug into a six gallon

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.320
jug, can we still
get four gallons?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:44.820
No.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.319
Why not?

00:07:47.695 --> 00:07:49.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.826
PROFESSOR: Everything has
to be multiples of three.

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:54.410
That's exactly right.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.510
This is a multiple of 3.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.190
1 times 3.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.280
This is 2 times 3.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.770
So if I do combinations
with those,

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.440
like pouring one into the
other completely, or emptying,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.350
of filling up, we
always will have

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:10.160
a multiple of three gallons in
either one of those, or both.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.630
So we can never
have four gallons.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.540
So this is something
that we would like

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.960
to analyze a little bit more.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.420
And to do that, we're
going to first a all

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.080
start with a definition.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.080
Actually you can put up
the screen over here.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.930
So let me take that out.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.610
Can someone up there
pull up the screen?

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.520
Maybe not?

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.190
Maybe later.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.840
All right.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.524
So let's go with a definition.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:59.340
We say n denote by m and a bar,
and a, we mean m defines a.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.920
And how do you define this?

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.910
Well, we say that n
divides a, if and only

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:11.260
if there exists an
integer k, such that a can

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:18.100
be written as some multiple
m, mainly k times m.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.980
So if you look at
this definition

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.100
we, for example, have
that 3 divides 6,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.645
like what we just discussed.

00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:29.270
There's something
interesting going on.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.160
Suppose a is equal to 0.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.030
Well, any integer will
define a, will define 0.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.030
Why is that?

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.090
Because I can't take
k to be equal to 0,

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.190
so this is equal to 0
times any integer m.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.910
So m defines 0 for all integers.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.440
So this is kind of
the exception, right?

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.840
And we are going to use
this to set up a theorem,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.090
and analyze this whole
situation over here.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:08.310
Now in order to do that, we
will need to sort of define

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.790
what we can do with all this.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.710
So there are states.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.940
We will define a state machine.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.060
We will see what kind
of possible transitions

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.230
we can have.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.120
And once we have modeled
all this very precisely,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.520
we can start proofing stuff.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.970
Now let me first of all write
out what our assumptions are.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:36.980
So suppose we have
an a gallon jug.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.500
So in our case, a equals 3.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.480
And we have also b gallon jug.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.740
And in our case,
b equals 5, right?

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.180
And we issue that
a is at most b.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.169
That is sort of the situation
that we are working with.

00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:02.710
And he would like
to prove a theorem.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.330
Exactly what we notice over
here, that three defines both.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.580
The three gallon jug,
and the six gallon jug,

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.740
we would like to prove
something like this.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:20.270
If m defines a, and
also m defines be,

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:26.720
well, then m should
define any results

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.670
that I can get with the pouring,
and emptying and filling

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.042
those jugs.

00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:36.000
So this is the theorem,
if you'd like to prove.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.080
And we can only do that
if you start to have

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.380
a proper model for this.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.020
So let's go for that.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.060
And--

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.570
And, well, the state machine
that we're going to use here

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.380
looks like this.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.060
First of all, the
states that we have

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.750
are the number of gallons
that are in these two jugs.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.575
So we will denote
those by pairs.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.700
Pairs x, comma y.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:24.020
And x denotes the number of
gallons in the a gallon jug.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:33.560
The number of gallons m m that
we abbreviate as by the a jug,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:41.970
and y is the number of
gallons in the b jug.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.960
So these are the states.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.760
And the start state it
exactly as it is right there.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.717
We have nothing in
either of the jugs.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.980
So that's the pair 0, comma 0.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.590
So now we start to build up
some mathematics here, right?

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.380
So we express the state
of this whole situation

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.980
by a pair of number.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.877
Now we need to find out
what they can do with it.

00:13:08.877 --> 00:13:10.043
So what are the transitions?

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.650
The transitions are,
as we have seen, right?

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.830
We can just fill
one of the jugs.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:23.881
We can empty those.

00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:25.380
And the other
possibility is that we

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.020
can pour one jug over into the
other one as much as we can.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.590
So let's write all of those out.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.010
We can do emptying.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.080
Well, how does that
change the state?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.850
If we have x gallons
in this jug, and y--

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.670
and y gallons in that one,
we can transition this into,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.420
for example, emptying
the a gallon jug.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.540
So be y of 0.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:14:00.262
Or we can empty the b jug.

00:14:00.262 --> 00:14:01.720
Well, filling is
something similar.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.860
But now we are actually pouring
more water from the fountain,

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.430
essentially.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.930
Right?

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.930
All those tennis balls here.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:20.430
And we can fill up say the
a gallon up to a gallons,

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.410
and leave the b jug as it is.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:30.410
Or w we can fill up the b gallon
jug, and leave the a gallon jug

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.520
as it is.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.670
So these are these
two transitions.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:39.025
And the pouring of one--

00:14:39.025 --> 00:14:41.370
of one jug into the
other is actually

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.570
a little bit more complex.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.850
So let's have a look.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.770
So how does pouring work?

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:55.000
Well, suppose we
start with x and y.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.562
So let's have a look here.

00:14:57.562 --> 00:14:58.270
Um, I don't know.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.450
Suppose we have 2 balls in
here, and 2 balls in here.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.400
Well, in that case, I can say
pour all of these over in here.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.670
Right?

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.930
So that's easy.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.920
But there's also another
possibility, better

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.840
when I pour all of
these over in here.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.340
But hey, I can
only put in 1 ball,

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.000
because it's only
a three gallon jug.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.170
So I'm left with only 1.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.410
A gallon in this jug.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.110
So these are two--

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.080
these are two situations
that we need to explain.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.400
So let's first do the first
example that I just did.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.210
I pour everything over
into the other jug.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.440
So we have 0 gallons
left in here,

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.800
and x plus y gallons
left in the other jug.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.160
And this can happen if there's
sufficient space, right?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.320
So this can only happen
if x plus y is at most b.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.530
Which is the capacity
of this b gallon jug.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.170
Now if that's not
the case, then I

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.680
can pour in just a little
bit, like just say 1 ball.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.480
Like just one of
these can go in here.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.090
So that's the other case.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:16.450
So x, y we'll actually go to--

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.580
well, let's just
see how this works.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:25.260
How many gallons are left in
this b gallon jug to fill up?

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.600
Well, we have b minus
y gallons left, right?

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.080
Space left.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.790
So we can take b minus y
gallons out of this one

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.410
to fill up this one.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.170
So let's do it.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:42.580
We take b minus y
gets out of the a jug,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.300
and put it all in here, and it
makes it completely filled up.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.800
So we have b gallons over here.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:56.350
So this is really equal to
x plus y minus b, comma b.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:01.200
And this only is possible if--

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.119
if you are essentially in
the complimentary case.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:12.980
So we have that x
plus y is at least b,

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:19.720
such that there is enough
gallons in the a jug

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.460
to be poured over to
fill up the b jug.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.430
So these are the
two kinds of cases.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.180
And, of course,
by symmetry we can

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.830
do also the pouring from the
other jug into the first.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.650
So let's write all
those out, as well.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:38.530
So x, y can actually go
to x plus y, comma 0.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.750
I pour everything
from here to there.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:47.435
And this only holds if
x plus y is at most a.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:59.720
The other possibility is
where, exactly as in this case,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:06.170
we can only pour a minus
x gallons over from y

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.220
into this particular jug.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.300
And then this one is
completely filled up.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.740
And then I have a few
gallons left over here.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.910
So how does that look?

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:21.460
Well, we completely fill
this up to its capacity.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.210
And what is left
this is y minus--

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.990
how much did we have
to pour in here?

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.180
Well, that's a minus x.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.920
And we again have
a similar formula.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.870
But it now looks a
little bit different.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.720
X plus y minus a.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:45.060
And this is only for the case
where x plus y is at least a.

00:18:47.891 --> 00:18:48.390
OK.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.050
So these are all the cases.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.990
So maybe there are some
questions about this.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.940
Is this clear, that we have
these different possibilities?

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.090
Like when we look at
these jugs we can either

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.840
empty them, filling them up.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.260
Or we can pour say
only 1 ball over up

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.940
to the full capacity
of this jug.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.660
Or we can just pour everything
over into, say, this jug.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.660
So those are the different cases
that are now fully described

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.380
by this state machine.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.100
So now we can start to prove
this theorem over here.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.410
So how do we go ahead?

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:24.100
How are we going to use what
you've learned like induction,

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.660
and invariance?

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.880
So let's do it.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.470
But before,
actually, we do this,

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.940
let's take this
example that we had

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.088
and see how we can describe all
the transitions that we just

00:19:39.088 --> 00:19:41.920
did, as far as I remember them.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.850
So we have that a
equals 3, b equals 5.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.320
Right?

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.760
We start with empty jugs.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.980
We need to filled up the
five gallon jug, right?

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.330
Then we started pouring
the five gallon jug as much

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.240
as we could into the
three gallon jug.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.100
So it's one of those rules.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.860
We've got 3 into 2.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.080
Then we emptied the
three gallon jug.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.330
We got 0 and 2.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.730
Then we did--

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.070
What did we did next?

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:24.750
Oh yeah, we poured
everything into this one.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.890
So we have 2, 0
as the next state.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:35.550
We filled up-- actually I
forgot exactly what we did next.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.790
But I think we filled
up the five gallon jug.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.170
And then we simply
poured over as much

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.400
as he could from
the five gallon jug.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.040
And we got 3 and
4, and here we are.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.440
We got 4 gallons.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.265
So what we just did is fully
describe this state machine.

00:20:55.265 --> 00:20:56.890
So let's not try to
prove this theorem.

00:21:02.769 --> 00:21:04.560
So as I said, we're
going to use induction.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.840
So you always would
like to write this out

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.085
if you solve your problems.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.810
What are we going to assume?

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:25.170
Well, we assume actually
that m defines a,

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.919
and m defines also b.

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.460
That's the assumption
of the theorem,

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.880
and now we need to prove that
defies any result that you can

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.340
achieve in this state machine.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.560
So what's the invariance
that we are thinking about?

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.600
Invariance is going to be--

00:21:47.401 --> 00:21:47.900
Oops.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.530
It's a predicate.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:22:00.000
And it says something
like, if the state xy--

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.605
if this is the state
after n transitions--

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:20.900
Then we would like to conclude
that m the fights both x,

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.220
and m defines y.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.910
So this is our--

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.150
our invariance.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.690
And we like to use this
to prove our theorem.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.280
So how do we start
usually, right?

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.250
So we always start with--

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:34.500
with a base state.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.690
Great.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.880
So let's do it.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.660
The base case is--

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:49.400
well, we start with the all
0s, like the empty jugs.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.390
It's-- well, and we also--

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.160
have paid a little
bit of extra attention

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.120
to what we mean by
division over here.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.400
We said that all integers
actually divide 0.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.790
So in particular,
m. m divides 0.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.450
m, 0.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.790
So the very initial
state, 0 comma 0,

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:13.760
is indeed complying to
is particular invariant.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.070
So let's write it out.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.000
So we have the
initial state 0, 0.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.360
We know that m divides 0.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:27.060
And therefore, we
know that p 0 is true.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.920
So that's great.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.380
So the inductive step.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.380
How do we start the
inductive step--

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.720
step all the time?

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.420
And we will assume,
actually, p of n, right?

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.230
So lets assume that.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:51.310
And now we would like to
prove p, and then n plus 1.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.620
So what do we really want to do?

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.910
We want to say, well, we know
that we reached a certain state

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:03.810
x comma y, for which m
divides x, and m divides y.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.370
Now we would like to show
that if we transition

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:10.050
to a next state, we again have
that same property, that m

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:14.820
divides the number of gallons
in both jugs once more.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.200
And then we can con--

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.700
can conclude p, n plus 1.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.020
So that's how we always proceed.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.900
So let's see where
we can write it out

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.330
in a bit more formal way.

00:24:29.121 --> 00:24:29.620
OK.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.270
So how do we go ahead?

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:45.175
Suppose that x, y is the
state after n transitions.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.150
Well, what can we conclude?

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:57.160
Well, we have the predicate
pn, the invariant.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:06.390
So we know that n divides
x, and n divides y.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:08.780
And we concluded that
because pn is true.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.900
So after another transition--

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.580
what happens after
another transition?

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:25.280
So we can conclude
that the jugs are

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.625
filled by the different
types of numbers

00:25:30.625 --> 00:25:32.840
that we see here this
is state machine.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.660
So let's write them out.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:44.060
So after another transition,
um, each of the jugs

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.890
is actually filled--

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:52.840
Um, are filled with--

00:25:52.840 --> 00:26:01.360
well, either if I've emptied
it, say a 0, 0 gallons, a, b, x

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:01.990
and y.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.060
I see appearing over here.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.810
And I also notice
that I see x plus y.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.330
And x plus y, minus b.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.980
And x plus y, minus a.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.740
Those are all the
different number

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.040
of gallons that can be in jug.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.161
Yes, please?

00:26:14.161 --> 00:26:15.604
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:19.680
PROFESSOR: In our example--

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.888
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:26:20.888 --> 00:26:23.450
So in our example
problems of 3 and 5,

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.480
it turns out that
the only number that

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.765
divides 5 both the three gallon
jug, and the five gallon jugs

00:26:29.765 --> 00:26:31.390
is actually one.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:35.790
So in our example, we
would have that m equals 1.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:44.330
So over here we have
that only 1 divides a,

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.030
as well as 1 divides b.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.800
So m equals 1 in our case.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.240
But for example, in the three
gallon jug, and the six gallon

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:53.770
jug--

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:54.650
Right?

00:26:54.650 --> 00:27:01.320
We have that m equals 3, like
3 divides 3, And 3 divides 6.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.630
So those are the two cases that
you sort of look at right now.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:06.870
But you put into a much
more general setting, right,

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.270
we are distracted away
from the actual numbers.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:13.355
And use a and b as
representations.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.130
Are any other questions?

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.790
So after another
transition, each of the jugs

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.890
are filled with, well,
either 0 gallons, if we

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.120
have a completely emptied them.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:33.170
Or we have filled the first
a gallon jug, or it can be b.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.040
We also noticed that it can be--

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.650
it can be of x, of course.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:41.610
It can be y, because that's
the state that we are in.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:47.950
And we can have x plus y, minus
a, which appears over here.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.570
And x plus y, minus b.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.550
So these are all the
different number--

00:27:58.175 --> 00:27:59.300
possible number of gallons.

00:28:02.262 --> 00:28:04.280
The x plus y.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.520
That's also present.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.473
Is that true?

00:28:08.473 --> 00:28:08.973
Yeah.

00:28:08.973 --> 00:28:10.370
That's right. x plus y.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.280
So we also have x plus y.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.980
Actually, it's good
to check that again.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.340
So we have 0, x, y, a, b.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.280
Got those.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:24.090
X plus y, and x plus y, minus
p, and x plus y minus b.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.090
Yeah.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.860
So now we can start using our--

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.120
our assumptions.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.600
So what our they?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.980
We have that in order
to prove this-- right?

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.980
At the top over here, we assume
that m divides, and m divides

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.420
b.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.900
So we know that first of
all, m divides 0, of course.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.460
But we know that m divides a.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.000
We know that m divides b.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.970
We have concluded
that m divides x.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:56.370
And also m divides y.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.790
So if you now use some
facts about divisibility

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.770
on your handout, which
we will not prove now.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:10.520
But I think most of them will be
on your problem set, actually.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:16.270
We can conclude that also linear
combination of a, b x and y

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.660
will be divisible by m.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.850
In particular, m
will divide x plus y.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:26.400
m will divide x plus y minus
a, and also x plus y, minus b.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:34.040
So we will conclude
that m actually

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.960
divides any possible results.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.680
So divides any of the above.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.380
And now we're done.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.120
Why is that?

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.510
Because we have shown now that
after the next transition--

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:52.870
after we have reached
x, y after n steps,

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:58.980
then in our n plus 1-th step,
all that you can achieve

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.180
is divisible by m.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.810
So that's exactly
the invariance.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:08.620
So we conclude that
p, n plus 1 is true.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.600
And so now we're done.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.900
Are any questions
about this proof?

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.540
So this is like the
standard technique

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.200
that we tried to use all
the time here in this class.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.850
We will use it in all
the other areas, as well.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.440
In graph theory, in particular.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.430
And especially in number
theory, will also use it,

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.220
especially in this class.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:33.720
OK.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.660
So let's apply this to theorem.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:43.790
Let's I think about
this movie that we saw,

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:46.150
this Die Hard number 3.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.120
Die Hard number 4 came out.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.890
And then the cast got
stuck in Die Hard number 5.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.730
There's was a problem,
because the rumors

00:30:55.730 --> 00:31:01.810
were that in Die Hard number 5,
they had like a 33 gallon jug.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:02.760
That's a lot.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.680
And a 55 gallon jug.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:13.252
So Bruce has in
training his muscles,

00:31:13.252 --> 00:31:15.210
because you can imagine
those are pretty heavy.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.560
So if you want the pour one
into the other, my goodness.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.810
So-- but the question is, is
he training the right muscles?

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:27.450
So can we apply this theorem
now, and showed that--

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.100
Oh, I should to tell
you what is the problem.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:35.980
Well, again, he has to
get say 4 gallons out

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.750
of this-- out of these two jugs.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.260
So is that possible?

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:42.760
It's not.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.280
I see someone shaking his head.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.030
Do you want to explain why?

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.874
AUDIENCE: A and b are
both divisible by 11.

00:31:50.874 --> 00:31:51.540
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.640
AUDIENCE: So any other
configuration will also

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.360
have to be divisible by 11.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.590
And 4 is not divisible by 11.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.810
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:02.540
4 is not divisible by 11, so
the whole cast got blown up

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.310
in Die Hard number 5.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.510
And so we have no Die
Hard number 6, as well.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:13.520
OK, so-- so now
all of this stuff

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.860
actually helps us to define
a new concept, as well.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.580
So let's do that.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.485
I'll put it up here.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:42.770
We will use the
terminology GCD of a and b

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:59.530
as being the greatest
common divisor of a and b.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:04.380
So, for example, if we
are looking at a equals 3,

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:11.030
and b equals 5, well
then the GCD of 3 and 5

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.360
is actually equal to 1.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:20.450
There's no other larger integer
that divides both 3 and 5.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:25.250
In other examples are, for
example, if we have the GCD of

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.410
say 52 and 44.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.550
Well, what's this equal to?

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.630
Well, this actually
is 4 times 13.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.170
This is 4 times 11.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.350
So 4 divides both this,
and both this one.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.220
But nothing larger can
divide both of those.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.940
So we have that
this is equal to 4.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:52.110
We will have a
separate definition

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.650
that talks about this
very special case where

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.270
two numbers--

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.630
if you look at their
greatest common divisor--

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:02.445
when that greatest common
divisor is equal to 1,

00:34:02.445 --> 00:34:04.240
we actually define
those two numbers

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.310
to be relatively
prime to one another.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.979
So let's put that out over here.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.630
So that's another definition.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:28.929
We say that a and
b are relatively

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:39.610
prime if the greatest common
divisor is actually equal to 1.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.810
Now today we will not really
use his definition so much,

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:47.510
but it's actually
very important.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.714
And we'll come back
to this next lecture.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.600
So if we now look at this
particular thing them

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:02.490
over here, can we see a
nice corollary of this?

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.460
Like a result, if you
think about this greatest

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.160
common divisor.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.200
Well, the greatest
common divisor off a an b

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.670
divides both a and b.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.080
So the greatest common
divisor of a and b

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.930
will divide any result that
we can generate by playing

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.650
this game with the jugs.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:28.060
So the corollary here is
that the GCD of a and b

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.751
divides any result.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.200
OK, so that's really cool.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.950
So this already tells us
quite a bit about this game

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.590
that we have here.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:46.830
So now what we would
like to do is to find out

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.050
what exactly we can be reached?

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.760
We have a property that
we have shown here.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.300
But what else can we do here?

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.640
Now it turns out that
you can say much more,

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.330
and we would like to prove the
following theorem to make--

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.920
to analyze this whole
thing much better.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.400
I don't think I need the
state machine anymore.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.709
So let's take that off.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.580
The theorem that we
would like to prove

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:29.022
is that any linear
combination of the-- let's

00:36:29.022 --> 00:36:32.210
change this into
the 3 and 5 again.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.180
Any linear combination
of 3 and 5,

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:41.280
I can make with these 3
and the 5 a gallon jug.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.660
So let's write it out.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:55.680
So any linear
combination l, which

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:01.330
we writes as some integer s
times a, plus some integer

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:02.360
t times b.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:14.717
So any linear combination
of a and b, with--

00:37:14.717 --> 00:37:16.300
well, of course, the
number of gallons

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.850
should fit the largest the jug.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:25.430
So with 0 is, at most l.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:27.620
Is it mostly can be reached.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.920
So this theorem we
would like to prove now.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.610
And in order to
do that, we would

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:44.260
like to already think about
some kind of a property

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.250
that we have.

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:49.090
So when we talk about linear
combinations, the s and the t

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.820
can be negative, or positive.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.760
We really don't care.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.560
So for example, we could
have like, I don't know,

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.070
minus 2 times--

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:05.130
so for example, 4 is equal
to minus 2, times 3, plus--

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:06.140
actually, is that true?

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:06.820
Yeah.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:10.590
Plus 2, times 5.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:18.710
So here we have s to be equal
to minus 2, and t is equal to 2.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.430
And of course, a is
equal to 3, right?

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.210
And be is equal to 5.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:27.160
So 4 is a linear
combination of these two.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.070
And according to the theorem,
we can create that number

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:33.280
of gallons in this jug.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.480
And we already saw
that, because we did it.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:40.430
But for our theorem,
in order to prove this,

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.020
we really would like
s to be positive.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.390
So how can we do that?

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.150
If anybody has an
indea what we could do?

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.224
AUDIENCE: Let's assume
that b is greater than m.

00:38:51.224 --> 00:38:51.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.240
We have still that a
is supposed to be--

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.821
We will assume that
throughout the whole lecture.

00:38:57.821 --> 00:38:58.320
Thanks.

00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:02.230
So in order to prove
this, we really

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.110
would like to have
s to be positive.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.867
So let's just play
around a little bit

00:39:05.867 --> 00:39:07.700
with linear combinations
to get a little bit

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.280
of feeling for that.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.510
How could we write
4 differently,

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:14.150
as a linear
combination of 3 and 5,

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:19.150
such that we have actually
a positive number over here?

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:23.895
Does anybody see
another way to see that?

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:25.937
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:25.937 --> 00:39:27.145
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's true.

00:39:27.145 --> 00:39:29.940
3 times 3, minus--

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.270
minus 5.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.460
So-- and how did we do that?

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:38.580
Well, we can just say
5 times 3 to this one,

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.090
and then subtract the same
again, minus 3 times 5,

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:43.320
over here.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.170
And if he adds those
things together,

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:50.870
he will see 5 minus 2, is
3 times 3, as you said.

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:55.580
And we have minus 3 plus 2
is actually minus 1 times 5.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.900
And this will be a different
linear combination of 4.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.930
So what we can do here, we can
sort of play around and make

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:07.260
this s over here, which we now
say call s prime, is positive.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.640
Actually, it's larger than 0.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:22.960
So let's start the
proof for this theorem.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.595
It's pretty amazing
to me, actually,

00:40:27.595 --> 00:40:31.470
that you can do so
much a game like this,

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:35.020
and see so much happening.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:40.651
So let's figure
out how this works.

00:40:40.651 --> 00:40:41.150
OK.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:51.850
So let's first formalize this
particular trick over here.

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.030
And how do we go ahead with it?

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:59.990
Ah, well, notice
that we can rewrite

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:05.780
L, which is equal to s
times a, plus t times b.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:13.130
s, you know, we can just add
a multiple of b over here.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.880
n times b, say m times a.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:22.140
And we can subtract the
same amount over here,

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.370
minus n times a, times b.

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.530
So do you see what
I did over here?

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.570
I have added n times b, times a,
and subtracted n, times a times

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.760
b.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.140
And we did something similar
over here, not exactly

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:35.750
the same.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.990
But that's what we did.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:42.390
And you can imagine
that we can choose m,

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:45.970
such that s plus n times
b will be larger than 0.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:47.030
We can do that.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:53.450
So essentially this proved to
us that there exists an x prime,

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:57.050
and also the t
prime, such that L

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:59.610
can be rewritten as
a linear combination,

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:04.600
s prime, times a,
plus t prime, times b.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.710
But now with you extra
property, that s prime

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:13.010
is actually positive.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.690
Now this is really
important, because we're

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.840
going to create an
algorithm of playing

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.410
with those jugs that can
achieve this particular linear

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:23.280
combination.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.700
And that's how we're going
to prove this theorem.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:36.215
So let's assume that 0 is
less than L, is less than b.

00:42:36.215 --> 00:42:39.690
I know that we, in
the theorem, we also

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.472
consider the case is L
equals 0, and L equals b.

00:42:42.472 --> 00:42:43.680
But those are obvious, right?

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.020
You could either empty
the jugs, or just

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:49.130
fill up with the bigger one.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.260
So we will consider
just this case.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.080
All right.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.243
So what's the algorithm
going to do for us?

00:43:03.159 --> 00:43:12.740
The algorithm is going to
repeatedly fill and pour

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.160
our jugs in a very special way.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.470
And miraculously we
will be able to get

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.520
the desired linear
combination every single time.

00:43:26.229 --> 00:43:28.270
And of course, we're going
to use induction again

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:30.611
to prove this property.

00:43:30.611 --> 00:43:31.110
OK.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.330
So how does the algorithm work?

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:45.980
Well, to obtain L gallons
we're going to repeat

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.047
s prime times, which is the
number that we have over here.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:44:00.260
The following algorithm--
we first of all,

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.160
we will fill the a jug.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.609
This one.

00:44:08.609 --> 00:44:10.150
After we have done
this, we are going

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:12.380
to pour this into the b jug.

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:15.090
So how do we go ahead?

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.470
We pour- oops.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:19.615
This into the b jug.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:28.960
And when this b jug becomes
full, we are going pour it out.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.040
So let's write it out.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:45.080
So when it becomes full, it
will actually empty it out.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:53.610
And we will continue pouring
the a jug into the b jug.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.060
So we'll continue this process.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.060
So let's take an example
to see how that works.

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:10.680
So we keep on doing this until
the a jug is actually empty.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.070
So let's take an example.

00:45:18.436 --> 00:45:20.890
So let's see.

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:22.555
Let's do that over here.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.960
Actually we can do
the tennis balls, too.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.100
Let's do that first.

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.810
See how that works.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:41.510
So essentially, in
order to get 4 gallons,

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:45.100
we just fill up the
three gallon jug.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.230
We empty it all in here.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.670
We fill it up again.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.110
You pour in as much as we can.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.480
That's-- that's it.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.501
We have to empty this one.

00:45:58.501 --> 00:45:59.000
Oops.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.040
We have to keep on pouring.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.740
Put this in here.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:12.900
Fill this one up, and then pour
over into the five gallon jug.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.640
And now we've got 4
gallons over here.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.160
So what did we do?

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.490
So let's write it out.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:23.180
So for our special linear
combination over here,

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:29.040
we have that 4 equals 3,
times 3, minus 1, times 5.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.620
So we need to repeat
this process three times.

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.740
So let's do that.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:42.150
In our first loop we
will do the following.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:47.490
We start with the start
state, the pair 0, 0.

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.720
We're going to fill up the
very first jug all the way up

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.950
to its capacity, 3.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:57.860
And we put it all
over into the b jug.

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.414
What happens in the second loop?

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:09.200
The second loop, we
again fill up the a jug.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.320
So we have-- we start at 0, 3.

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.730
We fill it up.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:18.430
We get 3, 3, the pair 3, 3.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:22.330
We pour everything in
here, as much as we can.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:24.320
That give us 1, 5.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:29.180
Only 2 gallons are poured
into the bigger gallon.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.230
We empty the bigger
gallon, the bigger jug.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.940
We get 1, 0.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:39.110
And we keep on pouring,
and you get 0, 1.

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.070
So now in the third loop--

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.276
and that's where we
should get the 4 gallons.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.440
We start off with 0,1.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:57.150
Um, we fill up the a jug.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:03.910
We pour everything over into
the bigger jug, and we get 0, 4.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.210
And that's the end result.

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:09.970
So this algorithm seems to work
for this particular example.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:13.489
Of course we would like to prove
it for the general situation.

00:48:13.489 --> 00:48:14.280
So how do we do it?

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.780
Well, we're going to just
to analyze the algorithm

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.660
in the following way.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.530
We can notice that
in this algorithm,

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:36.020
we fill up s prime
times the a jug,

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:42.420
and we essentially pour
everything out into the b jugs,

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.660
and we sometimes
empty the b jug.

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.170
So let's try to think
about this a little bit,

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:51.030
and see how we could
try to formalize this.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.160
So let's write it out.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:49:02.720
We have filled the a
gallon jug s prime times.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.500
We also know that the
b jug has been emptied

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.880
a certain number of times.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:15.510
So let's-- let's just assume--

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:24.375
suppose that the b jug is
actually emptied, say, u times.

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.800
I do not know how many times.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.900
But I say, well, let's
assume it's u times,

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.340
and try to figure
out whether we can

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.470
find some algebraic expression.

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:44.690
So at the very end
of the algorithm,

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:48.270
let r be what is in the b jug.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:58.235
So let r be the remainder,
in the b gallon jug.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.220
So now we can continue.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.940
We know if r is what left
in the b gallon jug, well,

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.780
we know already
some property of it.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.040
Actually, let's put
that on the next board.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.580
We know that 0 is at
most r, and at most b,

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.170
because that's what's left
in the b gallon jug, right?

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.740
So we know these bounds.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:33.700
We have assumed that 0 is
less than L, is less than b,

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.620
which we put over there.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:40.650
We know that r must
be equal to what

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:46.720
kind of linear combination
of s prime, and u?

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:52.240
So-- Well, we have been
filling of s prime times.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:57.020
So this is what we added in
water to the whole system,

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.660
you can say, s prime times a.

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.060
And we poured out water.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:06.890
Well, we did that u times
from the b gallon jug.

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.830
So we poured out
u times b gallons.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:13.520
So this is the remainder that
this left in this bigger jug,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.910
right?

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:17.940
So are there any
questions about this?

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:22.150
So-- OK.

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:27.470
So we also know that
L is equal to s prime,

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:31.220
times a, plus t prime, times b.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.500
And this is the
linear combination

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.820
that we would try
to prove of, that it

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:39.240
is left at the very end.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.440
So what we want to show
is that r equals L.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.290
So how do we do that now?

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:51.110
How are we going to show
that r can be expressed

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:52.770
in L, in a special way.

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:53.710
So let's have a look.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:58.150
So these are all
tricks in the sense

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:01.000
that I'm giving you
this proof, but how do

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.340
you come up with this yourself?

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.990
Sometimes you play a lot
with these kinds of things,

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:11.070
and you get a feeling
of what kind of--

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:16.080
sort of pattern exists,
and what kind of intuition

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.070
you need in order to write
down a proof like this.

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.910
So let's rewrite this.

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:26.030
I'm going add t prime times b.

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:27.570
And I'm going to
subtract it again.

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:34.650
So I have s prime times
a, plus t prime times b.

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:38.240
I subtract it again, and I
still have this amount left open

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.820
here.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.755
So what is this equal to?

00:52:41.755 --> 00:52:48.840
Well this part is equal to L.
So this is equal to minus--

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:52.140
and I have a multiple
of b, which is t prime,

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.708
plus u times b.

00:52:56.636 --> 00:52:59.072
Hm.

00:52:59.072 --> 00:53:00.280
Now this is very interesting.

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.760
Does anybody see how
we could continue here?

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:08.260
So we have r expressed as
L, minus a multiple of b.

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.630
And I also know that
L is in this range.

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:13.489
I also know that r
is in this range.

00:53:13.489 --> 00:53:15.030
So that's kind of
interesting, right?

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.730
So how can that be?

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:20.560
What should be the case here?

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:25.660
Does anybody see what kind
of property t prime plus u

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:30.490
must have in order
to make that happen?

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:31.960
So let's have a look here.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.300
We have L. It's in this range.

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.720
So let's just draw an axis.

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.340
So at 0, we have b.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:48.300
And somehow in this
range, we have L. Now

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:53.590
if I subtract like actually
b, or something more than b,

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:55.470
or I add more than b.

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:59.010
I will jump out of this range,
and I go somewhere over here,

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.510
or I go somewhere over there.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:02.160
Right?

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.050
So if I said suppose
L is over here,

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:09.960
then L minus b would be over
here, which would be negative.

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.900
Or if I add b, it
will be over here,

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.670
which would be more than b.

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:20.120
Now we know that this is equal
to r, but r is in this range.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.810
So that's not really possible.

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:23.780
So let's write it out.

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:29.370
So if t prime plus
u is unequal to 0,

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:31.420
so we're actually
really subtract

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:36.300
or add a multiple of b.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:41.770
Then I know that r is
either smaller than 0,

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:45.110
or r is larger than b.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:46.910
Now we know that
cannot be the case,

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:51.600
so we can conclude that
t prime plus u equals 0.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:58.520
Now that implies that
t prime equals minus u,

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.040
or maybe other way around,
because that's easier

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.200
to see what's happening.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:06.300
So u equals minus t prime.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.720
If you plug that
in here, well, we

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.510
get exactly the same expression.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:12.590
You see?

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:16.640
Minus, minus t prime is
equal to plus t prime.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.560
And we get the exact
same linear combination.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.910
So we conclude that r equals L.

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:23.370
And now we're done.

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:24.420
Why is that?

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:29.034
Well, we have shown that the
very last number of gallons

00:55:29.034 --> 00:55:30.450
that is left after
this procedure,

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:32.670
after this algorithm,
is actually

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:35.090
exactly equal to the
linear combination

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:36.630
that we wanted to achieve.

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.550
So now we got the
proof for this theorem

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:49.260
that tells us that any linear
combination is actually--

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.920
of a and b can
actually be reached

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.250
by pouring gallons
over and back,

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.980
and emptying and
filling those jugs.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.170
All right let's continue.

00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:01.707
So there was a question over
here that I would like to--

00:56:01.707 --> 00:56:02.915
that I would like to address.

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:10.600
So maybe I did not make
so clear what the s prime,

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.900
and the t prime is over here.

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:16.222
And in this proof,
we started off

00:56:16.222 --> 00:56:17.430
with this linear combination.

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:20.270
I would like to
have an algorithm

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:25.990
of pouring that creates L
gallons in say the bigger jug.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:30.870
So in order to do that,
I want to find, say,

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:35.040
a linear combination that
makes this L such that this

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.110
s prime is an integer--

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:38.160
positive integer.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.900
Why do I want to have
a positive integer?

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.420
Because in this algorithm,
I'm going to repeat something

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:45.190
s prime times.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:47.670
If s prime is negative,
I cannot do it, right?

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:50.710
So s prime has to be
a positive integer.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:55.200
In order to create such
a positive integer,

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.450
I can just add like
1,000 times b times,

00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:03.160
and subtract 1,000
times a times b.

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:06.080
That's OK I could
just add a lot.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:11.220
And if I add enough, I can
make s plus n times b positive.

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:17.620
Even if s is, say, minus 100,
well, if I add 1,000 times 5,

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.770
I will get a positive number.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:22.520
So that's sort of
the reason this proof

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.310
that we want to rewrite
the linear combination

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:29.040
to a new one, such that
s prime is positive.

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.800
And if we have s prime
positive, then we

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.070
can actually talk
about this algorithm,

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:37.890
because we can only repeat
something s prime times,

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:41.435
if s prime is say 1, or 2,
or 3, or something positive.

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:46.330
All right.

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:51.470
So let's-- I'll talk
about say the next part.

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.560
So we have gone--

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.480
We have proved two theorems.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.529
But in the end we would like
to have a characterization

00:58:01.529 --> 00:58:02.820
of the greatest common divisor.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:05.410
That's the goal of this lecture.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:07.250
So let's do it.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:10.000
Um.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.750
In order to do this,
let's first of all

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:18.290
look at our five gallon,
and three gallon example.

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:22.830
We know that the greatest
common divisor is equal to 1.

00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:30.740
We know that 1 can be rewritten
as a linear combination, as 2

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:35.960
times 3, minus 1 times 5.

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.530
So that means that according
to the theorem that we

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:44.120
have up here, we can
actually make exactly 1

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.140
gallon in one of these jugs.

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:51.770
So that means that we can also
have any multiple of those.

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:54.970
So we can reach any multiple 1.

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:56.180
That's very special.

00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:59.730
So this particular case,
we know that any multiple

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:03.100
of 1, any number of
gallons can be reached.

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:06.270
So can we sort of
generalize this a little bit

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:08.050
by using the greatest
common divisor?

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:11.680
So the greatest common
divisor 3 and 5 is equal to 1.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:16.700
And we have shown that the
greatest common divisor defies

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:19.000
any result. Can we
say something more?

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.840
Can we say that the
greatest common divisor

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:25.040
can be maybe written
as a linear combination

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.830
of this type over there?

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:30.610
And that's how we are
going to proceed now.

00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:40.300
So let's set talk about the
very special algorithm which

00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.240
is called Euclid's algorithm.

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:47.410
And I think in the book it's
also called The Pulverizer.

00:59:47.410 --> 00:59:50.940
And you will have
a problem on this

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:55.660
just to see how that works,
and to really understand it.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:59.100
So let's explain
what we want here.

00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:05.390
So first of all, we know
that for any b and a,

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:08.580
there exists a unique
quotient and remainder r.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.740
So let's write it out.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:20.110
There exists unique q, which
we will call the quotient.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.720
And r.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.845
We call this the remainder.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:44.670
Such that b equals
q times a, plus r.

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:54.380
With the property that 0 is
at least r, and at most a.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.630
So we're not going to
prove this statement.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:00.160
It's actually like
a theorem, right?

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.387
But let's just
assume it for now.

01:01:02.387 --> 01:01:03.970
And in the book you
can read about it.

01:01:07.805 --> 01:01:13.110
We're going to use this to prove
the following lemma that we

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.030
will need to give
a characterization

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:18.090
of the greatest common divisor,
as a linear combination

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:20.235
of integers.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.040
Oh, before I forget, you
will denote this remainder

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:34.400
as rem of b, a.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.930
And this is the notation
that we use in this lecture.

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:40.090
So what's the lemma?

01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:46.730
The lemma is that the greatest
common divisor of a and b,

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:52.790
is equal to the greatest common
divisor of the remainder of b

01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:53.441
and a.

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:56.590
With a.

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.420
So what did we do?

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:02.810
Let's give an example
to see how this works.

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:06.230
For example, let's take--

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:08.405
actually let's do it
on this white board.

01:02:14.678 --> 01:02:16.175
So, let's see.

01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:21.040
For example, let's
see whether we

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:27.590
can use this to calculate the
greatest common divisor 105,

01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:28.940
and 224.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.250
So how can we go ahead?

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:38.000
Well, according
to this lemma, we

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.430
can rewrite this as the
greatest common divisor

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:49.720
of first the remainder of
224, after dividing out

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:54.680
as many multiples
of 105 as possible.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.180
And 105.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.640
So what are we
going to use here?

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:09.370
We're going to use that 224 is
actually equal to 2 times 105,

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:10.803
plus 14.

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:18.340
So we had the GCD of 14 and 105.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.490
Now why can I do this?

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:28.540
Well, I'm essentially just
subtracting like 2 times 135

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.850
from 224.

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:32.320
Well, the greatest
common divisor

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:40.050
that divides 105 and
224 also divides 105,

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:43.700
and a linear
combination of 105, 224.

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.430
That's essentially
what we are using.

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:49.370
And that's actually
stated in this lemma,

01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:52.840
and that's what we
would like to prove.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.370
So let's continue
with this process,

01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:58.330
and do the same trick once more.

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:03.900
So we can say that we can
rewrite this as the greatest

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:14.660
common divisor of, well,
the remainder of 105

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:20.150
after taking out this many
multiples of 14 as possible,

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:22.580
and 14.

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.720
So what are we going
to use over here?

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:34.200
We are going to use that 105
is equal to 7 times 14, plus 7.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:40.580
So this is the greatest
common divisor of 7, and 14.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:45.550
Now if you just
continue this process,

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:49.230
we can see that this is equal
to the greatest common divisor,

01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:53.760
again, of the
remainder of now 14,

01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:00.090
after dividing out as many
multiples of 7 with 7.

01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:05.630
Now this is equal to 0, 7.

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:06.180
Why is that?

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:14.630
Because 14 is equal
to 2 times 7, plus 0.

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:18.940
So 0 is the remainder
after dividing out

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.510
7 as many possible
times as possible.

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:22.010
OK.

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:25.180
So we have the greatest
common divisor of 0, and 7.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.950
What's the largest integer
that can divide both 0 and 7?

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:32.590
Well, any integer can divide 0.

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:36.280
So we know that
this is equal to 7.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.590
So essentially, what
we have done here,

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:42.600
we have repeatedly used
this particular lemma

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:49.360
to compute in the end, the
greatest common divisor of 105

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.290
and 224.

01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:54.690
And we have been very methodol--

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:57.030
we have used a specific method.

01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:01.490
We used the lemma,
and we worked it out.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:04.120
We used the lemma
again, and we just

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.880
plugged in the actual numbers.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.860
Used to lemma again.

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.860
Plugged in the actual
numbers, and so on.

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:14.020
And this is what is
called Euclid's algorithm.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.910
And in the book it's also
called The Pulverizer.

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:20.270
And there's, I think,
a few other names.

01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:23.190
But I like this one.

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:29.010
So this is an example
of Euclid's algorithm.

01:06:29.010 --> 01:06:31.370
So now let's have
to look whether we

01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:41.910
can have prove this particular
lemma, and actually I will--

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:42.970
Yep.

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:44.930
We're going to prove this lemma.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.030
OK.

01:06:56.030 --> 01:07:01.190
So how do we do the proof?

01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:05.640
Well, first before we
know that if- yeah.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.840
Well, how do we do this?

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.350
You would like to prove that
if the great-- well, if n

01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:13.380
divides a and b, in
particular, the greatest

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:17.360
common divisor divides a and b.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.910
We would like to show
that it's dividing also

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:27.890
the remainder of b, after
dividing out a, and a itself.

01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:30.200
If you can show
that, then we know

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.330
that the greatest common
divisor of this thing

01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:35.740
is at least what
we have over here.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.370
So I said a lot right now.

01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:40.210
So let's try to write
it out a little bit.

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:44.860
So suppose that m
is any divisor of a.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:48.205
And at the same time,
m also divides b.

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:57.920
Well, then I know
that m also divides

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:04.520
b minus, say, the quotient, q
that we had over here, times a.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:11.250
And-- and this is actually equal
to the remainder of b and a.

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.950
Now we also note
that m divides a.

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:16.210
So what did we show here?

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:22.439
We showed that if m divides,
and m divides b, then m

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:25.649
also divides the
remainder of b and a.

01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:27.700
And n divides a.

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:29.790
So what does is prove?

01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:32.370
Well, it proves
that, in particular,

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:36.470
the greatest common divisor
over here divides this one.

01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:37.859
That's interesting.

01:08:37.859 --> 01:08:42.930
That essentially means that
we have shown this inequality.

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:49.180
Because if this
one divides this,

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.970
well, that means that
this number over here

01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:55.569
must be at least what
we have over here.

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:56.399
OK.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.400
So let's continue.

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.080
We consider two cases.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.439
If the remainder of b and
a is unequal to 0, well,

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:17.600
what can we say now?

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.859
We can say that if I
know that m divides

01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:27.569
this remainder of b and a, which
can be rewritten as b minus q,

01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:29.819
times a.

01:09:29.819 --> 01:09:32.390
And I also note that--

01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:38.520
if I also know that n
divides a, then this actually

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.120
implies the reverse of this
statement, that n divides a,

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.290
and divides b.

01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:46.910
Now why is that?

01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:49.439
Well, we're actually
using the fact

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:53.960
that if n divides b, minus
q, times a, and m divides a,

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.680
then m also defies any linear
combination of these two.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:04.620
In particular, this plus
q, times a, which is b.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.710
m divides b.

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:10.780
So maybe I'm going a little
bit fast here, I notice.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:15.000
This all also has to do with
all the lecture handouts.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.650
You see a few facts
on the divisibility.

01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:23.380
And in particular, item number
three that talks about the fact

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.380
that I'm using here.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:28.610
If a divides b on your handout,
and a divides c, then I

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:33.800
know that a divides any
linear combination of b and c.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.255
So that's essentially what
I'm using here repeatedly.

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:41.250
OK

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:48.930
So let's look at the other case.

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:54.620
If the remainder is equal
to 0, well, then I actually

01:10:54.620 --> 01:11:00.540
know that b minus q,
times a is equal to 0.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:07.780
Well, if I know that
m divides a, well,

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:16.380
then since 0 equals b minus q,
times a, I know that b equals

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:17.450
q, times a.

01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:21.260
So if m divides a, I also
now that m divides b.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.570
So this is one argument.

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:27.240
This is another one.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.775
And this was--

01:11:28.775 --> 01:11:30.610
These are the three
arguments that

01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:35.970
now show that anything
that divides these two also

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:37.439
divides a and b.

01:11:37.439 --> 01:11:39.230
So now we have the
reverse argument, right?

01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:43.590
So this greatest common
divisor divides this one here,

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.340
and this one.

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:49.002
And we just proved that
it divides a and b,

01:11:49.002 --> 01:11:50.460
and so it must
divides the greatest

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.940
common divisor of a and b.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.030
So now we have shown
the other inequality,

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:56.190
and this proves equality.

01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:59.160
So you should definitely look
this up in your lecture notes.

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:05.790
So now we can finally prove
this beautiful theorem

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:12.895
a that will help us to
characterize the-- actually,

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.360
let me put this over here.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.600
So the final theorem
that we prove here

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:30.630
is that the greatest
common divisor of a and b

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:38.280
is actually a linear
combination of a and b.

01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:43.280
So we're going to use this
algorithm that you have

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.460
over here, Euclid's algorithm.

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:53.860
And we are going to do a
proof, again, by induction.

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:55.470
And we use an invariance.

01:12:55.470 --> 01:13:03.360
So we use a similar kind
of strategy, of course.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:09.105
The invariance that we
are going to use says--

01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:26.050
well, if Euclid's algorithm
reaches the greatest

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:29.140
common divisor of x and y--

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:36.350
so for example, it's reach, say,
7 or 14, and 105, for example.

01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:47.790
Then, say, after n steps
then both x and y are

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:51.950
linear combinations of a and b.

01:13:51.950 --> 01:14:04.370
So then x and y are linear
combinations of a and b.

01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:07.020
And at the same
time, we also know

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:10.270
that the greatest common
divisor of a and b

01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:15.020
is equal to the greatest
common divisor of x and y.

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.390
So this is my invariance.

01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:24.540
And the way I will go ahead is
to simply do what you do always

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:25.650
in these situations.

01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:28.210
So we start with the base case.

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:33.220
And we can immediately see that
after 0 steps in the Euclidean

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.530
algorithm, I've done
absolutely nothing.

01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:42.890
So obviously after
0 steps, x equals a.

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:44.200
y equals b.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.060
So of course, they are linear
combinations of a and b.

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.440
And this equality
holds, as well.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.680
So for the base case--

01:14:58.130 --> 01:15:04.790
So after 0 steps, we immediately
know that p 0 is true.

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:08.690
Now for the inductive step, we
have to do a little bit more.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.025
As usual, right?

01:15:19.025 --> 01:15:24.410
We always assume p n.

01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:27.320
And now we would like
to prove p n plus 1.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.572
So how do we do this?

01:15:29.572 --> 01:15:41.510
Well, we notice that
there exists a q such

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:49.730
that the remainder of y and x
is equal to y minus q, times x.

01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:51.270
So we assume p n.

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:54.470
We have reached
some state, x, y.

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:57.910
We know that the remainder
of y, x equals y minus q,

01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:02.830
times x, for some quotient q.

01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:06.610
We know that y is a linear
combination of a and b,

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:08.610
and x is, as well.

01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:12.530
So that means that this
one is actually also

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:18.860
a linear combination of a and b.

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:25.257
So now when we look at this
, algorithm we can see that--

01:16:25.257 --> 01:16:26.840
that if you look at
the remainder that

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.850
appears in here, that's still a
linear combination of a and b.

01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:35.420
So after a extra step, we
notice that what we have reached

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.170
are still in
combinations of a and b.

01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:40.890
And of course, the
lemme has showed--

01:16:40.890 --> 01:16:46.270
has shown us that what
we reach is still equal--

01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:47.770
the greatest common
divisor is still

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:51.320
equal to what we originally
started out with.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.300
So this proves p of n plus 1.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.380
So n-- let's finish
this particular proof.

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:07.004
So for the very last
step, if you now

01:17:07.004 --> 01:17:08.045
look at this particular--

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.770
so if you look at the very end,
we notice that in every step

01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:19.750
the remainder is getting
smaller, and smaller,

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:20.260
and smaller.

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:22.250
Right?

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:24.700
And you can use a similar
kind of proof technique

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:28.510
to show that after a
finite number of steps,

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:33.190
we will reach a GDP of 0, y.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.200
Something like this.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:41.030
So in the very last step
of Euclid's algorithm

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:44.890
we achieve something
off this form.

01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:49.220
We now use our
predicate over here,

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:53.890
and say that y is a linear
combination of a and b,

01:17:53.890 --> 01:17:57.020
but the greatest
common divisor of 0, y

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.900
is also equal to the original
greatest common divisor

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.860
that we want to characterize.

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:05.760
So now we have
proved the theorem

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.110
that says that the greatest
common divisor of a and b

01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:11.830
is actually a
linear combination.

01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:13.840
So now we're going to
combine all those three

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.969
theorems in one go.

01:18:16.969 --> 01:18:25.580
And that will show
us the final result,

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:35.230
which is that the theorem that
the greatest common divisor

01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:42.010
of a and b is
actually the smallest

01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:54.000
positive linear
combination of a and b.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.840
So we're going to combine
all of these together.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.970
We know that the greatest common
divisor divides any result.

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:05.160
The theorem up there says
that any linear combination

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160
can be reached.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.949
And also just showed--

01:19:08.949 --> 01:19:10.740
have shown that the
greatest common divisor

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:13.890
is a linear
combination of a and b.

01:19:13.890 --> 01:19:17.450
So we can combine those
three to get this theorem.

01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:19.120
So how do we do it?

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.620
Well, let's just look
0 all the way up to b.

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:29.770
Suppose these are all
the results that we

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:32.530
can reach in our problem.

01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:38.160
We know that the greatest common
divisor divides all of those.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.390
At the same time, it's
also linear combination

01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:42.160
that's over here.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.860
Since it's a linear combination,
it can also be reached, right?

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:47.840
By the theorem that we have.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:51.099
So suppose that this is the
greatest common divisor.

01:19:51.099 --> 01:19:53.140
But we also know that the
greatest common divisor

01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:57.760
is dividing all of these points
here that can be reached.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.420
So therefore, it must
be the smallest one.

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:04.050
And I will leave you
with some homework

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:06.210
to think about this
very carefully.

01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:09.220
And you can show for
yourself that you can now

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.660
combine those three
arguments together, and see

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:15.630
that the greatest common divisor
must be the smallest positive

01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:18.420
linear combination.

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:21.770
So, I will see next Thursday.
