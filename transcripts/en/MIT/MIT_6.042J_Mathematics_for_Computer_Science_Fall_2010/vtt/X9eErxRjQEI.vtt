00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.120
PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.560
Last time we looked at a
variety of ways to analyze sums

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.900
and to find closed-form
expressions for the sums.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.440
And today we're going to
use those methods to solve

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.920
a variety of famous problems,
one of them involving center

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.370
of mass and stacking blocks.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.810
We saw a version
of that yesterday

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.000
in recitation, where you solved
the problem of figuring out

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.150
how many L's you need to make
something like this balance

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.870
perfectly.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.250
Now in this case I didn't
actually get an integer number

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.750
of L's-- which is possible--
because I didn't quite get it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.230
stacked right at the bottom.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.150
So I got 10 and 1/2 L's here.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660
There's an extra vertical here.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.990
Now in theory there are two
integer ways of doing it.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.430
And you proved that
yesterday in recitation.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.060
So in theory, 10
and 11 should work,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.170
but in practice the
blocks aren't perfect.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.000
I didn't get them
perfectly lined up.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.640
And so 10 wouldn't quite
work, and 11 tended

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.530
to pitch it the other way.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.890
And of course in theory, as
long as the center of mass

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.080
is just anywhere over this
block, it's going to be stable.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.550
In practice there's air moving
around, and bouncing and stuff.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.900
And so if you're close to
the edge, it's going over.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.420
OK.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.503
So now if you want to build
one of these yourself,

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.110
it's not hard to do.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.864
You just start with an
extra block here, all right,

00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:49.780
and then you build up.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.446
And that's easy.

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:52.912
And then you notice
when it's about right.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.870
And you can just start
wiggling this block out.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.850
And then it looks pretty
cool at that point.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.057
Actually it was a student
in the class showed me this

00:02:01.057 --> 00:02:03.390
a couple of years ago, because
we were doing the blocks.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.780
The next thing we're going
to do-- we were doing that--

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.321
and he said, hey,
there's this thing.

00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:08.150
And yeah, pretty cool.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.039
So today we're going to
look at a different problem,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.150
and that's the problem of
getting the blocks stacked up

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.950
so they go out over the edge of
the table-- if that's doable.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:30.840
So the goal is to stack
the blocks up like this.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.920
We go farther and farther out.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.410
And the question
we're going to look at

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.410
is is it possible-- whoa.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.910
Almost.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.909
Is it possible to get a block
all the way off the table?

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.700
That's the question
we're going to look at.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.440
And here I got close.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.215
And you can see it's
getting a little tipsy.

00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:51.090
It's not going to go.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.450
It's going to fall over.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.030
So I didn't do it this time.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.360
You're only allowed
one block per level.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.110
So you can't do
anything like this.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.590
That's not allowed.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.680
You can go backwards,
if that helps you.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.570
Well it's got to be
stable on both sides.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.220
But you can go back and forth.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.370
So the question is, can you
get out one block totally

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.360
out over the table?

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.160
How many people think
it can't be done?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.660
All right.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.810
A few doubters.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.830
More doubters.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.180
How many think it can be done?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.930
Oh, a lot of people
think it can be done.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.750
OK.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.300
Well all right.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.540
How many people think
you can get a block

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.080
two blocks out over the table?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.940
A few of you.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.230
How many think you can
get it three blocks out?

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.020
You're believers.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.430
OK.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.840
How many people think
I can reach that wall?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.540
Well I got to tell you I
can't reach the wall because--

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.123
AUDIENCE: The ceiling
gets in the way.

00:03:58.123 --> 00:03:59.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.900
That's going to be hard to do.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.560
But this is what we're
going to try to figure out.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.280
And we're going to do it
with a little competition.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.050
So we're going to have a team
of you go up against the TAs.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.079
And the winner gets
candy to share.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.519
The losing team gets the
infamous 6042 Nerd Pride pocket

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.030
protectors.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.940
Very nice.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.990

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.100
Has the MIT logo on them.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.310
Very handy.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.810
All right.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.730
So I need four volunteers.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.710
So come on down if
you'd like to volunteer.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.400
You can win some
candy for the class--

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.810
or at least win yourself
a pocket protector.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.020
And we'll put the
class over there.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.610
And we get the TAs to come down.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.460
So come on down.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.501
I got a couple of people.

00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:48.920
Who else wants to join them?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.420
All right.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.910
Come on down.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.307
We've got a fourth
volunteer out there?

00:04:57.271 --> 00:04:57.770
All right.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.061
We got some people coming down.

00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:00.430
All right, come on over.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.930
All right.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.270
You got all the blocks you want.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.660
We could even take
this thing down.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.660
So here's your supply.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.490
All right.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.810
Now the TAs have a little
bit of an advantage,

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.960
because they've done this
before, some of them.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.070
So you can give some advice
to your colleagues here.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.460
So you got to get some blocks
out of the block supply.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.751
Maybe we should take this down.

00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:25.180
It's about to fall over anyway.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.550
So yeah, how do
we get this down?

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.576
I'm not sure.

00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:31.770

a block out so far.

AUDIENCE: Uh, we're-- I
think we're actually there.

00:08:41.964 --> 00:08:42.547
PROFESSOR: No.

00:08:46.355 --> 00:08:46.855
All right.

00:08:46.855 --> 00:08:52.080
Well try another block or
two, and then we'll vote.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.580
See?

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.080
AUDIENCE: It's on the edge.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.960
Right there.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.697
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:08:56.697 --> 00:08:58.280
AUDIENCE: Looks like
the Stata Center.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah that's it.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.750
AUDIENCE: I'm holding it.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.750
PROFESSOR: You're close.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.154
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:12.570
PROFESSOR: You're not the most
efficient, that's for sure.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.050
Yeah the TAs are already
munching down here.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.426
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.910
AUDIENCE: Copy
the TAs' solution.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.201
PROFESSOR: Now there's an idea.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:35.820
All right.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.560
Well I think it's
time for a vote.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.061
But let the class
see what you did.

00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:44.560
Yeah you got to
take your hands off.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.270
That's you know.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:45.453
AUDIENCE: We can.

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:46.578
We're just choosing not to.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.340
PROFESSOR: Get some good
top balancing on there.

00:09:54.714 --> 00:09:55.678
I don't know.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.740
All right.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.970
Can you let it go?

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:02.470
All right.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.095
They let it go.

00:10:03.095 --> 00:10:03.690
Let's see.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.853
Did you get one out?

00:10:04.853 --> 00:10:05.477
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:05.477 --> 00:10:06.340
This one right here.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.215
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:08.320
We're going to do a vote.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.350
Who thinks they got
the one farthest out?

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.730
Oh it's close.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.230
Ah!

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.550
Look at that.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.080
We need some glasses out there.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.186
Who thinks the TAs
got it farther out?

00:10:21.186 --> 00:10:22.182
AUDIENCE: Boo.

00:10:22.182 --> 00:10:23.050
PROFESSOR: Oh man.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.555
All right.

00:10:25.555 --> 00:10:26.055
All right.

00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:27.270
So you guys.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.050
Here you go.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.650
Your very nice
pocket protectors.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.865
A good effort.

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:31.840
There you are.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.860
Well done.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.480
And I'm afraid they
get the candy here.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.942
So you can take these out and
share them with the class.

00:10:42.184 --> 00:10:43.100
Oh, leave it that way.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.500
Leave it there.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.970
I mean, we're going
to analyze yours,

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.553
because I can't begin
to analyze that.

00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:50.740
All right.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.460
Now watching this,
how many people

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.020
still think we can get it
all the way to the wall?

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.860
Ah, a few people.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.830
In fact, if you stack
this high enough--

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.250
and we're going to analyze
how high it has to go--

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.870
you could reach the wall.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.990
Now in fact we're going
to find that you probably

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.010
got to go out to the
stars to get that high

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.490
before you can reach the wall.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.750
So it's not too practical.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.130
Now what I want to do is
analyze this strategy.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.880
And this sort of looks
like a nice design.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.800
They got out there
with just five.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.070
And they did a
particular approach

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.500
using what we could call
as the greedy algorithm.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.580
We've seen greedy
algorithms before.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.370
And they used another
greedy algorithm here.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.820
Now what their greedy strategy
did-- and I'm going to redo it

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:42.770
here-- is stack all the
blocks right at the edge.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.680
Line it up here and,
starting at the top,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.230
push it out as
far as you can go.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.250
Now in this case, we can
get it out about halfway,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.889
because the center of mass of
this block is at halfway point.

00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:58.680
And that better be
sitting over this block,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.020
or it's going to tip.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.860
So the top block goes out here.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.590
Now I'm going to slide
the top two blocks out

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.738
as far as they go.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:11.790
All right.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.170
That's about the tip.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:18.500
Then I slide the top three
out as far as they go.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.840
Whoa!

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.600
Almost.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.020
Oops.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.030
Theory is always
easier than practice.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.600
And now we do the
top four blocks.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.120
And they did a better
job than I did.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.960
But that's the algorithm,
OK, the greedy algorithm.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.020
The top i blocks-- when i
goes 1 to n-- push it out

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.480
as far as you can go.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:41.980
All right.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:47.840
And we're going to
analyze that strategy

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.108
and see how far it goes.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:02.410
So we're given n blocks.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.365
And let's say they all have
length 1, to make it easy.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:15.010
And we're going to define r
sub i to be the amount by which

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.380
the i'th block hangs
out over the edge.

00:13:30.108 --> 00:13:31.691
and we're going to
count from the top.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.330
All right.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.270
So let's see this on a picture.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.080
So I got the table here.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:02.160
And then I'm stacking the blocks
out in some way like this.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.555
And with a greedy strategy,
you don't ever go backwards.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:12.900
All right.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.980
So I'm defining this distance.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.110
This is block one.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:26.240
This distance here is r 1.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.470
This distance is r 2.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.710
This one is r 3-- and so forth,
until you get down to here.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.080
This is r n, because
this is the n'th block,

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.610
and it extends out
r n from the table.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.590
And this is 0 here,
which the table--

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.860
we'll consider the table to
be the n plus first block.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.940
So r n plus 1 is 0.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.330
OK.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.820
And so using the strategy--
the greedy strategy--

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.170
we want to know what's r 1?

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:00.040
We want to compute that-- if
I keep pushing the blocks out

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.970
in a topward fashion
as far as they'll go.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.850
Now the constraint is
the stability constraint

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.171
so it won't fall over.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:24.970
The stability constraint says
that the center of mass--

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:37.010
we'll call it C k--
of the top k blocks

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.149
must lie on the k
plus first block.

00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:41.190
Otherwise it'll tip over.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.775
And of course the table is
block n plus 1 in this context.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:02.840
OK.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.550
So if at any point
we've got k blocks,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.200
and their center of
mass is out here,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.040
they'll fall over at that point.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.850
Or if you are
building it this way,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.390
they would fall over that way.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:16.890
All right.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.680
So for each set of the top
k blocks, the center of mass

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.280
has to be on the block below.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.300
And if it is, we're fine.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.602
It won't fall over.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.840
Now for the greedy stacking.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.940
Where is the center
of mass of the top k

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.630
blocks in the greedy
stacking, the way

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:49.270
we defined them in terms
of these variables.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.446
What is C k?

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:55.370
All right.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:02.190
So I got the top k
blocks r k plus 1.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.089
The center of mass of the top
k blocks by the greedy strategy

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.349
is right at the edge
of the k'th block.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:15.131
So if this is a block k here,
then this is r k plus 1.

00:17:15.131 --> 00:17:16.589
That's where the
center of mass has

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:20.500
to be of all these
blocks-- the top k blocks.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.270
If it's a little bit more,
it's going to fall over.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.480
If it's less, then
it's not greedy.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.510
We didn't push it out
as far as it could go.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.010
All right.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.250
So for the greedy stacking,
C k is equal to r k plus 1.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:42.090
And r n plus 1 of course
is the edge of the table.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:42.830
That's zero.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.540
Any questions so far?

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.500
What we're doing?

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.570
OK.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.080
All right.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.180
So let's figure out where the
center of mass of the top k

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.600
blocks is-- a formula for
that-- a recursive formula.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.280
So to do that we look
at the center of mass

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.970
of the k'th block by itself,
and then average it in with

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.551
the center of mass of
the top k minus 1 blocks.

00:18:10.551 --> 00:18:11.050
OK.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:15.560
So we're going to set up a
recursion to compute C k.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:23.150
Where is the center of mass of
the k'th block just by itself?

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.280
The center of mass
of the k'th block.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:26.780
This guy.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.970
Where is its center of mass?

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:30.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah, r
k plus 1 minus 0.5.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.200
Because the center
of mass of this block

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.860
is 1/2 from the right edge.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.450
And the right edge
is-- oh, it's r k.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.315
Sorry.

00:18:46.315 --> 00:18:46.900
All right?

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.590
The top.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:48.560
Yeah this is.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.060
What?

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:49.851
What did I do here?

00:18:49.851 --> 00:18:50.451
Oh, the top k.

00:18:50.451 --> 00:18:50.950
Sorry.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.074
This is the k'th block,
the way I had it.

00:18:53.074 --> 00:18:53.740
Here's the k'th.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.519
So it is r k minus a half.

00:18:56.519 --> 00:18:57.060
That's right.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.161
This is r k plus 1 down here.

00:18:59.161 --> 00:18:59.660
All right.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.730
Because the right edge of
the k'th block is at r k,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.320
the center of mass
is 1/2 left of that.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:06.820
All right.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:20.860
So we know that the center of
mass of the k'th block is at r

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.180
k minus 1/2.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:24.870
All right.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.980
Now we can compute another
expression for C k.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:45.610
The center of mass
of the top k blocks

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:53.660
is C k equals-- well there's
k minus 1 block centered

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.990
at C k minus 1, because
the center of mass

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.180
of the top k minus 1 block's
by definition is C k minus 1.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.910
And they have weight k minus 1.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.700
And then we average that with
a k'th block that has weight 1

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.930
at position r k minus 1/2.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.980
And the total weight of
this is k minus 1 here,

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.160
and one for this block.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:24.160
So this equals KC
k minus 1 minus--

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.600
let me write it better here.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.860
k minus 1.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:36.140
C k minus 1 plus R k
minus 1/2 all over k.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:36.640
All right.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.670
So now we've got an expression--
a recursive expression--

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:40.780
for C k.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.425
And to simplify it, we're
going to plug in that-- C k

00:20:48.425 --> 00:20:50.470
as r k plus 1 for
the greedy strategy.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.104
Yeah?

00:20:52.104 --> 00:20:54.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:55.900
PROFESSOR: L is 1.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.427
The length of the blocks is
1, here to make it simpler.

00:20:59.427 --> 00:21:01.010
Otherwise it would
have been a half L.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.890
So yesterday we talked
about length L blocks.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.870
Today they're length
1, to be simple.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:07.370
All right.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.828
So now for the
greedy strategy, I'm

00:21:08.828 --> 00:21:12.580
just going to plug
in C k as r k plus 1.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.680
So let's do that.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:24.830
So I got C k as r k plus
1 equals zero k minus 1.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:37.090
Well C k minus 1 is just R
k plus R k minus 1/2 over K.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:43.130
And this simplifies
to k r k minus r k

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:49.010
plus r k-- they cancel--
minus 1/2 over k.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.790
This equals r k minus 1/2.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:56.020
So getting very simple now.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.780
And I'm just going
to rewrite this

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:02.950
to look at the difference
between r k and r k plus 1.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.562
So r k minus r k plus 1 Oops.

00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:08.270
I made a mistake.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.700
That's 1 over 2 k.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.100
Half over k is 1 over 2K.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.921
Any questions about
the math we did?

00:22:20.921 --> 00:22:21.420
Interesting.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.970
This is one of those problems
where the math this way

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.099
is easy.

00:22:25.099 --> 00:22:27.140
There are other ways to
try to solve this problem

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.380
and the math gets pretty hairy.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.220
But this one's a
simple approach.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.030
What's the meaning of this?

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:39.090
What's an interpretation
of r k minus r k plus 1?

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:39.703
Yeah.

00:22:39.703 --> 00:22:40.578
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:43.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.270
This is how much further the
k'th block sticks out over

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.160
the k plus first block.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.398
So let's see that.

00:22:51.398 --> 00:22:52.170
All right.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.230
So here's r 1.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.020
Here's r 2.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.350
r 1 minus r 2 is the amount by
which the first block sticks

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.010
out over the second.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.700
Here's r 2 two minus r 3.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.841
It's that distance.

00:23:06.841 --> 00:23:07.340
All right.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.760
So we've gotten a formula for
the greedy strategy of how much

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.630
the k'th block sticks out
over the k plus first block.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.311
And it's pretty simple.

00:23:17.311 --> 00:23:17.810
All right.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:22.740
So now we can write
down this expression

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.340
for all the values of k.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:30.620
So what's r 1 minus r 2 going
to be in the greedy strategy?

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.480
How much is the top
block sticking out

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:38.130
over the second block
in the greedy strategy?

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:38.860
1/2.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.140
Just plug in k equals 1.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.758
r 2 minus r 3 equals--

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:49.105
AUDIENCE: A quarter.

00:23:49.105 --> 00:23:50.880
One quarter.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.430
r 3 minus r 4 is what?

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.270
6.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:57.950
All right.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.030
So now you can start to
see what the TAs did,

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.990
how it got smaller
each step going down

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.250
all the way to the end here.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:13.326
You get r n-- the n'th block--
minus the table is 1 over 2 n.

00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:14.010
All right.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.980
Now there's a very
easy way to figure out

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.970
what r 1 is, which
is what we're after.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.630
How far out is the top block?

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.880
What do I do?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.170
Add them all together.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.520
And everything cancels.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:39.430
So I get r 1 minus r n
plus 1 equals 1/2 plus 1/4

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.910
plus 1/6 out to 1 over 2 n.

00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:47.350
All right.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:55.210
So that's just equal to the
sum i equal 1 to n 1 over 2 1.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:55.710
All right.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.990
Now I got r 1 minus r n plus 1.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:03.810
But what's r n plus 1?

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.350
0.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:05.080
That's the table.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.980
The table doesn't
hang out over itself.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:16.320
So in fact r 1 equals a half
of the sum of the inverses

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.420
of the first n integers.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.460
OK?

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.760
And so now all we have to
do is to compute this sum

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.350
to know how far out it is.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.090
In fact, this sum
comes up so often

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.260
in mathematics and computer
science, it has a special name.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.150
It's called the harmonic sum.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.790
And the numbers are called
the harmonic numbers.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:49.860
And in particular, the
n'th harmonic number

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.990
is typically denoted
H n just equals

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.655
the sum of the n reciprocals.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.810
All right.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.810
So for example, the first
harmonic number is 1.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:10.510
The second is 1
plus 1/2 equals 3/2.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:21.130
The third is 3/2 plus
1/3, which is 11/6.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:27.340
The fourth harmonic
number is that plus 1/4.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.816
22 plus 3/12 is 25/12.

00:26:32.449 --> 00:26:33.990
That's sort of an
interesting number,

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:37.380
because it's bigger than 2.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.691
What does that tell us?

00:26:39.691 --> 00:26:41.565
Why is that interesting
from this perspective

00:26:41.565 --> 00:26:44.790
of what we're doing here?

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:47.070
Now you can get a
block off the table.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.230
Because R1, the distance
that the top block hangs out

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.690
off the table, is half
the harmonic number.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.930
Half of H 4 is a little
bit bigger than 1.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:02.580
Which means with four blocks the
top block can be off the table.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.880
Now the TAs did it using five.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.780
I didn't even get it
to work with five.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.950
In theory it'll work with 12.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.380
You can hang one out
there just a 24th

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.040
beyond the edge of
the table in theory.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:15.540
All right.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.920
If we kept on going,
h of a million--

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.490
the millionth harmonic number,
if you were to go compute it,

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:29.000
is 14.3927 and some other stuff.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.910
So if I had a million
blocks stacked up, in theory

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.230
how far would I get the
top block off the table?

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.910
Seven blocks.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:39.410
All right.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.493
So that gives you an idea.

00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:44.020
You have to do a lot
of work to get seven.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.720
And in fact it's hard,
because the bottom block

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.500
would be hanging out one
two millionth of a block.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.000
All right?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.670
So you're adding up
a lot of tiny things

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.800
to get to seven out there.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.860
Now it turns out that
the harmonic numbers

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.729
grow to infinity.

00:27:58.729 --> 00:27:59.520
And we'll see that.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.760
But they grow very, very slowly.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.890
And to see that, we need to
get a closed-form expression

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.130
for this sum.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.210
Now does anybody know a
closed-form expression

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.690
for the sum of 1 over i?

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.750
I don't think so,
because I don't

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.575
know anybody who knows that.

00:28:20.575 --> 00:28:25.150
In fact it's [? probably ?]
believed that it doesn't exist.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:30.208
So what do we do to get a
good estimation of that sum?

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.852
What do we do?

00:28:35.852 --> 00:28:37.060
AUDIENCE: Integration bounds.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.110
PROFESSOR: The
integration bounds.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.450
Yeah.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.410
Because we're not going
to get a closed form.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:44.260
At least I don't know of
anybody who knows how to do it.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.810
So we'll use the
integration bounds.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.460
And what kind of
function are we summing?

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.000
Is it increasing or decreasing?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.660
Decreasing.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.790
Yep.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.158
So we'll use the formula
we did last time.

00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:14.720
All right.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:23.980
And that formula is that the
sum i equals 1 to n of f of i

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.042
is, at most, the first
term plus the integral.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.370
And it's at least the last
term plus the integral.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.600
All right.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.680
In this case we have
f of i as 1 over i.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.197
So the first step is to
compute the integral.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:03.530
And that's pretty easy.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:08.520
That's just the natural log
of x evaluated at n and 1.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.070
And that's easy.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.990
That's just the
natural log of n.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.930
So the integral
is very easy here.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.720
And now we actually
can just plug in

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.883
and get really good bounds.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.868
Maybe I'll save
that just in case.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.740
OK so plugging in
into the bounds f of n

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:51.620
is 1 over n plus the
integral is log of n

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.860
is less than or equal to
the n'th harmonic number.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.190
And it's upper
bounded by f of 1,

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:01.798
which is 1 plus the integral.

00:31:01.798 --> 00:31:02.550
All right.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.520
So that's really good.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.410
We got very tight bounds.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.220
And now you can see that
the n'th harmonic number--

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.800
how fast is it growing?

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.620
If I were to use tilde
notation, what would I write?

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.381
As log n.

00:31:15.381 --> 00:31:15.880
Yeah.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.047
So this means that h
of n is tilde log of n.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.080
Now this is such an
important function

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.640
that people have gone
to a lot of extra work--

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.810
which we can't do in this
class-- to really nail down

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.260
the value-- get it much closer.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:40.560
And in fact it's now known
that it's the natural log of n

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:49.360
plus 1 over 2n plus 1 over
12n squared plus epsilon of n

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:58.080
over 120n to the
fourth where for all n

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.730
epsilon n is between 0 and 1.

00:32:04.661 --> 00:32:05.160
Oop.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.230
And I left one piece out.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.990
Actually there's a constant
term in here-- delta--

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.230
that's called Euler's constant.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:21.630
Delta is called
Euler's constant,

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:32.131
and equals 0.577215664
and some other stuff.

00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:33.630
And in fact to this
day people don't

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.760
know if this constant is
rational or irrational.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.200
But they know it to a
lot of decimal places.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:48.250
So basically H n is the log of n
plus some fixed value between 0

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.110
and 1-- as we knew
it had to be--

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.120
plus even some tail
terms here that

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.630
get very small as n gets large.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:56.130
All right.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:00.070
So say I wanted to using
this greedy strategy.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:04.750
How many blocks I would need
to get a block 100 blocks out

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.700
over the end of the table.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.300
So I want to go 100 blocks out.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:13.880
How many blocks do I need
using this strategy, roughly?

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.390
What is it?

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.190
I think somebody said it.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:30.020
So I want to get r 1 to be 100.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:36.070
So I need the harmonic
number to be 200.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:40.401
And what does this tell me
about n to get this to be 200?

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.100
e to the 200.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.600
All right.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.030
So you're going to
need an exponential

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.350
in 200 number of blocks, which
now we're past the stars,

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.340
all right, to get that many.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:54.840
All right.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.480
Now we won't prove it in class,
but this strategy-- the TA

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.710
greedy strategy-- is optimal.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:07.660
There is no way to get a block
farther out over the edge.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.080
That said, there is a
second way to get there.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.380
And in the second way, the top
block is not the optimal block.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.196
In the second way, it's the
second block that goes out.

00:34:18.196 --> 00:34:19.529
So it looks something like that.

00:34:19.529 --> 00:34:21.730
So there's a
counterweight on it.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.320
And in the text, when
you read chapter nine,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.699
you will see the proof
that shows that there's

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.000
two solutions that are optimal.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.666
One's a greedy, and
one's this other one

00:34:30.666 --> 00:34:33.599
that sort of is mostly the
greedy, except the top couple

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:34.810
of blocks are different.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.150
And it proves that's optimal.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.790
We won't cover that in class.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.830
Now actually in the
literature today people

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.900
have been studying how
far a block can go out

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.310
if you're allowed to do more
than one block per level,

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.870
like one of the
students wanted to do.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.429
So if you're allowed
to have multiple blocks

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:57.460
on the same level, it turns
out you can get much farther

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.900
out with n blocks.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.400
And right now it's known
that it's something like n

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.830
to the third is how
far you can get out,

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.310
which is much better
than log of n.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.950
And so mathematicians have
been studying that problem.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:15.420
Any questions about
the block stacking?

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.331
OK.

00:35:19.331 --> 00:35:19.830
All right.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:24.130
So that's basically it for sums.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:27.190
I do want to spend a little
time talking about products.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.340
And that may get us back
into sums pretty quick.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:37.690
The most famous product
out there is n factorial.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.900
And once we get to
counting and probability,

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.410
probably every
lecture we're going

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:45.530
to be looking at n factorial
one way or another.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.595
Just comes up all the time.

00:35:48.595 --> 00:35:54.610
n factorial is the product
of i equals 1 to n of i.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:36:02.530
It's the product of the first
n natural numbers after zero.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.280
Now we'd like to be able to
get a closed-form expression

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.600
for this, because factorial
is really not closed form,

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.870
because it's hiding this thing.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:15.040
And if I ask you how big is
n factorial, sort of hard

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:19.560
to say how big it is,
how fast it grows.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.970
Any ideas about how we might
go about doing a product to get

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.676
a closed-form expression?

00:36:26.676 --> 00:36:28.634
AUDIENCE: If you take a
logarithm of a product,

00:36:28.634 --> 00:36:29.770
you get a sum.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:31.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, good.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.341
Take the log of it.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:43.980
Well, let's write that out--
1 times 2 times 3 to n.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:47.470
That equals the log of
1 plus the log of 2.

00:36:50.347 --> 00:36:50.847
Whoops.

00:36:53.441 --> 00:36:53.940
All right.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.420
So I've now got a sum.

00:37:01.005 --> 00:37:05.150
And now that I've got a sum
we can use all the tools

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.650
we had for sums.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.750
So really, products
look hairy, but they're

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.399
no different than sums.

00:37:11.399 --> 00:37:13.190
Because we're going to
get an approximation

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:15.640
or get an answer for
[? login ?] n factorial.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.660
Then we'll exponentiate it,
and we'll have the answer.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.160
All right.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.540
So we're looking at this sum.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:26.200
And so how do I get a
closed form for that?

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.010
Turns out nobody
knows the closed form.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:35.100
But we do know a method that
approximates it very well,

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.470
which is the integration bounce.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:43.450
Only in this case, it's
an increasing function.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:44.320
So let's do that.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:05.960
OK.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.930
So let's do that.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.760
And the formula is easy.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.770
It's basically the same
formula we had there--

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:30.740
that the sum i equals
1 to n of f of i

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:34.996
is at most the n'th
term plus the integral.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:42.590
And it's at least the first
term plus the integral.

00:38:47.006 --> 00:38:47.760
All right.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.165
Now in this case f
of i is the log of i.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:39:03.300
And so we need to compute
the integral of log of x.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.060
And that's easy.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:11.950
That's x ln of x minus
x evaluated at n and 1.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:15.641
And that's just n
log of n minus n.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:23.250
If I plug in 1, I get a 0 here,
and I'm subtracting negative 1

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.901
there.

00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:26.400
All right.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.633
And so now we'll just plug
this into the integral

00:39:30.633 --> 00:39:31.674
and we'll get our bounce.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.700
So f of 1.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.370
What is f of 1 in this case?

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.980
Yeah, 0.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:52.140
Plus n ln n minus
n plus 1 less than

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:59.580
equal to log of n factorial,
less than or equal to f of n

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.770
is log of n.

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.340
OK.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.690
So to get bounds on
n factorial, we just

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.770
exponentiate both sides.

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:18.300
So I take e to this,
gives me-- well, that's

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:23.205
going to give n to the n here.

00:40:23.205 --> 00:40:24.080
And this is negative.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.822
That'll be e to the n minus 1.

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:34.170
And here I've got n plus
1 times the log of n.

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:38.680
So it's n to the n plus
1 over the same thing--

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.710
e to the n minus 1.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.160
So we got very close bounds.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.570
They're within a factor of
n-- which sounds like a lot,

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.450
but compared to how big n
factorial is, not so bad.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:54.205
Pretty good bounds there.

00:40:54.205 --> 00:40:54.705
OK.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:01.570
So n factorial's about n
over e to the n'th power.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:05.180
Now this is so important
that-- even more important

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.060
than harmonic numbers-- people
have gone to a lot of effort

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.970
to get very tight
bounds on n factorial.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:12.386
So let me tell you
what those are.

00:41:19.754 --> 00:41:21.045
It's called Stirling's formula.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:35.650
And that says that n
factorial equals n over e

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:42.230
to the n'th power times the
square root of 2 pi n times

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:54.770
e to the epsilon n where
epsilon n is between 1 over 12n

00:41:54.770 --> 00:42:00.670
plus 1 and 1 over 12n.

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:04.430
So it's epsilon n is
going to 0 as n gets big.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.921
So e to something going
to 0 is going to 1.

00:42:07.921 --> 00:42:08.420
All right.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.000
So another way of
looking at this

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.270
is you could put a
tilde here, all right,

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.490
and ignore that term.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.310
And that's called
Stirling's formula.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:19.670
This is a good thing to
have on your crib sheet

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.110
for the midterm.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:23.040
So very likely
there'll be something

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.700
where you've got to have
some kind of analysis

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:31.370
of n factorial, and to
know how fast it's growing.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.860
Now these bounds you
get here are very tight.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:42.330
For example, 100
factorial is at least 100

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:50.520
over e to 100 times square
root 200 pi, times e to the 1

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.960
over 1,201.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.880
This thing is just really tiny.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:03.080
This thing here is
1.0008329 and something.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.710
And 100 factorial
is lower-bounded

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:15.040
by the same things, only here
it's e to the 1 over 1,200.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:24.100
And that is very close
to 1-- 1.00083368.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.850
So the difference
in these bounds

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:30.770
is a tiny fraction of 1%.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.360
So the bound you get
from Stirling's formula

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.476
is very, very close
to the right answer.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:46.659
Any questions on
Stirling's formula?

00:43:46.659 --> 00:43:47.450
We won't derive it.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.407
You can derive that in
a graduate math class.

00:43:49.407 --> 00:43:50.365
They do that sometimes.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.615
More typically you'll
see it without that e

00:43:55.615 --> 00:43:56.940
to the error term.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.540
And you just see n
factorial written

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:05.930
as tilde, and over e to
the n, square root 2 pi n.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:06.430
All right?

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:10.610
Because that e to the epsilon
n goes to 1 in the limit.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:14.490
So it sort of disappears when
you go to the tilde notation.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.900
And this in fact is
a lower bound on n

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.510
factorial, and very close
to the right answer.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:25.010
Now this is sort of
an amazing formula.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:29.010
I mean who would think that
when you look at n factorial

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:32.640
that the expression
would have e and pi

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.120
in the expression for it?

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:34.930
Maybe e.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:35.640
Maybe.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.330
But what's pi doing
in n factorial?

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:43.410
It's sort of a bizarre thing.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.470
OK.

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:45.660
That's it for products.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.285
We're just going to
do the one example,

00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:50.530
because really any product just
becomes a sum through the log.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:52.590
And that makes it really easy.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.900
Any questions on
sums and products?

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.940
Because I'm going to totally
change gears now and talk

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.760
about more things like tilde.

00:45:05.297 --> 00:45:05.796
OK.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:15.340
So we're going to talk today
and tomorrow in recitation

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.690
about asymptotic notation.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:24.130
It is used all over the
place in computer science.

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:28.810
We've already seen one example,
which is the tilde notation.

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:33.150
And it turns out there's
five more things like that

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.911
which we're going to learn what
they are and how they work.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:46.530
They're used to
explain or describe how

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:50.330
a function grows in the limit.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:54.540
So for example, we had
the tilde notation.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:46:04.680
And we wrote f of x is tilde
g of x if the limit as x goes

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:11.223
to infinity of f over g is 1.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.280
Now the next one--
and most commonly

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.910
used one in computer
science-- is

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:23.200
called the O notation,
or the big O.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.760
And it's written like this.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:31.100
f of x equals O of g of x.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:37.100
And it means that
the limit as x goes

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:40.560
to infinity of the
absolute value of f

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:46.510
of x over g of x
is convergence--

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:48.210
is less than infinity.

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:55.760
So it's finite, and
it can't diverge.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:00.730
The interpretation
is that this function

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:05.860
is up to constant factors
upper-bounded by this one,

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:11.690
that this grows the same rate
or slower than this one grows

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.880
as x gets large.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.450
Because if f was growing a lot
faster than g in the limit,

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:20.520
then the limit would be
the ratio is infinity.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.521
And we're saying
that doesn't happen.

00:47:22.521 --> 00:47:23.020
All right.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.630
I'm not going to do a
lot of examples for this.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.400
In fact, let's go over here.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.544
There's several other ways
you'll see it written.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.460
For example, you'll
see people write

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.270
f of x is less
than or equal to O

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:01.550
of g of x, because the
natural interpretation is

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:05.950
f is not growing faster than
g-- sort of upper-bounded by g.

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:13.060
You'll see people write
f of x is O of g of x.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.440
And the formal math way
that people don't use,

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.590
but it's the
formally correct one,

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:23.750
is f of x is an
element of O of g of x.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:26.890
And the interpretation
there is that O of g of x

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.950
is a set of functions that
don't grow any faster than g.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.810
And f is one of them.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:34.357
You can use any of
these and that's fine.

00:48:34.357 --> 00:48:36.065
People will know what
you mean, and it'll

00:48:36.065 --> 00:48:38.560
be fine for the class.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.060
All right.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:44.513
Let's see some examples, and see
how to prove a big O relation.

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.480
Let f of x be the
function x, and g

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.670
of x be the function x squared.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:59.900
Then in this case
f of x is O of g

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:05.280
of x-- because x doesn't
grow any faster than x

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.940
squared as x gets large.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.510
To prove it, we
take the limit as x

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:18.700
goes to infinity of
x over x squared.

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.040
That is equal to what?

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.920
What is the limit of x over x
squared as x goes to infinity?

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.350
0.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:32.000
And that is less than infinity.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.960
So we proved it.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:40.350
So if you get asked to prove
f is O of g, what you do

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:44.860
is you take the limit of f
over g as x goes to infinity

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.871
and show that it
doesn't diverge.

00:49:47.871 --> 00:49:48.530
All right.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.258
Let's do another example.

00:49:52.258 --> 00:49:55.400
In this case we'll show
that f is not O of g.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.232
x squared is not O of x.

00:50:06.232 --> 00:50:08.360
Of course, x squared
grows faster than x,

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.783
but let's see why not.

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:16.010
Well we take the limit
as x goes to infinity

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:21.130
of x squared over x.

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:23.920
And what is that limit?

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.870
Infinity.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:28.360
And so it can't be true
that it's x squared

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.541
is O of x, because it has
to be less than infinity.

00:50:31.541 --> 00:50:32.296
Yeah?

00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:32.962
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:50:32.962 --> 00:50:33.819
I missed it.

00:50:33.819 --> 00:50:34.360
What's alpha?

00:50:37.227 --> 00:50:38.060
PROFESSOR: Infinity.

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:41.770
Sorry.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:42.050
Infinity.

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.350
There we go.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:43.808
That's important
in the definition.

00:50:43.808 --> 00:50:44.763
Yep.

00:50:44.763 --> 00:50:45.263
Good.

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:49.390
All right.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:52.190
What about this?

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:59.450
Is x squared equal O
of a million times x?

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:05.630
Yes?

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.811
No?

00:51:07.811 --> 00:51:08.560
What do you think?

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.166
This looks pretty darn big.

00:51:14.166 --> 00:51:15.470
AUDIENCE: It's a constant.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.750
PROFESSOR: That a constant.

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:23.670
So in the limit, as x goes
to infinity, this over that

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.541
is infinite.

00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:26.040
All right.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.720
So no.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:32.250
Because the limit of
x goes to infinity

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:40.180
of x squared over 10 to the
sixth x, that equals infinity.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:43.300
So the thing with
this big O notation

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.390
is you just ignore
our constant factors.

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:46.650
They don't do anything.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:47.914
Just forget about them.

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:52.690
What about this?

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:59.828
Is 10 to the sixth x
equal O of x squared?

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:05.010
Yes.

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:06.819
Because you just
ignore the constant.

00:52:06.819 --> 00:52:08.360
That's what the big
O is for, and why

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.810
it's used all the time
in computer science.

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.670
So yes, that's true.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:16.260
The proof is very simple.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:23.280
The limit as x goes to infinity
of 100 x squared-- whoops.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.110
I could even put a square there.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:31.780
10 to the sixth x squared over
x squared is 10 to the sixth.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.080
That's less than infinity.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.380
In fact, I could take
any quadratic polynomial.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:47.410
x squared plus 100x plus 10 to
the seventh is O of x squared.

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:52.140
Because smaller order
terms don't matter.

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:56.880
The limit of this here over
that in that case is 1.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.192
So it's less than
infinity as x gets big.

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.236
All right let's do a few more.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.660
This really is not so hard.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.770
It's a little dull.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.401
But you've got to
know it for later.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:21.960
OK.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.740
I could take classes like
6046, and you'll never

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:28.040
see any constants, because
everything is things like big O

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.040
and the other notation
we'll talk about.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.050
What about this?

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:37.490
X to the 10th equal
O of e to the x.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.175
Is x to the 10 O of e to the x?

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:48.740
Yeah, it is.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:49.870
So this is a theorem.

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:55.240
Proof.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.730
Limit as x goes to infinity.

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:00.680
x to the 10 over e to the x.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.185
That equals 0, which is
certainly less than infinity.

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:06.310
All right.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:08.070
Now the reason this
stuff is useful

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:11.310
when you're doing the
analysis of algorithms

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:13.590
is because when you're
talking about things

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:17.410
like matrix multiplication
algorithms or things like that,

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:20.580
the actual running time
depends on the machine you're

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.950
dealing with-- the machine
characteristics-- details

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.097
in how you count steps
of the algorithm.

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:28.805
For example, doing
matrix multiplication,

00:54:28.805 --> 00:54:33.160
do you count multiply different
than you count plus addition?

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.440
And if you start getting
caught up in all those details

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.880
you lose the important
fact of the algorithm.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.440
For example, matrix
multiplication--

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:47.320
the elementary algorithm takes
order O of n cubed steps.

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.930
And that's the important fact.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:53.070
And it tells you that if you
double the size of the matrix

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:55.960
the running time will increase
by at most a factor of eight

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.890
in the limit as n gets large.

00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:03.300
And so you might write
things like the time

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:08.450
to multiply n by n matrices.

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:16.990
You might call that t of n,
and then state that is O of n

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:19.390
cubed.

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.890
All right.

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:21.970
And you don't have to
worry about what computer

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.470
it's running on,
exactly how you're

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:27.580
counting the details of what
a step is or what time is.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:30.350
The important thing
is that it's growing

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:35.490
at most as a cubic of
the size of the matrices.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:41.730
And so in 6046 and 6006
you will spend lots of time

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:44.040
proving that things
are the running time,

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:50.313
or the size is O of some
function of the input size.

00:55:50.313 --> 00:55:50.812
All right.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.340
Any questions?

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:55.845
Yeah.

00:55:55.845 --> 00:55:56.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:05.484 --> 00:56:06.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:08.580
It gets all dicey if you
do oscillatory things.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.350
And it depends
how you define it.

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:13.360
So we're going to
stay away from that

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.730
and just stick with
this definition.

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:18.280
So if this guy
oscillates-- like f

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.660
is a sine of x,
sine of x is O of x.

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:22.160
All right.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.060
It doesn't have to converge.

00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:27.380
But as long as the ratio
is less than infinity.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.444
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:29.444 --> 00:56:30.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:31.500
Everything you do.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.250
Maybe you'll see sine
functions sometimes.

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:34.708
But everything you
do in algorithms

00:56:34.708 --> 00:56:36.350
is going to be
growing monotonically.

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:36.850
Yeah.

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:40.660
Nothing-- no wacky
stuff in math usually.

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.790
Any other questions?

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:43.555
Yeah.

00:56:43.555 --> 00:56:45.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
sort of comparing

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.890
something that's the same
magnitude that you go off

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:49.784
into infinity.

00:56:49.784 --> 00:56:50.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:52.006
It's upper bounded.

00:56:52.006 --> 00:56:52.880
So it's not the same.

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.296
We'll get to the
same in a minute.

00:56:54.296 --> 00:56:55.310
But it's upper bounded.

00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:58.950
f is upper bounded by g
up to a fixed constant

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:00.820
as you go to infinity.

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:04.949
And all constants get
washed away by O. Yeah.

00:57:04.949 --> 00:57:05.824
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:10.840
PROFESSOR: Ah, why is this true?

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.920
Well technically we'd have
to go back to calculus

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.510
and use L'Hopital's rule
or something like that,

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:20.520
because this function
exponential grows a lot faster

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.370
than x to the tenth.

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:23.620
So L'Hopital's rule is you
take the derivative of this

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:24.900
over the derivative of that.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:27.850
Then you'd have x to the
ninth over e to the x.

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:29.780
You do it nine more times.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:33.150
And you'd get 10
factorial over e to the x.

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:35.000
And that limit is zero.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.150
So that's how you'd actually
do it using L'Hopital's rule.

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:40.240
Yep.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.420
Any polynomial grows slower
than any exponential.

00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:46.090
All right.

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:50.940
Let's now do some examples
that can get you screwed up.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.790
What about this one?

00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:01.311
Is 4 to the x O to 2 to the x?

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.180
Is that true?

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.830
No, it's not true.

00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:13.710
I mean, the mistake
you might make

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:16.940
is say, oh, 4 and 2,
4 is only double 2.

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:18.750
Big O wipes out
constant factors.

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:20.360
So the answer is yes.

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.740
That would be bad.

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.770
Better to look at the limit.

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:27.760
So we'll state the correct
theorem-- 4 to the x

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.970
is not O of 2 to the x.

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:35.590
And the proof is obtained
by looking at the limit

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:40.060
as x goes to infinity of 4
to the x over 2 to the x.

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.660
That is just the limit 4
to the x over 2 to the x

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.000
is 2 to the x.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.730
That's infinity.

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:49.556
So the limit is not bounded.

00:58:49.556 --> 00:58:50.510
All right?

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:53.701
So it is not big O there.

00:58:53.701 --> 00:58:54.380
All right.

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.060
Here is one.

00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:00.270
Is 10 O of 1?

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:08.790
I've purposely
written it this way.

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:10.940
Yes, it is.

00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:13.770
And in fact the
interpretation here

00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:15.570
is that you've got
some function f

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:18.310
of x that's just
always equal to 10,

00:59:18.310 --> 00:59:22.550
and some function g of x
that's always equal to 1.

00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:26.070
And then it is true in this
case that f of x is O of g of x.

00:59:28.851 --> 00:59:29.350
All right.

00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:36.020
But any constant function is O
of any other constant function.

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.690
We're going to revisit
this in a nastier

00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:40.895
scenario in a little bit.

00:59:40.895 --> 00:59:41.395
OK.

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:50.670
Sometimes you'll see
notation like this.

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:53.890
H of n-- in fact, we
saw this earlier--

00:59:53.890 --> 01:00:00.770
is the log of n plus
delta plus O of 1 over n.

01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:04.310
When we wrote out the formula
for the n'th harmonic number,

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:08.260
it was log of n plus
Euler's constant plus

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.200
something like 1 over n,
constant times 1 over n.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.750
And then some even
smaller terms.

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.390
And so people will
write it like this.

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:19.840
And it tells you that the
error terms grow no faster

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.260
than a constant times 1 over n.

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.400
Technically this is the
wrong way to write it.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.260
But everybody does
it, so you can too.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.320
What it means is this.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.881
H of n minus ln of n minus
delta is O of 1 over n.

01:00:36.881 --> 01:00:37.380
All right.

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:40.050
That's the correct
way to write it,

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:43.790
because you're taking the
ratio of this over that.

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:45.540
This is how people will do it.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.040
All right.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.260
So just make sure you
understand that, what it means

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:52.070
when you put it over there.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.150
Same thing with tilde notation.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:01:00.230
People will write this-- H of
n is tilde ln of n plus Euler's

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:01.360
constant.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.360
The right way to write it
is Hn minus Euler's constant

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.720
is tilde ln of n.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.190
Now can anybody tell me
why this is really not

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:14.570
a good thing to do?

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.320
And you think of how
things get really

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.996
screwed up if you allow
to start doing this?

01:01:20.996 --> 01:01:22.370
Can you think of
anything that--?

01:01:25.489 --> 01:01:26.280
What if I did this?

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.093
Is this true?

01:01:31.431 --> 01:01:31.930
10.

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:37.400
The n'th harmonic
is harmonic number

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.180
is tilde of log of n plus 10.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:41.760
Is that true?

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.050
Think about that.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.247
People are shaking their heads.

01:01:48.247 --> 01:01:49.330
I mean how can it be true?

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:51.090
Because we know this is.

01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:53.700
We know that's what it is.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.730
In fact, this is true.

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:59.000
I can even make it a million.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.470
10 to the sixth here.

01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:02.530
It's true.

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:08.560
Because the ratio of this over
that in the limit is what?

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.360
1.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.091
And that's all I need for tilde.

01:02:16.091 --> 01:02:16.590
All right.

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:21.730
So when I wrote this,
everybody knew what I meant.

01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:24.960
But I could write this and be
just as true mathematically.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.640
And so you've got to be
sort of careful about this.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.840
Really, the right
way to do it is this,

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.880
because now we're
taking off that term,

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.820
and then it's-- actually
I did this wrong.

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:34.860
I should've put the [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.200
Whoops.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.408
I should've done it this way.

01:02:36.408 --> 01:02:37.490
Let me rewrite that.

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:40.710
The right way to do it is
H of n-- yeah-- is this.

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:42.560
You put the small
term out over here.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.740
That's the right way.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.380
Because now it's not true
that it's 10 to the sixth out

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:52.050
here-- all right-- for the
ratio of that over this guy.

01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:52.550
All right.

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:53.740
So you can do it.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.750
But be careful,
because you might

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.790
write wrong things
that technically

01:02:57.790 --> 01:02:59.400
would fit the definition.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.040
Same thing with big
O. Same problem there.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.365
Any questions about that?

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.080
All right.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.580
All right.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:17.780
Now one thing that people do all
the time that you cannot do is

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.132
to use big O as a lower bound.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.370
All right.

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.710
So that's one abuse that we
won't-- you'll get marked wrong

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:31.380
for doing that, even though
famous researchers will do it,

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.754
and you'll probably even have
a professor do it sometime.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.760
So you may not do this.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.270
f of x is bigger than
or equal to O of g of x.

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:45.123
That is meaningless.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.440
Because the whole point of big
O is that it's an upper bound.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.230
So you can't use it
as a lower bound.

01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:58.670
And the reason
you can't do it is

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:03.820
because there is another symbol
to do what you want to do.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:07.960
And that's called
the omega symbol.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.495
And it's written like this.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:15.810
It's a capital omega.

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:24.020
And it's if the limit as x goes
to infinity of f of x over g

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:28.640
of x is greater than zero.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.210
OK.

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:31.500
So now we're getting
the lower bound version.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:37.355
In fact it's just the
opposite of big O.

01:04:37.355 --> 01:04:39.080
In fact, we'll state a theorem.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.060
Not hard to prove.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:41.800
We won't do it.

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:50.210
f of x equals O of g of
x if and only if g of x

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:54.120
equals big omega of f of x.

01:04:57.370 --> 01:05:01.280
In other words, f
grows no faster than g

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.590
if and only if g grows
at least as fast as f.

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:07.640
One's an upper bound one.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.010
One's a lower bound.

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:11.430
And you've just got to use
the symbol the right way.

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.070
Now you can do this.

01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:19.620
You can write f of x bigger
than or equal to omega g of x.

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.750
That's OK.

01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:22.250
All right?

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.130
That's all right to do.

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:24.630
All right.

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:25.588
Let's do some examples.

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:36.360
So x squared is omega of x,
because it grows faster than x.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.910
2 to the x is
omega of x squared.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.960
All right.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:06.260
x over 100 is omega
of 100x plus 25,

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.580
because constants don't matter.

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.970
x over 100 grows
at least as fast

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:14.940
as 100x does in terms, because
we're measuring the growth.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.670
So constants go away.

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:20.830
If you want to say the
running time of that algorithm

01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:25.590
is at least quadratic,
you would write T of n

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:28.502
is omega n squared.

01:06:28.502 --> 01:06:29.190
All right.

01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:33.310
And that says that the running
time is at least n squared.

01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:37.570
Any questions on big omega?

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:42.380
Not too hard once you have
big O. It's just the opposite.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:46.890
All right the next
symbol is the version

01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:49.020
of equality, where you're
bigger-- at least as big

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.240
as, and at most as big as.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:55.180
There's a special
symbol for that.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.585
So in that case we use theta.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.210
And we say that f
of x equals theta

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:15.130
of g of x if the limit
is both bigger than 0

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:19.280
and less than infinity.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:19.780
All right.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:24.400
So it's just a shorthand way
of saying big O and big omega.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.400
That's what theta means.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.720
It just both hold true.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.220
All right.

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.430
And that's a theorem which
is not hard to prove,

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:32.990
but we won't do it.

01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:41.280
f of x equals theta of g
of x if and only f of the x

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:49.770
equals O of g of x and f
of x equals omega g of x.

01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:53.650
All right.

01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:55.845
So let's do some
examples of theta.

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:18.680
So for example, 10x cubed
minus 20x plus 1 is more easily

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.340
written as theta of x cubed--
because the constants don't

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:24.840
matter.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.319
The low order
terms don't matter.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.859
What about this?

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:34.460
Is x over log of x,
is that theta of x?

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.760
x over log of x.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.500
Is that theta of x?

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:44.979
People are nodding their heads.

01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:46.880
Hmm.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.750
Let's see.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.319
Let's check.

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:57.560
The limit as x goes to
infinity of x over log

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.660
of x divided by x.

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:02.920
Well, the x's cancel.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:11.240
That's the limit as x goes to
infinity of 1 over log of x.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.399
What's that?

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.460
0.

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.640
Uh-oh.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.830
it is not theta.

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:22.300
I got to be bigger than zero.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:27.880
In fact, this grows
more slowly than that--

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.250
strictly more slowly.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:31.930
All right.

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:36.020
A little more slowly,
but strictly more slowly.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:36.520
All right.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.729
If I use for an
algorithm, if you

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:43.680
want to say the algorithm runs
in quadratic time-- namely

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.100
at least quadratic time, and
at most quadratic time-- then

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:51.166
you'd say t of n is
theta of n squared.

01:09:51.166 --> 01:09:52.292
So let me write that.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:10:04.560
So t of n equals theta
n squared means t grows

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:14.094
quadratically in n-- both
upper and lower bound.

01:10:14.094 --> 01:10:15.056
OK?

01:10:15.056 --> 01:10:27.690
So for these three guys,
to summarize-- sort of you

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:39.070
can keep track of them pretty
simply-- O means less than

01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:40.030
or equal.

01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:43.572
Omega means greater
than or equal.

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:47.198
Theta means equal up
to constant factors.

01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:59.000
Now there's two
more symbols here.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.622
And they correspond very
naturally to this set-up.

01:11:03.622 --> 01:11:05.830
What two symbols are missing
from here that would you

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:08.650
naturally add to here?

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:09.150
Yeah.

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:11.130
Less than and greater than.

01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:15.620
So less than is little o.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:19.430
Greater than is little omega.

01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:24.710
And less than means it's less
than or equal, but not equal.

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:28.276
And this means greater
than or equal, not equal.

01:11:28.276 --> 01:11:30.150
And let me put them up
over here and give you

01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:31.108
the formal definitions.

01:11:34.852 --> 01:11:35.352
Eraser.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:52.740
OK.

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.120
So little o.

01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:04.280
as we have f of x
equals little o of g

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:18.310
x if the limit of f of
x over g of x equals 0.

01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:20.810
So f is growing
strictly smaller than g,

01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:24.680
so that when I take the
ratio, the limit goes to 0.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.477
And the reverse is little omega.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:35.880
And we say that f of x is
little omega-- whoops--

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:42.770
of g of x if this is infinity.

01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:46.430
Because now f is growing
strictly faster than g,

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:51.110
so I take the limit of the
ratio, and it goes to infinity.

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:55.394
All right so we can do
some simple examples.

01:12:55.394 --> 01:12:57.310
Then we're almost done
with all this notation.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.680
What about this one?

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.709
x over ln of x-- we just
looked at it-- and x.

01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:18.176
What symbol do I put there?

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.870
What symbol's missing here?

01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:26.060
Little o.

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.890
This grows strictly
smaller than that.

01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:31.390
If I took the ratio, and I
took the limit, we got 0.

01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:33.510
So that's a little o.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:35.810
OK.

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:37.340
Is this true?

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.427
x over 100-- is
that little o of x?

01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:46.410
No.

01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:48.520
The limit of the
ratio is 1 over 100.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.590
That's bigger than 0.

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:51.270
Constants don't matter.

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.770
All right.

01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:54.530
So what symbol would go here?

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:56.060
Theta goes here.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:56.960
Good.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.310
Also big O and big omega.

01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:01.311
But theta captures everything.

01:14:01.311 --> 01:14:01.810
All right.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:03.990
What symbol goes here?

01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:08.330
x squared equals something x.

01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:11.660
What symbol goes there?

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.635
Little omega.

01:14:12.635 --> 01:14:14.260
It would also be true
to put big omega,

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.320
but little omega tells you more.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:21.021
Because the limit of x squared
over x goes to infinity.

01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:21.520
OK.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.760
Any questions
about these things?

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.690
So a natural thing on the
midterm is we do some of that,

01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:29.710
for example.

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:30.410
All right?

01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:33.040
And you'll certainly see
some of that on homework.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.520
You might see some
of that on the test.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.690
You'll certainly see all
this stuff-- little omega

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:41.020
not very often in 6046 and
later algorithms courses.

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:43.970
But all the rest
you'll see there.

01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:46.230
Any questions?

01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:46.860
All right.

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.760
Now I'm going to
show you something

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.020
that is sort of scary.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:52.562
Yeah.

01:14:52.562 --> 01:14:53.978
AUDIENCE: Why do
you say that it's

01:14:53.978 --> 01:14:55.671
equal to zero when
you said it's less

01:14:55.671 --> 01:15:01.450
than [INAUDIBLE] equals sign.

01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:02.820
PROFESSOR: Which equals?

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:05.580
AUDIENCE: You said little
omega is less than.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:08.296
PROFESSOR: Little omega,
it corresponds to a greater

01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:11.650
than, which means a
greater than or equal to,

01:15:11.650 --> 01:15:14.840
but not an equal to.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.510
And the way we can see that
is looking at the definitions

01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:25.705
here in the greater than or
equal to is the big omega.

01:15:25.705 --> 01:15:31.850
And that just says
you're bigger than 0.

01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:32.350
Ah.

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:33.280
Let's see.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.350
All right.

01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:37.680
So I'm bigger than
or equal to is omega.

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.970
But I'm not equal
to, which is theta.

01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:46.940
So if I know that I'm
this but not that,

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.460
the only conclusion is that
I'm infinity in the ratio.

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:51.960
All right?

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.890
So that's another
way of saying it.

01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:55.940
That's why.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:56.922
Any other questions?

01:16:00.090 --> 01:16:00.590
All right.

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:02.048
Now I'm going to
show you something

01:16:02.048 --> 01:16:05.420
that is commonly done, and
that many students will attempt

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.137
to do after seeing
this notation,

01:16:07.137 --> 01:16:08.720
because the notation
is pretty simple.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.428
Take your limits.

01:16:09.428 --> 01:16:10.900
Everything goes fine.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.290
Then you start
cruising along with it.

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:15.490
So now I'm going to show
you how to prove something

01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:21.770
that's false using this notation
in a way that people often do.

01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:26.700
And the hope is by showing
you, you won't do it.

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:31.090
It will confuse you,
which is why sometimes we

01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:32.480
worry about showing you.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:48.420
But let f of i-- f of n-- equal
the sum i equals 1 to n of i.

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:51.600
Now we all know
what that is, right?

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.700
All right.

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:59.456
So I'm going to prove to
you that f of n is O of n.

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:06.460
Now what really-- what
should be here instead of n?

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:07.980
n squared.

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.090
So n squared can't be O of n.

01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:12.000
So this can't be true.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:12.500
All right.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.130
Well let's see how we do it.

01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:18.070
All right.

01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:31.280
So the false proof
is by induction on n.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:39.820
My induction hypothesis is p
of n is going to be that f of n

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:41.910
is O of n.

01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:42.410
All right?

01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:45.020
That's what we, when we want to
prove something by induction,

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.480
typically that's what you do.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.365
Becomes the
induction hypothesis.

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:50.531
Let's look at the base case.

01:17:54.690 --> 01:18:03.012
Well f of 1 is 1, and
1 is O of 1 surely.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:03.850
Right?

01:18:03.850 --> 01:18:06.990
Even 10 was O of 1.

01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.490
OK.

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:19.920
All right.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.426
Now we do the inductive step.

01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:36.405
We assume p n is true to
prove that p n plus 1 is true.

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:46.850
Well p n means that
f of n is O of n.

01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:49.980
Now I look at f of n plus 1.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:53.630
That equals the sum of
the first n plus 1 number.

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:59.640
So that will be f
of n plus n plus 1.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:04.000
The induction hypothesis
says this is O of n.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.620
Clearly this is O of n.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.830
Well I got O of n plus O of n.

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.385
That's at most twice O of n.

01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:18.630
And constants don't matter.

01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:20.121
So that's O of n.

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:26.520
All right.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.680
This should begin
to cause panic.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.900
Is induction wrong?

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.520
What's going on with the big O?

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:37.350
You will see this
done all the time.

01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:40.990
People would do this
kind of an argument.

01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:44.430
Looks pretty good, right?

01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:48.356
Can anybody see where
I got off track?

01:19:48.356 --> 01:19:49.980
This is a really hard
one to figure out

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:51.310
where things went wrong.

01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:52.254
Yeah?

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:53.906
AUDIENCE: One of them
might be that you

01:19:53.906 --> 01:20:00.458
might be applying O of n
to numbers which really you

01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:05.040
really apply asymptotic
notation to functions.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.390
PROFESSOR: Great.

01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:08.060
That's a great observation.

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.700
Asymptotic notation only
works for functions.

01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:15.460
Now here when we
say 1 is O of 1,

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:19.600
well, you could think of it as
f of x being 1-- the function--

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:20.240
and so forth.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.480
So that's OK.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.730
That's a great point.

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:26.999
Now let's figure out using
that how we got in trouble.

01:20:26.999 --> 01:20:28.040
We're not quite done yet.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.670
That's a great observation.

01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:32.160
But where's the
step that's wrong?

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:36.590
Oh, no.

01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:38.750
2 times O of n is O of n.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:43.190
If I have a function that's f
is O of g, twice f is O of g.

01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:44.078
Yeah?

01:20:44.078 --> 01:20:47.752
AUDIENCE: It's the end of
n equals 1 [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:47.752 --> 01:20:48.460
PROFESSOR: Is it?

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:50.371
So what's the problem now?

01:20:50.371 --> 01:20:52.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:56.100
PROFESSOR: Well f of n plus
1-- this statement is true,

01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:03.400
because f of n plus 1 is the sum
of i equals 1 to n plus 1 of i.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.360
That's 1 plus 2 plus
n plus n plus 1.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.630
And this is f of n.

01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:11.532
So that's OK.

01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:19.970
Yeah.

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:24.404
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that function.

01:21:24.404 --> 01:21:25.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:28.820
You know, you're getting closer.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:32.740
Yeah that's a little
flaky, because I've just

01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:34.950
got a single value
saying it's O of one.

01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:38.120
But we sort of argued
before that 10 was O of 1.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.762
Now realize a function
behind here that matters.

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:41.970
So you're on the right trail.

01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:44.160
But there's an even
bigger whopper hiding.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:44.984
Yeah.

01:21:44.984 --> 01:21:46.159
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:46.159 --> 01:21:46.950
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.

01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:51.130
This is really, really bad.

01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:52.520
All right.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.770
So now explain to me why this
is really bad what I did here.

01:21:56.770 --> 01:21:59.904
AUDIENCE: You didn't need
the function [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:59.904 --> 01:22:00.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:02.840
And why isn't-- this
looks like a function.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:03.938
Why isn't it a function?

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.740
It's not.

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.450
But it looks like one.

01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:10.760
f of n sure looks like one.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:14.128
Why is it not a function when
it's sitting in this thing?

01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:19.730
This P of n, right?

01:22:19.730 --> 01:22:23.350
Because I've fixed
the value of n here.

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:25.870
And so this is
now just a scalar.

01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:34.020
In fact, you know, I could state
the following-- f of a million,

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:38.930
right, is O of 1, because
this is really some function H

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:41.930
of x that always is this value.

01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:44.470
So the difference between
a scalar and a function.

01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:47.710
And this is just so nasty
looking, because we see f of n.

01:22:47.710 --> 01:22:49.140
That's a function.

01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:54.991
But you can never use
big O in a predicate,

01:22:54.991 --> 01:22:56.990
all right, because we've
lost the function here.

01:22:56.990 --> 01:23:00.690
This is just f
valued at n period.

01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:03.430
That single instance is
all that's happened here.

01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:05.910
It's not a function anymore.

01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:06.790
All right.

01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:09.480
If we had f n of x or
something, that might be OK.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.540
But there's no function left.

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:12.040
All right.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:17.670
So never ever use asymptotic
notation with inductive proofs,

01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:20.240
because you will
just invariably stick

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.150
big O into your predicate.

01:23:23.150 --> 01:23:27.190
And you could prove all sorts of
false things once you do that.

01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:29.590
OK?

01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:30.150
All right.

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:33.400
Never use asymptotic notation
in induction or predicates.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.950
Thanks.
