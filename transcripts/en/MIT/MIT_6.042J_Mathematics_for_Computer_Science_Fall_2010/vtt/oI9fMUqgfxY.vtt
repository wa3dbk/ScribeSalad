00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:25.280
PROFESSOR: Last time
we defined the expected

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.030
value of a random variable.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.570
And we talked about a lot of
ways it could be computed.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.090
We proved all sorts of
equivalent definitions.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.730
Today, we're going to keep
talking about expectation.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.970
And we're going to start
with an example that

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.030
talks about the expected
number of events

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.770
that you expect to have occur.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.200
And it's a
generalization of what

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.946
we did with Chinese appetizer
and hat check from last time.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:52.910
We're going to call
this theorem 1.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:06.360
If you have a
probability space, s,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.860
and you've got a
collection of n events,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:20.310
let's call them A1 through
A n, and these are just

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:31.750
subsets of s, then the expected
number of events to occur,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:47.375
of these events, is simply
the sum of i equals 1 to n

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:52.610
of the probability of
the i-th event occurring.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.380
So you just sum up
the probabilities

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.250
that the events occur.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.400
And that tells you
the expected number

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.185
of events that will occur.

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.320
So a very simple formula.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.730
So for example, A i
might be the event

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.829
if the i-th man gets the
right hat back from last time.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.570
Or it could be the event
if the i-th person gets

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.140
the right appetizer back
at the Chinese restaurant

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.320
after we spin the
wheel in the center.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.890
So we're going to prove this.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.677
And the proof is very similar
to what we did last time when

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.510
we figured out the
expected number of people

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.350
to get the right hat back.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.810
In particular, we're going
to start by setting up

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.160
an indicator variable, T sub
i, that tells us whether or not

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.610
the i-th event, A sub i occurs.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:50.400
So we define T sub i-- and it's
a function of a sample point--

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.650
to be 1 if the sample
point is in the i-th event,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.310
meaning the i-th event
occurs, and 0 otherwise.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.220
And this is just
another way of saying

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.910
that T sub i is 1 if and only
if A sub i happens or occurs.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.970
Now what we care about is the
number of events that occur.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.550
And we get that just by
summing up the T sub i.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:33.805
So we'll let T be
T1 plus T2 plus T n.

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:36.220
And that'll count because
we'll get a 1 every time

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.060
an event occurs.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.260
By adding those up,
we'll get the number

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.570
of events that occur.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.070
All right.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.210
Now we care about
the expected value

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.760
of T, the expected number
of events to occur.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.870
And I claim that's just
the sum i equals 1 to n

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.200
of the expected value of T i.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.110
Why is that true?

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.740
Why is the expected value of T
the sum of the expected values

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.440
of the T sub i?

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.610
Linearity of expectations.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.910
Now did we need the T sub i's to
be independent events for that?

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.970
No.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:17.884
OK, very good.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.180
Now the expected value of T
i is really easy to evaluate.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.220
It's just a 0, 1 variable.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.130
So it's just the
probability that T i is 1

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.800
because it's 1 times this plus
0 times the probability of 0,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.470
and that cancels out.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.440
And the event that
T i equals 1 is just

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:53.530
the situation where the i-th
event occurs because T i equals

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.090
1 is the case that A i occurs.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.770
That's what it is.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.770
So we've shown that the expected
number of events to occur

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.070
is simply the sum
of the probabilities

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.620
that the events occur.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.630
So a very simple
formula, very handy.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.630
And you don't need
independence for that.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.020
Any questions about that?

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.210
We're going to use that
theorem a lot today.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.445
As a simple example, suppose
we flip n fair coins.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.640
And we let A i be the event
that the i-th coin is heads.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.590
And suppose we want to know
the expected number of heads

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.640
in the n flips.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.530
Well, we can use this theorem.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.954
The expected number
of heads is just

00:05:51.954 --> 00:05:53.620
going to be the sum
of the probabilities

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.930
that each coin is a heads.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.960
So let's do that.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.300
T is the number of heads.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.460
We want to know the
expected value of T.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.810
And from theorem
one, that's just

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.070
the probability the first coin
is heads plus the probability

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.700
the second coin is heads.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.070
And the same out to the
probability the n-th coin

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.700
is heads.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.690
What's the probability
the first coin is heads?

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.620
And 1/2.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.614
The probability the second
coin is heads is a 1/2.

00:06:29.614 --> 00:06:31.530
The probability the last
coin is heads is 1/2.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.740
And so the expected number of
heads-- we add up 1/2 n times--

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.798
is just n/2.

00:06:41.798 --> 00:06:43.470
Of course, you all knew that.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.800
If you flip n fair coins,
the expected number of heads

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.900
is half of them.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.770
But that's a very
simple way to prove it.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.290
Did we need the coin
tosses to be mutually

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.720
independent to conclude that?

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.050
No.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.140
I could've glued them
together in some weird way.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.740
In fact, I could have glued
some face up and some face down

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.920
and done weird
things, and you still

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.060
expect n/2 heads even if
they were glued together

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.480
in strange ways.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.490
Because I don't
need independence

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.610
for linearity of
expectation to prove this.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.242
Now that's the easy
way to evaluate

00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:25.450
the expected number of heads.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.920
There is a hard way to do it.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.790
Let me set that up.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.630
We could start from
the definition,

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:38.040
a different definition, namely,
that the expected value of T

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.140
is the sum from i equals 0 to n.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.300
i times the probability
that you have i heads.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.670
This would be a
natural way to compute

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.260
the expected number of heads.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.050
You add up the
case where there's

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.390
zero heads times the
probability of 0,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.600
1 times the probability
of one head, 2 times

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.096
probably two heads,
and so forth.

00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:02.220
That's one of the first
definitions of expectation.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.555
So let's keep trying to do this.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.402
What is the probability
of getting i heads?

00:08:12.402 --> 00:08:13.860
And now I'm going
to have to assume

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.530
mutual independence actually.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.360
Now I'm going to need
mutual independence.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.439
So already, this
method isn't as good

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:21.980
because I had to
make that assumption

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.524
to answer this question.

00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:25.940
If you don't make
that assumption,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.420
you can't answer that question.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.040
What's the probability of
getting i heads out of n.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.745
Yeah?

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:36.700
AUDIENCE: s to the n-th
power times n [INAUDIBLE] i.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.789
PROFESSOR: Yes, because if
you look at the sample space,

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:45.110
there are 2 to the n sample
points all equally likely.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.310
They're all probability
2 the minus n.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.590
And there's n choose i of
them that have i heads.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.570
And now you'd have to
evaluate that sum which

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.520
is sort of a pain.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.320
That one won't come
to mind readily.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.940
So you might say I reached
sort of a dead end here.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.910
But in fact, the answer
is easy to use, easy

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.330
to get using this method.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.580
In fact, we've actually
proved an identity here

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.440
because we know
the answer is n/2.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.360
We've just proved that
this messy thing is n/2.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.930
In fact, you can multiply
by 2 to the n here.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.840
We have proved, using
probability theory and theorem

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:39.660
1 over there, the sum of
i n choose i equals n 2

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.770
to the n minus 1.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.370
Just multiply by 2 to
the n on each side.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.700
So we've given a
probability based

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:55.040
proof of this identity which is
sort of hard to do otherwise,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.630
could be harder to do.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.640
Any questions about that?

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.570
So again, if it comes time for
a homework problem or a test

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.950
problem, if it
naturally divides up

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.030
in this way where you can
take a random variable when

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.750
you got a computer's expectation
to make it a sum of indicator

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.760
variables, if that is a natural
thing to do, do it that way.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.370
Because it's so much
easier than trying

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.770
to go from the
definition because you

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.430
might encounter
nasty things like

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.290
that that you got to evaluate.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.840
So in this case,
we flipped n coins.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.050
We expect n/2 heads.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.650
In the hat check, in
Chinese appetizer problems--

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.620
we had n hats or n
appetizers-- we expected

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.490
to get one back to the right
person-- so a smaller expected

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.150
value.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.890
For some problems, the
expected value is even less.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.550
The expected number of events
to occur is less than 1.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.130
In fact, it might
be much less than 1.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.980
Now in those cases it turns
out that the expected value

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.710
is an upper bound
on the probability

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.280
that one or more events occur.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.910
We're going to state
this as theorem 2.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:22.190
The probability that at
least one event occurs

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.570
is always upper bounded by
the expected number of events

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.450
to occur.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.090
Now this theorem
is pretty useless

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.220
if the expected number of
events to occur is bigger than 1

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.230
because all probabilities
are at most 1.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.190
But if the expected
number of events to occur

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.080
is small, something
much less than 1,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.100
this is a pretty useful bound.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.025
So let's prove that.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.710
The expected value of
T-- and in this case

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.200
we'll use one of the definitions
we have of expected value,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.710
name of the one
where you sum from i

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:01.056
equals 1 to infinity
of the probability T

00:12:01.056 --> 00:12:04.210
is greater than or equal to i.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.951
Now what did we have to know
about T to use that definition?

00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:11.240
That doesn't work for
all random variables

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:19.650
T. What condition do I have on
T to be able to use this one?

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.770
Anybody remember?

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:21.289
Yeah.

00:12:21.289 --> 00:12:23.330
AUDIENCE: Must be defined
on the natural numbers?

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.371
PROFESSOR: T must defined
on the natural numbers.

00:12:25.371 --> 00:12:28.890
If it is, I can use this
very simple definition.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.260
And is T defined on the
natural numbers here?

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.560
Is the range of T
natural numbers?

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.920
Well, I'm counting the number
of events that occurred.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.575
Could be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:12:39.575 --> 00:12:40.700
Has to be a natural number.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.240
So it's OK.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.300
So I can use this definition.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.860
Now this is summing up
probability T is at least 1

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.680
plus probability T is
at least 2 and so forth.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.960
I'm just going to
use the first term.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.425
This is at least the
size of the first term

00:12:56.425 --> 00:12:58.050
because probabilities
are non-negative.

00:13:00.349 --> 00:13:02.890
So I'm just going to throw away
all the terms after the first

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.400
and conclude that this is
at least the probability T

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.000
is bigger than or equal to 1.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.882
And I'm done.

00:13:08.882 --> 00:13:10.090
I just look at it in reverse.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.680
The probability of at
least one event occurring

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.480
is at most the expected value.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.850
Very simple.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.620
There's a very quick
corollary here.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.140
The probability
at least one event

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:31.045
occurs is at most the sum of
the probabilities of the events.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.260
And the proof there is
just plugging in theorem 1.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.920
Because the expected value is
the sum of the probabilities.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.460
So we just plug-in theorem
1 for the expected value

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.710
because it's just that.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.900
Any questions about the proof?

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.670
Very simple.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.530
Now this theorem is very
useful in situations

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.100
where you're trying
to upper bound

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.400
the probability of some kind
of disaster or something

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.160
bad happening.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.210
For example, suppose
you want to compute

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.570
the probability that a
nuclear plant melts down.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.405
Now actually, the
government does this.

00:14:19.405 --> 00:14:20.780
They got to figure
this thing out

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.488
because if it's a high
probability, well,

00:14:22.488 --> 00:14:24.810
we're not going to allow
anybody to build them.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:29.250
And the way they do it is they
convene a panel of experts.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.160
They get some people from
various good universities

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.950
and they bring them
down to Washington.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.940
And they have them
figure out every way

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.450
they can think of that
a meltdown could occur,

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.800
every possible event that
would lead to a meltdown.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.470
And then they'd have them
figure out the probability

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.600
for each one of those events.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.240
For example, A1
could be the event

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.180
that the operator goes
crazy and makes it meltdown.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.150
A2 could be the event that an
earthquake hits and the cooling

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.340
pipes are ruptured, and
then you got a meltdown.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.800
A3 is the event that terrorists
shoot their way in and cause

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.577
a meltdown.

00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:11.410
So you've got a lot of
possibilities for how

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.730
the thing can melt down.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.000
And then they compute
the probabilities.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.260
And then they add them up
just using this result.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.120
And they say, well,
the probability

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.510
that a meltdown-causing
event or one or more occurs

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.270
is at most this small number.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.510
And hopefully it's small.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:37.530
So for example, suppose there's
100 ways that a meltdown could

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.730
occur, 100 things that
could cause a meltdown.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.350
And each one happens with
probability one in a million.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.710
What can you say
about the probability

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:49.690
that a meltdown occurs?

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.820
You got a hundred ways
it could happen only.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.902
Each is a one in
a million chance.

00:15:58.902 --> 00:16:00.610
What's the probability
a meltdown occurs?

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.940
1 in 10,000 because you're
adding up one in a million

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.940
100 times.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.000
n is 100.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.300
Each of these is
one in a million.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.630
So you get 100 over a million.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.880
There's 1 in 10,000.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.570
And so then they
publish a report that

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.500
says the chance of this reactor
melting down is 1 in 10,000.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.969
Now what if I've
got 100 reactors?

00:16:24.969 --> 00:16:27.260
What's the chance that at
least one of them melts down?

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.020
1 in 100 because I got 100
over 10,000-- same theorem.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.065
So there's a 1 in 100 chance
something melts down somewhere,

00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:40.657
at most.

00:16:40.657 --> 00:16:42.490
Hopefully, the numbers
are better than that.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.870
Same thing if you bought
100 lottery tickets, each

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.270
a one in a million
chance, you got a 1

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.780
in 10,000 chance of
winning, at most.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:59.980
So simple fact but powerful
and used a lot in practice.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.080
And this is sort of
the good case when

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.010
the expected number of
events that are bad to happen

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.569
is small, like a
lot less than 1.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:15.760
But what if the expected number
of events to happen is big.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.819
Say it's 10.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.020
Say this government
panel gets together

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.030
and they add up all
the probabilities

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.530
and it comes out to be 10.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.260
Well, it doesn't sound so
good if that's the case.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.880
But is it necessarily bad?

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.000
Does it necessarily
mean that you're

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.160
going to have a meltdown.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.810
So for example,
let's say there's

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.590
1,000 ways you could melt down.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:43.350
And let's say that the
probability of each one

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.860
is 1 in 100.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.710
So the expected number of
things that could happen

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.400
to cause a meltdown is 10.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.120
Am I guaranteed we're
going to melt down?

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.710
No.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.680
Can anybody think
of a way where it's

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.720
unlikely we're
going to melt down

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.280
but respect these values
here, hypothetically?

00:18:12.282 --> 00:18:13.740
Is there any chance
that it's still

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.906
unlikely to have a meltdown?

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.150
We're going to think of a way?

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.800
Yeah.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.591
AUDIENCE: They all
happen at the same time.

00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:24.800
PROFESSOR: They all
happen at the same time.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.565
Now the examples I gave you--
the terrorists, the earthquake,

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:31.470
and the crazy operator--
put that on the side.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.490
If they all happen together,
when any one happens,

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.360
the others have to happen.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.380
So we can express
that as for all ij,

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.750
probability of the
i-th event happening

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:51.440
given the j-th event happening
is one, so total dependence.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.060
What's the probability of a
meltdown in that scenario?

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.350
What's the probability one of
those meltdown-inducing events

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.850
occurs?

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.332
They all happen at once.

00:19:07.332 --> 00:19:08.320
AUDIENCE: 1 in 100.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:15.142
PROFESSOR: 1 in 100.

00:19:15.142 --> 00:19:17.600
Because it's the same as the
probability of the first event

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.180
happening which, by
definition, was 1 in 100.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.400
So it could be that the
probability of a meltdown

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.520
is small.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.270
But it might not be as well.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.405
There's no way,
given this, to know.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.940
What if I chain-- in fact,
this is like Chinese appetizer,

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.140
right?

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:45.040
If one person gets their
appetizer back, everybody does.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.009
So there are circumstances
where you have

00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:48.300
the total dependence like that.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.760
Let's say I change a little bit
and I don't do this scenario.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.760
In fact, say I
tell you the events

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:02.850
are mutually independent,
but you expect 10 to occur.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.210
Do you sleep at night now?

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.470
Of course, 1% is still
a pretty high number.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.690
But how many people think that
if they're mutually independent

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.630
and you expect 10
that, no matter what,

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.931
there's a least a 50%
chance of a meltdown?

00:20:20.931 --> 00:20:21.430
Anybody?

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.290
OK.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:32.840
In fact, if you expect 10 and
they're mutually independent,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.260
a meltdown is a
virtual certainty.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:41.890
The chance you don't melt
down is less than 1 in 22,000.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.270
For sure something
will occur that's bad.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:50.472
And this is a theorem
that we call Murphy's law.

00:20:50.472 --> 00:20:52.555
And Murphy's law, probably
you've all heard of it,

00:20:52.555 --> 00:20:53.920
it says-- it's a famous saying.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.679
If something can go
wrong, it will go wrong.

00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:58.720
And we're going to see
why that's true, at least,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.900
in our circumstances here.

00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:15.170
That's a pretty
powerful theorem.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:49.380
If you have mutually independent
events A1 through A n, then

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:55.300
the probability that none
of them occur, t equals 0,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:00.190
is upper bounded by e to the
minus expected number of events

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.980
to occur.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:09.430
So if I expect 10 to occur,
the chance that none do

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.660
is upper bounded by e to the
minus 10, which is very small,

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:21.640
which means almost surely one of
the events or more will occur.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.110
And that's bad
news in this case.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.800
So let's prove that.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.690
Well, the probability
that t equals 0

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:39.150
is the same as the probability
that A1 does not occur

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:44.890
and A2 does not occur and all
the way to A n does not occur.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.700
And I claim this
[INAUDIBLE] is the product

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.300
of the probabilities
they don't occur.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.110
So I'm taking the
product i equals 1 to n

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:01.240
of the probability that
A i does not occur.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.670
Now why can I make that step?

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:06.350
Yeah.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.270
Independence.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.670
This is the product rule
for independent events.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.560
Now the probability
that A i does not occur

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.255
is simply 1 minus the
probability it does occur.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.620
And now I'm going to
use a simple fact, which

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.840
is that for any
number x, 1 minus x

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.367
is at most e to the minus x.

00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:48.700
Just a simple fact from algebra.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.980
So I've got 1 minus-- I'm
going to treat this as the x.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:24:03.180
So this is at most e to the
minus probability of A i

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.710
using that fact.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.820
And now I'll take the
product and put it

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.130
into a sum in the exponent.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.450
And then some of the
probabilities of the events

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.190
is just the expected value.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.390
That was theorem 1
that I just erased.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.720
So this is e to the minus
expected number of events

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.650
to occur.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.220
So not too hard a proof.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.190
We had to use that fact.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.000
But that gets the
expected number of events

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.080
to occur in the exponent.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:51.010
So a simple corollary
is the case when

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:52.890
we expect 10 events to occur.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:19.040
So if we expect 10 or more
mutually independent events

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:35.870
to occur, the probability
that no event occurs

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:41.020
is at most e to the minus
10, which is less than 1

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.490
over 22,000.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:50.490
Now there's not even any
dependence on n here.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.740
It had nothing to do with a
number of possible events,

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.460
just that if you expect
10 of them to occur,

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.910
you're pretty sure
one of them will.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:04.270
And this explains why you
see weird coincidences.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.880
Or people sometimes see what
they think are miracles.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.720
Because out in the
real world, there's

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.360
billions of possible weird
things that could happen.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.450
You just can create all
sorts of crazy possibilities.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.230
And each one might be
one in a billion chance

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.800
of actually happening.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.970
But you got billions
that could've.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.710
And if they're all
mutually independent--

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.870
because you made up all these
different things-- than you

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.940
expect some of them to happen.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.110
And so you should--
in fact, you're

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.470
going to know that for sure
some of those weird things

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.545
are going to happen.

00:26:43.545 --> 00:26:45.720
At least the chance that
no weird thing happens

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.500
is 1 in 22,000.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.846
And so this can be why
somebody will go along

00:26:50.846 --> 00:26:52.710
and say, oh my goodness.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.650
You won't believe what
happened, a coincidence.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:57.880
And it's like, wow, the
chance of that happening

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.380
was one in a billion.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.046
It must've been a miracle or an
act of God that this happened.

00:27:04.046 --> 00:27:06.420
But you're not thinking about
the other 10 billion things

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.250
that didn't happen.

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.050
So for sure some of those
things are going to happen.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:17.080
It's not likely that I'm going
to win megabucks next week.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.310
But somebody's going to win.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.860
If enough people play
and it's more than 1

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.852
over the probability
that you're going to win,

00:27:24.852 --> 00:27:26.310
than it's very
likely somebody will

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.010
win if everybody is
guessing randomly.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.110
Any questions about
what we're doing?

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.110
So this is amazingly powerful,
this result. In fact,

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.040
it's so powerful that
it's going to let me read

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.860
somebody's mind in the class.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.980
We're going to do a
little card trick here.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.647
Now the way this
card trick works--

00:27:51.647 --> 00:27:52.730
it's a little complicated.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.410
I'm going to need a
volunteer, probably one of you

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:55.390
guys down front.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.480
We'll get you.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.410
And one of your buddies is going
to keep you honest for me here.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:01.962
I'm going to reveal--
first I'm going

00:28:01.962 --> 00:28:03.129
to let you shuffle the deck.

00:28:03.129 --> 00:28:05.170
So go ahead and shuffle
it, do whatever you want.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.040
It's a normal deck.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.760
It's got 52 cards
and two jokers.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.970
And I don't care what
order they're in.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:16.410
I'm going to turn over
the cards one at a time.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:21.110
Now I'm going to ask you to
pick a number from 1 to 9

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.200
ahead of time.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.530
Don't tell me or anybody else.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.550
In fact, I'm going to want
you guys to play along too.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:31.120
And we're going to see
where we all end up here.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.110
And that's your starting number.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.360
And as I turn over the
cards one at a time--

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.630
say you started with a 3 was
the number you had in mind--

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:44.100
on the third card I show,
that becomes your card.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.865
You don't tell me or jump
up and down or anything.

00:28:46.865 --> 00:28:47.740
But that's your card.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.650
And say it's a 4 of diamonds.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.110
Now a 4 replaces the
three in your mind

00:28:55.110 --> 00:29:00.130
and you count 4 more cards,
then that becomes your card.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:04.350
Now let's say that's a jack or
a face card or a 10 or a joker.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.840
10, face card, and
jokers all count as 1

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.730
just like an ace counts as 1.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.940
And so then the next
card would be your card

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.540
because you count 1.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.510
And we keep on going until you
have a card, maybe it's a 7.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.230
But there's only four
cards left in the deck.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.760
And so you don't get a new one.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.390
And your last card is the 7.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:29.300
And then you're going to write
that down here, not showing me.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.510
And you're going to
do this, maybe do this

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.610
with a friend over there.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.030
And you're going to make sure
you count right on the deck

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.571
because if you screw
up the counting,

00:29:37.571 --> 00:29:40.800
it's going to be hard
for me to read your mind.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.965
So just to make sure we
all understand this, let

00:29:42.965 --> 00:29:45.423
me write the rules down here
because I want the whole class

00:29:45.423 --> 00:29:49.270
to pick a number from 1 to
9 and play the same game.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.565
And we're going to
see what happens.

00:29:53.565 --> 00:29:55.190
So let me show you
the rules again just

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.648
to make sure
everybody understands.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.260
So say the deck
starts out like this.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.760
I got a 4, a 5.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.890
So my first few cards of
the deck go like this.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.410
10 equals a 1.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.630
Then I got a queen equals a 1.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.024
3, 7, 6, 4, 2.

00:30:16.024 --> 00:30:16.940
Say it's a small deck.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.740
I'm going to use 54 cards.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:26.420
And say you're chosen number to
start, you start with a three.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:34.640
As I show the cards, you're
going to count 1, 2, 3.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.650
That becomes your new card.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.340
Then you're going to count 1, 2.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.430
That becomes your card.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:42.220
It's a 10, so you
convert it to a 1

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.390
because we're only doing
single digit numbers.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:46.760
Go to 1, that becomes your card.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.910
Queen converts to a 1.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.520
You go 1, that
becomes your card.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.320
3, 1, 2, 3.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.730
That becomes your card.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:31:00.240
And you can't get 4, so you
remember the final card.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.230
Does everybody understand
what you're supposed to do?

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.410
Because we're going to
do 54 cards of this.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.859
Maybe we get the TAs
to play along here.

00:31:08.859 --> 00:31:11.150
And as you do it, maybe you
want to talk to your buddy,

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.940
make sure you got
it worked out there.

00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:18.200
And if I could read
your mind maybe

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.510
we'll have a gift
certificate or something.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.330
So you shuffle the deck?

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.350
Got it good?

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.880
All right.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.213
So I'm going to start revealing
the cards one at a time.

00:31:27.213 --> 00:31:30.190
So you guys play along
quietly in your mind.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.100
And we'll see if we can
concentrate long enough.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.700
Aces are 1.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:00.693
Jacks are 1.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:19.550
10's are 1.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:28.380
10's are 1.

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:12.840
We're halfway done.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.650
Jokers are 1.

00:35:28.471 --> 00:35:28.970
OK.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.070
That's the last card.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.111
So remember the last
one that was yours.

00:35:32.111 --> 00:35:33.735
And you got to go
check with your buddy

00:35:33.735 --> 00:35:38.592
to make sure you guys agree
on the counting there.

00:35:38.592 --> 00:35:39.550
And then write it down.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.040
Don't tell me because I'm
going to read your mind.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:47.990
I'm going to tell you.

00:35:53.312 --> 00:35:54.020
This is not good.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.690
They're arguing
over the last card.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:00.980
I'll have to read
one of your minds.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.480
What's that?

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.286
The 11 of clubs.

00:36:02.286 --> 00:36:03.410
That's hard one to predict.

00:36:12.976 --> 00:36:14.600
Make your best guess
and write it down.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.183
Don't tell me.

00:36:15.183 --> 00:36:16.152
Write it down.

00:36:16.152 --> 00:36:16.652
You got two?

00:36:16.652 --> 00:36:17.568
Well, write them both.

00:36:17.568 --> 00:36:18.780
I'll predict one of them.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.704
I've never had a
dispute on what the--

00:36:32.704 --> 00:36:34.620
because if you started
with the same position,

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.870
you've got to wind up
in the same position.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:38.244
You wrote it down?

00:36:38.244 --> 00:36:39.910
Now think about your
number really hard.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:40.690
We'll take yours.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:41.370
I'll trust you there.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.870
Think about it
really hard because I

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:46.230
need the brain waves to come
over and read the mind here.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.559
I'm getting a really strong
signal on the last card.

00:36:55.559 --> 00:36:56.350
Maybe I don't know.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.183
Maybe it's something--
it's really powerful.

00:36:58.183 --> 00:37:00.941
I'm going to say it's
the queen of hearts.

00:37:00.941 --> 00:37:02.861
Is that right?

00:37:02.861 --> 00:37:05.360
Both were the queen of-- oh,
you were trying to screw me up,

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.080
mess with me.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.066
So you both got the
queen of hearts.

00:37:09.066 --> 00:37:09.820
Oh, you did.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.030
So how many people got
the queen of hearts?

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.530
Oh wow.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:18.200
How many people did not
get the queen of hearts.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:18.700
Somebody.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.680
OK.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.490
Now there's a chance
you did it legitimately.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:26.030
But usually, with
a deck, we're all

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.329
going to get the same last card.

00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:30.620
Now in this case, it happened
to be the very last card.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.880
That is typically not the case.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.660
So very good.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.670
So I read your mind.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.670
So you guys get the
gift certificates here.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:39.170
Very good.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:42.220
One for you and
your sponsor there.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:47.300
So it's clear how I read
his mind because I got

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.350
the same number everybody did.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.630
And somehow it doesn't
matter where we started.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.322
We all had the same
card at the end.

00:37:55.322 --> 00:37:58.150
How is that possible?

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.874
There's nine different
starting points.

00:38:00.874 --> 00:38:02.790
Why don't we wind up in
nine different places?

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.460
And why isn't there
a one in nine chance

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.420
that I guess his card?

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.829
Why do we all wind
up in the same place?

00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:11.370
Any thoughts?

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:12.806
Yeah?

00:38:12.806 --> 00:38:13.972
AUDIENCE: Get the same card.

00:38:13.972 --> 00:38:16.525
After that you stay [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:16.525 --> 00:38:17.525
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:38:17.525 --> 00:38:20.960
If ever we had the
same card, then we're

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.910
going to track forever and
finish in the same card.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.710
But why should we ever
get the same card?

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:29.605
What are the chances of that,
that we land on the same card?

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.810
Why don't we just keep
missing each other?

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.410
It's a 1 in 9
chance or something.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.247
I don't know.

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:37.330
Why don't we keep missing?

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:39.420
AUDIENCE: It seems like
there are enough low cards

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.130
that you just move slowly
along and, eventually, you're

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.524
going to intersect.

00:38:43.524 --> 00:38:44.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:47.060
I did make a lot
of 1's in the deck.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.460
If I would've made
all these face

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.360
cards be 10's, the chances of
my reading your mind go down.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.300
Why do they go down?

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.300
What does it have to do?

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:00.320
Why did I put a lot
of 1's in the deck?

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.770
AUDIENCE: It goes on longer.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:02.728
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:39:02.728 --> 00:39:04.520
AUDIENCE: The game
goes on longer?

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.978
PROFESSOR: The game
goes on longer.

00:39:05.978 --> 00:39:09.180
So there's more chances
to hit together.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.630
Because at any given time--
you've got your card.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:13.250
I've got mine.

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:17.590
If mine is behind you, I
got a chance to land on you.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.170
And if you're behind
me in the deck,

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.146
you've got a chance to land
on me with your number.

00:39:22.146 --> 00:39:23.770
And if the numbers
are smaller, there's

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.190
more chances to
land on each other.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.010
And it is true that
on any given chance,

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:33.300
the chances are low that
we land on the same card.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.990
But there's a lot of chances.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.610
And if there's a
lot more chances

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.720
than the probability of
landing on each other,

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.580
we've got Murphy's law.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:49.600
If you've got a lot of chances
and they're not less likely

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.690
than the number of chances
or the inverse of that,

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:53.880
then we expect to have
a certain bunch of times

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.050
that we're going to
land on each other.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:59.970
And therefore, a very
high probability we do.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.240
Now that was a little hand-wavy.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.210
And in fact, there's a
reason it was hand-wavy.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:13.510
Why doesn't Murphy's law
really apply in this case,

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.711
really mathematically apply?

00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:15.210
Yeah.

00:40:18.399 --> 00:40:20.190
AUDIENCE: They're not
mutually independent.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.940
Once you draw one card,
it's not coming back.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.240
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.640
And it means that the knowledge
that we haven't collided yet

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.670
tells me something about the
cards we've seen-- not a lot,

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.670
but something maybe.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.080
And it's a finite
deck which tells me

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.180
something about the
cards that are coming.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.840
And it might influence
the probability

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.710
that we land together,
the next person

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.390
who's jumping on the deck.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:48.870
And so the events of-- like
for example, in this case,

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:54.930
we let A i be the event of a
collision on the i-th jump.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:58.000
And there's about 20 jumps in
this game, 10 for each of us

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.500
expected.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:06.935
So A i is the event that we
collide on the i-th jump.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:15.710
These events are not necessarily
mutually independent.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:19.900
Now if I had an
infinite deck or a deck

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.360
with replacement so every card
is equally likely to come next

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.230
no matter what's
come in the past,

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.630
now you can start getting
some mutual independence here.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.880
And then you could start
really applying the theorem.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.730
Now in this case, you don't
expect 10 things to happen.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.190
You expect a few.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:38.945
But that's good enough
that, in fact-- so

00:41:38.945 --> 00:41:40.990
we did a computer
simulation once

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:44.300
and I got about a 90%
chance that we'll all

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.970
be on the same card.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.640
So I have a pretty good chance
that I'm going to guess right.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.410
And so far, I haven't
guessed wrong.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.670
But it will happen
some day that we'll

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.180
start with a different
first number,

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.450
and we will miss at
the end because they'll

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.954
be two possible outcomes.

00:41:59.954 --> 00:42:01.620
Just the way it works
out with 52 cards.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.320
Now of course, if
we have more cards

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.020
or I made more things be
1's instead of 9's, say,

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.290
my odds go up because the
number of events I've got,

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.970
the number of chances
to collide, increases.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:17.920
And the chance of hitting
when I jump also increases.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.860
Any questions on that game?

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:28.090
So the point of all this is
that if the expected number

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:31.730
of events to occur
is small, then

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.400
it's an upper bound
on the probability

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:38.550
that something happens, whether
they're independent or not.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:42.310
If the expected number of events
to occur is bigger than 1,

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:46.390
large, and if the events
are mutually independent,

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.140
then you can be sure
one of those events

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.260
is going to occur-- very, very
likely one of them will occur.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.690
And that's Murphy's law.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:57.670
Any questions about
numbers of events to occur?

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:05.010
We'll talk more about the
probability in the numbers

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.055
of events that occur next time.

00:43:09.055 --> 00:43:10.430
Before we do that,
I want to talk

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.725
about some more useful
facts about expectation.

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.020
Now we know from
linearity of expectation

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.330
that the expected value of
a sum of random variables

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:30.550
is the sum of the expected
values of the random variables.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:34.600
Now we're going to look at the
expected value of a product

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.660
of random variables.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.965
And it turns out there's
a very nice rule for that.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:46.845
Theorem 4, and it's the
product rule for expectation.

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:57.000
And it says that for-- if
your random variables are

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:09.140
independent, R1 and
R2 are independent,

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.855
then the expected value
of their product, also

00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:17.510
a random variable, is simply the
product of the expected values.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:23.650
So it's sort of the
equivalent thing

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.672
to linearity of expectation,
except we're doing products.

00:44:26.672 --> 00:44:27.755
And you need independence.

00:44:31.781 --> 00:44:34.280
Now the proof of this is not
too hard, and it's in the book.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.061
So we're not going
to do it in class.

00:44:37.061 --> 00:44:38.185
But we can give an example.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:52.820
Say we roll two six-sided
fair and independent dice.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.130
And I want to know what's the
expected product of the dice.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:18.720
So we're going to let R1 be
the value on the first die,

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.355
and R2 would be the
value on the second one.

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:31.670
And the expected
value of the product

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:33.320
is the product of
the expectations.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:43.160
And we already know the expected
value of a single die is 7/2.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:49.260
So we get 7/2 times 7/2
is 49/4 or 12 and 1/4.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:55.400
So it's easy to compute the
expected product of two dice.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.200
Any questions about that?

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:06.200
Much easier than looking at all
36 outcomes to use this rule.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:11.350
Now what if the dice we're
rigged, glued together somehow

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.790
so they always came up the same?

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.540
Would the expected
product B 12 and 1/4 then?

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.610
No?

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:24.460
Why not?

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.060
Why wouldn't it be the case?

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.890
Why isn't the
expected value of R1

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:37.060
squared the square of
the expected value of R1?

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.174
Isn't that what this says?

00:46:40.174 --> 00:46:41.150
AUDIENCE: Independent.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:42.730
PROFESSOR: They're
not independent.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:47.120
R1 is not independent of R1
In fact, it's the same thing.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.490
And you need independence
for that to be the case.

00:46:50.490 --> 00:47:02.140
So a non example, the
expected value of R1 times R1

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:07.950
is the expected
value of R1 squared.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.210
And to do that, we got
to go back to the basics.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:12.805
We're taking the six
possible values of R1.

00:47:12.805 --> 00:47:15.400
i equals 1 to 6.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.550
i squared, because
we're squaring it,

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.060
times the probability
R1 equals i.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.020
And each of those
probabilities is 1/6.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:36.470
So we get 1/6 times 1 plus 4
plus 9 plus 16 plus 25 plus 36.

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:42.250
And if you add all that
up you get 15 and 1/6,

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:50.180
which is not 3 and 1/2
squared, which is the expected

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:54.340
value of R1 squared.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.660
So the expected
value of the square

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:01.150
is not necessarily the
square of the expectation.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.774
Because a random variable
is not independent of itself

00:48:03.774 --> 00:48:04.273
generally.

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:08.190
OK.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.270
Any questions there?

00:48:12.492 --> 00:48:14.075
There's a couple of
quick corollaries.

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:21.590
The first is you take
this rule and apply it

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:26.067
to many random variables as long
as they're mutually dependent.

00:48:26.067 --> 00:48:40.580
So if R1 R2 out to R n
are mutually independent,

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:48.620
then the expected
value of their product

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.510
is the product of
the expected values.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.620
And the proof is just by
induction on the number

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.550
of random variables.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.439
So that's pretty easy.

00:49:06.439 --> 00:49:07.730
There's another easy corollary.

00:49:11.718 --> 00:49:19.670
And that says, for any
constants, constant values,

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:28.150
a and b, and any
random variable R,

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:35.460
the expected value of a times
R plus b is simply a times

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.760
the expected value of R plus b.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.860
And the reason that's
true-- well, the sum

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:47.300
works because of linearity
of expectation for the sum.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.030
You can think of b as a random
variable that just always

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:52.950
has the value b.

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:56.862
And the a comes out
in front because you

00:49:56.862 --> 00:49:58.570
can think of it as a
random variable that

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:01.225
always has a value a.

00:50:01.225 --> 00:50:04.240
And that's independent of
any other random variable

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.630
because it never changes.

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.325
So by the product rule,
the a can come out.

00:50:10.325 --> 00:50:11.700
Now you've got to
prove all that.

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.159
But it's not too hard and
not especially interesting.

00:50:14.159 --> 00:50:15.200
So we won't do that here.

00:50:18.372 --> 00:50:19.455
Any questions about those?

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.530
So we've got a
rule for computing

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:32.170
the sum of random variables,
a rule for the product

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.420
of random variables.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:39.350
What about a rule for the
ratio of random variables?

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:40.280
Let's look at that.

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:47.600
So is this the corollary?

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:52.890
In fact, let's take the
inverse of random variable.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:57.690
Is the expected value
of 1/R equal to 1

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:04.510
over the expected value of
R for any random variable R?

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:06.560
Some folks saying yes.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.240
Some saying no.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.350
What do you think?

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:11.445
Is that true?

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:15.790
Oh, got a mix.

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:17.910
How many say yes?

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:19.385
How many say no?

00:51:19.385 --> 00:51:20.500
Oh, more no's.

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.940
Somebody tell me
why that's not true.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.058
Who would like to
give me an example?

00:51:26.058 --> 00:51:31.345
Give us an example there
that'll be very convincing.

00:51:31.345 --> 00:51:33.954
Yeah?

00:51:33.954 --> 00:51:36.370
AUDIENCE: I don't think it's
one that would be immediately

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:41.558
obvious, but I think if R is
the result of the roll of a die,

00:51:41.558 --> 00:51:43.900
I don't think it works out.

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:47.060
PROFESSOR: So it's 50
chance of-- oh, I see.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:53.159
So I take the average of 1/i--
that's sort of hard to compute.

00:51:53.159 --> 00:51:55.200
I got to do [INAUDIBLE]
the sixth harmonic number

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.825
and then invert it.

00:51:56.825 --> 00:52:00.439
There's an easier way to
show that this is false.

00:52:00.439 --> 00:52:00.938
Yeah?

00:52:00.938 --> 00:52:02.869
AUDIENCE: The expected
value equals 0?

00:52:02.869 --> 00:52:03.535
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:52:03.535 --> 00:52:07.330
The expected value
equals 0 which

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:12.520
could happen if R is plus 1
or minus 1 equally likely.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.840
So here's an example here.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:23.640
So R equals 1 with
probability 1/2, and minus 1

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.500
with probability 1/2.

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.835
So the expected value of R is 0.

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:33.370
So that blows up.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:34.625
That's infinity.

00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:36.000
What's the expected
value of 1/R?

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.300
Well, 1/1 and 1 over
minus 1, it's the same.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.300
It equals 0.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.930
And this would say 0 equals 1/0.

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:50.030
That's not true.

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:51.980
So this is false.

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.230
It is not true for
every random variable.

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:00.180
So once you see this example,
just obviously not true.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.010
In fact, there's very
few random variables

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:06.440
for which this is true, even
an indicator random variable.

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:11.290
So it's 1 with probability 1/2
and 0 with probability 1/2.

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:14.950
Then the expected value
of 1/R is infinite.

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:16.790
1 over the expected
value of R is 2.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:24.570
So it's clearly not true.

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:27.066
Let's do another one.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.090
What about this
potential corollary?

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:53.530
Given independent random
variables R and T,

00:53:53.530 --> 00:54:02.570
if the expected value
or R/T is bigger than 1,

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:07.630
then the expected value of R
is bigger than the expected

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:15.970
value of T. And let me even give
you a potential proof of this,

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:18.960
see if you like this proof.

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.270
Well, let's assume the expected
value of R/T is bigger than 1.

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:39.620
And let's multiply both sides
by the expected value of T.

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:42.530
And well, the product rule
says that this is just

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:48.830
the expected value
of R/T times T, which

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:51.990
is just the expected value
of R because the T's cancel.

00:55:02.654 --> 00:55:03.570
So I gave you a proof.

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:09.760
Anybody have any
quibbles with this proof?

00:55:15.172 --> 00:55:15.672
Yeah?

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:20.330
That's a big problem.

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:23.680
R/T is not independent
of T. [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.240
if T is very big, likely
that R/T is small.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.280
So we can't do that step.

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.950
We can't use the independence
here to go from here to here.

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:36.030
That's wrong.

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:39.474
There's actually another
big problem with this proof.

00:55:39.474 --> 00:55:40.640
Anybody see another problem?

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.140
Yeah?

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.880
Yeah.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.840
If the expected value
of T is negative,

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.440
I would end up doing that.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.030
So that step's wrong.

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:53.600
So this is a pretty lousy proof.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.900
Every step is wrong.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.170
So this is not a
good one to use.

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:04.780
And in fact, the
theorem is wrong.

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.100
Not only is the proof wrong,
but the result is wrong.

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.950
It's not true.

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:11.890
And we can see examples.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:13.840
We'll do some
examples in a minute.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.350
Now the amazing thing is that
despite the fact that this

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:21.610
is just blatantly wrong,
it is used all the time

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:23.270
in research papers.

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:26.280
And let me give you
a famous example.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:32.430
This is a case of, actually, a
pretty well-known paper written

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:36.090
by some very famous computer
science professors at Berkeley.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.130
And let me show
you what they did.

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:45.950
And this is so that
you will never do this.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:54.870
They were trying to compare
two instruction sets way back

00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:55.510
in the day.

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:58.750
And they were comparing
the RISC architecture

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:01.740
to something called the Z8002.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.260
And they were
proponents of RISC.

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:07.600
And they were using this to
prove that it was a better way

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:09.290
to do things.

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:14.290
So they had a bunch of benchmark
problems, probably 20 or so

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:14.940
in the paper.

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.520
And I'm not going
to do all 20 here.

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.210
I'm going to give you a flavor
for what the data showed.

00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:27.110
And then they looked at
the code size for RISC

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:32.182
and the other guys, Z8002.

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:33.390
And then they took the ratio.

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:44.720
So the first problem was
called E-string search,

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.440
whatever that is.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.820
But it was some benchmark
problem out there at the time.

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.510
And the code length
on RISC was 150

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:53.450
say-- I've changed these
numbers a little bit

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:54.820
to make them simpler.

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:58.930
Code length here and
the Z8002 is 120.

00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:01.270
The ratio is 0.8.

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:05.020
So for this problem, you're
trying to get low, short code.

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:08.410
So this was a better way
to go to support that.

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:12.640
And they had something
called F-bit test.

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.530
And here you have 120 lines.

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:16.750
Here's 180.

00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:20.260
So in this case, risk is better.

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:26.500
So the ratio of that way
to this way would be 1.5.

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.465
And they had computing
and Ackermann function.

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.260
And that was 150 and 300.

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:39.390
So a big win for
RISC, ratio of 2.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:45.690
And then they had a thing called
recursive sorting problem.

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:47.530
This is a hard problem.

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:50.040
There's 2,800 lines on RISC.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:54.190
1400 on the old way.

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:57.200
Ratio of 0.5.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.400
And there was a bunch more which
I'm not going to go through.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:04.470
But their analysis, what they
did is they took the ratio,

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:06.380
and then they averaged it.

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:12.715
And so when you do this, you get
an average of, well, 2.3, 4.3,

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:19.250
4.8/4 is 1.2.

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:23.890
So the conclusion is that on
average code in this framework

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:27.400
is 20% longer than
the code on RISC.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.100
Therefore, clearly, RISC
is a better way to go.

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.020
Your code on average
will be shorter.

00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:38.080
Using the Z8002 on average,
the code will be 20% longer.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.246
Makes perfect sense, right?

00:59:42.162 --> 00:59:44.840
In fact, this is one of
the most common things

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.133
that is done when people
are comparing two systems.

00:59:50.514 --> 00:59:56.420
Now just one problem with
this approach, and that's

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.840
that it's completely
bogus, completely bogus.

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.820
You cannot conclude--
let's make this conclusion.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:13.090
So their conclusion, they
concluded that Z8002 programs

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:17.905
are 20% longer on average.

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:28.110
Everybody understands
the reasoning why, right?

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:31.875
Take the ratio of all the
test cases, average them up.

01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:33.410
Then you get the average ratio.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.030
Now there could be some
hint why this is bogus.

01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:45.000
If I just looked at--
I took and summed

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.670
these numbers, if I add all
those numbers up, I get 3,220.

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:55.570
And all these, I get 2,000.

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:59.500
RISC code is not looking
shorter if I do that.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.340
Looking longer.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:08.200
But all that gain, all the loss
of RISC is in this one problem.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.960
And maybe it's not
fair to do that.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.537
And that's why when people
have data like this,

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.620
they just take the ratios.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:20.110
Because now it would be-- if
I just took the average code

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:22.290
length and took
the ratio of that,

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:23.950
it's not fair because
one problem just

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:26.409
wiped out the whole thing.

01:01:26.409 --> 01:01:27.700
I might as well not even do it.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.880
And they want every
problem to count equally.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.210
And that's why they
take the ratio,

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:34.840
to make them all count equally.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.330
Let's do one more thing here.

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:44.130
Let's look at what happens
if we take the ratio of RISC

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:47.356
to the Z8002.

01:01:47.356 --> 01:01:48.355
Make some room for that.

01:01:48.355 --> 01:01:54.630
So this is-- this column
is Z8002 over RISC.

01:01:54.630 --> 01:02:00.930
What if I just did this--
RISC over the Z8002 I mean

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:03.754
the answer should come
out to 1/1.2, right?

01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:05.420
That's what we expect,
because I've just

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.820
been turning it upside down.

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:10.490
Well, I get 1.25 here.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:12.100
These are just being inverted.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:14.386
Here I've got 2/3, 0.67.

01:02:14.386 --> 01:02:15.010
Here I get 1/2.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.440
Here I get 2.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.815
Let's add those up.

01:02:23.815 --> 01:02:32.250
I get 1.92, 2.42, 4.42.

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:38.020
Divide by 4-- wow,
I get 1.1 something

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.100
which says, well, that
on average, RISC is

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:44.740
10% longer than the other one.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:50.430
So same analysis says
that RISC programs

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:54.010
are 10% longer on average.

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:00.210
Now the beauty of
this method is you

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:05.410
can make any conclusion you
want seem reasonable, typically.

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:08.590
You could have the
exact same data.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:13.330
And if you want RISC to look
better you do it this way.

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:17.720
If you want RISC to look
worse, you do it that way.

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.540
You see?

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.690
Is that possible?

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:21.470
Is it possible for
one to be 20% longer

01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:24.026
than the other on average,
but the other be 10% longer

01:03:24.026 --> 01:03:24.525
on average?

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.000
How many people think
that's possible?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.440
We had some weird things
happen in this class,

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.650
but that's not possible.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:34.830
That can't happen.

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:36.430
These conclusions
are both bogus.

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:44.210
Now I'm not teaching you
this so that later when

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:46.510
you're doing your PhD thesis
and it's down to the wire

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:49.250
and you need a conclusion
to be proved, good news.

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:51.240
You can prove it.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.957
No matter what your conclusion
is, you can prove it.

01:03:53.957 --> 01:03:55.290
That's not why we're doing this.

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.831
We're doing this so you can spot
the flaw in this whole setup

01:03:58.831 --> 01:04:00.080
and that you'll never do this.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.538
And you'll see it when other
people do because people do it

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:03.190
all the time.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.460
So let's try to put some
formality under this

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.460
in terms of probability.

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.607
Because when you start
talking about averages,

01:04:12.607 --> 01:04:15.190
really think about expectations
of random variables and stuff.

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:19.970
So let's try to view this
as a probability problem

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:22.410
and see if we can shed
some light on what's

01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:25.480
going on here because it
sure seemed reasonable.

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:41.890
So let's let x be the benchmark.

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:45.400
And maybe that'll be
something in the sample space,

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.280
an outcome in the sample space.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:05:00.490
Let's let R x be the code
length for RISC on x and Z x

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:09.340
be the code length for
the other processor on x.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:19.060
And then we'll define a
probability of seeing x.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.560
That's our problem
we're looking at.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:28.290
And typically, you might
assume that it's uniform,

01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:30.790
the distribution there.

01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:33.830
We need this to be able to
define an expected value

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:37.350
for R and for Z.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:42.610
Now what they're doing in the
paper, what really is happening

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:50.230
here, is instead of this, they
have the expected value of Z/R

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:52.160
is 1.2.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.880
That is what they can conclude.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:01.630
That does not mean that
the expected value of Z

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:05.350
is 1.2, the expected
value of R, which

01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:10.200
is what they conclude
that the Z8002 code is

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.430
20% longer than RISC code.

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:14.860
This is true.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.160
That is not implied.

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:21.506
And why not?

01:06:21.506 --> 01:06:26.909
That's just, actually, what
this corollary was doing.

01:06:26.909 --> 01:06:28.450
Really, it's just
what we were-- they

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:33.100
made the same false assumption
as happened in the corollary.

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:37.210
You can't multiply both sides
here by the expected value of R

01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:41.240
and then get the expected value
Z. Of course, if you ask them,

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.066
they would have known that.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:44.440
But they don't
even think through

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.523
that, they just used the
standard method of taking

01:06:46.523 --> 01:06:49.290
the expected value of a ratio.

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:51.220
So this is fair to conclude.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:58.340
But as we saw, the expected
value of R/Z was 1.1.

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.950
So both of these can be
true at the same time.

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:01.960
That's fine.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.420
But you can't make
the conclusions

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.419
that they tried to make.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.470
Here's another-- in
fact, in this case,

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:14.100
if we had a uniform
distribution,

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:21.396
the expected value of R
is like 805 for uniform.

01:07:21.396 --> 01:07:28.990
And the expected
value of Z is 500.

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:31.254
And that's all you
can conclude if you're

01:07:31.254 --> 01:07:32.420
taking uniform distribution.

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:36.310
In which case, of course,
if they're promoting RISC,

01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:39.240
well, you don't like
that conclusion.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.739
So it's better to
get this one's.

01:07:41.739 --> 01:07:43.530
I don't think it was
intentional of course.

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:46.690
But it's nice that
it came out that way.

01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:53.770
Here's another example that
really makes it painfully clear

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:57.060
why you never want to do this.

01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:02.150
So a really simple case, just
generic variables R and Z.

01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:08.550
And I got two problems only--
problem one, problem two.

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:11.020
R is 2 for problem
1, and z is 1.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.768
And they reverse on problem 2.

01:08:15.396 --> 01:08:19.205
Z/R is 2 and 1/2.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.955
R/Z, just the reverse.

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:36.200
Now the expected
value of R/Z here

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.260
is 2 plus 1/2 divided
by 2 is 1 and 1/4.

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:44.359
And what's the
expected value of Z/R?

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:50.859
The average of
these is 1 and 1/4,

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.470
what's the average of these?

01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:54.410
Same thing, 1 and 1/4.

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.830
So never, ever take
averages of ratios

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:02.689
without really knowing
what you're doing.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.470
Any questions?

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:09.960
Yeah.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.640
AUDIENCE: What would be the
word explanation of the expected

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.240
value of Z/R?

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.430
What is that?

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:18.270
PROFESSOR: That is the
average of the ratio.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:25.859
It is not the ratio
of the average.

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:27.744
They are very different things.

01:09:27.744 --> 01:09:29.660
And you can see how you
get caught up in that.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.060
You could see how you have
linearity of expectation,

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.010
you got the product
rule for expectation.

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:39.135
You do not have a rule that
says this implies that.

01:09:39.135 --> 01:09:41.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:42.465
PROFESSOR: Which two?

01:09:42.465 --> 01:09:46.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Z/R?

01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:48.910
PROFESSOR: Well, in
this case, they're one.

01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:50.968
I don't think that'll
be true in general.

01:09:50.968 --> 01:09:53.990
AUDIENCE: Does that
give you information?

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:55.820
PROFESSOR: They give
you information.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:00.020
That may not be the
information you want.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.530
It wouldn't imply
that which is what

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.220
you're after in some sense.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.140
But it gives you
some information.

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.170
It's the expected average ratio.

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:12.700
The problem is the human brain
goes right from there to here.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.450
It's just you do.

01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:17.400
It's hard to help
yourself from doing it.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.510
And it's not true.

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:23.430
That's the problem.

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:26.170
We have a version of this in the
one in the homework questions

01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:27.420
which is true.

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.490
But it's a special
version of it where

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:33.030
you can say something positive.

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:36.020
Any questions about this?

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.180
So anybody ever shows
you an average of ratios,

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:42.120
you want the light to go
off and say, danger, danger.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.682
Think what's happening here.

01:10:44.682 --> 01:10:47.015
Or if you're ever analyzing
data to compare two systems.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.540
So we talked a lot
about expectation, seen

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:56.840
a lot of ways of computing it.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.310
We've done a lot of examples.

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:01.420
For the rest of today
and for next time,

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.180
we're going to talk
about deviations

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.870
from the expected value.

01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:09.830
Now for some random
variables, they

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:11.880
are very likely to
take on values that

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.850
are near their expectation.

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:17.510
For example, if
I flip 100 coins.

01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:20.770
And say they're fair and
mutually independent.

01:11:20.770 --> 01:11:24.389
We know that the expected
number of heads is 50.

01:11:24.389 --> 01:11:25.930
Does anybody remember
the probability

01:11:25.930 --> 01:11:30.990
of getting far from that, namely
having 25 or fewer heads or 75

01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:32.564
or more heads?

01:11:32.564 --> 01:11:33.480
Remember, we did that?

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.760
It was a couple of weeks ago?

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.334
Is it likely to have
25 or fewer heads?

01:11:39.334 --> 01:11:41.000
AUDIENCE: It's less
than 1 in a million?

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.140
PROFESSOR: Less
than 1 in a million.

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:42.400
Yeah.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.450
It was 1 in 5
million or something.

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:45.420
I don't know, some
horribly small number.

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:49.510
So if I flip 100 coins,
I expect to get 50 heads.

01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:52.480
And I'm very likely to
get close to 50 heads.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.080
I'm not going to be 25 off.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.240
And then the example
we had in recitation,

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:02.350
you got a noisy
channel, and you expect

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:06.640
an error rate, 1% of your
10,000 bits to be corrupted.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.830
The chance of
getting 2% corrupted

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:12.210
was like-- what was it, 2 to
the minus 60 or something?

01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:17.710
Extremely unlikely to be
far from the expected value.

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:21.900
But there's other cases where
you are likely-- you could well

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:24.189
be far from the expected value.

01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:25.730
Can anybody remember
an example we've

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:32.510
done where you are almost
surely way off your expected

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:35.700
value for a random variable?

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:39.730
Anybody remember an example
we did that has that feature?

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:41.239
AUDIENCE: The appetizer I think.

01:12:41.239 --> 01:12:42.280
PROFESSOR: The appetizer.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.460
Let's see.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:49.350
Appetizers, you expect 1, but
you're almost certain to be 0.

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:51.290
Or actually, you're
almost certain to be 0,

01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:53.560
and you have a
chance of being n.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.204
So if you count 0
as being close to 1,

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.120
you're likely to be close
to your expectation.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.690
Because you're likely to
be 0, and you expect 1.

01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:04.851
Remember that noisy
channel problem--

01:13:04.851 --> 01:13:06.600
not the noisy channel,
the latency problem

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.330
across the channel?

01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:12.310
And we show that the expected
latency was infinite?

01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:15.580
But 99% of the time you
had 10 milliseconds,

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.770
something like that?

01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:20.020
There's an example where
almost all the time you

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.870
are far from your expectation
which is infinite.

01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:25.380
So there are examples
that go both ways.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:33.570
Now let's look at another
couple of examples

01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:36.700
that'll motivate the
definition that measures this.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.930
I'd say that we've got a simple
Bernoulli random variable where

01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:51.250
the probability that
R is 1,000 is 1/2,

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:58.660
and the probability that
R is minus 1,000 is 1/2.

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:00.660
Then the expected
value of R is 0.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.770
Similarly, we could
have another one, S,

01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:12.540
where the probability
that S equals 1 is 1/2,

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:16.230
and the probability that
S equals minus 1 is 1/2.

01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:18.110
And the expected
value of S is 0.

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:23.240
Now if this was a
betting game and we're

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.470
talking about dollars--
here's where you're

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:28.910
wagering $1,000, fair game.

01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:31.550
Here's where you're wagering $1.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:36.950
Now in this game--
both games are fair.

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:38.980
Expected value is 0.

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:43.070
But here you're likely to end
up near your expected value.

01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:46.130
Here you're certain to be far by
some measure from your expected

01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:47.290
value.

01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:52.740
And in fact, if you were
offered to play a game,

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:56.270
you might have a real decision
as to which game you played.

01:14:56.270 --> 01:15:00.990
If you like risk, you
might play that game.

01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:05.000
If you're risk averse, maybe
you stick with this game

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.180
because what you could
lose would be less.

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:16.770
Now this motivates the
definition of the variance

01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:20.700
because it helps mathematicians
distinguish between these two

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:22.398
cases with a simple statistic.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:44.670
The variance of a
random variable R--

01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:49.170
we'll denote it by
var, V-A-R, of R--

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:54.210
is defined as the expected
value of the random variable

01:15:54.210 --> 01:16:01.250
minus this expected
value squared.

01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:02.950
That's sort of a mouthful there.

01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:04.075
So let's break it down.

01:16:07.285 --> 01:16:11.240
This is the expected value
of R. This is the deviation

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.130
from the expected value.

01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:16.630
So this is the
deviation from the mean.

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:22.770
Then we square it.

01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:31.800
So that equals the
square of the deviation.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.810
And then we take the
expected value of the square.

01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:42.190
So the variance equals
the expected value

01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:46.156
of the square of the deviation.

01:16:50.829 --> 01:16:52.370
In other words, the
variance gives us

01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:55.630
the average of the
squares of the amount

01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:59.662
by which the random variable
deviates from its mean.

01:16:59.662 --> 01:17:04.500
Now the idea behind this is
that if a random variable is

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:08.710
likely to deviate from its
mean, the variance will be high.

01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:10.580
And if it's likely
to be near its mean,

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.180
the variance will be low.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:15.805
And so variance can tell us
something about the expected

01:17:15.805 --> 01:17:16.305
deviation.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.835
So let's compute the
variance for R and S

01:17:26.835 --> 01:17:29.220
and see what happens.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:35.010
So with R minus the
expected value of R, well,

01:17:35.010 --> 01:17:37.670
that is going to be
1,000, because you expect

01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:42.420
the value of 0, with
probability 1/2, and minus 1,000

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:44.770
with probability 1/2.

01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:45.825
Then I square that.

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:58.430
Well, I square 1,000, I get a
million with probability 1/2.

01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:00.700
And I square minus
1,000, I get a million

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:05.340
again with probability 1/2.

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:09.620
And so therefore,
the variance of R,

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.664
well, it's the expected value
of this, which is-- well,

01:18:12.664 --> 01:18:13.580
it's always a million.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:14.610
So it's just a million.

01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:20.160
Big.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:26.140
Now if I were to do this with S,
S minus the expected value of S

01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:31.170
is 1 with probability 1/2,
minus 1 with probability 1/2.

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:39.290
If I square that, well,
I get 1 squared is 1,

01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:42.670
minus 1 squared is 1.

01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:47.280
And so the variance of S is
the expected value of this.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.010
And that's just 1.

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:52.590
So a big difference
in the variance.

01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:55.520
So the variance being different
tells us these random variables

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:58.110
are-- the distributions
are very different even

01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:01.220
though their expected
values are the same.

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.870
And the guy with
big variance says,

01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:06.920
hey, we're likely to
deviate from the mean here.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.720
And so risk averse people
stay away from strategies

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.678
when they're investing
that have high variance.

01:19:18.370 --> 01:19:24.710
Now does anybody have any idea
why we square the deviation?

01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:26.850
Why don't we just-- why
didn't mathematicians

01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:28.890
when they figured out
this stuff I don't know

01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:30.931
how many centuries ago,
why didn't they just take

01:19:30.931 --> 01:19:32.930
the expected deviation?

01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:34.510
Why do the stupid
squaring thing?

01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:37.110
That only is going
to complicate it?

01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:44.250
Why don't we instead
compute the expected value

01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:48.730
of R minus the mean?

01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:51.620
Why didn't they do that
and call that the variance?

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.170
Yeah?

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:54.252
That's zero.

01:19:54.252 --> 01:19:55.490
Yeah.

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:57.210
Because by linearity
of expectation,

01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:59.670
that corollary
[? 4-2 ?] or whatever,

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:03.590
this is just the expected value
of R minus the expected value

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:09.030
of the expected value of R. The
expected value of a scalar is

01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.925
just that scalar.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.270
And that is 0.

01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:20.570
So the expected
deviation from the mean

01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:24.042
is 0 because of how
the mean is defined.

01:20:24.042 --> 01:20:25.750
It's the midpoint,
the weighted midpoint.

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:28.320
The times you're high
cancel out the times you're

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:31.950
low if you got the mean right.

01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:33.820
And so this is a
useless definition.

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:36.150
It's always 0.

01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:40.262
So mathematicians had to do
something to capture this.

01:20:40.262 --> 01:20:42.220
Now what would have been
the more logical thing

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.390
to do that is the next step.

01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:44.910
This doesn't work,
but what would

01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:47.730
you think the mathematicians
would've done?

01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:51.670
Absolute value would have
made a lot of sense here.

01:20:51.670 --> 01:20:54.370
Why they didn't do that?

01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:56.440
Well, you could
do that, but it's

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.960
hard to work with
mathematically.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.470
You can't prove nice
theorems, it turns out.

01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:05.050
If you put the square in there
and make that be the variance,

01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:09.030
you can prove a theorem
about linearity of variance.

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.290
And if the random
variables are independent,

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:14.090
then the variance of the sum
is the sum of the variances.

01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:16.630
And mathematicians like
that kind of thing.

01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:19.640
It makes it easier to work
with and do things with.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.320
Now there are also other
choices like, in fact,

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.120
there's a special name
for a weird case where

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.685
you take the fourth power.

01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:33.360
You could do that.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.690
As long as an even
power, you could do it.

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:39.040
And that's actually
called the kurtosis.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.260
Sounds like a foot disease.

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:44.370
But it's the kurtosis
of the random variable.

01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:46.915
Now we're not going to worry
about that in this class.

01:21:46.915 --> 01:21:50.030
But we are going to
worry about variance.

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.350
And let me do one
more definition,

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:56.560
then we'll talk about
variance a lot more tomorrow.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.480
That square is a bit of a pain.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.310
And to get rid of it, they
made another definition

01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:06.590
after the fact called
the standard deviation.

01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:10.790
And standard deviation
is defined as follows.

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:29.650
For a random variable R,
the standard deviation of R

01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:34.810
is denoted by a sigma
of R. And it's just

01:22:34.810 --> 01:22:38.750
the square root of
the variance, undoing

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:41.650
that nasty square
root after the fact.

01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:45.250
So it turns out to be the
square root of the expectation

01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:48.940
of the deviation squared.

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:52.090
Another name for this
you've probably seen,

01:22:52.090 --> 01:23:02.770
it's the root of the mean of
the square of the deviations.

01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:05.532
And so you get this thing
called root-mean-square,

01:23:05.532 --> 01:23:06.990
which if any of
you ever done curve

01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:08.614
fitting or any of
those kinds of things

01:23:08.614 --> 01:23:12.152
in statistics or whatever, this
is what you're talking about.

01:23:12.152 --> 01:23:14.360
And so that's why that
expression were to come about.

01:23:18.090 --> 01:23:20.780
So for the standard
deviation of R--

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:23.670
what's the standard
deviation of R?

01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:24.597
1,000?

01:23:24.597 --> 01:23:26.180
In effect, that's
pretty close to what

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:28.360
you expect the deviation to be.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.095
What's the standard
deviation of S?

01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:33.450
1.

01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:34.825
Square root of 1
is 1, and that's

01:23:34.825 --> 01:23:37.240
what you expect its
deviation to be.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.210
So we'll do more of this
tomorrow on recitation.
