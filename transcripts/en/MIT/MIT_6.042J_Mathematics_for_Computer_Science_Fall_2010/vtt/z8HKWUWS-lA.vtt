00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.310
PROFESSOR: Last week we talked
about the key components

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.380
of a proof, propositions,
axioms, and logical deductions,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.580
and as you probably talked
about during recitation,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.180
we're not going
to worry too much

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.360
about what axioms or logical
deductions that you use.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.490
Anything that is
reasonable, is fine by us.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.240
We're not going to ask you
to know what modus ponens is,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.420
or to label some law when
you make a logical deduction.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.360
Just, you know, be reasonable.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.860
Any facts you knew coming into
this course about mathematics,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.470
probably close enough
to use as an axiom.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.440
Want to make sure your axioms
are consistent, but that's OK.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.160
Now the exception to this would
be, is say we're on an exam,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.080
and we ask you to prove
some proposition, p.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.730
Well you can't say, I already
knew p, it's an axiom, check.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.550
That's not so good.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.710
We're asking you to
prove it from some more

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.060
elementary facts.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.980
OK it's also don't want me
making wild leaps of faith,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.130
or saying it's obvious that,
unless it really is obvious.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920
That kind of stuff can
get you in trouble.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.470
Much better to sort of explain
the reasoning in the proof.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.480
Now the proofs that we covered
last week in recitation,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.840
the problems set,
were all examples

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.140
of what are called
direct proofs.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.820
You start with some axioms,
you have some theorems

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.100
you knew before or you
proved along the way,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.960
and you make logical
deductions until you

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.960
get to where you want
to go, the theorem.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.980
We're going to start today
with an indirect proof.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.360
For example, a proof
by contradiction.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.320
And this is a little
bit different.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.740
In a proof by contradiction,
you assume the opposite

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.350
of what you're trying to prove.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.570
Then you just take steps
for logical deductions

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.610
forward until you arrive
at a contradiction,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.920
something where you
prove false equals true.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.420
Now if you can ever
get to the point

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.830
we approve something
is false and true,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.750
that means what you assumed
at the start had to be wrong.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.680
Namely, what you're trying
to prove has to be true.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.180
So let's write that
down, because it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.800
can be a little
confusing the first time.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:49.000
So to prove a
proposition p is true,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.060
you will assume that it's false.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.380
In other words,
that not p is true.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:19.630
And then you use that
hypothesis, namely the p

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:27.040
is false, to derive a falsehood.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.590
In other words, you prove
a falsehood is true.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.290
And this is called
deriving a contradiction.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.720
And so it must be that,
in fact, p is not false,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.980
namely that it's true.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.410
Now this works because
if you can prove,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:59.660
if not p implies false is
true, well from last time,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.530
the only way this is a true
statement is if this is false,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.740
namely p is true.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.240
All right?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.520
So we can conclude
that p is true,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.850
if we can show that not
P implies a falsehood.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.779
Any questions about that?

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.860
It's sort of a lot
of sort of notation,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.300
and until you've seen,
it can be confusing.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.970
So maybe we should
do an example.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.005
Let's prove that square
root of 2 is irrational.

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:40.550
Is irrational.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.290
OK, everybody knows what
an irrational number is?

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.090
That's something that
can't be expressed

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.321
as the ratio of integers.

00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:54.820
OK, and probably
most people already

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.300
know that-- how
many people have not

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.780
seen a proof that square root
of 2 is a rational before?

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.820
So most of you have seen
a proof of that, good.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.945
You know, if you try to do
a direct proof for this,

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:06.840
it's pretty hard.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.900
How do you show there's
no way to represent

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.950
the square root of 2 is
as integers a over b?

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.040
But it's very easy, if we
do a proof by contradiction.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.010
Now when you're doing a
proof by contradiction,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.540
always start off by
saying, by contradiction.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.910
Write that down.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.140
And then what you
do next is you say,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:41.690
I'm going to assume, for the
purpose of contradiction,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.350
that p is false and
when not p is true.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.365
In this case, that would be
square root of 2 is rational.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.520
So in this case, here's
what we're trying to prove.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.730
That's p.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.740
I'm going to assume not p,
namely that square root of 2

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.570
is irrational number.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.830
Then I'm going to get a
contradiction or falsehood,

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.540
and then I'm going to know
that p was true after all.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.250
All right, so let's see
where this leads us.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.980
Well, if square root
of 2 is rational

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.850
then we can express it as
a over b, where a over b

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.325
is a fraction in lowest terms.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.415
That means a and b have
no common divisors.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.720
And then I can
square both sides,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.850
and I get two is a
squared over b squared.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.100
Then I multiply by
b squared, and I get

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.900
2b squared equals a squared.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.340
And what does that
imply about a?

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.710
What can you tell me
about a if it equals--

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.080
if a squared is 2b squared?

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.910
Anything special about a?

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.460
Could a be anything?

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.180
A squared is even, all right?

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.360
Because 2b squared is an even
number, so a squared is even,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.605
and what does that mean about a?

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.140
A is even.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.570
B squared is even,
then a is even.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.860
So a is even.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.080
So we could write
that as two divides a.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.250
That's the divide symbol.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.700
You'll see a lot
of that next week.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.940
All right if a is even, what
do I know about a squared?

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.340
I know more than
just, it's even.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.510
What is it?

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.160
It's multiple of 4, yeah.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.030
So that means that
four divides a squared.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.150
A squared is 2b
squared, so that means

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.970
that four divides 2b squared.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.780
Divide each side by 2
means 2 divides b squared.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.418
What does that imply about b?

00:08:07.764 --> 00:08:10.870
B is even.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.750
All right, b is even, good.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:19.620
Well, I've got a is
even and b is even.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.225
I got a contradiction
here, somewhere?

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.260
Yeah a over b was not a
fraction in lowest terms,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.410
because both and b are even.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:41.565
All right, so that implies a
over b is not in lowest terms.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.500
And that is a contradiction.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.660
Now you'll see that
written lots of ways.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.410
One is, you can say
a contradiction,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.586
sometimes you'll see just
this sharp symbol written,

00:08:57.586 --> 00:08:59.460
and that means you've
got to a contradiction.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.510
Because here, we had it
being in lowest terms,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.260
and here we have it
not in lowest terms.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.801
You can't have both
at the same time,

00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:08.910
so you got a contradiction.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:14.080
And that means we've now proved
that this assumption was wrong.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.750
Square root of 2
is not rational,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.840
so it must be irrational.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.540
and then we put a little
box here at the end,

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.620
or sometimes you'll see
a check, sometimes you'll

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.910
see QED, that says
the proof's done now.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.640
It's over.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.790
Any questions about that proof?

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.740
We're going to do a lot of
proofs by contradiction.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.630
Actually, there's an interesting
story behind this proof.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.600
As far as we know, it was first
discovered by the Pythagoreans,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.270
way back when in ancient Greece.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.330
And the Pythagoreans
were a religious society

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.350
started by Pythagoras, of
Pythagoras theorem frame.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.850
Now it sounds weird today, but
back then, in ancient Greece,

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.845
math was a religion, all right?

00:10:06.845 --> 00:10:08.970
Every once in while you'll
see somebody around MIT,

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.920
and you'll think he must
think math is a religion,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.860
but back then it really was,
and it was ruled by God,

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.620
because this is ancient Greece.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.430
And there were two key gods
in this religion, Apeiron

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.790
and Peros.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.730
Now Apeiron was the bad god,
and he was the god of infinity,

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.645
because infinity was
considered all that was bad.

00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:32.020
And I don't think we'll do a
lot with infinity this term,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.270
but if we do you'll appreciate
why that's the case.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.540
And Peros was a good god.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.580
He was the god of
the finite world,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:43.570
and represented everything that
was good to the ancient Greeks.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.930
Now one of their main
axioms, or beliefs,

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.290
was that there were
no irrational numbers.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.070
They just didn't exist.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.570
Now the reason is, they didn't
like irrational numbers.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.690
They were bad.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.420
Because, well they're infinite.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.390
You can't write
them as a decimal

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.130
without repeating forever, and
you know, just an infinite sort

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.160
of decimal representation.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.530
They liked rational numbers,
you know, like one seventh?

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.540
That's a good number,
because you can write it

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:19.330
as 0.142857 repeating.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.370
So rational numbers
are finite, in that

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.100
you can always find a repeating
pattern of finite length.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.540
Irrational numbers are not.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.924
They're infinite in that
sense of the ancient Greeks.

00:11:28.924 --> 00:11:30.840
So they said there were
no irrational numbers.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.380
That was an early axiom.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.810
Now they also had
an axiom that said

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:43.717
that every length of a line
was finite, therefore rational.

00:11:43.717 --> 00:11:45.300
All right, you know
the ancient Greeks

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.130
were good with a compass,
and drawing lines

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.570
with straight edges and stuff.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.090
So they said any line
that you can construct

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.270
has a finite length
to it, so therefore it

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.390
has a rational length.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.740
That was axiom number two.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.910
Now they were good geometers,
so they knew, of course,

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.070
they developed the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.520
But if you took a triangle,
and you have side lengths one,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.177
the length of the hypotenuse
was square root 2.

00:12:11.177 --> 00:12:12.760
Therefore they had
a theorem that said

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.946
square root 2 was rational.

00:12:14.946 --> 00:12:18.430
Because you've got the
2 axioms there, right?

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.480
Now eventually, they
discovered a proof like that,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.740
that it wasn't rational.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.380
It was irrational.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.010
This caused quite a stir.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.180
First it meant that their
axioms were inconsistent.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.590
Every theorem they
proved was now suspect,

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.600
once you have
inconsistent axioms.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.800
Even worse, the devil
is in their midst.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.300
Square root 2 is
infinite is the bad god,

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.690
and this is the most basic
length they had, besides one.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.849
So that's a very bad thing.

00:12:49.849 --> 00:12:51.390
Sort of like, you
know, today we were

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.310
to wake up and discover
that there were only nine

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.950
commandments, and the 10th was
planted there by the devil.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.710
And you're not sure
which one, maybe.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.270
That would be a big
mess, sacrilege.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.520
Well, so what were they to do?

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.370
This is a disaster
of major proportions.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.490
So they covered it up, and
they denied the result.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.570
So they didn't want
to publish that proof.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.760
So they kept on saying
square root 2 was rational.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.130
But then, according to legend
there was a Deep Throat.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.339
Somebody who let out the word
and the proof the square root 2

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:25.630
is irrational, because that
would be very destabilizing

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.810
for the society, and
so they killed them.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.042
This is the legend.

00:13:31.042 --> 00:13:32.500
Now, hard to imagine
getting killed

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.505
over the irrationality of 2.

00:13:35.505 --> 00:13:37.130
All right, we're
going to do a lot more

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.080
of these kind of
proofs in homework

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.800
and throughout the term.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.750
The next proof I
want to show you

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.410
is one of my favorite
proof techniques.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.950
One of my favorite proofs.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.912
And that is a false proof.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.370
And we're going to see a lot
of these during the term, too.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.030
And if we could bring
the screens down.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.420
Somebody back there to-- yeah.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:55.730
Great.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.313
Bring the screens
down, I'm going to--

00:13:57.313 --> 00:13:58.750
and then turn this on for me.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:05.160
So I'm going to prove to you
that 90 is bigger than 92.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:05.660
All right?

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.360
And that hopefully,
is not really true.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.470
But, you know, watch this
proof and see if there's

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.450
any problems with it.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.016
All right, the
proof, by PowerPoint.

00:14:19.016 --> 00:14:20.515
Right away you
should be suspicious.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.004
I'm going to take two
triangles with total area 90

00:14:27.004 --> 00:14:28.920
and put them together,
and then divide them up

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.110
into four triangles with
area greater than 92.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.020
And by the conservation
of area axiom, which

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.230
you want to be maybe
thinking about,

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.110
this will imply an area of 90
is larger than an area of 92.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.460
And therefore that
90 is bigger than 92.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.900
All right, those
are my triangles.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.150
They are right
triangles, 9 by 10.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:58.510
If I put them together, I
get a 9 by 10 rectangle.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:03.140
Of course it has
area 90, 9 times 10.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:10.170
Now I'm going to slide these
triangles across their diagonal

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.620
so that I get, instead
of having 10 on the side,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.030
I'm going to slide it
so I get a 2 and an 8.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.560
OK I had 10 there
before, now it's 2 and 8.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.060
And then you see
I've got this-- I'm

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.940
going to cut off
along the dotted line,

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.977
and as you can see
that dotted line, yeah

00:15:22.977 --> 00:15:24.560
but won't compute
it exactly, but it's

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.371
a little bit bigger than 2.

00:15:26.371 --> 00:15:26.870
All right?

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.828
It's a little bit longer
than that 2 there, you

00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:31.090
could see that.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.390
All right, so I'll call
it 2 plus, bigger than 2.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.970
Now I slice off along
the dotted line,

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.040
and now I'm going to put
those two triangles together,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.560
and I create a rectangle.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.595
Two by two-- little
more than two.

00:15:44.595 --> 00:15:46.095
Now the area of the
little rectangle

00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:49.850
is bigger than 4, cause I got 2
times something bigger than 2,

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.740
and you can see here I
have the 8 left over,

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.020
and I have 9 plus 2 plus,
means it's a little bit bigger

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.120
than 11 by 8.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.250
I got area bigger than 88,
add them up, get area bigger

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.820
than 92.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.655
So I started with 90 and
I created more than 92.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.441
All right, what's
the problem here?

00:16:13.441 --> 00:16:14.940
This would be good
if I could do it.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.140
I'd get some gold,
you know, bars of gold

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.540
and cut them up, and do the
game, and I make more gold.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.340
That would be pretty
good if I could do that.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.300
Because of the
conservation of area axiom?

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.570
Did I assume something
there that was too powerful

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.382
that if I manipulate the
area of rectangles like this,

00:16:34.382 --> 00:16:35.840
that the area needs
to be the same?

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.630
Yeah?

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.170
My bigger ones aren't closed.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.320
Well, let's see, I don't know.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.230
Let's go back and see I
made those bigger ones.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.700
All right, I got my
triangles, right?

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.287
I'm just chopping along the line
there, and I got 2 plus and 9.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.457
Those are rectangles.

00:17:01.457 --> 00:17:02.540
They look like rectangles.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.541
Yeah.

00:17:06.541 --> 00:17:09.319
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:15.050
PROFESSOR: Well it looks
bigger than 2, doesn't it?

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.670
Yeah, 2 pluses.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.470
Well bigger than 2 is bigger
than 2, but, yeah, maybe that

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.329
should have been a 2 minus.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.190
Would that change anything?

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.030
Yeah, if that had
been a 2 minus,

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:32.860
then we'd have area less than 4,
area less than 88, and then 90

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.420
would be less than 92.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.780
That would be OK.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.882
But it sure as heck looks
bigger than-- the 2 plus looks

00:17:38.882 --> 00:17:40.090
bigger than the 2 doesn't it?

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.240
I don't know, do they
got distortion out there?

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.590
I guarantee you, if I
measured on my screen,

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.864
that 2 plus is bigger than
the length of the tube.

00:17:48.864 --> 00:17:49.530
I guarantee you.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.930
We can to take a
ruler on my screen,

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.510
and the 2 plus will be longer
on the ruler than the 2.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.090
That I guarantee you, but
you're on the right track.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.700
Yeah

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.200
Good, all right,
now how did you--

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.871
but it is true, if I measured
on my screen, it's bigger.

00:18:10.871 --> 00:18:11.370
Yeah.

00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:15.970
AUDIENCE: Are the triangles,
like, drawn to scale?

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.502
It's like, on the SAT they
always say, not to scale,

00:18:18.502 --> 00:18:19.350
right?

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.720
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.780
Yeah, they're not
drawn to scale.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:29.850
In fact, if I go back to the
beginning, it says 9 by 10.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.080
But in fact, if I measure the
nine, it's bigger than the 10.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.690
All right?

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.706
So this is one of the big
problems of proofs by picture.

00:18:40.706 --> 00:18:42.580
Because look at it,
you're not thinking which

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.030
is bigger, 9 or 10 up there?

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.199
10's bigger even though
it's not, it's shorter.

00:18:46.199 --> 00:18:47.740
But when you get
down into the proof,

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.860
well, clearly the 2 plus
was bigger than the 2,

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.943
because it looks that way.

00:18:50.943 --> 00:18:52.480
It is, on the paper.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:52.980
All right?

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.271
In fact if you go on a
computer, you're probably right,

00:18:55.271 --> 00:18:57.410
it's 1.8, not 2 plus.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.940
But that's how the error
crept in and how it was drawn,

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.665
and then you're going
along with a proof,

00:19:02.665 --> 00:19:04.040
and everything
else is just fine.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.840
So the mistake is
right up front.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.680
I drew it wrong.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.320
OK.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.960
And this happens,
you're doing graphs--

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.168
we'll talk about graphs here
in a couple weeks-- over

00:19:13.168 --> 00:19:14.519
and over again, people do this.

00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:16.560
They draw it, it looks
like this, you accept that

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.620
and then you're dead.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.190
Everything else,
there's no hope.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.080
Everybody clear what went
wrong in this picture?

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.630
How we got off track?

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.100
This is sort of a nasty one.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:29.600
OK.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.586
Now one of the nice
things about proofs

00:19:34.586 --> 00:19:36.710
is that when there is a
bug, if you really write it

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.775
out step by step,
and there's a bug,

00:19:38.775 --> 00:19:40.620
you can go back and find it.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.240
And so this, I
didn't sort of really

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.770
write it out very
well step by step,

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.740
and it was harder to find.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.190
Now, all right, so we
can pull the screens up.

00:19:52.543 --> 00:19:54.460
Thanks.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.915
OK, so for the rest of today
and the rest of this week,

00:19:57.915 --> 00:20:00.040
we're going to talk about
a different kind of proof

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.600
technique, which is induction.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.510
Now, induction is by far the
most powerful and commonly used

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.350
proof technique in
computer science.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.880
If there's one thing
you should know

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.640
by the time you're
done with this class,

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.415
it's how to do a
proof by induction.

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:17.790
In fact, if there's
one thing you

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.280
will know by the time
we're done with this class,

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.020
is how to do a
proof by induction.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.240
And in some sense, when we
get to grading the final, how

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.020
we measure ourselves
as instructors,

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.770
the first test is,
can you do the proof

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.250
by induction question,
and do a good proof there?

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.090
You will see it on the
midterm and the final,

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.410
probably in multiple instances.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.960
Now just to make sure you
become intimately familiar

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.480
with induction, we're going
to do over a dozen proofs

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.720
with induction in class,
and many more in homework

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.610
over the next five to six weeks.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.670
You'll probably be
dreaming about induction,

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.940
if we're successful here.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.130
Soon.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.984
The good news is that
induction is very easy.

00:20:57.984 --> 00:21:00.150
Once you get your mind
around it, get some practice,

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.910
it really is not a hard thing.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.600
In fact, induction is
really just an axiom.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.350
So let me state it.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.720
Let P(n) be a predicate.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:44.940
If P(0) is true, and for all
natural numbers n, p of n

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:51.140
implies p of n plus 1 is true.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.850
So here I'm saying that
this is true for all n.

00:21:59.525 --> 00:22:00.025
OK.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:11.860
Then for all n, natural
numbers, P of n is true.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.220
I had another way of
saying this without the

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:25.090
for alls there, is
that if P(0) is true,

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:34.030
if P(0) implies P(1) is true,
if P(1) implies P(2) is true,

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:40.240
and so on, forever, then p
of n is true for all that.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:48.990
So then, P(0), P(1),
P(2), forever, are true.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.900
OK.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:04.600
Now you can sort of see why
this is a reasonable axiom,

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:10.440
because if P(0) is true,
and P(0) implies P(1), then

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.640
by that modus ponens thing or
one of the logical deductions,

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.000
we know P(1) is true.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.120
And if P(1) is true, and
P(1) implies P(2) is true,

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.770
then we know by
the same reasoning,

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.770
P(2) is true, and
so on, forever.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:28.870
Now the reason it becomes an
axiom is that and so on forever

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.200
bit is part of it.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.370
That's why we need
it as an axiom.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.652
You could sort of view this
as a series of dominoes.

00:23:37.652 --> 00:23:57.300
You know, I got a
domino for each n,

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.710
and each domino knocks over
the next in terms of truth,

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.230
knocking over corresponds
to the truth here.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.400
And if I know P(0) is true,
that means I knock over P(0),

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.210
P(0) implies P(1) means
P(1) one goes down.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.070
P(1) implies P(2) means P(2)
goes down, and so forth.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.230
Pretty basic.

00:24:19.035 --> 00:24:21.660
Raise your hand if you think you
don't have a lot of experience

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.745
with induction.

00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:26.200
All right, yeah,
that's pretty typical.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.560
About a third to a half of you.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.640
So we're going to change that.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.390
Let's do a simple
proof using induction.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.600
So let's prove that for all
n bigger than or equal to 0,

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:48.140
again natural numbers, that
1, plus 2, plus 3, plus n

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:53.677
equals n times n plus 1 over 2.

00:24:53.677 --> 00:24:55.510
This is actually a
useful thing to remember.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.820
We're going to use this
all term, this identity.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.740
Now the first thing,
before we prove it,

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.080
I want to make sure we
understand this dot,

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.740
dot, dot, notation.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.690
Because it is the source
of a lot of errors.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:14.180
What it means is that you need
to fill in the pattern here,

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.500
which is vague.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.380
What it means in this case,
you fill in four, five, six all

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.865
the way up to n
minus 1, and then n.

00:25:21.865 --> 00:25:22.740
That's what it means.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.020
Figure out the pattern
and fill it in.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.340
Pretty risky thing.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.490
Now in this case,
because that's so vague,

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.320
there's other terminology
we use for this.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.200
For example, we would
use a big sigma,

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.250
capital sigma i
equals 0 to n of i.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:44.940
That means the sum of i,
where i is the integers from 0

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.004
to n inclusive.

00:25:47.004 --> 00:25:48.170
Actually, let me put 1 here.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.830
Another way to write this--
these are all equivalent ways

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.810
to write it-- is you
could put 1 less than

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:01.005
or equal to i, less
than or equal to n of i.

00:26:01.005 --> 00:26:04.810
So you could put something i
over the range, from one to n,

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.000
or you can write it on
the bottom if you want.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.730
So these are four
different ways of writing

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:16.106
the same thing, the sum of the
natural numbers from 1 to n.

00:26:16.106 --> 00:26:17.730
And we'll use them
all during the term.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.750
All right, now there's
some special cases

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.430
that make this a little
more interesting.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.686
What if n equals 1?

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:35.570
I've got 1 plus 2 plus
dot, dot, dot, plus n.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.490
What do you suppose it
equals if n equals 1?

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:48.910
1, because we're summing
the numbers from 1 to 1.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.390
That's just 1, the number 1.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.930
There is no 2.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.880
And there aren't
two copies of 1.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.910
So this notation
is very ambiguous.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.810
You'll see a 2 here in the sum.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.614
If n is 1, you'll see
a 1 here and a 1 here.

00:27:03.614 --> 00:27:04.780
So you've got to be careful.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.080
I guarantee you, you'll
make a mistake with this.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.371
In fact I'm going to show
you another false proof later

00:27:09.371 --> 00:27:11.244
where this comes into play.

00:27:11.244 --> 00:27:13.160
What about if n is less
than or equal to zero?

00:27:15.849 --> 00:27:16.515
What is it then?

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:21.510
Any thoughts?

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.680
0.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:32.889
There are no integers to sum,
no 1, no 2, no n, because you

00:27:32.889 --> 00:27:34.930
never get started because--
sorry, n is less than

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.550
or equal to 0-- because
you're summing from 1 to 0,

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.320
0 is below.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.710
You never-- it doesn't
include anything.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:45.120
So these are the conventions
to keep in mind with the edge

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.710
cases here.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.300
All right, it's easy enough
to check that the theorem is

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.640
true for certain values of n.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:00.520
For example, if n equals 4,
I've got 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.220
That's 10.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:09.580
And 10 equals 4 times 5 over
2, plugging in the formula.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.030
So for any value of n you could
check this formula is true.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.930
Proving is true for all n.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.820
It takes a little more effort
unless you use induction.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:20.760
So let's do that.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.870
So we'll prove the theorem.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.200
Now, whenever you're using
a proof by induction,

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.480
first thing you do is you
write down by induction

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.920
so we know what
you're going to do.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.980
And the next thing
you need to do

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.500
is figure out, what's
your predicate.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.060
What's your
inductive hypothesis?

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.750
What's p?

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.870
So usually p will
be the thing you're

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.820
trying to prove, namely
that 1 plus 2 plus 3 up to n

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.460
is n times n plus 1 over 2.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.390
And you state that.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:06.140
You say let p of n be the
proposition, the predicate,

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:13.880
that the sum i equals 1
to n of i equals n times n

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.897
plus 1 over 2.

00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:19.210
And once you've got
that established,

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:24.300
now we're going to go
verify that p 0 is true

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:29.030
and that p n implies p n plus 1.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.510
So we always have
to write this down.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.740
The next thing to do is to check
what's called the base case,

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.165
p zero.

00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:37.300
So let's do that.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.130
So we write down base case.

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.615
Some people call
it the basis step.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.060
And we have to check
that p 0 is true.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:13.650
Well, what's the sum of
i equals 1 to 0 of i?

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.650
0.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.140
There are no terms in this sum.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.020
And if I look over there,
n times n plus 1 over 2.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.995
If n is 0, it equals 0.

00:30:28.346 --> 00:30:29.720
So we're done with
the base case.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.890
We've now proved
that p0 is true.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.935
And the second part is
called the inductive step.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:47.350
And here we have to show, for
n greater than or equal to 0,

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:53.020
we need to show that pn
implies pn plus 1 is true.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.380
Now how do we show an
implication is true?

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.580
How do I show this is true?

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.810
What am I going to do to
show that's true in general?

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:10.900
Yeah?

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.775
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.780
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.230
Because an implication is true
in every case, except for true

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.060
implies false.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.960
So if pn is false, we're done.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.410
This implication is true.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.530
The only case we have to
worry about is p of n is true.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.600
So we assume p of n is true.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.500
And now we confirm that that
means pn plus 1 is true.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.960
So we write that down.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:49.960
Assume pn is true.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.765
And you might also write down,
"for purposes of induction"

00:31:53.765 --> 00:31:59.490
or "purposes of it verifying
the inductive hypothesis." just

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.152
to let us know why
you're assuming it.

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:02.610
In other words,
you're not assuming

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.615
pn is true for purposes
of contradiction.

00:32:05.615 --> 00:32:07.490
You're assuming it for
purposes of induction.

00:32:10.329 --> 00:32:11.370
All right, let's do that.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:27.400
That means, in this case, i.e.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:40.270
we assume 1 plus 2 plus up to n
equals n times n plus 1 over 2.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:49.910
And we need to show that
the n plus 1 case is true,

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:58.350
and the 1 plus 2 plus n plus
1 equals n plus 1 times n

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.960
plus 2 over 2.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.930
It's sort of weird,
and this does

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:10.830
confuse people that aren't
familiar yet with induction.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.360
It looks like we just assumed
what we're trying to prove.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.410
We're trying to prove
this is true for all n.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.280
And we just assumed it.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:22.360
But we're assuming it in
the context of establishing

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.080
this implication is true.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.730
And then we apply the
induction axiom to conclude pn

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:27.480
is true for all n.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:39.040
All right, well, let's
rewrite this as 1 plus 2

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.540
plus n plus n plus 1.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:50.130
Because I've assumed
pn, I can rewrite this

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:54.960
as an n plus 1 over 2.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.600
And now plus n plus 1 out here.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:06.520
That equals, well, I got
n squared plus n, here,

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.544
over 2, plus 2 n plus 2.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:22.050
And that equals n plus
one times n plus 2 over 2,

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.830
which is what we're
trying to show.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.350
So we've completed,
now, the inductive step.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:33.976
We have shown that for all n,
pn implies pn plus one for all n

00:34:33.976 --> 00:34:35.100
greater than or equal to 0.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:45.760
Any questions about that?

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.370
So, the proof is done.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.830
We've done everything we
need to imply induction.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.909
We've got p0 is true.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.820
And pn implies pn plus 1 for n
bigger than or equal to zero.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:05.138
Now induction helped
us prove the theorem.

00:35:05.138 --> 00:35:07.221
Did it help us understand
why the theorem is true?

00:35:09.879 --> 00:35:11.670
Do you have any feel
for why the theorem is

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.836
true after seeing the proof?

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:17.670
Not really.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:19.709
I don't think--
sometimes induction

00:35:19.709 --> 00:35:21.000
will give you an understanding.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.900
Sometimes it won't.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.950
Here you've got no understanding
of why the theorem's true,

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.160
which is sort of unfortunate.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:32.979
Did induction help you figure
out the answer to the sum?

00:35:32.979 --> 00:35:34.520
Namely, say you were
trying to derive

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.810
this answer from this sum.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:39.730
Did induction give
you the answer?

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:40.450
No.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:44.720
You had to know the answer,
namely this, in order

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.320
to prove it was true.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.830
Now later we'll see examples
where induction actually

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.380
can give you the answer,
but often it does not.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.280
Often, induction gives
you no hints, no answer,

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.090
just prove that it's right once
you had the clever idea that,

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.940
oh, maybe that's the answer.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:06.080
You'll see that with things
like the beaver flu problem.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.040
Figuring out the inductive
hypothesis or the answer,

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.040
you know, the details
of it is hard.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.840
But once you do it, then
applying the induction,

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.410
not so hard.

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:16.660
It gives you a concrete proof.

00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:20.350
OK, let's do another one.

00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:27.850
In fact, we're just going
to spend the rest of today

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:29.110
doing induction proofs.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:48.780
So for all natural numbers
n, 3 divides n cubed minus n.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.740
Means than n cubed minus
n is a multiple of three.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.940
For example, n is 5.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:06.720
3 divides 125 minus
5, because that's 120.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.191
Let's prove that.

00:37:09.191 --> 00:37:10.565
And we're going
to use induction.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.220
What do you suppose
pn's going to be?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.810
What's my predicate or my
inductive hypothesis here?

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:27.480
Any thoughts?

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.752
Yeah?

00:37:31.752 --> 00:37:32.684
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:33.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's you.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:34.638
Go ahead.

00:37:34.638 --> 00:37:36.224
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:36.224 --> 00:37:36.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.710
First thing you
always want to try

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:42.460
is you assume that is
your induction hypothesis.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:50.320
So we say, let pn be 3
divides n cubed minus n.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.230
What's the next thing
we do in our proof?

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.830
Base case.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.200
Always easy to forget,
but not a good idea.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.550
Base case is n equals 0.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.850
And sure enough, 3
divides 0 minus 0.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:10.753
So that's done.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.210
What's the next step we do?

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:24.590
What is it?

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.270
Next step?

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.810
Inductive step.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.960
And for that we're going to
need to show for n bigger

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:49.661
than or equal to 0, we want
to show pn implies pn plus 1

00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:50.160
is true.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.130
So to do that we
assume pn is true.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:11.590
In other words, we assume that
3 divides n cubed minus n.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.690
And we're trying to show that
3 divides n plus 1 cubed minus

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.270
n plus 1.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:25.050
So we take a look at, we examine
n plus 1 cubed minus n plus 1.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:29.070
And we want to show it's
a multiple of three.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.540
Well, let's expand that out.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:39.160
This is n cubed plus 3n
squared, plus 3n plus 1.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.100
And I subtract off n plus 1.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.846
So I get n cubed plus
3n squared plus 2n.

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:55.985
Is this a multiple of 3?

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.220
I need to show that's a multiple
of 3 and then I'd be all done.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.180
Is it a multiple of 3?

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.950
Beats me.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.965
It doesn't look like a
multiple of 3, necessarily.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.200
So maybe we need to
massage it a little bit.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.890
I do know that this
is a multiple of 3.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.579
I can use that fact.

00:40:23.579 --> 00:40:25.120
And in proofs by
induction you always

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.290
want to-- if you're not
making use of that fact,

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.390
then you're not really
making use of induction.

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:30.390
Sort of a warning sign.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:34.220
So I want to use this
fact to prove this.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:39.520
Well, let's get a
minus n in here.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.700
This equals n cubed minus
n plus 3n squared plus--

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.070
if I subtracted an n I
got to add an n-- plus 3n.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:50.700
So I've rewritten it.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.160
Now is it clear?

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.740
Now it's clear.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:58.390
Very simple, because
3 divide this by pn.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:59.330
3 divides that.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.810
And 3 divides that.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:05.050
So this is a multiple
of 3, because I've

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:12.150
got 3 divides 3n squared, 3
divides 3n, and 3 divides n

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:17.120
cubed minus n by pn.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.640
Or you could say, by the
inductive hypothesis.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.680
pn is the inductive hypothesis,
another name for it.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.820
So therefore, 3 divides that,
which means 3 divides this.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:36.590
So that means 3 divides n
plus 1 cubed minus n plus 1.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:42.560
And we are done with
the proof by induction.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.768
Any questions about that one?

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.600
So the key steps in induction
are always the same.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.490
You write down
"proof by induction."

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.570
You identify your predicate.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.610
You do the base case,
usually n equals 0,

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.140
but it could be something else.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:03.850
And then you do
your inductive step.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:06.115
Now in general, you could
start your induction--

00:42:06.115 --> 00:42:08.240
you don't have to start it
at 0, you could start it

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.336
at some value b, some integer b.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:17.810
Let's take a look at that.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:29.900
So you could have
for the base case,

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:35.130
you could have p of b
is true, not p of 0.

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:40.730
And then for your
induction step you

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:47.440
would have for all n bigger
than or equal to b, pn implies

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.000
pn plus 1.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.040
And then your conclusion is
that for all n bigger than

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.790
or equal to b, pn is true.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.630
So inductions don't
always have to start at 0.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:05.790
You can pick where you start.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:10.150
Just make sure that you
verify the starting point

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.940
and you verify the
implication for all n

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.772
at that starting
point and beyond.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.950
All right, let's now do a
false proof using induction.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:42.130
We're going to prove that all
horses are the same color.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.270
So let's go through the process.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:04.750
So the proof, we write
down "by induction."

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:08.320
Now we need our induction
hypothesis, the predicate.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.550
So we're going to let that
be-- we can't let it be this.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:14.950
Why can't this be our predicate?

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:16.340
All horses are the same color.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.756
What's wrong with making that
be the induction hypothesis?

00:44:20.917 --> 00:44:22.250
You can't plug anything into it.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.900
There's no number here.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.050
I've got to have a
number, n, to induct on.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:37.000
So what I'm going to say is
that in any set of n horses--

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.180
and let's make n bigger
than or equal to 1--

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:48.920
the horses are all
the same color.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.610
All right, now if I prove
this is true for all n,

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.280
well then all horses
are the same color.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.738
Because in any set of n horses,
they're all the same color.

00:45:02.738 --> 00:45:05.860
So all horses must
be the same color.

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.020
What's the next thing I do?

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.150
What's the next step?

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:11.870
Base case.

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:16.790
Now, what am I going to
use as my base case here?

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:21.580
One horse, OK, or n equals 1.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.920
So p of 1.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.650
That would say that any set
of one horses the horses

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.510
are all the same color.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:29.050
That's true.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:29.841
I've got one horse.

00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:32.180
It's the same color as itself.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.970
So that's easy.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:38.310
It's true since just one horse.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:08.100
All right, what's the
next step of the proof?

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.200
What's the next thing I do?

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.180
Inductive step.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:28.060
So I'm going to assume that pn
is true to prove pn-- and show

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:32.030
pn plus 1 is true.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.630
All right, so I'm
going to assume

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.310
that in any set of
n horses, the horses

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.680
are all the same color
that I start with.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.050
And now I look at a
set of n plus 1 horses.

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:50.500
So we consider a set
of n plus 1 horses.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:47:00.060
And let's call those
horses h1, h2, hn plus 1.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:08.400
What do I know about
horses h1 to hn?

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:17.340
They're the same color,
because pn is true.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.290
There are a set of n horses.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:21.140
By p1 they're all
the same color.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:42.221
Also, what do I know but
h2, h3 and hn plus 1?

00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:44.470
All the same color, because
they're a set of n horses.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.170
All right.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:48:01.760
Well, since the
color of h1 equals

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:09.430
the color of those
guys, h2 to hn,

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.560
I know h1 is the same
color as these guys.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.620
I also know that hn plus 1 is
the same color as those guys.

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:27.440
That means that h1 is the
same color as hn plus 1.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.260
And all n plus 1
are the same color.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:39.700
And that's pn plus 1.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.660
That implies pn plus 1.

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.460
And I'm done.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:54.720
Now a few years ago we assigned
this problem as homework.

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.410
And we asked students
to figure out what

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:57.860
went wrong with the problem.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:59.740
Why doesn't this work?

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.230
And the responses were
a little discouraging.

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:06.950
Half the class responded,
effectively as follows,

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:09.980
this example just goes to show
that induction doesn't always

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.560
work.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.430
A third of the
class said, I always

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:17.390
knew that you can't
trust mathematics.

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:21.140
This example just proves it.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.540
That really hurt.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:26.930
And most of the rest were
something similar to that.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.180
Not exactly what we were
looking for in the homework.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:31.030
So now we don't
leave it to homework.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:34.110
We do it in class.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:37.150
What's the flaw here?

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:38.248
What was it?

00:49:38.248 --> 00:49:39.060
AUDIENCE: P of n.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:39.810
PROFESSOR: P of n?

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:40.873
What's wrong with p of n?

00:49:40.873 --> 00:49:41.748
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:47.380
PROFESSOR: No, this
is a real assumption

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:52.280
in any set of n horses--
depends on n-- the horses are

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.150
all the same color.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:55.730
That is a proposition.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.340
Because it depends on
n, it's a predicate.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.990
It's true or it's false.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:04.840
Now we know it's false, because
you could get a set of a couple

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.670
horses with different color.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:07.740
But it is a proposition.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.640
Yeah, way back there?

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] for
like a certain set of horses.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.940
So even though it's the
same number of horses,

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:20.638
so it was the same number
as a different set of horses

00:50:20.638 --> 00:50:23.077
it's not something you
can assume anymore.

00:50:23.077 --> 00:50:24.410
PROFESSOR: That's a great point.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:28.450
I did gloss over something
here, because in the predicate

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.860
I've got "in any set."

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.724
So there's really a "for
all sets" sitting out here.

00:50:34.724 --> 00:50:36.140
So I've going to
be careful that I

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:41.080
establish that when I'm trying
to prove pn implies pn plus 1.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.520
So to establish
pn plus 1 here, I

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.710
assume pn which means
in any set of n horses

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:46.860
they're all the same color.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:47.910
That I'm given.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:48.840
That's pn.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.500
I've got to look at any
set of n plus 1 horses.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:58.270
So consider any set, not a set,
any set of n plus 1 horses.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:00.060
So you pick any set you want.

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:03.870
Call them this, h1
through hn plus 1.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:08.900
Well then, the first n are a set
of n horses, so I can apply pn,

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.290
therefore they have
the same color.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:14.860
The last n horses in the
set are a set of n horses,

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.590
so I can imply pn.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.750
So these guys all have the same
color, and I'm on my merry way

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:20.810
here.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.800
So you're right, I had to
do a little bit more work,

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.660
but I can do that work
and I still get a proof.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.114
Yeah?

00:51:28.114 --> 00:51:28.989
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:28.989 --> 00:51:30.030
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:31.950
Is there a problem
with the base case?

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:37.270
So my base case was
here, n equals 1.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:42.060
In any set of one horse, the
horses-- let's say in the set

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:47.960
just to be really careful--
are all the same color.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.100
No, in any set of one horses
there's only one horse,

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.080
so it's the same
color as itself.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.096
Yeah?

00:51:54.096 --> 00:51:54.971
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.622
PROFESSOR: n plus 1 is
not the same as n, yeah.

00:52:00.622 --> 00:52:02.088
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:02.088 --> 00:52:04.896
So you can't have
the same assumption

00:52:04.896 --> 00:52:06.768
because it's not
a set of n horses.

00:52:06.768 --> 00:52:08.395
It's a set of n plus 1?

00:52:08.395 --> 00:52:09.520
PROFESSOR: Well, let's see.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.700
So you're arguing I made
a mistake here, right?

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:16.230
Well, I've got horses--
horse 2, 3, up to n plus 1.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.000
How many horses are
in this set here?

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.802
AUDIENCE: Oh, in that set?

00:52:21.802 --> 00:52:22.760
PROFESSOR: In this set.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.400
How many horses are there?

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:24.900
AUDIENCE: N.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:28.270
PROFESSOR: N. So I can apply p
of n to this set just the same

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:31.290
as that set, because p of
n is any set of n horses.

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:35.097
Well, I'm picking this one
now and applying pn to it.

00:52:35.097 --> 00:52:36.930
And so therefore they're
all the same color.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.646
Yeah?

00:52:41.646 --> 00:52:44.060
AUDIENCE: H1, h2, dot, dot, dot.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.450
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:48.414
AUDIENCE: Because it does
work it there's two or more,

00:52:48.414 --> 00:52:52.370
but you didn't prove it with
just one-- or from one to two.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:53.175
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:52:53.175 --> 00:52:54.758
Remember I told you
that dot, dot, dot

00:52:54.758 --> 00:52:57.740
is so reasonable,
so easy to use.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:58.540
Everybody uses it.

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.440
It was going to catch us up.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.420
The bug is in the dot, dot, dot.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:08.775
And in particular, it has to
do with the case n equal 2.

00:53:08.775 --> 00:53:10.400
So there's two ways
to look at the bug,

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.580
dot, dot, dot, or
we didn't completely

00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:16.090
do all the inductive steps.

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:19.680
So let's look at the case--
actually it's the case n

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:25.090
equals 1, here, in
this inductive step.

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:30.780
Did I prove p1 implies p2?

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.160
Let's just double check
that worked for n equals 1.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:42.066
n equals 1.

00:53:42.066 --> 00:53:46.030
I've got a set of two horses.

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:48.360
This becomes 2.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.542
So I've got h1, h2.

00:53:51.542 --> 00:53:52.750
Nothing in the dot, dot, dot.

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:55.310
It's just h1 and h2.

00:53:55.310 --> 00:54:01.570
Then this becomes h1.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:04.260
So sure enough, h1 is
the same color as itself.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.170
This becomes-- what does this
become, this set of horses?

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.990
What is it really?

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:11.590
h2.

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:13.190
All right, so I've
got the color of h1

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:16.550
equals the color
of-- oh man, this

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:18.850
is so hard to see this bug.

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:23.550
I wrote down h2 dot, dot,
dot, to hn because-- take out

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:26.410
h1, what's left?

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:28.550
What's left is h2 through hn.

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.830
But this set is only h1.

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:30.830
What's really left here?

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:31.600
What is this set?

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.190
What is this set?

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.962
h2, h1?

00:54:41.962 --> 00:54:43.450
No.

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:45.870
You see, what is the whole
set? h1, dot, dot, dot, hn.

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:46.870
What is the whole thing?

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.930
It's just h1.

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:52.950
pull out h1 and look
at the rest of it,

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:55.600
how many horses are here?

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.580
0 horses.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.120
This is the empty set.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:04.560
There are no horses
here to compare to.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:08.220
Even though I got an h2, I got
an hn, I got a dot, dot, dot.

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:11.770
Because generally,
if n is big, this

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:13.870
has n minus 1 horses are here.

00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:15.310
There's n total.

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:18.120
I got n minus 1 right here.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.280
But n minus 1 is 0.

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.680
There are no horses here.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:27.220
And so this bridge in the
equality totally breaks.

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:31.910
I got color of h1 equals--
there's no information here--

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:33.882
equals the color of h2.

00:55:33.882 --> 00:55:35.590
There's no equality
here, because there's

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:39.380
no horses in this set, all
because of that dot, dot, dot.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:43.360
Do you see where the problem
is by using the dot, dot, dot?

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.912
For the case n equals-- it was
true for every other case of n.

00:55:46.912 --> 00:55:51.240
n equals 2, n equals
3, it's all true.

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:55.360
In fact, what we proved, we
proved the base case of p1

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.030
is true.

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.610
This is an argument
that p2 implies p3.

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.790
That is true.

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:06.680
p3 implies p4, that is true.

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.200
And so forth.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.050
We proved for all n
bigger than or equal to 2,

00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:13.780
pn implies pn plus 1.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:15.440
That we proved.

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:20.060
What is the one missing
implication we did not prove?

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:24.410
The missing link, p1 implies p2.

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:26.080
We did not prove that.

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.650
Now is that true?

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.350
No.

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:33.330
You can find a set of two
horses are not the same color.

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:35.880
And just because every horse
is the same color as itself,

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.400
does not give you that.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.432
That was missing in this proof.

00:56:39.432 --> 00:56:40.890
And so we have to
be really careful

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:43.510
when you're doing these
proofs that you establish

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:45.620
the inductive step
for all n bigger

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.032
than or equal to the base case.

00:56:47.032 --> 00:56:48.490
And then make sure,
if you're going

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:51.790
to use this really convenient
dot dot dot notation, that you

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:55.650
don't wind up here saying, oh
this is horses h2 through hn

00:56:55.650 --> 00:57:00.640
when there's no horses
there, because n is 1.

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.370
Any questions about this?

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:03.302
Yeah?

00:57:03.302 --> 00:57:04.177
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.670
PROFESSOR: Great question.

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:11.970
All right, let's fix the proof.

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:14.500
Start with the base
case of p of 2,

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:16.250
and now I've got all this done.

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:19.665
So therefore, that's
another proof.

00:57:19.665 --> 00:57:20.165
Yeah?

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:24.357
Say it again.

00:57:24.357 --> 00:57:25.232
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:28.834 --> 00:57:30.250
PROFESSOR: This
is still the same.

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:34.515
In any set of n bigger than
or equal to two horses,

00:57:34.515 --> 00:57:36.390
all the horses in the
set are the same color.

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:37.390
That's what he saying.

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:40.000
And he's saying, hey look,
the proof worked here.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.930
The inductive step is just fine.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:44.630
p2 does imply p3.

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:45.512
Yeah?

00:57:45.512 --> 00:57:47.220
AUDIENCE: The base
case for 2 isn't true.

00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:48.219
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:57:48.219 --> 00:57:51.060
The base case fails.

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.450
That's why you've always
got to check the base case.

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:55.390
Yeah?

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:59.851
AUDIENCE: What it does prove is
that if you find any two horse

00:57:59.851 --> 00:58:02.725
and they're always going
to be the same color,

00:58:02.725 --> 00:58:04.650
then all horses have
to be the same color.

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:05.770
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:07.170
That's a great point.

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:10.580
We have given a proof that if
you look at any pair of horses

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:14.380
and they're the same color, then
all horses are the same color.

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.620
That's true.

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:17.790
That is true.

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:19.370
Of course, there
are pairs of horses

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:21.000
that aren't the same color.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.560
So the base case would fail.

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.170
So always check the base case.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.860
You could prove some
great stuff if you

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:26.950
don't check the base case.

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:34.262
All right, any other
questions about that?

00:58:34.262 --> 00:58:37.148
Yeah?

00:58:37.148 --> 00:58:39.994
AUDIENCE: Negative
number [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:39.994 --> 00:58:40.660
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:41.806
As long as it's an integer.

00:58:41.806 --> 00:58:43.790
And as long as you
prove pn implies

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:46.390
pn plus 1 starting
there all the way out.

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:48.990
Yeah, you can start at
negative numbers if you want.

00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:51.500
Usually there's not many
cases where that comes up

00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:52.630
you want to, but you can.

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.030
Nothing wrong with that.

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:57.730
Any other questions?

00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:02.820
Yeah, you can see why it was
a messy homework problem.

00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.790
So far we've seen
examples of how induction

00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:09.220
is useful in proving the
hypothesis is true, but not

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:12.920
in solving the problem, per se.

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.540
Or even figuring out what
the hypothesis should be.

00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:19.400
Now in the last
example, we're going

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.330
to show you how
induction can be used

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:24.300
to prove there is a
solution to a problem,

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.727
and also how to
find the solution.

00:59:25.727 --> 00:59:28.310
So it's actually going to be a
very useful, constructive thing

00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:29.390
in this case.

00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:31.390
Now this problem arose
in the construction

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:35.110
of the status center, the
building we're in now.

00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:37.950
This whole building was
originally supposed to cost,

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:41.120
completely furnished,
under $100 million.

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.400
That was the goal.

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.000
But the first mistake they
made was the first step,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.260
was hiring the architect.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.820
They hired Frank Gehry.

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:51.350
I think MIT is now in a
lawsuit with Frank Gehry.

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:53.200
So he was the architect.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.600
And costs just went nuts.

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.960
As you could imagine,
all these slanted walls

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.850
and crazy things happening
actually are expensive.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:05.862
And the cost quickly got
over $300 million, literally.

01:00:05.862 --> 01:00:06.820
That that's parts true.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:10.180
Now I'm going to
fabricate a little bit.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:13.562
Now actually, fund raising
became a huge priority

01:00:13.562 --> 01:00:15.020
once they're more
than $200 million

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.670
over budget they haven't even
bought the furniture yet.

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:21.000
So some pretty radical
ideas were proposed.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.390
And one of them was to build
a large 2 to the n by 2

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:27.080
to the n courtyard
and put a statue

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.990
of a wealthy, potential donor
in the center of the courtyard.

01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:35.390
So let's draw this.

01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:50.780
So the courtyard--
and of course,

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:55.380
you know, it's computer science,
so it has to be a power of 2.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:59.760
So it's 2 to the
n by 2 to the n.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.060
And I've drawn here
the case n equals 2.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.960
And we've got to get the
statue of the wealthy guy

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.614
in the middle.

01:01:08.614 --> 01:01:10.280
And I'm not supposed
to reveal his name.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.970
So we're just going
to call him Bill.

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.130
So Bill's got to
go in the center.

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:20.920
Now this would be fine,
except to that nothing

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.870
was easy with Frank
Gehry, everything

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:25.310
was some weird,
weird thing going on.

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:28.860
And he insisted on
using l-shaped tiles

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.660
for the courtyard.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.560
So the tiles that we're going
to use looked like this.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.260
So it's almost a two
by two, except you're

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.220
missing that piece.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.930
So what you need to
figure out how to do

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:47.000
is tie all this courtyard
perfectly leaving

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.060
one spot for Bill
using tiles like this,

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.125
these l-shaped tiles.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.650
And this is 2 by 2 here.

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.150
So that's the task.

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:07.030
So let's see if we can do
that for n equals 2 here.

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:15.040
Let's see, we can
do a tile here.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.100
We can do a tile here.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.870
A tile here.

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.520
A tile here.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.730
And a tile there.

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:25.320
So we can.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.530
In this case we can tile
the courtyard perfectly

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:32.440
using these L shaped
tiles, leaving one square

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.819
in the Center for the statue.

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:39.110
All right, everyone understand
what we're trying to do?

01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:40.790
The goal?

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:42.398
Now I want to do it for n.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:50.999
So let's start proving
it by induction,

01:02:50.999 --> 01:02:52.790
even though we don't
know how to do it yet.

01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:55.123
Because we're going to see
how induction's going to help

01:02:55.123 --> 01:02:58.745
us show it's possible and maybe
even show us how to do it.

01:03:03.594 --> 01:03:04.635
So let's state a theorem.

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:18.470
For all n there exists away
to tile a 2 to the n by 2

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:28.840
to the n region, or courtyard,
with a center square missing

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.480
for Bill.

01:03:43.222 --> 01:03:44.680
And the proof will
be by induction.

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:56.250
And our induction
hypothesis, the predicate,

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.930
pn is going to be what
we're trying to prove.

01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:03.280
So this is the
induction hypothesis.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.680
Almost always when
you do the induction

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.380
you want to start out with
that as your hypothesis.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.350
What's the next step?

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.040
Base case.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.830
Never ever forget the
base case or you'll

01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:22.660
be thinking all horses
are the same color.

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:25.350
p0.

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:32.190
Well, the courtyard for n
equals 0 is just 1 square.

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:35.150
And that's for Bill.

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:36.230
So you're done.

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:38.790
There's no tiles at
all to worry about.

01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:40.500
That's easy.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.070
So that's true.

01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:44.905
And then we do the
inductive step.

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:13.965
So inductive step.

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:22.200
For n bigger than
or equal to 0, got

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.030
to remember to keep
track of that now,

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:31.240
we assume pn to verify
the inductive hypothesis,

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.010
or to prove pn plus 1.

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:35.930
A lot of ways to
write this down,

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:40.650
but you always want to say
what you're assuming and why.

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:46.190
So we need to show
pn plus 1 is true.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.280
Well, so let's look at a 2 to
the n by-- 2 to the n plus 1

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.600
by 2 to the n plus 1 courtyard.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.745
So let's draw it out here.

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:16.990
2 to the n plus 1 by
2 to the n plus 1.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.400
What are we going to do to
use our inductive hypothesis?

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:23.995
Yeah?

01:06:23.995 --> 01:06:24.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.170
PROFESSOR: For the-- yeah.

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.920
So you're on a good
track there, for sure.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.720
But I've got to apply--
I'm not going from 1 to 2,

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.336
I want to get-- I
want to use pn here.

01:06:49.336 --> 01:06:51.960
So I've got a 2 to the n plus 1
by 2 to the n plus 1 courtyard.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.610
How do I use pn?

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.310
2 to the n by 2 to
the n courtyard.

01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:56.965
Yeah?

01:06:56.965 --> 01:06:58.006
AUDIENCE: Oh, never mind.

01:06:58.006 --> 01:06:58.964
I don't think it works.

01:06:58.964 --> 01:07:01.576
I was about to say that
would be as if 2 to the n

01:07:01.576 --> 01:07:04.282
would divide that
into four blocks.

01:07:04.282 --> 01:07:05.770
PROFESSOR: Good idea, yeah.

01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:07.830
Let's divide our courtyard
into four blocks.

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:09.410
That's a great idea.

01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:13.550
And now each of these is
2 to the n by 2 to the n.

01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:15.210
Right?

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:19.040
And I can apply the
inductive hypothesis there.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:19.915
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:26.490
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:28.444
Hm.

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:30.110
Yeah, something--
yeah, it doesn't quite

01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:34.250
work because Bill
wants to be here.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.280
Got a little square
for Bill there.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.780
But I can't use my
inductive hypothesis to tile

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.980
this, because there's
no square missing.

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:46.190
In fact, even if there wasn't a
square missing, I'm in trouble.

01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:50.480
If I've got-- say this
is size 4 by 4 here.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.390
Can I tile a 4 by 4 region
with L shaped tiles?

01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:56.379
No, they're size 3.

01:07:56.379 --> 01:07:57.420
3 doesn't divide into 16.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.282
Yeah?

01:07:59.282 --> 01:08:01.889
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
There's one tile missing

01:08:01.889 --> 01:08:06.067
from each of those blocks at
the corner that [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:06.067 --> 01:08:07.400
PROFESSOR: There's a great idea.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.030
All right, we're
making progress now.

01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:12.640
Take a corner out
of each of them.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.529
Put my l-shaped tile here.

01:08:16.529 --> 01:08:19.200
Now I can use the
inductive hypothesis

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.319
to tile each one of these.

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.643
Yeah?

01:08:26.643 --> 01:08:28.137
Yeah?

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:31.623
AUDIENCE: Well, why can't
you put a 4 in the center

01:08:31.623 --> 01:08:34.113
and then you have a
bunch of 2s on the side?

01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:35.689
PROFESSOR: A 4 in the center--

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:37.784
AUDIENCE: Like a 2
by 2 in the center.

01:08:37.784 --> 01:08:38.700
PROFESSOR: I got that.

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.790
I got Bill and the tile.

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:44.147
AUDIENCE: No, but
like make it bigger.

01:08:44.147 --> 01:08:47.393
Not just like 4 single
tiles, but like-- so you

01:08:47.393 --> 01:08:49.991
have something like
that over there, right?

01:08:49.991 --> 01:08:50.965
Put that in the center.

01:08:50.965 --> 01:08:52.913
PROFESSOR: Put that
in the center, OK.

01:08:52.913 --> 01:08:56.529
AUDIENCE: And the rest of them
will have like [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:56.529 --> 01:08:58.720
PROFESSOR: Well, the rest
of them aren't 2 by 2,

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.399
because this is n.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:01.600
I've got to use pn here.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.869
And pn says that I can--
in a region 2 to the n by 2

01:09:04.869 --> 01:09:09.970
to the n with a square out
of the center, I can tile it.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:11.310
Am I good here so far?

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:13.020
I claimed I was sort of done.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.271
Yeah?

01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:18.207
AUDIENCE: No, because
p of n tells us-- well,

01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:21.355
assume p of n tells us that you
can set up a 2 to the n by 2

01:09:21.355 --> 01:09:23.140
to the n courtyard
with a centerpiece of--

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.684
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:25.684 --> 01:09:26.350
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:28.100
And what's the problem
for this 2 to the n

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.579
by 2 to the n region?

01:09:30.579 --> 01:09:31.620
Bill's not in the center.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.170
He wants to be in the center.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.529
We put Bill in the corner.

01:09:35.529 --> 01:09:40.130
So you can't use the
inductive hypothesis here.

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:41.899
So I went a little
too fast, here.

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:44.450
This is not a proof so far.

01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:45.970
I've got a problem.

01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:47.137
Yeah?

01:09:47.137 --> 01:09:48.012
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:55.002 --> 01:09:55.710
PROFESSOR: Great.

01:09:55.710 --> 01:10:00.060
OK, let's then change
the inductive hypothesis.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:00.750
Good.

01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:03.620
Let's say there exists a way
to tile a 2 to the n by 2

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:10.870
to the n region with a corner
square missing for Bill.

01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:19.459
All right, but now
I got to put-- oh,

01:10:19.459 --> 01:10:20.500
but I can make this work.

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:20.770
Yeah.

01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:20.930
Yeah.

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:22.760
We can make something--
we can prove this now.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.218
The inductive step
is going to work

01:10:24.218 --> 01:10:28.320
because I'll put Bill-- say
he's in one of the four regions.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.510
Then use the l down here.

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:32.850
Put the l here.

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:34.900
And now I've got a
corner out of each one.

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:37.810
And now I'm done by induction.

01:10:37.810 --> 01:10:41.315
I have proved there's a
way to tile any 2 to the n

01:10:41.315 --> 01:10:46.050
by 2 to the n region with
a corner square missing.

01:10:46.050 --> 01:10:48.426
I think that proof works, Yeah?

01:10:48.426 --> 01:10:54.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
with Bill in the middle,

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:58.266
because to prove that you can
put Bill in the corner in a 2

01:10:58.266 --> 01:11:01.218
by 2 case, you can just
blow that square off.

01:11:01.218 --> 01:11:05.646
[INAUDIBLE] just becomes just
another square, which is 4 by 4

01:11:05.646 --> 01:11:07.770
and then you can put
him in the middle.

01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:08.770
PROFESSOR: That is true.

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:10.140
So you've jumped ahead.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:14.842
We have successfully now
proved this is true for p of n.

01:11:14.842 --> 01:11:16.550
But Bill didn't want
to be in the corner.

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:18.008
We're trying to
prove there's a way

01:11:18.008 --> 01:11:19.844
to do it with Bill
in the center, which

01:11:19.844 --> 01:11:20.760
is not what we proved.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.218
And you've come up with a way--
yeah, that might be doable.

01:11:23.218 --> 01:11:25.690
First prove you can
put Bill in the corner.

01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:31.420
And do it in 2 to the
n by 2 to the n's.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.300
I don't know about
this, actually.

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.890
I got Bill in the corner.

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:38.010
There's some way to do it.

01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:39.630
But it might have
involved doing this.

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:41.400
And now I can't rotate that.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.900
I don't think we have-- I don't
think that proof necessarily

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.115
works.

01:11:45.115 --> 01:11:54.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] prove
that he could be here.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.490
But likewise, we could
prove that if the block just

01:11:57.490 --> 01:11:59.212
rotates you can [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:59.212 --> 01:12:01.170
PROFESSOR: Yes, I agree
with you and I liked it

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:02.086
when I first heard it.

01:12:02.086 --> 01:12:03.860
And you might still convince me.

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:08.310
But all we proved is this,
there's a 2 to the n by 2

01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:10.586
to the n-- any 2 to the
n by 2 to the n region,

01:12:10.586 --> 01:12:12.085
we could tile it
with a corner, Bill

01:12:12.085 --> 01:12:15.480
in a corner, any
corner square missing.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.910
Good, so now you want to say,
I can get Bill in the middle.

01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:20.510
And what you want
to say is OK, I

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:30.549
tile this region with Bill
here, in a 2 to the n by-- maybe

01:12:30.549 --> 01:12:31.090
you're right.

01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:35.150
So then I would apply the
theorem here, with Bill here.

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:35.940
Oh, Bill here.

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:37.860
No, I think I like it now.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.546
And then I would take these out.

01:12:39.546 --> 01:12:45.044
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] just
takes up up three blocks.

01:12:45.044 --> 01:12:49.780
And that big square is just
like a zoomed out version

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.660
of a little square.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:55.980
And since you know that little
square fits in a 2 by 2--

01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:04.240
like for example
in the 4 by 4 case.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.470
We proved the 2 by 2 case.

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:11.235
In the 4 by 4 case
you have a big size.

01:13:11.235 --> 01:13:14.770
It's just like a-- you
have four squares, right?

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:18.919
And each of those four
squares has [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:18.919 --> 01:13:23.965
So you take that top right
square and you put Bill

01:13:23.965 --> 01:13:28.470
within the smaller
square exactly where you

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.430
want him to be.

01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:33.410
And then you fill those
other-- all those empty spaces.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:34.342
PROFESSOR: I agree.

01:13:34.342 --> 01:13:35.300
You could make a proof.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.860
So in this case
you'd make a Lemma

01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:40.770
that uses induction
that says you can do it

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:42.350
with Bill in the corner.

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:44.080
And then as a
corollary or a theorem

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.980
you'd take that and apply
it to four sub-squares.

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.970
Put Bill in here.

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:51.595
Take these out.

01:13:51.595 --> 01:13:54.011
And then now you'd have your
result of Bill in the center.

01:13:54.011 --> 01:13:55.340
So that is is a way to do it.

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:56.860
It ends up being
more complicated.

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:58.300
There is a simpler approach.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.870
But that is a way that works.

01:13:59.870 --> 01:14:03.490
It is a natural thing you would
do if you had this on homework.

01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:05.980
Is you'd think of a different
thing to prove by induction,

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.540
then use that as a Lemma to
get you where you wanted to go.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:14.290
There's another way to do it
without having that first step.

01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:16.870
And that's-- yeah?

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:20.750
AUDIENCE: That courtyard
where n equals 2.

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:24.630
Divide each cell into a 2 by 2--

01:14:28.154 --> 01:14:28.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:31.180
AUDIENCE: Something.

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:33.780
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:35.400
You want to do it bottoms up.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.450
You want to take it and make
that your inductive step, 2

01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:40.310
by 2's inside.

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:42.272
I haven't thought
about that approach.

01:14:42.272 --> 01:14:55.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
So if you could

01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:58.262
do that then you're all
set except for the 2

01:14:58.262 --> 01:15:04.176
by 2 where Bill was.

01:15:04.176 --> 01:15:05.800
PROFESSOR: I'm worried
about a lot of 2

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.883
by 2's with a corner
missing if I do it that way.

01:15:08.883 --> 01:15:11.620
I'll think about that.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:17.372
There is-- let me get to
another approach here.

01:15:17.372 --> 01:15:19.080
We couldn't make it
work with the center.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.580
We could make it
work with a corner.

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:22.960
But then we had to
do more work after.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.336
One general technique
to use with induction,

01:15:25.336 --> 01:15:27.460
when you're having struggling,
what's the induction

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.140
hypothesis to use.

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:33.040
If what you've got doesn't work,
you could pick a different one,

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.180
but better to pick
a stronger one.

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:36.643
Yeah?

01:15:36.643 --> 01:15:37.518
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:42.390
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.890
You could.

01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:45.110
And that is a good thing to do.

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:50.460
Make the induction
hypothesis be much stronger.

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:52.810
I had trouble proving
there's a way to do it

01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:54.880
with a center square missing.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.710
Turns out to be
easier to prove it

01:15:57.710 --> 01:15:59.890
where you say any
square could be missing.

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:01.600
Seems like this should
be harder, right?

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.183
We had a hard enough
time just showing

01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:05.250
this square missing was doable.

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:07.850
But by assuming something--
by trying to prove a harder

01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:10.330
problem, assuming
something stronger in pn,

01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:12.680
it gets easier to prove.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:16.140
All right, now we better
check the base case, p0,

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:16.900
but that's easy.

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.960
There's only one
square Bill can be.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.458
But now let's look at
pn implies pn plus 1.

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:26.930
So we go back to this.

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:32.780
We've got a 2 to the n plus 1
by 2 to the n plus 1 courtyard.

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.940
And now Bill can be anywhere.

01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:39.750
Put him here.

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:42.420
There's Bill.

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:45.660
Now I'm going to place my
first l-shaped tile here,

01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:49.000
in the other three regions.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.710
And now I apply
pn to each region.

01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:54.950
A pn says I can do it
with any square missing.

01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:57.540
So I'll pick this one out
here, this one out here,

01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.520
that one there, that one there.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.080
And now I'm done.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.720
That was easy.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.650
No extra steps.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:08.340
Now, how is it possible that it
was easier to prove something

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:11.370
that was harder?

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:13.394
Yeah?

01:17:13.394 --> 01:17:15.602
AUDIENCE: First need to be
in the center [INAUDIBLE],

01:17:15.602 --> 01:17:17.518
you're putting another
constraint on yourself.

01:17:17.518 --> 01:17:18.840
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.470
That is true.

01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:22.440
But by allowing
him to be anywhere,

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.420
I could have started-- I have
to-- that's a possibility.

01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:31.350
See, what I'm trying to do
here, this inductive step

01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:37.380
is all about proving pn
implies pn plus 1 is true.

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:40.130
That's what I'm trying to show.

01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:43.840
Now, how is it useful
for me if pn is stronger?

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.826
Has more?

01:17:45.826 --> 01:17:46.974
AUDIENCE: You grow it.

01:17:46.974 --> 01:17:48.515
You prove that he
can be in a corner.

01:17:48.515 --> 01:17:51.090
But when you grow
it, the corner moves.

01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:52.840
But since we proved
that it can be in any,

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.784
it's fine if it moves.

01:17:53.784 --> 01:17:54.575
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:17:54.575 --> 01:17:56.420
That's exactly right.

01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:00.150
ph got more
powerful, which means

01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:02.560
I get more to assume here.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.082
In the recursive problem,
Bill can be anywhere now.

01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:07.040
It gives me more power.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.750
I can tile any courtyard
with any square missing.

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:11.810
This is more powerful.

01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:13.790
So this got more powerful.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:15.440
So did this.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.790
So what it means
is that my tool set

01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:20.450
is bigger with a stronger pn.

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:24.240
And what I'm trying to
construct or prove got harder.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:28.430
And sometimes, if
I've got more tools,

01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:31.750
it becomes easier to
prove, even a harder thing.

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:33.960
And so a general
rule with induction

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.505
is if you don't first
succeed, try, try again.

01:18:36.505 --> 01:18:39.130
Well, the rule with induction is
if you don't succeed at first,

01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:41.310
try something harder.

01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:42.070
All right?

01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:45.110
And it's amazing, but it
actually works a lot of time,

01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:47.010
as it did here.

01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:49.930
If I don't assume
something strong enough,

01:18:49.930 --> 01:18:54.100
and pn is some little weak thing
like Bill just in the center,

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:57.120
it's not enough to go anywhere.

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.940
But if I could assume
a lot more, like Bill

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.680
could be anywhere he pleases.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.870
Then I could prove
lots of things here.

01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:07.453
So it's all the art--
and you're going

01:19:07.453 --> 01:19:09.244
to learn this over the
next several weeks--

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:12.650
it's all the art of what's
your induction hypothesis.

01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:14.110
Picking a good
one, life is easy.

01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:17.140
Picking the wrong
one, very painful,

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.830
as you'll see with beaver flu.

01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:22.180
OK, that's it for today.
