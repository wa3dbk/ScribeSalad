00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.540
PROFESSOR: Who can tell
me what a proof is?

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.459
Any ideas of, what
is a proof, anyway?

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:30.000
Any thoughts?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.874
Yeah?

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:34.262
AUDIENCE: It's a chain of
statements, each logically

00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:36.215
supported by the
previous ones, that

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:39.161
get you from a
set of assumptions

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:40.730
to a set of conclusions.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.810
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.640
I like that.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.090
That's very close to what
we're going to do here, yeah.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.110
Now, that's a special
kind of proof, though.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.290
That's a mathematical proof.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.170
And I'm going to write
a definition very

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.610
close to that in a few minutes.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.830
But proofs exist
beyond mathematics.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.960
Can anybody think
of a higher level

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.061
notion of what a proof is?

00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:06.810
That's correct, what
you said, but there's

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.500
a higher meta level notion of
what a proof is beyond that.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.220
It may have no logical
deductions potentially.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.490
It may have no assumptions.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.710
Any thoughts about a proof?

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.970
OK, well, I think
generally, a proof

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.400
is considered, across
multiple fields,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.150
as a method for
ascertaining the truth.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.190
And you described one method.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.720
Now, by ascertaining, I mean
establishing truth, verifying

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.340
truth.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.930
And there's lots of
ways to ascertain truth

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.540
in society, and
even within science.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.050
What are some examples
of ways that we

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.395
ascertain truth in society?

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.897
Yeah?

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.768
AUDIENCE: Observations, like
seeing that piece of chalk

00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:15.560
will fall to the ground.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.260
PROFESSOR:
Observation, experiment

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.640
and observation-- excellent.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.540
And that's the
bedrock of physics.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.580
I mean, who really knows if
there's gravity out there?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.720
Well, we observe it.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.730
And so we then conclude
that's the truth.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.607
There's gravity, and
we have laws about it.

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:34.440
That's one good way.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.890
What's another way
of ascertaining truth

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.830
across scientific disciplines,
or beyond science, just

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.150
in society?

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.700
How is truth established?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.450
What are the ways?

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.950
Yeah?

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.704
AUDIENCE: Well,
establishing what's false,

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:53.620
you can know what
things aren't true.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.109
Then that helps you
narrow down what is true.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.900
PROFESSOR: Yes, truth--
yeah, that's great.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.980
Truth is the opposite
of falsehood.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.590
How do we establish falsehood?

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.460
What are the ways in doing that?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.455
How you decide something is
not true in every day-- yeah?

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:10.100
AUDIENCE: Find counterexamples.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.460
PROFESSOR: Find counterexamples,
yeah, that's good.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.890
So in fact, even a step
more general, sampling.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.730
Counterexamples are ways.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.400
If you do something, an
experiment, ten times,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.310
and every time, it comes out
one way, that's truth, maybe.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.329
But there's fields where
that becomes truth.

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.245
What about other ways?

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.760
How are we going to
decide if Roger Clemens is

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.410
guilty of perjury for lying
about steroids to Congress?

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.230
He did it or he didn't.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.300
How are we going to decide that?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.290
How is that truth going
to be ascertained?

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.790
Yeah?

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.481
AUDIENCE: Would it be by
examining the evidence

00:03:59.481 --> 00:04:00.100
that we have?

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.350
PROFESSOR: Examining evidence.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.512
And who makes the
conclusion there?

00:04:03.512 --> 00:04:04.220
AUDIENCE: Juries.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.540
PROFESSOR: The jury.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.645
Truth is established
by juries or judges.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.859
You know, Blago-- I
can never pronounce

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.950
his name, the Illinois governor,
Blagojevick-- he's guilty.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.880
That's the truth of--
not of conspiracy,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.910
trying to sell
Obama a senate seat,

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.970
but of lying to the authorities
about campaign financing.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.640
OJ is guilty-- not
of killing his wife,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.650
but of breaking into an
apartment to steal back

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.850
some of his merchandise.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.840
So judges and juries
make decisions on truth.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.250
What are other truths-- bigger
truths, even, than judges

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.085
and juries, in society?

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.680
There's one really big one
that causes a lot of issues.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.180
Yeah?

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.870
AUDIENCE: Religion.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.420
PROFESSOR: What is it?

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.211
AUDIENCE: Religion.

00:04:57.211 --> 00:05:01.824
PROFESSOR: Religion, the word
of God-- broadly construed here,

00:05:01.824 --> 00:05:02.365
for religion.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.140
Now, that one is really
hard to argue about

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.750
because you believe it.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.440
And especially if you're
not talking to God regularly

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.904
and somebody is, well, it's
hard to argue about the truth.

00:05:17.904 --> 00:05:19.820
So you rely on others
to interpret it for you,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.560
often-- a priest, or
a minister, a rabbi.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.640
And it gets complicated,
because you can end up

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.890
with conflicting truths based on
who you think you're talking to

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.220
or who the translator
is for you.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.080
Another one is the
word of your boss.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.850
Whatever the boss says is right.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.650
Often in business, the
customer is always right.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.680
That's the truth, whatever
the customer says.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.920
With Donald Trump as your
boss, you'd better agree

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.586
or you're fired.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.110
Often in classes, the
professor says it, it is true.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.910
Because the authority said it.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.290
That's not true here.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.600
That will not hold.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.340
And one of the nicest things
about math that I like a lot

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.230
is that the youngest
student can stand up

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.020
against the most oldest,
most experienced professor,

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.015
and win an argument
on mathematics.

00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:19.850
I do get pleasure when a student
comes up and proves me wrong.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.391
I loved it when that
student came in,

00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:23.240
and she showed me
what I said really

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.090
wasn't right when you
looked at it carefully

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.400
or in a different light.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.230
Now, sometimes if I do it on the
board here and it's in class,

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.990
well, that's fun.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.740
I feel a little
embarrassed afterwards.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.640
But it's a good thing
about mathematics,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.550
is you can have that
kind of dialogue.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.200
OK, another one, which is
related to the word of God

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.370
sometimes, is inner
conviction-- very popular

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.020
in computer science, believe
it or not, with the mantra,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.820
there are no bugs in my program.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.850
I can't tell you how
many times you hear that.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.790
Closely related is, I don't
see why not something is true.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.940
And that's a good
one, because that

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.906
transfers the burden of proof to
anybody who disagrees with you.

00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:14.910
You don't have to prove.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.550
You just say, I don't
see why it's not true.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.883
All of a sudden, the other
person who's questioning you,

00:07:18.883 --> 00:07:24.000
it becomes their job to disprove
you, which is not so good.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.710
OK, now in mathematics,
there's this higher level.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.980
And someone stated it
very clearly up there.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.460
Let me write it up here.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:39.280
In mathematics, we have
a mathematical proof

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:57.700
is a verification
of a proposition

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:16.410
by a chain of logical
deductions from a set of axioms.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.070
Now, that's a bit of a mouthful.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.500
There's three important
components here--

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:34.780
propositions, logical
deductions, and axioms.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.130
And we're going to spend
the rest of the class

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.770
today talking about
each of these,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.144
and then give an
example of a proof.

00:08:41.144 --> 00:08:42.394
We'll start with propositions.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:09:04.000
A proposition is a statement
that is either true or false.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.800
You may not know which one,
but it's one or the other.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.310
A simple example--
2 plus 3 equals 5.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.292
Now, that's a true proposition.

00:09:18.292 --> 00:09:20.125
Here's one that's a
little more interesting.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.900
For all n in the set
of natural numbers,

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:38.660
n squared plus n plus
41 is a prime number.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.520
I know I've used
some notation here.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.465
This is-- the upside down
A is the for all symbol.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.620
How many people have not
seen that symbol before?

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.310
A bunch of you.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.110
You're going to see a bunch
of symbols here first week.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.520
And that means for every
possible choice of n--

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.010
and this is in the natural
numbers, which is the set 0, 1,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.970
2, 3, and so forth.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.644
It's the natural numbers.

00:10:13.644 --> 00:10:15.560
It's basically the
integers, but not negative.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.790
So we're saying for every
natural number, i.e. for 0,

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.700
for 1, for 2, and for 3, and
so forth, this expression

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.540
is a prime.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.410
Now, a prime number
is a number that

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.830
is not divisible by any other
number besides itself and 1.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.850
So 1, 3, 5, 7 are prime.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.890
9 is not because it's 3 times 3.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.700
Now, this part here is
called the predicate.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:11:00.420
And a predicate is a
proposition whose truth

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:11.090
depends on the value of a
variable-- in this case, n.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:21.480
All right, this is referred to
as the universe of discourse.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.240
It's the space of all the
things we're talking about.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.230
We're only talking about
natural numbers here.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.140
This is called a quantifier.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.900
We'll see more
quantifiers later.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.820
All right, now to see if
this proposition is true,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.120
we need to make sure
that this predicate is

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.770
true for every natural number n.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.160
So let's see if
we can check that.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.140
Let's try some values.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.230
So we'll try n is 1,
2, 3, and so forth.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.390
And we'll compute n
squared plus n plus 41.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.890
And then we'll
check, is it prime?

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:12.202
So for n equals 0, n squared
plus n plus 41 is 41.

00:12:12.202 --> 00:12:13.405
Is 41 prime?

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.450
Yeah, nothing divides
41 but itself and 1.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.120
All right, let's try 1.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.845
1 squared plus 1 plus 41 is 43.

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:28.120
Is 43 prime?

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.400
Yes.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.050
Let's try 2.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.440
We get 4 plus 2 is
6 plus 41 is 47.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.230
Is 47 prime?

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.030
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.650
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.200
Looking good.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.640
3-- I got 9, 12, 53.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.600
Is 53 prime?

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.000
Yeah.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.810
And I could keep on going here.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.550
I could go down to 20.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.140
I get 420-- 461.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.150
In fact, that is a prime.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.410
And I could just
keep on going here.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.460
Go down to 39.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.967
I get 1,601.

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:07.550
You can check.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.880
That is a prime.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.120
The first 40 values of n,
the proposition is true.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.700
The predicate is true.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.640
It is prime.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.520
Now, this is a great example
because in a lot of fields--

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.560
physics, for example;
statistics, often-- you

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.720
checked 40 examples.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.040
That's above and beyond
the call of duty.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.820
It's always true.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.160
So yeah, this must
be true, right?

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.730
No, wrong.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.940
Often, you'll see this in
a lot of scientific fields.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.690
It is not true.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.220
Can anybody give
me an example of n

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.750
for which n squared plus
n plus 41 is not prime?

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.390
Yeah?

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.270
AUDIENCE: 40.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.720
PROFESSOR: 40, good.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.720
Let's see about 40.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:59.990
40 squared plus 40
plus 41 is 1,681.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.960
What's that equal?

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.070
41 squared.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.740
So it is not prime.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.830
Somebody give me an obvious
example where it's not prime.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.530
AUDIENCE: 41.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.330
PROFESSOR: 41--
yeah, 41 squared,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.480
we get everything
is divided by 41.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.990
But 40 is the first break-point.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:22.110
So the first 40 examples
work, and then it failed.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.570
So this proposition is
false, even though it

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.657
was looking pretty good.

00:14:28.657 --> 00:14:29.990
There's a reason I'm doing this.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.990
In fact, I'm going to
do it some more here.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.000
I'm going to beat you
over the head with it.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.353
Here's a famous in
mathematics statement.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:47.380
a to the fourth plus b to the
fourth plus c to the fourth

00:14:47.380 --> 00:15:01.200
equals d to the fourth has no
positive integer solutions.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.980
That is a proposition.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.160
Now, this proposition was
conjectured to be true by Euler

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.740
in 1769.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.570
Euler's a big honcho in math.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.970
We still talk about him
a lot even though he's

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.700
been dead for centuries.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.100
It was unsolved for
over 2 centuries.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.890
Mathematicians worked on it.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.280
It was finally disapproved
by a very clever fellow

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.090
named Noam Elkies 218 years
later after it was conjectured.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.100
He worked at that other
school down the street.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.200
And he came up with this.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.990
a equals 95,800.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.510
b equals 217,519.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.912
c equals 414,560.

00:15:49.912 --> 00:15:51.620
You don't have to
remember these numbers.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:57.217
We're not going to quiz
you on that-- 422,481.

00:15:57.217 --> 00:15:59.300
Now, he claims-- I've never
personally checked it,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.360
but presumably, people have--
you plug those in here,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.580
and you have an equality.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.850
So he says.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.340
So in fact, the
correct proposition

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:15.980
is there does exist a, b,
c, d in the positive natural

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.000
numbers such that a the fourth
plus b to the fourth plus

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.510
c to the fourth equals
d to the fourth.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:28.460
I used a new quantifier
here called there exists.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.870
Instead of an
upside down A, it's

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.030
a backwards E. Don't ask me why.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.960
That's what it is.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.040
The plus means you can't
have 0 or negative numbers.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.280
So these are the
positive natural numbers.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:51.080
And here's your predicate, which
of course, the truth of this

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.951
depends on the values
of a, b, c and d.

00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:57.200
It took a long time to figure
out that actually, there

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.817
was a solution here.

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:01.150
Obviously, everything they
tried until that time failed.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.316
Let me give you another one.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:24.085
313 x cubed plus y cubed equals
z cubed has no positive integer

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:24.585
solutions.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.850
This turns out to be false.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.580
But the shortest,
smallest counter-example

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.950
has over 1,000 digits.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:38.770
This one was easy.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.650
It only has six digits.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.560
So there's no way ever
you'd use a computer

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.600
to exhaustively search
1,000 digit numbers here

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.440
to show it's false.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.810
Now, of course, some of you are
probably thinking, why on earth

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:58.860
would I care if 313 times
x cubed plus y cubed equals

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.484
z cubed has a solution?

00:18:02.484 --> 00:18:04.150
And that probably
won't be the last time

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.310
that thought occurs to
you during the term.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.635
And why on earth
would anybody ever try

00:18:09.635 --> 00:18:13.320
to even find a solution to that?

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.830
I mean, mathematicians
are sort of a rare breed.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.417
Now, actually in
this case, that's

00:18:18.417 --> 00:18:19.625
really important in practice.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.280
This equation is an
example of what's

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.300
called an elliptic
curve-- elliptic curve.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.820
You study these if you're really
a specialist in mathematics

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.030
in graduate school,
or if you work

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.770
for certain
three-letter agencies

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.140
because it's central to
the understanding of how

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.670
to factor large integers.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.760
That means factoring,
showing that-- what was it--

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.916
1,681 is 41 times 41.

00:18:46.916 --> 00:18:50.380
And I said, OK, who
cares about factoring?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.880
Well, factoring is the
way to break cryptosystems

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.625
like RSA, which are
used for everything

00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:01.840
that we do electronically today.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.130
You have a Paypal account.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.230
You buy something online.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.710
You're using SSL.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.750
They're all using cryptosystems,
almost all of which

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.400
are based on number theory.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.130
And in particular, they're
based on factoring.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.570
And if you can find good
solutions to things like this,

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.260
or solutions to things
like this, all of a sudden,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.325
you can get an angle and
a wedge on factoring.

00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:24.700
And it's because
of that that now

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:30.940
RSA uses 1,000 digit
moduluses instead of hundred

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.844
digit moduluses like
they used to use,

00:19:32.844 --> 00:19:34.510
because people figured
out how to factor

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.430
and how to break
the cryptosystem.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.490
If you could break
those cryptosystems,

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.350
well, you can't rule the
world, but it's close.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.950
All right, so we'll
talk more about this

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.830
the week after next when
we do number theory,

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.020
and we work up to RSA and
how that cryptosystem works,

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.880
and why factoring
is so important.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.537
So yeah, you don't
have to really have

00:19:55.537 --> 00:19:56.370
to worry about this.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.661
But these things are important.

00:19:57.661 --> 00:20:01.750
And the bigger message is that
you don't just try a few cases,

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.610
and if it works,
you think it's done.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.906
That's not how the game
works in mathematics.

00:20:06.906 --> 00:20:08.280
You can get an
idea of maybe it's

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.390
true, but doesn't
tell you the answer.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.380
All right, let me
give you another one.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.785
This is another very famous
one that probably most of you

00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:19.830
have heard of.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:34.880
The regions in any map can
be colored in four colors

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:47.710
so that adjacent regions
have different colors.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.270
Like a map of the
United States--

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.860
every state gets a color.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.020
If two states share
a border, they

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.430
have different colors so
you can distinguish them.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.530
This is known as the
four color theorem.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.570
And it's very famous in
the popular literature.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.060
How many people have heard
of this theorem before?

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:05.680
Yeah, OK.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.334
So you've all heard of it.

00:21:07.334 --> 00:21:08.250
It has a long history.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.240
It was conjectured by somebody
named Guthrie in 1853.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.950
He's the first person to say
this ought to be possible.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:20.630
And there were many false
proofs over the ensuing century.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.510
One of the most convincing
was a proof using pictures

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:28.700
by Kempe in 1879,
26 years later.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.420
And this proof was
believed for over a decade.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.890
Mathematicians thought
the proof was right

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.570
until another mathematician
named Heawood found

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.270
a fatal flaw in the argument.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.510
Now, this proof
by Kempe consisted

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.204
of drawing pictures of what
maps have to look like.

00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:46.620
So he started by
saying, a map has

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.953
to look like one of these types.

00:21:47.953 --> 00:21:49.620
And he would draw
pictures of them.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.690
And then he argued that those
types that he drew pictures of,

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.580
it worked for.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:01.110
Proofs by picture are often
very convincing and very wrong.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.550
And I'm going to give you one
to start lecture next time.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.133
It'll be a proof by PowerPoint,
which is even worse than proof

00:22:06.133 --> 00:22:08.130
by picture.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.971
And it is compelling.

00:22:10.971 --> 00:22:13.220
And the point will to be to
show you proofs by picture

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.387
are generally not a good thing.

00:22:15.387 --> 00:22:16.970
Because your brain
just locks in-- oh,

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.010
that's what it has to look like.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.510
And you don't think about other
ways that it might look like.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.240
Now, the four color
theorem was finally

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.120
proved by Appel
and Haken in 1977,

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.970
but they had to use a computer
to check thousands of cases.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.510
Now, this was a little
disturbing to mathematicians,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.989
because how do they know the
computer did the right thing?

00:22:42.989 --> 00:22:44.780
Your colleague writes
a proof on the board.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.630
You can check it.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.630
But how do you know the
computer didn't mess up,

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.130
or not do some cases?

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.620
Now, everybody
believes it's true now.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.780
But it's unsatisfying.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:00.420
A few years ago, a 12-page
human proof was discovered,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.810
but it's not been verified.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.180
And people are very
suspicious of it

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.800
because the proof of
the main lemma says,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.740
quote, "details of this
lemma is left to the reader.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.509
See figure seven."

00:23:12.509 --> 00:23:14.300
That's what the main
lemma of the proof is.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.674
But people think
that maybe there

00:23:15.674 --> 00:23:19.240
were some good ideas there,
but very suspicious proof.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.430
All right, let's do another
one, another proposition--

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.800
also very famous.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:35.490
Every even integer
but 2-- actually,

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:41.875
positive integer but 2--
is the sum of two primes.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:53.025
For example, 24 is the sum of
11 and 13, which are prime.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:57.640
Anybody know?

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.635
Is this true or false,
this proposition?

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:04.370
Yeah?

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.156
AUDIENCE: I wish I knew.

00:24:05.156 --> 00:24:06.780
PROFESSOR: [LAUGHS]
Yeah, that's right.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.120
Me too.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.140
Nobody knows if this
is true or false.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.326
This is called
Goldbach's conjecture.

00:24:14.326 --> 00:24:19.510
It was conjectured by
Christian Goldbach in 1742.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.570
This is a really
simple proposition.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.850
And it's amazing it's not known.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.301
In fact, I spent a couple
years working on-- I thought,

00:24:28.301 --> 00:24:29.800
oh, well, this has
to be easy enough

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.550
to prove when I was younger,
and didn't get very far.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.010
So people still don't
know if it's true.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.270
And in fact, it was
listed by the Globe

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.360
as one of the great
unsolved mysteries.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.310
So if you get out this Globe
article here, one of the hand--

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.300
does everybody
have this handout?

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:48.800
You don't?

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800
We'll get it passed out.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.907
Somebody missing that handout
up over there and over here?

00:24:52.907 --> 00:24:54.490
All right, if we get
those passed out.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.260
Now, it lists the
three conjectures.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.610
Do you see Goldbach's
conjecture there?

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.240
Now, can anybody
point out something

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.509
that's a little disturbing
about what the Globe says

00:25:09.509 --> 00:25:10.675
about Goldbach's conjecture?

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.980
AUDIENCE: 9 as a prime number.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
gives the example.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.120
Like, instead of
24 is 11 plus 13,

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.410
it says 20 is the
sum of 9 and 11.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.860
Now, if we're allowed to
use things like 9 as primes,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.110
Goldbach's conjecture's
pretty easy to prove is true.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.517
This won't be the last
time we get examples

00:25:35.517 --> 00:25:36.350
from the literature.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.970
In fact, we're going
to do this a lot,

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.381
along this theme of, you cannot
believe everything you read.

00:25:41.381 --> 00:25:43.130
Now, the Globe is easy
pickings, but we'll

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.370
do some more
interesting ones later.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.850
Now, this article lists two
other famous conjectures

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:55.440
which most people believe to be
true-- the Riemann hypothesis

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.280
after an 1859 paper
written by Bernard Riemann

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.740
suggested that zeros in an
infinite series of numbers

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.170
known as a zeta function
form along a straight line

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.690
on that complex plane.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:11.350
The hypothesis has been proved
to 1.5 billion zeros, not far

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.860
enough to prove it completely.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.660
If they did 1.5
trillion zeros, it

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.230
wouldn't be far enough to
prove it completely, of course.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.510
And then the-- no, actually,
the Riemann hypothesis,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.920
a couple years ago,
somebody credible

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.150
claimed to have proved it.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.320
Proof turned out
not to be right.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.910
Then there's the
Poincare conjecture.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.570
Now, this one was finished off.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.090
It was proved to be true
in 2003 by a Russian named

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.250
Grigori Perelman.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.560
The conjecture says,
roughly speaking,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.180
that 3D objects without
holes, like no a doughnut,

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.200
are equivalent to the sphere.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.350
They can sort of be
deformed into a sphere.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.700
This is known to be true in
four dimensions and higher,

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.616
but nobody could prove
it for three dimensions

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.490
until Perelman came along.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.880
Now, there's a bit of a
controversy around this guy.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.290
He had an 80-page proof, but
didn't have all the details.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:07.880
So then other teams
of mathematicians

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:12.770
got together and wrote
350 pages of details.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.080
And then most people
believe now that it's right,

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.940
and that his original
proof might not

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.420
have had all the details, but
he had the right structure

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.540
of the proof.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.040
So he won prizes for this.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.090
He won the highest prize in
mathematics, the Fields Medal.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.660
And just earlier this year,
he was awarded the $1 million

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.450
Millennium Prize.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.250
And there's about
six problems or so

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.750
that if you solve one of them,
the Clay Institute gives you

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:36.690
a million dollars.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.100
And he's the first one to
win the million dollars.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.440
Now, the guy's a little strange.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.820
He rejected the Fields Medal and
refused to go to the ceremony

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.350
where he was being honored.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.440
And he's recently rejected
the Millennium prize.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.970
And anyway, this area's
murky, and we have an expert

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.929
to explain it all
for us on video,

00:27:56.929 --> 00:27:57.970
which I thought I'd show.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.550
All right, let's do
a simpler one here.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:19.620
For all n in Z, n greater
than or equal to 2

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:24.240
implies n squared is
greater than or equal to 4.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.060
Now, Z, we use for the integers.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:37.440
And so that would be 0, 1, minus
1, 2, minus 2, and so forth.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.645
And this symbol here is implies.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.100
I In fact, one
thing you can notice

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.670
when you read the text is we
use different notation there

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.960
as the standard than
I will use in lecture.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.060
And there's lots of
ways of doing it.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.300
You could have a double
arrow, a single arrow.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.000
You could write out
implies every time

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.200
as it's done in the text.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.783
And it doesn't really
matter which one

00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.700
you want to use as
long as you use one

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.630
of the conventions for implies.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.515
And let me define
what implies means.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:43.830
An implication p implies q is
said to be true if p is false

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:48.440
or q is true, either one.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:55.480
So we can write this down
in terms of a truth table

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.800
as follows.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.680
You have the values of p and q.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.048
And I'll give the
value of p implies q.

00:30:03.048 --> 00:30:11.575
If p is true and q is true,
what about p implies q?

00:30:11.575 --> 00:30:16.330
It's true, because q is
true in the definition.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.594
If p is true and q is false?

00:30:19.594 --> 00:30:20.260
AUDIENCE: False.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.910
PROFESSOR: False.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:23.880
P is false.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.610
Q is true.

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:28.190
True.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:32.440
What about false and false?

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.230
It's true.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.760
Even though this is false,
as long as p is false,

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.790
p implies q is true.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.520
So this is important
to remember.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:49.800
False implies anything is true,
which is a little strange.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.880
There's a famous expression.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.819
If pigs could fly,
I would be king.

00:30:55.819 --> 00:30:56.360
Is that true?

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.020
Sort of.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:07.740
In fact, this
statement, pigs fly

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:18.400
implies I'm king-- that's
true, because pigs don't fly.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.420
Doesn't matter whether or
not I'm king, which I'm not.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.010
Since pigs don't fly,
even though that's false,

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.414
the implication is true.

00:31:27.414 --> 00:31:29.580
Now, some of you have worked
on these things before.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.470
It's second nature.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.190
If you haven't,
you want to start

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.100
getting familiar with that.

00:31:36.504 --> 00:31:37.545
Let's do another example.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:50.776
What about this proposition?

00:31:53.850 --> 00:32:00.610
For all integers, n in Z, n
greater than or equal to 2--

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:05.350
this is if and only if--
n squared greater than

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.890
or equal to 4.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:08.590
Is that true?

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.600
Is n only bigger
than 2 if and only

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.030
if n squared is bigger than 4?

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.100
It's false.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.490
What's an example of n
for which that's false?

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.620
Negative, all right?

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.980
So it's false.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.560
n equals negative 3, all right?

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.620
Negative 3 squared is
bigger than or equal to 4,

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.620
but negative 3 is not
bigger than or equal to 2.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:39.670
And in fact this if
and only if means you

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:43.660
have to have an
implication both ways.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.625
So you have to check
both ways for it.

00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:48.000
So let's do the truth table--
extend this truth table out

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.340
here to do the truth table
for p if and only if q.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.790
So here are p and q.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.800
Is q implies p
true for this row?

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.760
Does true imply true?

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.000
Yeah.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.891
False implies true?

00:33:20.891 --> 00:33:22.120
That's true.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.570
True does not apply false.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.160
That's false.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.660
And false implies false.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:33.500
And so now, we can see
where p is if and only if q.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.860
If they're both true,
then it's true here.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.660
What about here?

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.670
Is p true if and only if
q is true in this case?

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.190
No, because p implies q is
false, but q implies p is true.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.980
So it's false.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.730
False here.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.490
I made a mistake there, right?

00:33:56.490 --> 00:34:00.070
That was true-- oops.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.900
And true if and
only if true, OK.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.240
They're both true, so we're OK.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.260
So p if and only if q is
true when they're both true

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.499
or both false.

00:34:09.499 --> 00:34:10.744
And that's it.

00:34:10.744 --> 00:34:13.889
If they're different,
then it's not true.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:17.860
The key here is to
always check both ways.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.139
So if you're asked to
prove an if and only if,

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.037
you have to prove that
way, and that way.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:30.239
We've just done about
15 propositions.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.620
Is every sentence a proposition?

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:36.570
Yes?

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.388
No?

00:34:37.388 --> 00:34:37.929
AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:38.512
PROFESSOR: No.

00:34:38.512 --> 00:34:41.240
What's an example of something
that's no a proposition?

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.659
AUDIENCE: This
statement is false.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:43.409
PROFESSOR: A what?

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:45.420
AUDIENCE: This
statement is false.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.719
PROFESSOR: This
statement is false.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:48.590
That's true.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:52.020
Well, it's true it's
not a proposition.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.971
Because if it were true,
it wouldn't be false.

00:34:53.971 --> 00:34:55.429
And if was false,
then it'd be true

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:56.909
and you'd have a contradiction.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.850
So it's neither true nor false.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:00.579
What's a more simple
example of something

00:35:00.579 --> 00:35:01.620
that's not a proposition?

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.069
AUDIENCE: This is a tissue.

00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:05.484
Isn't that a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:05.484 --> 00:35:06.940
PROFESSOR: Ooh.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:11.470
Boy, I would have said
that's true in some world.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.214
Because yeah, that's a tissue.

00:35:13.214 --> 00:35:14.255
So it's a true statement.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:17.670
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:18.641
PROFESSOR: Hello.

00:35:18.641 --> 00:35:19.140
That's good.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.590
That's neither true
or false, yeah.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.720
A question.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.080
Who are you-- neither
true nor false.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.000
So not everything
is a proposition.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.750
But in this course,
pretty much everything

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.620
we deal with will
be a proposition.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.166
All right, so that's
it for propositions.

00:35:34.166 --> 00:35:35.415
Any questions on propositions?

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.315
Next, we're going to
talk about axioms.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.660
Now, the good news is that
axioms are the same thing,

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.920
really, as propositions.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.130
The only difference is that
axioms are propositions

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.470
that we just assume are true.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:16.470
An axiom is a proposition
that is assumed to be true.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.570
There's no proof that
an axiom is true.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:26.740
You just assume it because
you think it's reasonable.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.430
In fact, the word
"axiom" comes from Greek.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.250
It doesn't mean to be true.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.180
It means to think
worthy-- something

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.950
you think is worthy enough
to be assumed to be true.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.780
Now, a lot of times, you'll hear
people say-- sometimes, we'll

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.000
even say it to you--
don't make assumptions

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.150
when you're doing math.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.774
No, that's not true.

00:36:47.774 --> 00:36:49.690
You have to make assumptions
when you do math.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.570
Otherwise, you can't
do anything because you

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.900
have to start with some axioms.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.240
The key in math is to identify
what your assumptions are

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.450
so people can see them.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:03.350
And the idea is that
when you do a proof,

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:06.634
anybody who agrees with your
assumptions or your axioms

00:37:06.634 --> 00:37:07.550
can follow your proof.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.660
And they have to agree
with your conclusion.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.210
Now, they might disagree
with your axioms,

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:15.810
in which case, they're not
going to buy your proof.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.020
Now, there are lots of
axioms used in math.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:31.670
For example, if a equals b and
b equals c, then a equals c.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.250
There is no proof of that.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.090
But it seems pretty good.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:41.580
And so we just throw it in the
bucket of axioms and use it.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:47.210
Now, axioms can be contradictory
in different contexts.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:49.340
Here's a good example.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:56.220
In Euclidean geometry,
there's a central axiom that

00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:11.420
says given a line L
and a point p not on L,

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:22.090
there is exactly one
line through p parallel

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:31.280
to L. You all saw this in
geometry in middle school,

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.020
right?

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.228
You've got a point in a line.

00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:35.160
There's exactly another
line through the point

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.220
that's parallel to the line.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.600
Now, there's also a field
called spherical geometry.

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.820
And there, you have an
axiom that contradicts this.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.220
It says, given a line L
and a point p not on L,

00:38:52.220 --> 00:39:01.840
there is no line through p
parallel to L on the sphere.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:09.270
There's a field called
hyperbolic geometry.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:11.190
And there, there's
an axiom that says,

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.800
given a line L and
a point p not on L,

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:26.632
there are infinitely many
lines through p parallel to L.

00:39:26.632 --> 00:39:27.690
So how can this be?

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.870
Does that mean one of these
fields is totally bogus,

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.620
or two of them are?

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.470
Because they've got
contradictory axes.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.860
That's OK.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.230
Just whatever field you're
in, state you're axioms.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.610
And they do make sense
in their various fields.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:43.794
This is planar geometry.

00:39:43.794 --> 00:39:44.710
This is on the sphere.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.880
And this is on
hyperbolic geometry.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.990
They make sense
in those contexts.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:54.750
So you can have more or less
whatever axioms you want.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.070
There are sort of two
guiding principles to axioms.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:22.305
Axioms should be-- it's called
consistent-- and complete.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:39.880
Now, a set of
axioms is consistent

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:48.300
if no proposition can be proved
to be both true and false.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.640
And you can see why
that's important.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:02.120
If you spend three weeks
proving something's true,

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.880
and the next day, somebody
proves it's also false,

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.020
I mean, the whole
thing was pointless.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.630
So it only makes sense if
your axioms, as a group,

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.140
are consistent.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:26.610
A set of axioms is
said to be complete

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:35.800
if it can be used to
prove every proposition is

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.060
either true or false.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.930
Now, this is desirable
because it means-- well,

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.450
you can solve every problem.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.314
Everything is-- you
can prove it's true,

00:41:56.314 --> 00:41:57.480
or you can prove it's false.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.010
You can get to the end.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:05.280
Now, you'd think
it shouldn't be too

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.230
hard to get a set of axioms
that satisfies these two

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.730
basic properties.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:12.490
You're allowed to choose
whatever you want, really.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.990
Just, you don't want to be
creating contradictions.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.762
And you want a set
that's powerful enough

00:42:16.762 --> 00:42:18.970
that allows you to prove
everything is true or false,

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.740
one of the two.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.350
Turned out not to be
so easy to do this.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:27.800
And in fact, many logicians
spent their careers--

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.700
famous logicians--
trying to find

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.130
a set of axioms,
just one set, that

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.529
was consistent and complete.

00:42:34.529 --> 00:42:36.320
In fact, Russell and
Whitehead are probably

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.820
the two most famous.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.080
They spent their entire
careers doing this,

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.270
and they never got there.

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.570
Then one day, this guy
named Kurt Godel showed up.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:49.940
And in the 1930s, he
proved it's not possible

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.060
that there exists any
set of axioms that are

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.450
both consistent and complete.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:59.560
Now, this discovery
devastated the field.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.270
It was a huge discovery.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.670
Imagine poor Russell
and Whitehead.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:08.035
They spent their entire careers
going after this holy grail.

00:43:08.035 --> 00:43:09.660
Then Kurt shows up
and said, hey, guys.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.580
There's no grail.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.910
It doesn't exist.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.580
And that's a little
depressing-- pretty bad day

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:15.840
when that happened.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.000
Now, it's an amazing
result, because it

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.600
says if you want consistency--
and that's a must--

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.630
there will be true facts
that you will never

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.052
be able to prove.

00:43:26.052 --> 00:43:27.510
We're not going to
prove that here.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.210
It's proved in a logic course.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.740
For example, maybe
Goldbach's conjecture is true

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.960
and it is impossible to prove.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.810
Now, we're going to
try not to assign any

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:40.210
of those problems for homework.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.182
And in fact, they do exist.

00:43:42.182 --> 00:43:42.890
It's complicated.

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:47.432
You can state a problem that you
can't prove is true or false.

00:43:47.432 --> 00:43:49.390
And you may be thinking
that from time to time.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:50.348
Hey, it's one of those.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:57.140
Remember when your parents told
you if you work hard enough,

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.270
you can do anything?

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.890
They were wrong.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.270
All right, that's
enough for now.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:06.020
And we'll do more
of this next time.
