00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.490
PROFESSOR: The equivalent cost
of manufacturing in China,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.910
as best as we can determine,
is in the order of $1, $1.30,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.010
$1.50-- somewhere in that
range with the error bars.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.249
So keep those numbers in your
head as we dive into price.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.790
Because now we're
going to be talking

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.760
about what the market
is offering to pay

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.740
and what that spread is
between the cost and the price.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.330
So you have, in your slide deck,
a list of different websites.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.719
I guess you have web
[? e-sits. ?] You have

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.010
websites, email list serves,
blogs, and Twitter feeds--

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.630
different sources of information
for collecting data from PV.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.050
And I should add one more
to this list, which wasn't

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.910
on there, but should be there.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.535
PVinsights.com.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.540
This is where you can find
it pretty up-to-date spot

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.720
prices for wafers, cells,
modules, and so forth.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.160
Does anybody know
what a spot price is?

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.300
What does it mean, a spot price?

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.920
Spot price means I'm
desperate to buy.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.150
I need to buy it right now.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.983
I pick up a phone and
call somebody and say,

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm willing to pay you.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.750
So there's no long
term contract involved.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.570
It's usually a one-time deal.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.540
That's a spot price.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.206
A long term contract,
on the other hand,

00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:41.222
says, no, no, really.

00:01:41.222 --> 00:01:41.930
I have a factory.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.790
It's 100 megawatts.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.630
And I need wafer
supply for five years.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.850
Let's lock ourselves
into a price.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.880
Maybe we visit it
every 2 and 1/2 years,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.830
but that's a long term contract.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.940
So these are spot
prices and they provide

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.830
a variety of information.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.209
The information
for today is free.

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.750
If you want historical
data, you have

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.900
to sign up, become
a member, and pay.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.850
But there are other websites
like this-- various consulting

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.970
groups-- that acquire and
gather information, PVinsights.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.990
So you have a variety
of different sites

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.620
to grab information
that could be

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.620
useful for your class projects.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.010
We're going to talk again
about the dynamics of price.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.070
And that is driven, in
large part, by-- well,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.430
we agreed to call
it different things.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.930
Support mechanisms, tax breaks,
incentives-- but in reality,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.270
they're support for PV.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.890
Recognizing that with
$1.30, $1.10 cost,

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.230
and then you add on top
of that the profit margin,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.860
even if you assume a very
meager margin of 15%,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.870
you're-- and then
the balances systems,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.870
and then the installation
costs on top of that--

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.930
you're not reaching grid parity
in the majority of markets.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.200
Not with that sort of
cost structure today.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.030
With innovation
and moving forward

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.520
into the future and
scale-- we'll get there,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.200
I'm fairly confident--
but today, we

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.770
don't have the cost structure
necessary to match, say,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.590
a subsidized
coal-fired power plant.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.110
So there are a variety of
different support mechanisms,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.904
a variety of different subsidies
in different countries,

00:03:09.904 --> 00:03:11.820
and different states
within the United States.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.111
And you can think about these
as the carrot, the stick,

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:14.800
and the hybrid.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.400
The carrot meaning the margin
enhancement, the stick being

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.800
the penalty if you
produce too much carbon,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.662
for instance, and some variety
of mixtures between the two.

00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:29.120
So in terms of
margin enhancement--

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.010
the carrot-- what
mechanisms exist?

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.360
Let me break it down
very simply into-- we'll

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.550
look in two
different categories.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.380
We'll look at what the United
States has mostly done,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.850
which are tax relief and
grants and soft loans.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.770
So let's describe
what that means.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.550
When I bought the panels on
top of the house in 2007,

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.840
we paid out of the box somewhere
in the order of $7 to $8

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.070
per watt peak.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.040
And after tax rebate coming
from the federal government,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.110
and some additional support
from the state of Massachusetts,

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.270
the final price tag wound up
being from say $18,000 plus

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.960
down to about
$12,000 to $14,000.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.660
And then there's revenue coming
in from offsets and so forth.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.700
So this is a one-time deal.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.717
I could have installed
those panels in my basement

00:04:24.717 --> 00:04:26.300
and still gotten the
tax break, right?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.750
Because it's per watt peak,
not per kilowatt hour produced.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.650
The rebates based
on carbon emissions

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.610
is based on the amount
of energy it produces.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.140
That gives you an incentive
to maximize the efficiency

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.266
of the installation.

00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:39.890
But just a one-time
tax rebate doesn't.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.390
However, what the one-time
tax rebate allows you to do

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.790
is decrease the
upfront sticker price.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.200
So if I'm trying to sell
you system on your house,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.780
US installers are
convinced that it's

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.190
a lot easier to
sell you the system

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.130
if the price tag is lower.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.760
If I can say, well this is
the real cost, but wait, wait,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.610
there's more.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.530
We'll give you this tax rebate,
this tax rebate, draw a line.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.740
The final amount you pay is
this lower amount right here.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.460
The other mechanism of margin
enhancement, if you will,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.310
is what's called
a feed-in tariff.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.460
Now, a feed-in tariff
works as follows.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.536
A feed-in tariff says, OK,
if you're paying-- let's say,

00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:19.830
in the state of Massachusetts,
we don't have one.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.038
We don't have a feed-in
tariff here in Massachusetts.

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:23.460
But imagine if we did.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.080
You, as a residential
customer, are paying $0.18

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.400
per kilowatt hour
for your electricity.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.241
But if you have solar panels
on your roof, the utility,

00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:33.990
if you will-- the state
of Massachusetts--

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.850
is willing to pay you $0.30
per kilowatt hour for that PV

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.660
electricity.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.310
Recognizing the additional
value that that PV

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.230
is adding to the state.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.690
Reducing the need for
additional transmission lines,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.460
reducing the amount
of investment

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.170
in new coal-fired power plants,
reducing the health detriment

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.260
to the local communities around
the coal plants, and so forth.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.060
So a feed-in tariff is meant
to give an incentive-- a market

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.900
pull incentive, if you will--
to install PV on your house.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.920
Or in a field.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.350
And this is the mechanism that
has been in use in Germany.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.870
And because it's a
market-driven mechanism,

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.260
it rewards the most efficient
systems that are out there.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.210
If you install that
system in your basement,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.920
you're not going to be
producing kilowatt hours,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.461
and hence you're
not going to benefit

00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:22.830
from the feed-in tariff.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.950
Now it's a tricky business
to decide where exactly

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.560
to fit that feed-in tariff.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.130
Right?

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.540
If you go too low, people
aren't going to move.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.540
They're going to say,
eh, no, not enough.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.660
Not enough to make me
want to install solar.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.600
If the feed-in
tariff is too high,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.290
you're going to get this
massive onrush of people

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.780
coming to install solar.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.330
And now you're going to
have to finance it, right?

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.540
And the money has to
come from somewhere.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.230
In Germany, the money
comes from the rate payers,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.690
not from the state.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.240
Which means that if you install
solar panels on your house,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.330
all of us have to help
pay for the electricity

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.170
that you sell back to the grid.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.650
So our rate goes up from $0.18
per kilowatt hour to, say,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.760
18.2 cents per kilowatt hour.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.800
In the beginning, we
don't notice it at all.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.100
But then if Joe starts putting
solar panels up, as well,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.960
and then, let's say, 50%
of us put solar panels up,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.060
now obviously we're
paying a lot more.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.276
And it gives more of an
incentive for more people

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:21.900
to put the solar
panels up on the roof.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.275
And of course,
the price goes up.

00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:27.360
So the feed-in
tariff is a very--

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.030
it is a market-driven incentive.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.720
And hence, it is very skillful
at rewarding the most efficient

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.620
installations.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.120
But from a government
point of view,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.210
it requires very
structured, rigorous,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.540
and deaf-to-manipulation
of the feed-in tariff

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.940
rate-- the decline of the rate
versus time-- to ensure that A,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.290
the installers aren't reaping
an enormous profit, and B,

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.610
that the system doesn't become
unsustainable over time.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.310
That the burden
on the rate payers

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.070
is not so great that
they're shouldered

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.180
in for 20 years paying these
excessively high rates.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:08.010
So it rewards first adopters,
it allows the market to predict,

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.760
versus rate of growth, what
the reward rate will be.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.110
And it allows you to
glide into grid parity.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.040
So we're at a situation today
where we're not at grid parity.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.670
In 10, 20 years, we're
likely to be there.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.040
And so the declining rate
of the feed-in tariff

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.110
allows you to glide back in.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.185
In the United States, the
tax rebate, unfortunately--

00:08:30.185 --> 00:08:31.810
because of the way
our political system

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.220
works-- it tends to get renewed
in a very frequent rate.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.059
Every two years, it
seems, it's going up

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.283
for debate and discussion.

00:08:39.283 --> 00:08:40.199
Should we continue it?

00:08:40.199 --> 00:08:41.282
Should we not continue it?

00:08:41.282 --> 00:08:44.550
It becomes a big political
struggle just to get it passed.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.110
And as a result,
everybody uses up

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.740
their energy trying
to pass this thing

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.770
and renew it, as
opposed to saying,

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.784
gee, what's the best way
to decrease this over time

00:08:53.784 --> 00:08:55.700
so that we can kind of
glide into grid parity?

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.800
So we have some
issues in the US,

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.830
more related to how our
political system doesn't work.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.990
But there are examples of
this throughout the world,

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.890
in terms of what are
states and countries doing

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.580
to enhance the margins to create
market-pull incentives to allow

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.130
solar to be installed
on the grid?

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.380
And the panels
that are installed

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.910
could come from anywhere.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.830
They could be produced
in Guam and they could

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.920
qualify for the feed-in tariff.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.080
So it doesn't discriminate
against particular regions

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.410
of the world.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.860
Another thing to add
here is that this is just

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:42.150
the support from the state,
from the public sector.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.440
From the private sector,
what is possible?

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.070
Well what is possible is
what's called a power purchase

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.070
agreement.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.860
And this was alluded
to during our tour.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.640
What is a power
purchase agreement?

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.542
A power purchase agreement is--
instead of you buying a system

00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:58.250
and putting it up on
your roof and having

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.690
to pay all that money
up front, what you do

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.700
is you enter an agreement
with the installer.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.959
They will put the panels
up on your roof for free

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:08.250
because they're getting the
financing, say, from Morgan

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.610
Stanley, from the Bank of Joe.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.612
So the Bank of Joe is financing
the panels on your roof.

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:15.070
So the panels went
up on your roof.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.150
You didn't pay a penny.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.720
But you inked an agreement
with me, the installer,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.220
because I just borrowed money
from Joe at a certain interest

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:21.724
rate.

00:10:21.724 --> 00:10:23.140
And you inked an
agreement with me

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.500
that you'll pay a certain
amount for your electricity

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.630
over the next 10, 15, 20
years, however long it

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.040
is-- usually 12.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.062
And that rate may be
a little bit higher

00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:34.770
than what it is today,
but it's certainly

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.630
going to be lower if current
price inflation continues

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.870
for the price of electricity.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.450
It will certainly be lower than
what the price of electricity

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.900
will be in 12 years.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.760
And so you'll make money.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.620
I'll make money because there's
a spread between the rate

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.570
at which I'm borrowing
the money from the bank

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.110
and what you're paying
me for those panels--

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.200
for renting the panels
on the roof, if you will.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.340
For buying the electricity
from those panels.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.510
So everybody's making money.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:10:59.720
And the bank's making
money, obviously,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.180
because they're charging an
interest rate on the loan.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.000
And so with those
financing schemes,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.540
where it's called a power
purchase agreement, bank loans

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.910
the money to the installer,
the installer loans the panels

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.490
on the roof of the
customer, and the customer

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.910
pays a fixed price
for the electricity.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.670
That allows everybody to
make money from day one,

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.720
as long as there's
capital in play.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.410
It requires capital
to be in play,

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.290
meaning it requires
the Bank of Joe

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.920
to be willing to lend
money to me, the installer.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.880
If the Bank of Joe
doesn't want to lend,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.080
then that isn't an option.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.060
And so you see many of these
very large deals being forged

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.900
with the investment banks
between large installers-- say,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.410
SunPower, SunEdison, and so
forth-- in New York City.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.630
It's becoming an
increasingly popular form

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.050
of financing solar panels.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.910
You may stand to make more
money as an individual

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.660
by buying the panels up
front because then you reap

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.890
the entire benefit
of your investment.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.659
You're not sharing
the investment benefit

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:01.450
with the installer.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.170
You're not sharing
the investment benefit

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.190
with the bank.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.260
But that requires,
again, access to capital.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.716
And not everybody has a spare
$14,000, $15,000 lying around

00:12:10.716 --> 00:12:12.020
to put solar on the roof.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.346
Question.

00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:16.244
AUDIENCE: What's the
incentive of the, I guess,

00:12:16.244 --> 00:12:18.176
whoever's installing
the panels on

00:12:18.176 --> 00:12:20.108
to buy the electricity from you.

00:12:20.108 --> 00:12:24.470
Why would you buy it
from you, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:30.250
So over the past 10 years--
say, from 2000 to 2009--

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.150
in the state of Massachusetts,
the price of electricity

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.250
increased by 15%.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.754
So if you compare what did
it take per kilowatt hour

00:12:38.754 --> 00:12:40.420
at the beginning and
the end-- normalize

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.810
for inflation, 15% inflation--
in the price of electricity.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.480
And there are a variety
of reasons for that.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.770
We're at the end of a
natural gas pipeline,

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.310
so even if the price of
natural gas goes down,

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.490
it takes a lot to get it to us.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.140
Sometimes shipments
go in by boat.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.250
Other times, up the
actual pipeline itself.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.980
And then, other forms
of fossil fuel-- oil,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.050
especially-- has
experienced a rise

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.860
in prices of the last few years.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.179
And so for a variety of
reasons, including those

00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:10.970
and including a difficulty
in transmission,

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.870
and including limited new
power plants coming online,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.340
the price has gone up.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.890
And as a result, if
you project forward,

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:25.360
you could say, OK, let's
hedge our bets here.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.710
We can estimate that the price
is going to go up another 15%

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.080
between now and the next decade.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.620
So what I'm going
to do is to say,

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.890
this is the price today,
this is the price tomorrow--

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.380
in 10 years, right?

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.730
I'm going to sell
you electricity here.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.710
And so it's almost
like the deal--

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:46.420
I don't know if anybody signs
up for the natural gas lock-in

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.300
price during winter with NStar.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.050
You probably see the
envelope in the mail,

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.216
or maybe your landlord does.

00:13:51.216 --> 00:13:55.410
But NStar-- the utility
company around this area--

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.960
will allow you to lock in
a price for natural gas

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.440
per therm-- per unit
of natural gas--

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.000
over the winter, that is
slightly above the market

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.290
rate in the fall.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.030
With the understanding
that prices

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.030
tend to spike during winter,
and you're able to hedge,

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.770
you're able to reduce risk.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.560
And so really what it is is
a risk mitigation strategy.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.280
And it's good enough
for most people.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.560
I know two people
on our street alone

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.260
have entered power
purchase agreements

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.600
as means of financing
their solar installations.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.526
So let's discriminate once
again between the private sector

00:14:29.526 --> 00:14:31.400
that's trying to sell
you the panels-- I say,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.000
Omar, you have to buy my panels.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.530
Let me sweeten the deal here.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.150
You don't have to
pay a penny upfront.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.150
We'll introduce a power
purchase agreement.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.200
Versus what the state
is doing, right?

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.200
Whether that's the national
government or the state level

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.790
is doing to try to get the
installers and other industries

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.340
growing within
their organization.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.300
And as well, several
of the EU states

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.170
meeting their Kyoto
Protocol obligations

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.410
to reduce carbon emissions
by a certain amount by 2020.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.700
So we're going to do a deep
dive into the German case,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.180
just because it is so
interesting and so exemplary,

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.990
in terms of increasing the
amount of PV on the grid.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.460
And one thing to
note, just upfront,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.500
this is the insulation
map of Europe.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.720
Insulation being
the solar radiance,

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.880
the total solar
resource available,

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.641
shown in this barely
distinguishable little legend

00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:23.140
down here.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.380
Blue being low, red being high.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.390
And Germany is
right here, as they

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.230
would say, from herzen Europas,
from the heart of Europe

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.150
right there.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.140
Right in the middle.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.260
And this is the insulation
comparison, again,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.610
between Germany
the United States.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.920
Same scale over here.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.470
A lot less solar resource
in Germany, even than

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.770
in the Northeastern part
of the United States.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.011
Yet there was about half of
all solar panels installed here

00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:52.510
last year.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.630
Why?

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.030
Well first off, it's
high electricity prices.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.710
Secondly, there is
a feed-in tariff

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.010
that gives an
incentive for solar

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.310
to be installed on a grid.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.110
So what I'm going to do is
go over several slides coming

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:09.152
from the ministry in Germany,
describing the growth of solar

00:16:09.152 --> 00:16:11.110
and the growth of other
renewables on the grid,

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.890
in response to this
feed-in tariff.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.770
So the renewable
energy resources,

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.220
if you will, as a share
of the total energy

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:23.110
supply in Germany--
the goal by 2020

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.080
is this white bar right here.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.520
And if we look at the
share of renewable sources

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.550
in total gross
electricity consumption,

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.040
you can see that it's
getting there, right?

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.140
17% versus a minimum of 35%.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.420
So working toward those
targets pretty well.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:47.160
And climbing from 2000 to 2010--
more than doubling, almost

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.760
tripling.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.030
This is the electricity,
heat supply,

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.227
and fuel supply breakdown.

00:16:53.227 --> 00:16:55.060
If we just look at the
electricity component

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.460
right here, since that's where
PV falls and contributes,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.780
you can see it's growing.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.670
What you have to keep
in mind is this 17%

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.290
of electricity
consumption coming

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:15.000
from renewables-- this
17% is this amount here,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.109
the yellow bar.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.240
And we're looking at
something in the range

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:24.220
of 103 terawatt hours over
the course of a year in 2010.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.950
And out of those
103 terawatt hours,

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:31.730
breaking it out into PV,
biomass, hydro, and wind,

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.860
you can see that PV has
accounted for a relatively

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.400
small fraction of that total.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.260
The largest, by
far, has been wind.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:45.420
Wind has reached lower
prices of electricity

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.400
faster than solar has.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.560
Differences between the
technology, so we say.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.980
And as a result, the
grid penetration of wind

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.550
has preceded that of solar.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.206
But solar is
growing quite a bit.

00:17:57.206 --> 00:17:59.080
And this is averaged
over the entire country.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.246
And as I mentioned before,
there are certain regions

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:04.840
within Germany, as you
might guess-- down here,

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.300
for instance-- that have
experienced larger grid

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.034
penetration of
solar than others.

00:18:10.034 --> 00:18:11.950
Just because they have
a larger solar resource

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:12.700
available to them.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.180
So this is the little
fraction here-- growing--

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.860
of solar electricity.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.490
These here are the
different legislations

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.200
that are being passed,
regulating the feed-in tariff.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.837
Now, the feed-in tariff is
scheduled to reduce gradually

00:18:31.837 --> 00:18:32.420
for each year.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.430
Let me show you how that works.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.060
We'll go back to
this German energy

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:43.980
blog by two of our energy
law experts in Germany.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.710
And this describes for you
the German feed-in tariffs

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.470
as of 2010.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.510
The Renewable Energy Sources
act-- essentially, one of those

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.440
legislations that have
passed-- and it just

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.140
shows you what you
can expect over

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.490
a variety of different sectors.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.770
Hydro, landfill, gas.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.200
And you can see, it's broken
into very specific details.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.180
Different sizes of
installations, different types

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.470
of plants and so forth.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:14.870
This is bio, geothermal,
onshore wind, offshore wind,

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.360
solar radiation,
roof-mounted facilities,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.130
electricity used within
the building facility,

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:26.580
freestanding facilities,
and digression.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:32.000
Digression means, how much
does it go down per year?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.880
This is based on their best
estimate for the growth

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.900
of grid penetration of PV.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.610
They're trying to guess
in the future, how much PV

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.230
is going to come onto the
grid by a certain date?

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.590
And hence, what the
price will be, as well.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.660
And thus, reduce their
feed-in tariff accordingly.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.060
And since it's impossible
to look into a crystal ball

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.200
and nail it-- especially
since this is a nonlinear

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.830
system-- the price depends
on the feed-in tariff,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.790
the feed-in tariff depends
on the price, right?

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.250
So there's a little bit of
that interaction going on.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.330
They have to reassess,
from time to time, what

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.060
the new rates are going to be.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.849
And that's why you have
these various-- well, aside

00:20:09.849 --> 00:20:12.140
from the initial-- you have
these various reevaluations

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.950
from time to time, looking
at the feed-in tariff.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.560
Now, what has happened
more recently--

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.940
there was a reevaluation
in January 2009.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.330
Another mid-2010 that
decreased it even further.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.035
So more recently--
this, unfortunately,

00:20:27.035 --> 00:20:28.850
only goes to 2010--
but more recently,

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.970
there have been more
significant, stronger cuts

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:37.104
to the feed-in tariff in Germany
in response to a few things.

00:20:37.104 --> 00:20:38.520
So let me go over
this real quick.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.990
I'll get back to
that in a second.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.610
First off, this is the payment
of fees in millions of s

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.730
versus time that the rate
payers are paying in total.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.210
So that winds up being
something in the order of 135

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.187
s per head in Germany.

00:20:54.187 --> 00:20:56.520
That's not spread equally
amongst everybody-- per year--

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.353
that's not spread equally
amongst everybody.

00:20:58.353 --> 00:21:01.514
That's, as well, their
industry bears more,

00:21:01.514 --> 00:21:03.430
obviously than the
residential customer would.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.080
But it's a line item of
a few s on your utility

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.670
bill per month as a customer.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.020
And that begins to add up.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:16.680
So Germany has begun putting on
the brakes on the incentives.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.140
And further, if they
look at how much they've

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.340
installed versus other
countries-- again,

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.860
this is the same chart
we showed last class--

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.424
their portion of all new
installations is very large.

00:21:28.424 --> 00:21:30.840
And so they began looking
around to the rest of the world,

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.370
saying, hey folks, we don't
have a lot of sun here.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.820
Why aren't you doing your part
to put solar on your grids?

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.040
Compounded by the
fact that now they

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.990
have a growing percentage
of manufacturing

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.220
that's not in Germany.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.280
The percentage of German
manufacturing of the PV

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.359
modules themselves has
stayed more or less flat.

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:51.150
And so Germany's sitting
here thinking, OK,

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.430
we're in a financial
crisis right now.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.240
Something has to give.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.270
Let's put a damper on this
feed-in tariff for a little bit

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.410
until the situation
straightens itself out

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:08.290
and until there's more growth
in other markets besides just

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.270
Germany.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.420
Let's try to reduce
the incentive

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.680
that we give to
put PV on our grid

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.640
and maybe increase the share
of PV going onto US, China,

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.100
and so forth-- other big
markets around the world.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.670
So that we're not bearing the
sole burden of trying to reduce

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.260
the cost of PV to grid parity.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.590
As a result of this-- the
decline in the feed-in tariff

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.150
in Germany-- and as a
result of a massive amount

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.730
of new production
capacity coming

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.380
online in China
and Taiwan, we're

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.620
now in an oversupply condition.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.760
What means an
oversupply condition?

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.650
What it means is that there are
more PV modules available today

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.260
than there are customers to buy
them at the given prices that

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:51.910
are available.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.730
And the price is dictated, in
part, by the feed-in tariff.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.740
And so what you've
seen is-- sorry,

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.230
I'm just going to drive through
these slides right over here

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.750
till I get to that one.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.970
So what you see is that chart
that Secretary Chu presented

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.940
yesterday during his talk.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.620
This was in first
quarter of 2008.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.330
This was when the
market began softening.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.140
Right around here, the
German feed-in tariffs

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.240
really started going
down tremendously.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.310
Chinese manufacturing and
Taiwanese manufacturing

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:26.860
really started ramping up
around here, 2007, 2008.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.290
And so what happened?

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:32.100
This here is price, not cost.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.920
Price.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.910
So this is being driven
by market dynamics,

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.130
not solely by the
costs of manufacturing.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:41.930
So we have what people
are willing to pay

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:42.930
for their hours of watt.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.210
So if the feed-in
tariff is going down

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.530
in Germany, which is
acquiring 50% of the modules

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.450
in the market, that
means that the price

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.540
has to come down, as well.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.900
If you're going to be
able to sell your modules,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.240
you're going to have to
sell them at a lower price

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.320
because the feed-in
tariff is now lower.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.050
At the same time, you have
now more supply on the market

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.620
and you have companies
competing against each other

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.200
to get their modules
on the market.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.450
And so prices are going to
come down by that, as well.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.949
So what this chart is telling
you-- let's look at the blues,

00:24:04.949 --> 00:24:05.520
for instance.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.600
Let's start here.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.790
These are estimates
made in 2008.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.150
And this blue line
extending forward

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.540
is the estimated price-- not
cost-- the estimated price

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.840
of what a PV module would
sell for, projected forward

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.100
to the end of 2010.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.860
Then, we enter
2009-- the reds here.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.980
And the real prices continue
to drop precipitously.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.280
Again, here we have
the analysts' estimates

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.260
for what the price
is going to be,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.410
moving forward to end of 2011.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.700
And you can see that the
analysts' estimates are always

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.460
above the actual prices
over the last three years.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.780
Which means that
the actual prices

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.220
have fallen faster
than anybody--

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.850
or the analysts-- expected to.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.810
Maybe there were
some smart people

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.869
in the actual industry who
saw this coming in quite

00:24:57.869 --> 00:24:58.410
the same way.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.800
But what this
means is the prices

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.300
have come down a lot faster
than what people expected.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.850
I don't think people expected
that Germany would cut

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.330
the feed-in tariff rate
quite as large as it did

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.530
in '09 and in '10.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.060
And some people, who haven't
been paying attention

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.940
to the market, might not
have expected as much supply

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.731
to be available from
China as there is today.

00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:25.980
Those people should have
been paying better attention.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:30.930
But that combination of factors
resulted in a much faster price

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.380
decline than what
people saw coming.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.210
And as a result,
companies that were

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:40.290
formed in, say, 2007, 2008, and
got venture capital-- and saw

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.430
one of these lines right
here and said, oh, we're

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.990
going to be able to
intersect them in 2010--

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.837
are now looking at these
sorts of prices here.

00:25:47.837 --> 00:25:50.295
And saying, oh, gee, we're not
to be able to intersect them

00:25:50.295 --> 00:25:52.920
in 2010, it's going
to be more like 2015

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.390
before we get our
production costs low enough

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.470
to compete at those prices.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.020
And so the venture catalysts
are now sitting back thinking,

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.490
so let me get this straight.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.840
You came to us three
years ago and told us

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.776
that you'd be cost
competitive by 2010.

00:26:07.776 --> 00:26:09.150
But now the story
is you're going

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.690
to be cost competitive by 2015.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.100
This kind of smells fishy.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.480
I don't know if I want to
lend you an additional round

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.438
here, especially if I
have to wait another five

00:26:18.438 --> 00:26:19.790
years before you're profitable.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.600
Let me just cut my losses
and pick up shop and leave.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.110
And your company will go under.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.710
So that's happened a few times.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:30.070
That's happened in a high
profile way, which we all

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.550
know about-- Solyndra.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:35.120
It's also happened to a few
other companies-- SpectraWatt.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.650
Even earlier ones
at the beginning

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.020
of the financial crisis--
OPTI-Solar and others.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.785
So the companies that are
surviving right now-- there

00:26:44.785 --> 00:26:48.680
are still more than 100 startup
companies in the United States.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.980
Dozens and dozens of
startup companies in solar.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.080
Those smart ones
that are surviving

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.840
are usually in
pre-production stage.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.230
They don't have big
manufacturing lines, hundreds,

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.960
thousands of people to pay,
supply chains to pay for,

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.370
and customers evaporating,
so they're not

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:09.731
caught in that situation.

00:27:09.731 --> 00:27:10.480
That was Solyndra.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.950
They had a big production line.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.520
They had 1,100 people
employed in that line.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.950
And they had customers lined up.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.730
They had suppliers shipping
in materials that they

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:21.580
were converting into product.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.760
And some of the
customers disappearing

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.310
were not willing to pay
as high prices anymore.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.040
And that leads to a very
difficult situation.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.220
You don't have a
cash cushion, you

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.720
don't have any
reserves in the bank,

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.770
you have to sell your product.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.460
And you're not able to
compete at these prices.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.930
It's a recipe for disaster
if you're a mid-size company.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.280
So small companies can survive
in what I call spore mode.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.240
They're like a spore.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.646
They don't have that big
manufacturing line to pay for.

00:27:47.646 --> 00:27:49.020
They can survive
off grants, they

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.570
can survive off venture capital.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.710
And their cash burn
rate is very low,

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.380
they're developing technologies.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.761
The big companies have
cash cushions already,

00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:57.760
they have cash reserves.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.220
They might even be able to
access low interest rate

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.440
loans from banks
that borrow money

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.380
at ridiculously low rates
from the treasury right now.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.960
They may even have
financial branches

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.430
within their own
company, like GE Finance,

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.360
that can do that sort of thing.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.550
So big companies are,
so far, surviving,

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.640
the really tiny companies
are, so far, surviving,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.350
but the market dynamic
is really hitting

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.610
those mid-size companies that
already have a manufacturing

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:23.260
line.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.370
And so you hear about layoffs,
you hear about job losses.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.650
These are often the
mid-size companies

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.570
just trying to go
back to spore mode

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:35.210
so they can survive this
difficult period until prices

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:36.360
equilibrate.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:41.320
And when we look at
price is equilibrating--

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.690
let's look at the price now.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.500
We're headed towards Q4 2011.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.300
Let's put a data point
right here for Q4 2011.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.900
Let's do it right now.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:54.080
So I'll go back here
and-- sorry about that.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.580
That was me
registering a website.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.040
That's for the project
that Doug was working on.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.920
We'll go to PVinsights.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.180
And we're going to add the
latest data point here.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.180
So solar wafer-- this is
silicon, this is wafer,

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.690
this is cell, and
this is module.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.710
All right.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:14.050
This is our low,
this is our high.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.850
These are all prices in
dollars per watt peak.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:18.100
Prices.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.160
Our low and our high
and our average for-- I

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.510
guess, last update
was yesterday.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:28.320
The low-- I can tell you this
particular low number right

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.335
here came from a tier three
manufacturer in China.

00:29:32.335 --> 00:29:33.960
What is tier one,
tier two, tier three?

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.250
So tier one are brand names.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.090
Yingli-- they advertised
during the World Cup.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.480
Suntech, mentioned in Secretary
Chu's presentation yesterday.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.790
Trina Solar, LDK, and so forth.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.870
These are tier one
manufacturers, the big dogs.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.340
Tier three are companies
you've never heard of

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.160
but are employing
thousands of people

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.220
and manufacturing modules in
the hundreds of megawatts range.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.650
Perhaps even reaching
a gigawatt scale.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.450
And because banks have
never heard of them

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.660
either-- maybe that's
an overstatement,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.454
but I'm making a point here.

00:30:06.454 --> 00:30:07.870
They're not as
well known, they're

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.707
not as reliable from
the bank's perspective.

00:30:11.707 --> 00:30:13.290
Maybe they haven't
been around as long

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.831
and it's questionable
whether they're

00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:16.930
going to survive this
difficult economic climate.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.930
They have difficulty
to sell their product.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.470
The installers don't want
to take their product.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.670
And so they have to
undercut the competition.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.360
They have to leave
money on the table.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:32.590
And selling at prices
at $0.75 per watt.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.760
Now, what Doug's
calculations are indicating--

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.375
as you saw from the
very beginning--

00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:39.940
the cost of manufacturing
in the US is around $1.30.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.727
The cost of manufacturing
in China is around $1.00.

00:30:43.727 --> 00:30:45.560
And then you have to
ship it over to the US.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.940
So if somebody is
willing to sell

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.510
you a module at 0.75
dollars per watt,

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:55.084
that means that the
price is below the cost.

00:30:55.084 --> 00:30:57.250
That means that that company
is desperate to get rid

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.040
of inventory.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.534
They must have modules stacking
up in their shipment yard.

00:31:01.534 --> 00:31:02.700
They're unable to move them.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.420
And so the chief financial
officer walks over and says,

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.890
we got to get rid of this stuff.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.410
It's costing us money.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.250
It costs us money to keep
this product on the books.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.530
Sell it for whatever you have
to sell it for to get rid of it.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.560
And as a consequence, they
sell below cost, put it out

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.050
into the market.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.270
And then you have
SolarWorld, or a US company,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.400
coming to the Department
of Commerce saying,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.160
they're dumping product.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.520
It's an unfair competition.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.270
According to the World
Trade Organization,

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.230
you can't sell at a
price below your cost

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:36.480
in order to squeeze out
and gain market share.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.500
So it's a complex
situation right now.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.000
I've described for you, in
as much detail as I can,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.170
my impression of what's
happening in the world today.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:51.280
This low price right here, of
0.75 from a Chinese tier three

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.270
manufacturer.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.700
And the high price here
coming from, most likely,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.150
a German supplier
or US supplier.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.460
Selling what is known to
be a very high quality,

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:05.220
reputable, product, has been
selling for the last 10 years.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.790
Very reliable, very few
incidences of consumers

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.190
returning the product.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.960
And banks like that product.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.230
So they're able to extract
a premium for their product.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:18.530
They're able to sell and move
those modules at a higher price

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:20.390
because they're more bankable.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:24.660
This average right here is more
representative of what Chinese

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.590
tier one manufacturers are
currently selling for, and what

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:33.180
many of the US and European
average module makers are

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:38.490
having to compete against with
costs on the order of $1.30.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.400
That's the
constriction right now.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.290
So if we add that one data point
onto this chart right here,

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.740
where we have Q4 2011-- we're
solidly in Q4 right now--

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.930
and we're at 0.98 with an error
bar somewhere around here.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.240
So we're at 0.98.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.210
You see the prices
are still coming down.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.460
And will likely come down
for maybe another quarter

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.210
before they start to stabilize.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:05.090
And as companies fail--
as more companies leave

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.406
the market-- you'll have
consolidation of market share,

00:33:08.406 --> 00:33:10.030
you'll have the few
remaining companies

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.410
that had the large cash cushion,
that had the lowest cost

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:13.930
structure, survive.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.570
And increase their market
share and reduce the number

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.407
of players out on the market.

00:33:18.407 --> 00:33:20.490
And probably, prices will
come back up afterwards.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.550
Because you can't
continue selling

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:26.790
below cost for very long before
everybody goes out of business.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.798
I saw a hand going
up over there.

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:32.009
AUDIENCE: I guess, those
prices-- a transaction happened

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:34.232
at that price, or that
was just the asked price

00:33:34.232 --> 00:33:37.690
of the the manufacturer?

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.780
PROFESSOR: So these
right here-- I

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:45.210
know that the 0.75,
that was an offer price.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:45.880
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.546
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:46.546 --> 00:33:55.210
So it was 0.85 during Solar
Power International in Texas

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.310
about a month ago.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.970
And it made a big
splash and everybody

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.410
was really awed by it.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.016
The 0.75 is news to me.

00:34:03.016 --> 00:34:04.890
It probably came up over
the last week or so.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.389
And in response, most likely,
to that company selling

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:11.129
at 0.85-- unable to move
their product-- going

00:34:11.129 --> 00:34:13.170
even lower in a desperate
attempt just to get rid

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:14.319
of their inventory.

00:34:14.319 --> 00:34:16.155
AUDIENCE: But these
are offered prices?

00:34:16.155 --> 00:34:19.370
The transaction hasn't happened
at that price as of yet?

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.170
PROFESSOR: So these
prices, most likely,

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:24.550
are coming from a
few different routes.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:29.350
So you, as an individual,
can send an email or fax

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:32.850
over a request for
a quote from any one

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.590
of 100 module manufacturers
around the world.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:39.250
And you will get a quote
back or an offer sheet back.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.199
And most likely, what
PVinsights is doing

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:45.520
is some combination of
that-- a guerrilla tactic,

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.020
let's gather information.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.469
And as well, information gleaned
from their installer base.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.678
So they have contacts to
various installer companies.

00:34:52.678 --> 00:34:54.552
They keep the finger on
the pulse over there,

00:34:54.552 --> 00:34:57.274
talking to their friends saying,
how much are they offering you

00:34:57.274 --> 00:34:57.940
the modulus for?

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.764
AUDIENCE: It's not
like the stock market,

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:02.550
where the price sold
at is subjective?

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.303
The sell and the buy price
are a little different.

00:35:05.303 --> 00:35:07.000
No-- or currency
exchange markets.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.900
No.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.860
These are individual
companies trying

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.160
to assess what the
market is willing to pay

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.560
for their product.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.000
In the case on
the low end, these

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.200
are desperate producers
trying to move product.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.270
And on the high end,
these are companies

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.970
with high cost structures,
typically, in the west--

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.350
typically US and Germany--
that have a reputation.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:32.580
And they are
clinging for as long

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.030
as they can on to
the high prices.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.530
For as long as they can do it,
before the market finally says,

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:39.620
you know what?

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.861
I'm sorry.

00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:41.860
We've been good friends.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.880
We've worked together
for the last 10 years.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.620
But honestly, I'm not
going to buy it $1.45.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:51.340
Not when Suntech is offering
me a module at $1.05 and it's

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.430
comparable in quality.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.560
They've proven themselves.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:00.080
The days when all Chinese
modules were inferior are over.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.510
Now we have several tier
one Chinese manufacturers

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.780
that have proven their modules
out in the open market.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.070
There hasn't been a
large number of recalls.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.080
So I'm willing to take
the risk with them.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:15.460
And at that point, you'll start
to see the higher priced US

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:20.300
and European products
begin to soften.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.259
Yeah.

00:36:21.259 --> 00:36:22.800
AUDIENCE: If the
oversupply condition

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.522
doesn't get resolved
in enough time,

00:36:24.522 --> 00:36:26.230
does it have the
potential to, basically,

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.190
stall the entire industry?

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:31.150
And if so, how long
would that take?

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.732
PROFESSOR: Well, keep in mind
that this is just the module.

00:36:34.732 --> 00:36:37.190
There's a whole other dynamic
happening on the installation

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.690
side.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:40.148
And the reason I'm not getting
into that in too much detail

00:36:40.148 --> 00:36:42.680
is because it varies so much
from country to country.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.096
Although I will
say a few comments

00:36:44.096 --> 00:36:46.210
before the end of class.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.770
If the oversupply
condition continues

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.010
and if the feed-in
tariffs continue

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:55.080
to be low, what you'll see
is a continued softening

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.710
of the module price
into the point

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.220
where almost all
manufacturers are selling

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.579
below manufacturing costs.

00:37:03.579 --> 00:37:06.120
They're all desperately trying
to reduce manufacturing costs,

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.160
reduce overhead.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.790
It's forcing them to innovate--
at least in manufacturing

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:10.960
innovation-- faster.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.630
Not on product
innovation, not on,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.254
how do we design this
cell differently?

00:37:14.254 --> 00:37:15.900
But more on the
process innovation

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.520
on the line of saying, gee,
how do we mix the silver

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.960
with the cheaper metal
like aluminum in a ratio

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.130
so that we eek out half
a cent per watt peak?

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.310
Because any small fraction
counts at this point.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:29.380
We're desperate.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:34.500
And you can think of
this oversupply condition

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.570
as a bunch of horses
running nose to nose.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.220
And which ones will
begin falling out?

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.500
In the beginning, you could
point to easy candidates.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.620
Those that have already
begun to go by the wayside.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.390
But now, companies are burning
through the cash cushion,

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.270
reporting negative profits.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.390
You see right and left, even the
Chinese tier one manufacturers

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:59.580
are reporting negative
earnings this last quarter.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.480
So that's a reflection not only
of the oversupply condition,

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.880
but also the fact that
they're continuing to expand,

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.150
despite the
oversupply condition.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:12.335
The idea being, well, we can
withstand one, two, three, four

00:38:12.335 --> 00:38:15.910
quarters of losses as long as
we consolidate market share.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.370
Once we emerge from this
oversupply condition,

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.350
we'll be able to increase
prices a bit more.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:23.290
And then return to a
more sustainable market.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:26.600
But we'll be the big dogs and
everyone else will be out.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.910
So I think all companies
right now are trying

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.780
to play that game of survive.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.740
Survive this oversupply
condition, make it through.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.050
Some are able to continue
growing and other ones are

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.119
just stagnant.

00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:40.410
So the stagnant ones are
going to become niche players.

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:42.480
They won't be the major
players in the market.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.993
The ones who continue growing
will be 80%, 90% of the market.

00:38:46.993 --> 00:38:49.891
AUDIENCE: Has there been talk
of increasing feed-in tariffs

00:38:49.891 --> 00:38:53.760
to try to keep the
American companies alive?

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.222
PROFESSOR: So US doesn't
do many feed-in tariffs.

00:38:57.222 --> 00:38:58.930
This goes back to the
US case right here.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:03.310
So due to lack of leadership
at the national level,

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:07.696
there are a variety of state
level incentives put forth.

00:39:07.696 --> 00:39:09.570
So these are the policies--
we kind of talked

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.070
about this last class, but to
dive into a bit more detail.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.900
The rebate programs for
the renewables-- these

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.960
are state programs
plus the utility

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.170
and/or nonprofit programs.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:21.360
Utility, local, and/or
nonprofit programs only

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.940
and state programs only.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.450
So you see, for example, in
the state of Massachusetts,

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:29.370
we have what used to be the
Massachusetts Technology

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.560
Collaborative.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.790
There was a bit of a power
struggle within Mass State

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.646
and it got incorporated into a
more centralized organization

00:39:36.646 --> 00:39:37.145
downtown.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.610
So that used to be in a
nonprofit organization, which

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.390
is now more affiliated
with the state.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:48.930
The state also has a rebate.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.760
We have a very different set of
ways of doing things than, say,

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.304
California, which has a
clean energy commission that

00:39:56.304 --> 00:39:57.970
rates each module and
gives you a rebate

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:00.140
depending on what they rate
the module as performing

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.060
in California.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.190
So every state has its
own way of doing things

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.870
and it becomes very
complicated very quickly.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:11.150
To enact a national incentive,
beyond the tax rebate

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.110
that is already offered
today, is challenging,

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.720
in this political
climate especially.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.540
Because anything
that you would do

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:23.780
to raise the cost of something,
which most likely would come

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.410
from some federal
program-- right now,

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.030
the Republican
Party is demanding

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.469
that there be an offset, a
reduction of spending elsewhere

00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:31.385
within the government.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.672
Many of the places that are easy
to cut have already been cut.

00:40:37.672 --> 00:40:39.130
And so you've gone
through the fat.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.171
You're now hitting muscle,
and pretty soon you're

00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:42.680
going to be hitting bone.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.120
So it's difficult
to enact something

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.450
that the government
would pay for.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:49.350
It is even more difficult
to enact something

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.016
that the utilities
and rate payers would

00:40:51.016 --> 00:40:53.480
pay for at a national
level because, oftentimes,

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.610
those powers are
delegated to the states.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.810
And you would enter a
federal versus state

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.630
fight over that, which would
go to the courts, most likely,

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.770
and be held up there
for several years.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:08.030
There are about 18,000 different
independent jurisdictions

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.290
within the United
States governing

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:12.600
how solar is added to the grid.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.100
And so what the
Department of Energy

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.450
has done, which I think
is the wisest thing

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:20.220
to do-- given this situation
that we have-- is to say, OK,

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.060
we're not going to
force anybody to change,

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.977
but we're going to give an
incentive for people to change.

00:41:24.977 --> 00:41:27.060
And like they had in the
Department of Education--

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.100
the race to the top,
where states competed

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.770
against each other to implement
best practices in education--

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.230
they're having a similar
program on the installation

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:38.340
side of solar, trying to get
various states to adopt a best

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.160
practices.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.360
To streamline the
permitting process

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.580
to get solar onto the grid
in the most efficient way

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.910
possible, and hopefully
reduce the installation costs

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.449
associated with that.

00:41:48.449 --> 00:41:49.990
So let's turn our
attention, quickly,

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.420
to installations, since
I want to give some time

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.980
to have people ask questions
about their class projects.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.730
Since time is
running very short,

00:41:56.730 --> 00:42:01.190
if you're hitting up
against a roadblock,

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.500
I want to make sure
that we resolve that.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.860
I'll say a couple of words
about the installation.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.690
So a funny thing happened
on Tuesday night.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:10.080
I met with a colleague
from Wisconsin.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.635
And he said, well, I
met the editor of-- I

00:42:13.635 --> 00:42:16.540
think it was an editor from
one of the big journals.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.030
We'll protect the innocent.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.700
And this was a very
high-impact scientific journal.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.560
And he said, well, the
majority of the cost right

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:30.690
now is in the installation side,
not in the module, in solar.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.990
So I'm not going to be
interested in any papers

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:37.270
to my journal that describe
new concepts for PV modules.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:39.140
I'm interested in
the installation side

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.894
because that's where the
majority of the cost is.

00:42:41.894 --> 00:42:43.310
And I went, oh my
goodness, here's

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:44.790
another one who
can't distinguish

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.280
between cost and price.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:53.420
So the installation cost right
now-- let's focus on cost first

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.610
and then we'll get to price.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:56.830
So the installation cost
in the United States

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.520
is partially
reflective of the fact

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.340
that we have those 18,000
different ways of doing it

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.810
here, versus in Germany, there
is one way to do it nationally.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:06.660
The federal government
said, we are

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:11.070
going to demand that
everybody in Germany

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.010
install in this protocol.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.810
And the paperwork
is very, very brief.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.420
It's a couple of pages
to get it installed.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.870
And the inspection is one.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:22.020
And so Germany has a much
more efficient system.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.560
And they've installed roughly
six to seven times more solar

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.514
than we have.

00:43:26.514 --> 00:43:28.430
And if we remember
experience learning curves,

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:32.920
when you have the reduction
of cost the more you do it,

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.420
that means you have
three doublings.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.510
Germany has three
doublings over us.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:40.730
And even if you assume a
very leisurely 20% reduction

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.290
for each doubling, that means
Germany is about the half

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.660
of the cost as we are,
because they've done more.

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.620
They know how to do it more
efficiently than we do.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.120
OK.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.690
So that's on the cost side.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:54.620
On the price side, if
you look around the US,

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.950
you have some states
like New Jersey,

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.210
which had an amazing
incentive program for a while.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.885
And California's as
well, quite generous.

00:44:02.885 --> 00:44:04.260
So there are
certain states where

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.760
it's almost like a gold mine.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.010
And so there's no
incentive for the installer

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.530
to reduce their price.

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:12.150
Their costs can be going
down, but their price

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.720
can be maintained high.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.280
And usually-- this
isn't always the case,

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.870
but in most industries--
when prices are high,

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.620
the industry becomes lazy.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.605
Now this isn't always the
case, but is often the case.

00:44:24.605 --> 00:44:27.140
It is not atypical that
when the prices are high,

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:31.090
the industry says, oh, prices
are high, that's pretty good.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:32.340
I'm enjoying myself right now.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.490
I'm not going to be
focused on cost reduction.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:38.280
It seems that, at least, the
lower level managers suddenly

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.320
become fixated on cost
reduction when it's too late.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.380
When margins have
already begun shrinking,

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:47.300
when prices are collapsing,
and when it's do or die

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.150
for the company.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:51.517
Then, all of sudden,
cost becomes imperative.

00:44:51.517 --> 00:44:52.850
So there are very few companies.

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:54.850
The ones that usually
become leaders

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.580
are the ones who
recognize, gee, prices

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:58.850
can't remain high forever.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.270
We have to reduce our costs now.

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.210
And hey, it'll be
even to our benefit,

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.710
because our margins
will be greater.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.585
We'll be able to take
advantage of this right

00:45:06.585 --> 00:45:09.430
now and build up some cash,
so that when the prices do

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:11.390
collapse, we have some buffer.

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:14.100
And we can survive the
oversupply condition.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.880
So installers, right
now, I have to say

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.210
I'm disappointed in our
installers in the United States

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.550
for not doing more
amongst themselves

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.600
to reduce the
amount of paperwork.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.510
For not taking a leadership
role in reducing the paperwork

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:31.260
burden.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.060
And the true cost of installing
PV on the balances system,

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.500
[INAUDIBLE] installation side.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.480
I think that's a very
resolvable problem.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.530
You look to Germany and you have
residential systems going in

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:45.490
for below three euros
per watt peak price

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:49.140
taking advantage of the low
module prices right now.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:52.080
And the fact that the
installation costs in Germany

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.291
are low, as well.

00:45:53.291 --> 00:45:55.040
Because they've learned
how to do it well,

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.748
they've learned how
to do it efficiently.

00:45:56.748 --> 00:45:58.510
And they've reduced
their cost structure.

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:01.290
So I personally-- I think
there is innovation to be

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.040
done on the installation side.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.700
I think there's a lot that can
be done with pre-fabrication.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.310
Maybe moving a
robot out there that

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.697
can assemble things in a big
rack and then a crane that

00:46:09.697 --> 00:46:10.530
puts it on the roof.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:13.020
As opposed to having 10
people going out to a house

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.350
and spending a couple days
putting panels on the roof.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:16.190
It's not that bad.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:17.990
Maybe it's more like a day.

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.860
But it's still a very
labor-intensive industry

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.380
right now in the US.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.320
So more innovation can be done.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:28.810
But the lion's share of
the installation price

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.760
right now is driven
by what I would

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.769
call inefficiencies in the
way installation is done

00:46:34.769 --> 00:46:37.310
and inefficiencies in the way
the permitting process is done,

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.270
the paperwork is done.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:43.855
So that's my soapbox
speech on installation.

00:46:43.855 --> 00:46:45.730
By all means, there is
innovation to be done.

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:48.040
So don't give up on
that side either.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.450
It's important.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:51.180
It's where the
rubber hits the road.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:56.684
But I think you can't just look
at the price of modules today

00:46:56.684 --> 00:46:59.100
and the price of installing
the system today in the United

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.040
States-- and realize that
80% of the price right

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.047
now is wrapped up in
the installation--

00:47:04.047 --> 00:47:06.130
and say, oh, well, there
isn't any more innovation

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.030
to be done on the module side.

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:09.700
You have to look at cost.

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.780
And you have to recognize
that the module cost is

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.952
driven by the efficiency
of the module.

00:47:14.952 --> 00:47:16.410
And the installation
cost, as well,

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.450
will be driven by the
efficiency the module.

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:20.840
And so the module being
the engine of the system

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.492
is still very, very,
very important.

00:47:23.492 --> 00:47:25.950
And so the work that folks are
doing-- on new PV materials,

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:29.630
especially-- is important.
