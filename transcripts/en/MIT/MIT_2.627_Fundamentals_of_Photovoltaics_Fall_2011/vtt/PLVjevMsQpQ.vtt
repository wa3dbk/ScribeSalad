00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.590
PROFESSOR: Last
class, we introduced

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.730
thin-film technologies.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.710
We described some of
their generic advantages

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.180
and disadvantages.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.980
I showed that particular book
that's going around in the back

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.813
there, The Handbook of
Photovoltaics Science

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:37.760
and Engineering.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.410
That describes several
of the technologies

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.070
that we're discussing
today and last class.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.060
So last class we covered
general thin films

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.610
and cad-tel-- cadmium telluride.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.250
Today we're going to be talking
about amorphous silicon, copper

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.000
indium gallium diselenide, and
the last material system, which

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.090
is actually more of a stack
or a composite of several.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.790
Then we'll enter a debate,
which will be kind of fun.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.140
So amorphous silicon-- we talked
about crystalline silicon.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.790
Crystalline silicon is
the crystalline form

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.910
of the element known as
silicon, comprising a diamond

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.820
cubic crystal structure.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.980
Amorphous silicon,
on the other hand,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.520
is a very broad term
catching a range of materials

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.530
that lack long-range order.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.950
Let me be a little
bit more specific.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.560
Typically, there is some
semblance of short-range order

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.050
in these materials.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.044
One can describe the
composition of amorphous silicon

00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:29.960
using, say, for example,
a radial distribution

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.220
function-- the average distance
from one atom to the next.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.300
And you have these
distribution functions

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.280
describing the material.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.960
It gets a little
bit more tricky when

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.190
you try to define it on
a more detailed level,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.190
with average number
of nearest neighbors,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.630
the local configuration, the
number of stretched bonds

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.470
locally.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.350
And the reality is that
with any amorphous material,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.490
you can deposit a
range of materials.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.740
It isn't just one
specific amorphous

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.004
silicon material that
you get every time.

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:01.670
Depending on your
deposition conditions,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.354
depending on the pressure, and
the temperature, and the power,

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:07.520
during the PCVD-- the
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.130
deposition-- you obtain a range
of amorphous silicon materials.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.210
And within that
range, you can find

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.070
that the mobility
of charge carriers

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.460
can vary by several factors.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.490
The mobility, I believe,
in amorphous silicon

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.201
can range easily between
0.001 and 0.1 centimeter

00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.200
squared per volt second.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.980
So that's two orders
of magnitude easily.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.146
And I have heard of amorphous
silicon materials that

00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:37.933
have gone as low as 10 to the
minus 4 centimeter squared

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:41.440
per volt second, and as
high as approaching 1.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.500
So we have a range of material
qualities as a result,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.140
and also a range of performance.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.520
Likewise, there's a range
of stress in the film,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.940
depending on how you deposit
your amorphous silicon.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.750
So delamination is
of concern as well,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.100
depending on how you deposit it.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.530
And the challenges
from a material level

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.630
is getting consistent quality
material, high-quality material

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.990
every single deposition, and
overcoming certain degradation

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.570
modes that are present
in amorphous silicon,

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.200
not present in other material
systems-- certainly not present

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.340
in crystalline silicon.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.050
For example, the
Staebler-Wronski defect

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.960
that's still up for some
debate as to what precisely

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.840
is the atomic nature
of that defect.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.490
But it is known that when
one exposes amorphous silicon

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.270
to sunlight, that
the performance will

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.310
degrade with a
relatively quick time

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.970
constant over the period
of minutes and hours,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.700
and finally stabilize.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.050
So when you report
the cell performance

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.130
of an amorphous silicon cell,
it's always very important

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.730
to emphasize that this
is light-degraded or

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.679
light-stabilized
efficiency, as opposed

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.970
to the efficiency you get
when you take it straight out

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.170
of the deposition
chamber, and it

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.560
hasn't been exposed to high
amounts of sunlight yet.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.560
In general, amorphous silicon
has low hole mobility.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.760
Again, the precise root
cause on an atomic scale

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.350
for the low hole mobility
is still up for some debate.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.800
There's a professor here
at MIT, Jeff Grossman,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.220
who has performed a combination
of molecular dynamics

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.130
and density functional theory
to obtain amorphous silicon

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.769
samples in DFT.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.760
And through those samples,
he and his colleagues

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.460
were able to determine that
the low hole mobility might

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.490
be caused by stretched
bonds, certain types

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.787
of stretched bonds, within
the amorphous silicon.

00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:30.620
There are other hypotheses
out there as well

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.320
in the literature.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.640
Finally, just getting a
uniform film deposition

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.520
at high speed-- that's
really key-- a high speed,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.890
uniform deposition
of this layer has

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.790
proved challenging in
commercial production so far.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.510
So all of this has combined
so that amorphous silicon

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.880
has received a lot of
attention, but hasn't

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.870
yet, in a massive way, been
economically successful.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.547
This is a cross-section SCM of
an amorphous silicon device,

00:05:04.547 --> 00:05:06.380
showing the TCO-- the
transparent conducting

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.760
oxide-- on the top.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.610
The TCO was deposited
onto the glass,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.390
which appears at the very
top underneath the scale bar.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.000
The amorphous silicon layer
right here in the middle

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.150
is shown.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.510
It is in a PIN structure.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.950
So we've learned
about P-N junctions.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.700
The I layer between
is an intrinsic layer,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.050
meaning lightly doped.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.350
And we'll see the band
diagram in the next slide.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.420
The silver contact in the back
here extracting the charge

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.000
from the backside.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.520
So this is an example of the
amorphous silicon technology.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.150
Again, another cross-section
just for your reference,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.230
showing the stack there.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.170
OK, the PIN device
architecture-- right here

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.242
we can see the P plus layer,
or the P layer, the N layer,

00:05:53.242 --> 00:05:55.200
and then the I here in
the middle-- the lightly

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.500
doped, intrinsic layer.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.410
Note the band structure
or the band diagram,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.850
how it's arranged.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.740
And interestingly,
the layer thicknesses

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.880
here are on the order
of 300 nanometers

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.860
for the entire stack.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.870
It's rather thin, typically
under a micron in thickness.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.290
The reason it's very thin
is because amorphous silicon

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.390
absorbs light much, much better
than crystalline silicon.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.580
For those who have a
solid-state physics background

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.389
and want to know the root cause
of that, I'll explain briefly.

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.680
For those who don't have the
background and can follow,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.190
don't worry.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.790
Plant a flag.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.100
We'll come right back to it.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.350
So in crystalline silicon,
we have crystal symmetry,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.310
and hence we have momentum
conservation rules

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.150
when we excite charge carriers,
hence the indirect band gap

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.890
nature of crystalline silicon.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.946
When we amorphize our
material, we no longer

00:06:42.946 --> 00:06:44.070
have that crystal symmetry.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.050
We no longer have
momentum conservation.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.340
We can excite directly
from your valence band

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.540
into your conduction band.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.865
So that, in a very
quick, hand-wavy way

00:06:51.865 --> 00:06:54.460
is why amorphous silicon tends
to behave like a direct band

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.090
gap semiconductor,
absorbing light

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.100
extremely well with a very high
optical absorption coefficient.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.950
Hence, instead of
100 microns, we

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.505
can get away with 300
nanometers of thickness.

00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:06.960
All right, back to our flag.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.489
We see here the PIN structure.

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:10.780
Everybody should be able to
follow along and understand

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.410
that if light excites a charge
carrier here in the middle,

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.070
the electrons will be swept the
right, the holes to the left.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.450
And we'll have charge
separation occurring.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.840
Sometimes, we can have a stack
of materials like shown here,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.680
with varying band
gaps by, for example,

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.600
blending germanium into
the amorphous silicon.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.860
This can modify the band
gap of the material.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.060
And we can wind up
with a stack of layers,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.564
or we could simply use two
layers of the same material.

00:07:42.564 --> 00:07:44.980
We wouldn't necessarily be
able to absorb more efficiently

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.545
across the solar
spectrum, but we

00:07:46.545 --> 00:07:49.130
would be able to increase the
voltage output of the device.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.110
So there's a variety of
different amorphous silicon

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.000
shall we say designs
out there in the market.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.850
Here's one example
of the triple stack.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.600
We have amorphous
silicon here at the top,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.650
with a large band gap.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.330
The band gap is somewhere
in the range of 1.7 eV.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.678
Yeah, question.

00:08:05.678 --> 00:08:08.670
AUDIENCE: I just have a
question of how that-- so

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.169
does the [INAUDIBLE]
pair have to go

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:13.670
to the interface between
the [INAUDIBLE] to separate?

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah, so
in this particular case,

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.790
I believe this is
a dual terminal

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.700
device, which would be rather
tricky to perform an operation.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.390
What you have to imagine--
this is right here

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.290
with very small perturbation.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.200
If you imagine it being
biased in sunlight,

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.030
then you can easily see how a
larger voltage would result.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.734
Right here, you can imagine
a two-terminal device where

00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:39.520
you extract charge
from here and here,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.990
or perhaps a
four-terminal device--

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.260
which is less common because it
requires more metal contacts.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.540
But that would contact
the device here, here,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.030
again here, and here.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.660
So you'd have the two
devices contacted.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.759
If you have a
two-terminal device,

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:57.050
one can typically think about
it as adding the voltages

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.530
together.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.520
Then the current would
be limited by the worst

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.800
performer of those two.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.520
And that's why you
have this thinner

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.089
than that one over
here, because we

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:07.380
know that the light tends to
be absorbed preferentially

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.342
near the front surface.

00:09:08.342 --> 00:09:10.300
We're absorbing an
equivalent number of photons

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.380
in this thickness and
in that thickness.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.760
So the currents
tend to be matched.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.862
So that's why I would guess,
given the geometry of the fact

00:09:18.862 --> 00:09:21.070
that we have silver in the
back and TCO in the front,

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.600
and no explicit contacts
here in the middle,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.933
that this is a two-terminal
device as opposed to a four.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.740
This stack right here
is representative

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.150
of what is commercialized by Uni
Solar, a company in Michigan,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.770
where we have an
amorphous silicon

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.890
layer on the top, wide
band gap semiconductor--

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.810
somewhere in the range
of 1.7 to 1.9 eV,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.946
depending on the
deposition conditions.

00:09:42.946 --> 00:09:45.070
Again, I mentioned that
amorphous silicon is really

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.580
a range of materials.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.080
There is no one
amorphous silicon.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.830
Depending on the
density of atoms

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.620
inside of the amorphous
infrastructure

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.160
and their local configuration,
you can vary the properties

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.680
quite a bit.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.513
So the band gap can
vary, but typically it's

00:10:00.513 --> 00:10:02.980
in the range of 1.7 to 1.9 eV.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.570
Blending in germanium--
germanium being a bigger atom--

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.460
tends to reduce the band
gap of the material.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.556
And you have successively
higher concentrations

00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:13.180
moving toward the
back, so the band gap

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.080
shrinks from front to back.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.190
And you can wind up
with a stack like this.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:22.820
And this is an example here
of a three-cell stack, where

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.180
you have the combined
quantum efficiency

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.310
and the individual quantum
efficiencies of each

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:31.510
of the sub-cells, showing you
how you can really fill up

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.960
the entire solar spectrum
using a combination

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.730
of these materials.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.140
Unfortunately, despite
all these efforts,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.880
the material is still
affected by what's

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.500
called the Staebler-Wronski
effect in honor

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.830
of the people who
initially determined it.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.264
The Staebler-Wronski effect
typically manifests itself

00:10:52.264 --> 00:10:53.930
as a degradation of
material performance

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.330
as a function of time.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.600
It's also known that as the
layer thickness increases,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.150
the predominance of this
effect also increases,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.610
and its impact also increases.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.720
So it manifests itself as
a reduction of the fill

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.420
factor, a reduction
of performance,

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.470
and we see the trade-offs
during device design

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.590
of amorphous silicon.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:19.220
So I would say, the essence
of amorphous silicon

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.490
is that it's a very
promising material,

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.050
has a wide degree of tunability.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.590
But the low hole mobility
limits its performance

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.880
to somewhere around 10% for
just a single amorphous silicon

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.900
layer, and in the low
teens for the stacks

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.070
of multiple materials,
one on top of another.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.510
And this right here is
showing an interesting effect.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.330
When you begin heating
up your substrate,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.720
when you're depositing
amorphous silicon,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.060
you have amorphous material.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.850
If you heat up your substrate
to too high of a temperature

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.890
during the deposition
process-- and this is also

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:52.040
impacted by the concentration
of silane gas to hydrogen ratio

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.830
during the deposition
process-- one

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.620
can obtain a phase transition
from amorphous material

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.660
into what's called
microcrystalline material.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.010
That's shown at the very top.
a-Si stands for amorphous

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.200
silicon, mu-Si for
microcrystalline silicon.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.550
Microcrystalline silicon is
right at the phase transition

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.900
between an amorphous silicon
and a crystalline variant

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.140
polycrystalline
variant of silicon.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.400
And in some cases,
it can actually

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.380
contain a mixture
of both amorphous

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.520
and crystalline regions.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.550
And so it's very tricky to
nail to the position conditions

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.720
just right.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.382
Somebody along the
way figured out--

00:12:26.382 --> 00:12:27.840
wait a second-- we
can actually use

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.160
this microcrystalline
silicon to our advantage,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.050
and stack a layer of
microcrystalline silicon

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.340
on the bottom, put a layer of
amorphous silicon on the top.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.671
And that was called a micromorph
technology as a result.

00:12:38.671 --> 00:12:41.170
And there are companies that
have commercialized micromorph.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.750
So the micromorph technology
commercialized by Oerlikon

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.880
and previously by a company
in the United States

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.090
called Applied Materials.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.131
And we'll get to that in
a couple slides as well.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.860
This right here is a brief
slide just addressing

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.790
the issue of how
growth conditions can

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.210
impact material quality.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.730
There are a number of growth
parameters, shall we say,

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.610
that impact whether you
obtain an amorphous material

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.920
with high mobility,
with low mobility,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.220
a microcrystalline material,
nanocrystalline material,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.360
and so forth.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.580
And if you're interested
in more details,

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:31.010
these NREL reports from the
late 1990s and early 2000s,

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.950
mid 2000s, are really a
treasure trove of information,

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.650
if you really want to
get up to speed quickly

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.780
on how to grow high-quality
amorphous silicon layers.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.340
OK, so these are
record amorphous

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.250
silicon cell efficiencies.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.830
This, I believe, was
from the Martin Green

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.610
tables that come out each
half year in Progress

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:53.640
in Photovoltaics.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.940
So he and his colleagues
produce an article every half

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.810
of a year in Progress
in Photovoltaics,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.735
describing the record
efficiencies of lab size

00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:03.860
cells-- maybe a centimeter
squared-- all the way up

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.260
to full-size modules.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.390
So we have here
amorphous silicon

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.950
and the blended amorphous
silicon germanium,

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.450
or SiGe for short.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.770
People sometimes call
silicon germanium SiGe.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.240
So we have a variety of
different types shown here,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.770
and the areas of the
devices shown here.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.240
I would caution
over-interpretation

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.940
of the very small area devices.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.970
If you're at 0.25
centimeters, you're

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.140
at a very small linear dimension
along the side of the cell,

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.650
and you can wind up being
impacted by edge effects.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.850
Sometimes this is
the active area

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.590
of a much larger
device, where they've

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.037
shrunken down the aperture.

00:14:41.037 --> 00:14:43.120
But depending on the
texturization of the surface,

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.810
you still get light
trapping and, essentially,

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.140
a larger active area than what
is actually being shaded off.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.780
So I would caution you against
over-interpreting these very

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.720
small area measurements.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.980
At 1 centimeter squared larger,
you're typically in a regime

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.460
where the results
are more believable.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.940
The Jse's shown here,
Voc's shown here.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.790
Note in certain
cases, the Voc you

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.930
would expect from
amorphous silicon,

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.270
if it's a band gap
of 1.7 eV, you'd

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:21.080
expect a Voc somewhere in
the range of maybe 1.4 volts.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.970
And sometimes you get
much lower than that.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.860
Likewise, the short
circuit current

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.210
is rather low, say, compared
to a crystalline silicon

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.980
device because of
that higher band gap--

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.990
the inability to capture some
of those lower energy photons.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.260
And so the record
single amorphous

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.940
silicon device
performance somewhere

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.420
buttressing up against
10%-- not quite.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.310
And then if you combine
different layers into a stack,

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.720
for example here, you can
move into the low teens

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.330
for your performance.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.750
Flag that-- these numbers here.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.550
We're going to get
back to this, and use

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.520
that to understand why
some of the technologies

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.750
didn't make it to
commercialization.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.440
This represents the largest
scale attempt to commercialize

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.620
amorphous silicon technology.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.635
This was a turnkey line.

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:09.760
Let's start from over here.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.770
This is a human being seated
at a computer-- two humans.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.400
This pod right
here-- this machine--

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.930
represents one of these
little components right here

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.050
that fits into a much
larger assembly line.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.254
This is the PCVD
reactor, actually.

00:16:22.254 --> 00:16:23.670
I believe there
were seven of them

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.040
attached to each of these
little pods right here.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.920
So this the plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.770
reactors were depositing
microcrystalline silicon

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.290
and amorphous silicon
onto sheets of glass

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.809
that were as large as you
could possibly transport.

00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:39.600
Does anybody just happen
to know the number

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.400
off the top of their head?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.030
What is the largest
sheet of glass

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.150
that you can physically
transport, say

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.265
in commercial form, such
that you could buy it

00:16:48.265 --> 00:16:51.190
in bulk without custom design
of the Pilkington float glass

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:51.704
process?

00:16:51.704 --> 00:16:54.120
AUDIENCE: It's as big as the
cross-sectional area of that.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.036
PROFESSOR: It's about,
yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:16:56.036 --> 00:16:58.090
That's a good place to start.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.959
It's actually
dictated by what can

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:02.250
fit on some of the trucks
that transport the glass back

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:02.749
and forth.

00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:05.269
You ever seen the glass
transport trucks with the sides

00:17:05.269 --> 00:17:06.810
where they put the
panes of glass in?

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.329
And they have the chassis
of the truck like so,

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.500
and the glass along the edge.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.230
It's around 3 by 3.3 meters.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.069
And so these deposition
systems could incorporate

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.340
huge sheets of glass.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.089
And they would leave
it up to the customer

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:21.569
whether they wanted
to quarter them

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.040
and make reasonable-sized
modules, or whether they

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.920
want the full-size
module and have

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.099
to use cranes to
install them, which

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.330
would reduce the labor
content of installation,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.190
but would shift the burden
onto the automation.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.410
So you see the panes
of glass coming along,

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.300
pre-cleaning, and eventually
insertion to these devices.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.880
Why so many of those devices?

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.170
Why so many PCVD reactors like
little piglets around a pod

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.700
here?

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.030
Each of these reactors
would have a cycle time

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.310
somewhere on the order
of a few 10s of minutes--

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.470
so my estimate would be
somewhere between 20 and 30

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.020
minutes, maybe up to 40.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.640
Because the
microcrystalline silicon

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.524
layer just took so
long to deposit.

00:18:01.524 --> 00:18:03.190
But without that
microcrystalline layer,

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.780
it was difficult to
reach 10% efficiency.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.740
With just the amorphous
silicon layer,

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.230
the efficiencies were in
the range of 6% to 7%.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.420
And if you start doing
calculations for a 6% or 7%

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.080
module, you realize very quickly
that the cost of the glass,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.910
and the encapsulants, and
everything else adds up,

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.654
because your device is
so low in efficiency

00:18:23.654 --> 00:18:26.070
that you need more encapsulant,
more gas, more labor, more

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.380
installation to produce
a panel to produce

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.040
the same amount of power.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.590
And as a result, the
system cost was very high.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:38.070
This technology couldn't compete
once the Chinese production

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.130
started really ramping
up in the market,

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.580
and decreasing the cost of
traditional crystalline silicon

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.770
modules.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:50.300
And the SunFab Project,
which was Applied Materials

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.860
name for this amorphous silicon
line-- or micromorph line,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.540
in reality-- was shut
down relatively recently,

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.390
about a year ago,
when it I realized

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:03.890
that this was no
longer commercially

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.890
viable in the face of some
of the low-cost competition

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.850
from crystalline silicon.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:13.110
All that could change very
quickly, if somehow one of you

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.000
were to develop a way to, say,
double the record efficiency

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.910
number.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.510
So if someone were to figure
out why exactly hole mobility is

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.070
so low, impairing
transport inside

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.080
of these materials,
in principle one

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.080
could then envision rolling
it out into the SunFab line.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.030
There's already a turnkey
production equipment

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.360
that's been built by Applied
Materials, ready to go.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.860
And you're off and running.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.000
So that's an
opportunity out there.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.850
This lists some of the
commercialization attempts.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.620
And the bottom line
at the end of the day

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.550
was that 6% modules were too
inefficient to be profitable,

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.479
unless you reach scales
of, say, gigawatts.

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:51.020
And believe it or not, there
was one company out there called

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.340
OptiSolar, the business
plan was literally

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.890
to scale up to a gigawatt
faster than everybody else.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.530
And even though it
was lower performance,

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.910
the sheer size and scale of
the manufacturing facility

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.090
would reduce the cost
of the amorphous silicon

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.210
relative to the crystalline
silicon competition.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.530
Unfortunately, OptiSolar
didn't make it, either.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.320
So the companies
that are left today

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.820
producing amorphous
silicon include Oerlikon.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.840
This is a Swiss company that
produces turnkey equipment,

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.766
and Uni Solar, which is
selling the actual modules

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:26.640
of amorphous silicon.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.010
They have a nice roll to
roll deposition process

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.210
on these stainless steel foils.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.220
Very nice factory--
believe it was

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.160
toured by several members of
our current administration.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.747
And they're still going.

00:20:41.747 --> 00:20:42.542
AUDIENCE: Sorry--

00:20:42.542 --> 00:20:43.208
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:44.874
AUDIENCE: Is the roll
that that person's

00:20:44.874 --> 00:20:48.570
holding-- what is he holding?

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.650
PROFESSOR: I usually
think, based on the color,

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.440
that this already has amorphous
silicon deposited onto it.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.500
But it could be at some
intermediate phase.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.830
I don't know for that specific
roll, but in principle,

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.580
yes, at the end of the
manufacturing line,

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.100
they'll have a full stack--
the triple amorphous

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.550
silicon and then the two
layers of SiGe beneath it.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.340
AUDIENCE: What's--
the base is flexible,

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.320
so what's the thing that the
film is deposited on, do you

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.492
know?

00:21:14.492 --> 00:21:15.950
PROFESSOR: So what
they incorporate

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.060
their flexible material
into typically,

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.906
one of their products
is roof shingle.

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:24.280
That looks very similar to a
standard, asphalt-based roof

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.410
shingle.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.460
And it is very nice building
integrated technology.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.430
I happened to see one back
when I was a graduate student,

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.370
and I was inspired by the
building integrated potential

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.240
there.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.502
So there are attempts to
integrate amorphous silicon

00:21:41.502 --> 00:21:43.710
into regular crystalline
silicon technology, as well.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.835
Turns out amorphous silicon
passivates the surfaces

00:21:45.835 --> 00:21:46.490
very nicely.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.550
And you can create what's called
a HIT cell structure, which

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.540
is a heterojunction with
a thin intrinsic layer,

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.390
using a silicon substrate.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.880
Typically what's used
is an n-type base.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.300
And then the amorphous
silicon layers

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.360
are deposited on either side.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.820
And that device
is currently being

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.110
commercialized by a company
called Sanyo in Japan.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.490
The patents for the
base HIT cell structure

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.980
expire very soon, if they
haven't expired already.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.540
And so there is a fair amount
of interest-- several companies

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.100
out there right now attempting
to reproduce this process.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.356
But it is fairly tricky.

00:22:23.356 --> 00:22:24.730
And again, a lot
of it boils down

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.940
to managing the
interfaces-- making

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.110
sure the interface between the
crystal silicon and amorphous

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:34.780
silicon are of high quality.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.570
So we have our HIT
cell structure here.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.670
Let me hop over to the
last thin-film materials

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.880
so we have adequate
time for our debates.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.070
The copper indium gallium
diselenide, or SIGS for short--

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.090
this is a quaternary
phase, sometimes comprised

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:52.760
of even five elements.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.530
But let's show this is
the chalcopyrite structure

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:01.320
right here, with copper shown in
black, indium or gallium shown

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.430
in gray-- typically there's
some blend between the two--

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.890
and the chalcogen-- the
selenium or sulfur--

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:13.600
shown in the white right
here, typically selenium.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.190
So we have here an example
of the crystal structure.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:22.080
As I understand the situation,
this crystal structure

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.000
came into being because copper
sulfide demonstrated potential

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.440
as a photovoltaic material
early on, say in the late 1970s,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.480
early 1980s.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.320
There were attempts to grow
high-performance copper sulfide

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.360
cells.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.520
They failed because
copper electromigrated.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.430
In the presence of an
electric field, copper,

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.700
a very small ion
far to the right

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.929
on the 3-d series
of elements-- so

00:23:44.929 --> 00:23:46.470
if you look at the
transition metals,

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.140
copper is on the
far right, meaning

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.010
you're adding more and more
and more protons to the nucleus

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.700
as you go from left
to right, and you're

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.297
pulling the outer shell in.

00:23:54.297 --> 00:23:56.630
So if you look at atomic
radius going from left to right

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.020
in the periodic
table, you'll see

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.920
that the atoms tend to shrink.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.750
So copper, being on
the far right-hand side

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.200
of the 3-d elemental series,
has a smaller atomic radius

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.520
compared to, say, iron,
or manganese, or titanium.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.950
And as a result, it
could move fairly easily

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.480
throughout the lattice if it
is present in a charged state--

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.340
if you have, say, copper plus--
and a large electric field

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.190
distributed across a thin
film solar cell device.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.554
So copper sulfide devices ended
up degrading quickly over time.

00:24:24.554 --> 00:24:26.470
And it was realized that
some heavier elements

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.750
needed to be included
to stabilize the crystal

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.090
structure.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.530
So in the lab, the reason why
SIGS-- this particular material

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.940
right here-- is so interesting
is because in the laboratory,

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.250
efficiencies on the order
of 20% have been achieved.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.730
For large area-- you'll have
to correct this number right

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:48.450
here-- you can increase that
to 15% plus-- 15.7% in fact,

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.810
over large area devices.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.910
That's a very recent result
coming out of MiaSole,

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.430
a company in California.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.580
There are dozens of
startup companies

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.330
focused on SIGS development.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.780
And it is a very
challenging problem

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.820
to get the stoichiometry
right, and to passivate

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.890
the defects inside the
structure, including surfaces.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.480
Where many companies
fail or fall

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.030
short is getting the
stoichiometry just right

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.810
over a large area.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:20.530
It's as simple as a
manufacturing challenge.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:24.130
The idealized structure of
these thin-film devices--

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.090
you have your SIGS layer
right here in the middle.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.530
In this case, it's
shown as CIS or cis,

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.170
but you can add gallium as well.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.190
Typically, gallium
is blended in.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.240
Moly-- molybdenum-- back
contact on the glass--

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.350
the glass in this case is just
the support for the structure.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.440
Molybdenum here would
be non-transparent.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.250
It'd be an opaque layer.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.570
The cadmium sulfide
on the front side

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:53.350
here forms a very nice interface
with the SIGS layer underneath,

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.320
preventing any interface
damage or any segregation,

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.250
say, of gallium to
the surface here.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.930
And then the zinc
oxide layer on the top,

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.940
which serves as the buffer
window layer, depending, is

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.970
then deposited on the
cadmium sulfide layer.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.260
And eventually charge
is brought away.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.780
This right here is another
three-dimensional rendition

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.960
of the same.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.890
What is unique about each
of those dozens of startup

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.760
companies is the process in
which they deposit the SIGS

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.324
layer, typically.

00:26:24.324 --> 00:26:25.740
So you have companies
like MiaSole

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.470
that are invested in
sputtering of SIGS.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.780
You have companies
like Nanosolar

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.930
that are invested in
ink-based printing of SIGS.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.750
So they print an ink
down, and then they

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.810
sinter the ink to
form the layer.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:42.010
And like those two, there are
many other companies out there

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:45.360
that are depositing SIGS in
some way, shape, or form.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.990
The folks at NREL
seem to be more

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:53.250
in favor of thermal evaporation
based process for SIGS.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.960
Many of the more successful
industrial renditions of SIGS

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.450
right now-- at least the ones
that appear most promising--

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.290
are using other
deposition methods.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.050
So you'll see a
variety out there,

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.840
of deposition methods
for SIGS technology.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.710
And one of the things
to keep track of,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.650
as you watch and monitor
all these startup companies,

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:20.400
is to bin them by their process,
and to begin to discern trends.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.660
As we start to see some market
leaders evolve in the sector,

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.150
begin to discern which
technologies are the most

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.880
appropriate, perhaps for
large-scale deposition

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.360
of this material system.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.740
Interfaces are critical.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.400
Here are some examples of
attempts at mapping out--

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.710
and quite successful attempts at
mapping out the, shall we say,

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:46.310
the band diagram of a
SIGS-based solar cell.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.100
One thing to keep in mind
is that, just like amorphous

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.870
silicon represents a
broad class of materials,

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.700
SIGS also represents a broad
class of stoichiometries,

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.790
meaning the ratio of
indium to gallium,

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:01.840
the ratio of-- if you include
it at all-- sulfur to selenium

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.060
is critical in determining
the properties of both

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.680
the bulk and the surfaces.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.870
Typically at the surfaces,
you will get termination

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.350
by one atom, one atomic
species or another-- one

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:13.650
elemental species or another.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.620
And that will determine,
to a large degree,

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.170
the electronic quality
of that surface.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.780
So for a long time
in literature,

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:25.850
you had debating world views of
what the band diagram of a SIGS

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.140
device really looked like.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.720
And it turned out a lot
of people were right.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.670
They just had varying
starting materials.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.010
So they were comparing
apples to oranges.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.900
The thing that keeps
people going with SIGS

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.150
is that in the
laboratory, efficiencies,

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.170
I believe, now up to 21%
have been demonstrated.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.140
So that is really encouraging.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.140
People-- venture capitalists--
will look at this

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.530
and say, wow, with
those high efficiencies,

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.510
you could really
make solar cheap.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.320
The amount of, again,
glass, encapsulants,

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.370
labor, and so forth that you
have to have for watt peak

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.380
is lower, because
the cell can perform

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.940
at a higher performance.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.350
But the downside is, there's a
gap between-- a substantial gap

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.970
between-- what is commercially
manufacturable today

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.000
and that record
efficiency device.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.880
Sometimes the practical
matters of commercialization

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.590
are the ones that
impede a technology

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.800
from getting to market.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.600
And I have a modicum of
faith that SIGS will make it.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.320
But if it fails to reach
its true market potential,

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.690
if it fails to realize
its dream of becoming

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.290
a significant fraction of
all solar panels produced,

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.820
it will most likely be because
of these process engineering

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.230
issues associated with
depositing over a large area,

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:42.440
coupled to the scientific gap
in managing interfaces properly.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.010
So that's the story
of SIGS in a nutshell.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.820
There are some minor
issues, shall we say,

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.520
associated with cadmium.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:58.730
There are attempts to go to
an all zinc oxide or maybe

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:03.020
a graded zinc oxysulfide
buffering window layer here

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.680
in the front to get
rid of the cadmium.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.230
We'll discuss that shortly.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:15.360
And I would say that's
probably the biggest

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.490
near-term challenge.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:20.090
With the removal of cadmium,
you can access more markets.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.650
And secondly, SIGS
does contain indium,

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.990
which is not in an infinite
supply in Earth's crust.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.320
It's debatable how much of
an issue that really is.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.370
And we'll get to that
in our discussions

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.250
as well, in our debates.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:37.900
SIGS commercialization--
several startup companies

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.780
and I would say a lot
of promising research

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.291
and development
going on right now.

00:30:45.291 --> 00:30:49.370
This particular
technology right here--

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:52.300
let's keep this company
nameless for now.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.920
This company represents
some of the difficulties

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.006
in ramping up large area SIGS.

00:30:57.006 --> 00:30:59.450
They deposit it sometimes
over large areas,

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:01.330
but would achieve
inhomogeneous results.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.000
And so the ultimate form
factor for the devices

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.630
was to chop them
up into areas that

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.510
are not too dissimilar from
an actual crystalline silicon

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:11.230
device.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.360
So to chop up their layers into
individual, discrete cells,

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.777
and then to connect them--
solder them together,

00:31:17.777 --> 00:31:19.360
much like a crystalline
silicon device

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.730
would be put together
inside a module.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.960
So the dream of having this
inline, thin-film process

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.760
roll to roll was reaching an
abrupt wall, shall we say,

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.000
in the development process
because of the lack

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.590
of large-scale uniformity.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.460
So you need to chop them up
into smaller units, which

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.600
would add to the cost,
which would decrease

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.435
the module performance as
well, and now you have gaps

00:31:42.435 --> 00:31:43.310
in between the cells.

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.890
So it just goes to show
the difficulty of bringing

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.980
a new technology to market.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.410
And hopefully, they're
doing better now.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:58.070
Lots of promising news for SIGS,
like this particular article--

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.200
"The Rise of SIGS,
Finally?" question mark.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.570
There has always
been a lot of promise

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.390
in the realm of SIGS because
of the high performance

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.900
and high efficiencies reached.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.990
The big question is,
can you accomplish this

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.650
at large scale for
large area modules?

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:18.320
That's been the big challenge
so far-- and of course,

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.890
materials availability.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:21.980
So let me pause right here.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.800
What I'm going to do-- we
are going to shift gears.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.110
And for the next 20
minutes-- unfortunately,

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.160
not half an hour, but
for the next 20 minutes--

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.780
we are going to
enter debate mode.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.930
What we're going to do is divide
the group into-- this group

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.336
right here-- into
your project teams.

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:39.210
And you'll cluster
together and work together

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.557
on this next exercise.

00:32:40.557 --> 00:32:42.140
So for the very
beginning, we're going

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.470
to have the cadmium
telluride debate.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.980
That will be debate number one.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.220
We'll be discussing the
pros and cons of cad-tel.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.470
Keep in mind that First
Solar, a gigawatt company,

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.770
meaning one of the largest
companies in the world,

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.940
and certainly the largest
company in the United States,

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.080
is going full force producing
cadmium telluride modules.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.520
The debate question that
you'll be faced with is, is it

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.060
a good investment for
the United States?

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.980
Say, for example, you're
in charge of US government

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.530
research and development funds.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.080
Should you be putting
your money into cad-tel?

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.610
Or should you be putting your
money into something else?

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.630
And we'll have two sides
of the debate-- one

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.434
that will defend cad-tel
and say, no, it's

00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:23.600
a very promising technology.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.764
We should be going all in.

00:33:24.764 --> 00:33:26.430
And the other side
that will be adopting

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.180
the counter argument
saying, well, cad-tel

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.560
has these concerns.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.180
Perhaps we should be
looking elsewhere to invest.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.990
And that's the debate number
one-- cad-tel, no cad-tel.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.470
For the folks working on
earth-abundant materials,

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.800
the second debate will be
focused on that question.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.580
Recently, there's
been a lot of interest

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.203
in developing earth-abundant
alternatives to, say, SIGS,

00:33:47.203 --> 00:33:50.600
because of the indium
content, and cad-tel because

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.460
of the tellurium content.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.909
And there's been a huge
amount of momentum behind it.

00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:57.450
But there are few
naysayers out there

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:58.960
who say, well, wait a second.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.500
We've always come
up against shortages

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.930
of one kind or another, since
the days of Malthus's warning

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:08.530
about the limits of population
growth because of limited food

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.830
supply.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:11.420
But then we developed
fertilizers.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.219
And that overcame that limit.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:15.570
Likewise, in these
resource abundance issues,

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:17.909
I'm sure we're going to
find some new way to extract

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:18.630
the metals.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.250
We'll find a way around it.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.110
We'll discover new
deposits and so forth.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:26.060
You hear similar arguments in
the peak oil debate, right?

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.199
And so what I'd like to do
is to set up two teams there

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.780
as well to debate this
particular question.

00:34:37.203 --> 00:34:39.179
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.489
And we furthermore
recognize that several

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.870
of these issues
that might appear

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.482
black and white, in reality
have many shades of gray in PV.

00:34:46.482 --> 00:34:47.940
This cad-tel debate
is one of them.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.080
We'll hear the second
debate the next time.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.027
And anything from should we
invest in silicon technology

00:34:53.027 --> 00:34:55.610
or should we develop thin films
will have these shades of gray

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:56.389
as well.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.980
So it's important to
recognize that simple fact

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.757
as you gain maturity, and shades
of gray in your own ability

00:35:01.757 --> 00:35:03.090
to argument one side or another.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.010
So thank you, and we'll
see us on Thursday.
