00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.740
PROFESSOR: So we have an
interesting class today.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.410
We're going to be taking
this IV curve that we've so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.300
laboriously set up and
understood-- sorry about that.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.110
And now we will subject
it to illumination.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.760
So that's the essence
of our lecture today,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.710
the diode under illumination.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.020
And as part of
today's lecture, we

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.770
have some wonderful
little kits over there

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.970
in the corner where
we'll actually be testing

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.300
IV curves of solar cells.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.620
So I hope some of you
brought the computers today,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.480
and if not, we have some extras
up here as well we can use.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.980
So again, just to
situate ourselves.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.230
We're here in fundamentals.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.489
We're approaching the end
of our fundamental section,

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.530
but we still have a few
really important lectures

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.269
to get through.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.519
After we get through
the fundamentals,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.890
we'll be in a good
position to understand

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.473
the different
technologies and finally

00:01:08.473 --> 00:01:09.880
the cross-cutting themes.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.020
And our goal is to, at
least for the fundamentals,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.820
to understand solar
cell conversion

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.280
efficiency, which is the ratio
of output to input energy.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.100
And for most solar
cells, this breaks down

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.610
to the following progression,
from the solar spectrum

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.940
to charge collection.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.880
And we're going to be
focusing on charge separation,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.240
incorporating elements
of either side

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.980
but mostly focused on
charge separation today.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.410
reminding everybody, of
course, that the total system

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.180
efficiency is the product of
each individual efficiency.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.520
And if any one of these
is low, the efficiency

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.120
for the entire system is low.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.870
And since folks are tired of
looking at this chart by now,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.690
every single lecture I intend
to introduce something new that

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.010
follows a similar pattern.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.930
Does anybody recognize
what this is about?

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.620
So you have over
here some H2O going

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.890
into an oxygen-evolving
complex, and light is coming in,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.640
essentially exciting
up an electron,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.390
which is being stored in
some form of chemical energy.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.980
What is that?

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.480
AUDIENCE: Photosynthesis.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.940
PROFESSOR:
Photosynthesis, right?

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.220
And just like a solar cell,
the photosynthesis conversion

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.060
efficiency of the
entire system is

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.550
dictated by the efficiency
of each individual part.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.660
Roughly it can be broken down to
this little pie chart up here.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.620
The total system
efficiency in blue

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.060
is somewhere, depending
on the plant, somewhere

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.430
around 1%, maybe as
high as 7% or 8%,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.570
depending on very
specialized plants that

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.700
are experts at converting
sunlight into usable chemical

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.460
energy.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.600
And that, in part, is largely
due to optical losses.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.610
If you can see the absorption
spectrum of chlorophyll,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.574
of the different types
of chlorophyll here,

00:02:45.574 --> 00:02:47.740
you'll see large portions
of the solar spectrum that

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.810
go underutilized.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.190
So again, another system
that's similar to a solar cell,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.030
that the total
system efficiency is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.680
the product of each individual
component going on here.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.180
All right.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.670
So now what we're going
to do is just quickly

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.840
revisit the diode in the dark
and construct the energy band

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.030
diagram for pn-junction
in the dark.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.670
Each of you should have
on your desk these sheets.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.170
Oh, we don't have
them on the desks.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.222
We need to pass those out.

00:03:15.222 --> 00:03:17.310
We need to pass those out.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.040
So we should have
sheets that describe

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.670
essentially the equivalent
circuit diagram, the IV

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.340
characteristics,
and the energy band

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.930
diagram for our
pn-junction in the dark.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.129
We laboriously filled
this out last class.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.670
We're just going to
refresh ourselves

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.250
to make sure we're
all on the same page

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.880
and redo it this class
right at the beginning

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.160
because it's that important.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.570
Thank you, thank you,
thank you for those

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.370
who came to our office
hours and for those

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.970
who came to the
recitations, and we really

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.850
tried to get this across.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.810
For those who are
still struggling,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.710
let's make sure that you get
this sometime between now

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.500
and, say, the next
two weeks because this

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.090
will feature
prominently on the exam,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.050
and it's pretty important
for understanding

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.620
how a solar cell works.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.350
So if you would not mind working
directly with your partner,

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.940
the person who's sitting
directly next to you.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.287
Let's walk through
the diode in the dark

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.870
and construct the
energy band diagrams

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.211
for the diode in the dark.

00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:11.210
I'll walk you through it
as soon as you've done.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.600
Maybe I'll give you three
minutes to complete that.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.092
And then we'll progress to
the diode under illumination.

00:04:16.092 --> 00:04:17.050
Should be a lot of fun.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.800
I see convergence among several
of you, so let's move forward.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.119
Just to review quickly,
the way I typically

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:34.660
think about it, if we set up in
the model circuit right here,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.100
we have our pn-junction.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.705
We have our space-charge
region, also

00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:39.580
known as the quasi-neutral
region, also known

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.730
as the depletion zone.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.080
So we have this
region right here

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.710
that represents the
space-charge region.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.202
So this is in the dark.

00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:50.660
Now we have the
energy band diagram

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.000
shown right here, where this
dashed blue line represents

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.390
the chemical potential, also
called the Fermi energy,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.310
throughout the entire device
right here in cross-section.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.900
And just to be very,
very clear, we've

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.470
so far described
the solar cell as

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.080
like coming in through the top.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.642
And now we've rotated this
structure by 90 degrees

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.850
to represent the pn-junction.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.766
That's been a little
confusing for some folks.

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:15.410
So just to be totally clear,
in a device like this one,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.780
if it were subject
to illumination

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.020
you would have light coming
in from the side, right,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.790
either from the p side
or from the n side.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.520
So to transfer this
into what we've

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.270
seen so far with the solar
cell devices facing up

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.010
toward the sun, you'd have
to rotate this by 90 degrees,

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.670
right?

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.837
Just to make sure we're all
clear with orientations.

00:05:32.837 --> 00:05:34.919
[? Because ?] we have the
Fermi energy right here.

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.410
The drift and diffusion currents
for electrons-- electron

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.940
diffusion, electron
drift-- there

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.052
is an abundance of electrons
over here in the n-type side,

00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:44.010
and so they want to
diffuse over to the p-type.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.490
That's why the diffusion
current is pointing left.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.990
Once they do to
a certain degree,

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.450
they set up a field,
the electrons and holes,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.100
the mobile charges
set up a field,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.377
and that creates a drift current
that counteracts the diffusion.

00:05:55.377 --> 00:05:56.960
And once these two
are in equilibrium,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.876
there's no current flowing
through our device.

00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:01.244
That's why current is
equal to 0 right here.

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:02.910
And there's also no
potential difference

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.870
because the Fermi energy,
the chemical potential,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.027
is the same on either
side of that device,

00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:09.860
and so the voltage
output of that solar cell

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.650
would also be 0.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.164
When we forward bias our device,
now we're forcing a separation,

00:06:18.164 --> 00:06:20.455
or we're forcing a separation
of the chemical potential

00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:22.770
on either side of the device.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.130
If you connected this
to an external circuit,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.470
the electrons would want to flow
from this side to that side.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.320
But since we're forcing this
condition here with a battery,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.360
we are reducing the
barrier height here.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.380
Electrons can now diffuse
over from the n-type

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.610
into the p-type
side, and they do.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.650
And the diffusion
current increases.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.680
And that's why we have
current now a positive value.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.440
We've defined the electrons
traveling to the left

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.010
as being a positive current.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.510
We have now electrons
traveling from the n-type

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.000
to the p-type material.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.114
When we reverse bias our
device, notice the separation

00:06:59.114 --> 00:07:00.280
of the quasi-Fermi energies.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.130
Again, we have here
one sign of voltage

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.344
because the right side
is higher than the left.

00:07:06.344 --> 00:07:08.260
And now the right side
is lower than the left,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.490
so our voltage sign
flips from right

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.210
to left over here from
positive to negative values.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.290
So notice the voltage.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.830
And now the current as well.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.220
The drift current will
outweigh the diffusion current

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.442
in this particular case because
now the barrier for electrons

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:24.900
to diffuse from
the n to the p-type

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.790
is very large they'll have
difficulty going from that side

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:28.820
to that side.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.590
Whereas the drift
current is larger because

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.450
of the larger electric field.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.806
And as a result, the drift
current will dominate.

00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:37.430
And so now instead
of electrons flowing

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.900
from n-type to p-type,
where we had defined

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.260
as positive current, electrons
are flowing from p-type

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.340
to n-type in that, which we
defined as negative current.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.930
And that's why our
current has changed signs.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.560
Over here, notice that we're
in positive current territory,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.957
and over here, notice we're
in negative current territory.

00:07:53.957 --> 00:07:56.290
Also, you'll notice the width
of the space-charge region

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.130
changing as we forward and
reverse bias our device.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.530
As the barrier
height decreases, we

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.530
have a decrease of the
built-in electric field.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.280
We have a decrease of
the amount of charge

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.800
on either side of the junction.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.140
That's why the depletion
width decreases.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.640
And the opposite happens
here under reverse bias.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.690
So getting to the point where
you can set up a pn-junction

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.350
and understand how drift
and diffusion currents come

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.970
into being in the
first place and then

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.700
being able to bias your diode
under different conditions

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.240
is a really important
fundamental skill

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.280
for understanding how
a solar cell works.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:30.793
Question.

00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:32.542
AUDIENCE: On the forward
and reverse bias,

00:08:32.542 --> 00:08:34.434
does the Fermi energy
actually continuous,

00:08:34.434 --> 00:08:36.799
or does it actually [INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.965
PROFESSOR: So the Fermi
energy, which we defined here

00:08:40.965 --> 00:08:42.482
as the chemical
potential, notice

00:08:42.482 --> 00:08:43.940
we're avoiding
talking about what's

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.231
happening here in the middle
until a couple of lectures

00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:46.910
from now.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.650
That gets into a gray
zone where we talk

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.051
about quasi-Fermi energies.

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:53.550
We'll get to that in a minute
or maybe a couple of lectures.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.057
But yes, the Fermi energy in
the extreme sides right here

00:08:57.057 --> 00:08:58.473
near the contacts,
so your contact

00:08:58.473 --> 00:09:00.806
in your device over here and
your contact in your device

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.290
over here, those
Fermi energies are

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.370
different on an
absolute energy scale.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.547
So there is an energy
difference when

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.880
you're driving the electrons
from one side to the other.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.651
Notice in this case
right here, you

00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:16.150
would think that
the electrons would

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.120
want to travel through
an external circuit

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.411
to come back to this side
because their energy's higher

00:09:20.411 --> 00:09:22.240
in this side and
lower over here.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.700
But we're not illuminating
the solar cell yet.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.950
We're biasing it
using a battery.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.515
And this is why we have current
flow coming from this side

00:09:30.515 --> 00:09:31.140
into that side.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.870
We're essentially forcing
the electrons from the n-type

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.390
into the p-type material.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.490
We're pushing them up
that hill with a battery.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.020
And that's why we have this
diffusion current dominating

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.180
in the dark, in the dark.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.160
So we have a current
flowing from right to left.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.150
In the illuminated
case, we'll have

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.630
all of our carriers
traveling from left to right.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.330
And in the dark,
this is the only case

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.040
in which we have carriers
traveling from right to left.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.050
And it's happening because we're
using that battery in the dark

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.300
to change the chemical
potential on either side, which,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.320
in effect, reduces
this barrier height

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.940
and allows carriers to diffuse
from the n-type into p-type.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.390
So you can think about
it as forcing carriers

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.640
up the junction.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.232
And this is a very
useful technique

00:10:15.232 --> 00:10:17.440
because, in effect, what
it's doing in a real device,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.148
when we you have a
two-dimensional device

00:10:19.148 --> 00:10:21.020
within homogeneities,
the current

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.150
will travel through the weakest
point of that pn-junction.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.230
Wherever the barrier
height is lowest, current

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.260
will begin crowding
through that spot.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.800
And so it's a way of
probing or testing

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.311
the quality of your junction
characteristic in the dark.

00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:35.810
OK.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.870
So this is the basics of
pn-junction in the dark.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.350
Let's flip our page
over and now let's

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.550
try to imagine what will happen
under illuminated conditions,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.270
and let's start out
in a very simple case.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.830
We'll assume that the
principle of superposition

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.815
applies here, that the
photo-excited carriers--

00:10:55.815 --> 00:10:57.940
in other words, when light
shines into our device--

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.420
I'm looking at this one right
now or this one right here--

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.830
and light's coming in and
generating electron-hole pairs,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.180
essentially exciting
electrons across the band gap

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.810
like we described in lecture 3,
so we have carriers now being

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.520
excited across
the band gap, what

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.060
will happen to
those electrons now

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.559
that they're in the
conduction band?

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:16.362
Where will they want to go?

00:11:16.362 --> 00:11:17.320
AUDIENCE: To the right.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.450
PROFESSOR: To the right, right?

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:18.950
OK.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.089
So what you'll do
is set up what's

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:22.380
called an illumination current.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.250
Notice now at the bottom
of the second row here,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.020
you have electron diffusion,
electron drift, and IL current.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.992
IL stands for
illumination current.

00:11:30.992 --> 00:11:32.450
So you have a third
arrow here that

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.390
will have to be
implemented in some way.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.720
And that will-- by the
principle of superposition

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.145
you should think what happens
to your IV curve as well.

00:11:41.145 --> 00:11:43.520
So let's make an estimate of
what we think should happen,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.228
and then I'll confer
some notes, and then

00:11:45.228 --> 00:11:48.334
we'll measure what actually
does happen under illumination.

00:11:48.334 --> 00:11:49.500
Why don't we give it a shot?

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.550
What does forward
and reverse bias

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.690
mean when there's no battery?

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.360
This is a very
interesting question.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.390
So once you start illuminating
your solar cell device

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:08.900
and you start injecting carriers
into it, what will happen is,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.429
very naturally,
this band alignment

00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:13.220
that you see right
here, this band diagram,

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.820
will begin to shift toward
the forward bias condition.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.530
Rationale?

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.780
You'll be generating carriers.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.570
They'll be swept over
into this region here.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.860
One way to think
about is that you'll

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.969
be increasing the number
of electrons over here

00:12:23.969 --> 00:12:26.260
and the number of holes over
here, which will naturally

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.430
cause the energy
of those electrons

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.430
to increase on this side,
the chemical potential

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.910
on this side, to increase.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.660
So one way to think
about it is, as you're

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.580
illuminating your solar
cell more and more and more,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.280
you're forcing a forward bias
condition on your device.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.430
To get the solar cell
to go into reverse bias,

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.390
you really do need
to bias your device.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.710
You physically need to bias it.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.090
Yeah.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.324
So when I mentioned
illumination current here,

00:12:56.324 --> 00:12:58.490
we're really talking about
the electron illumination

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.100
current, right, what
direction of travel

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.270
the electrons are taking
inside of our system.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.930
So yes, the electrons would be
traveling from left to right.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.500
Very astute observation.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.210
Current is generally described
as a flow of positive charge.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:18.200
And in the absence of a definer
or, say, electrons or holes,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.952
you rightly could
assume that it would be

00:13:19.952 --> 00:13:21.160
the flow of positive charges.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.766
We're assuming electrons
are flowing here

00:13:22.766 --> 00:13:23.974
in the illumination. current.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.420
Good.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:28.920
All right.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.170
So This is very positive.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:35.410
I see everybody has
settled on the notion

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.990
that illumination will
shift our IV curve down.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.660
Because of the way
we've defined current,

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.450
that if current flows from
left to right that lands us

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.260
in negative current territory.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.520
So that makes sense.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.850
If we shine light
on our system, we

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.365
have electrons flowing
from left to right here.

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:54.990
That'll put us into
negative territory.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.820
So that shifts the
entire thing down.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.160
And we would add illumination
current, an arrow pointing

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.010
to the right right
here, which would

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.410
mean that we would have current
flowing through our device,

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.615
but there's still no difference
in the chemical potential

00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:09.310
on either side.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.060
There's still a
difference in Fermi energy

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.518
in the p-type and
the n-type, which

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:16.670
means our voltage is equal to 0,
which means we're intersecting

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.840
the y-axis right
here, and our little x

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.870
should be marked
right down here.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.350
So it's really just
a superposition.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.210
Great.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:24.800
OK.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:31.610
Now what happens if we
forward bias our device either

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.214
because we're adding a resistor
in series to our solar cell?

00:14:36.214 --> 00:14:37.630
So instead of a
battery there, you

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.300
would replace that
with a resistor.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.280
Or if we're applying a
bias voltage as well,

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.255
we could also do that
under illumination.

00:14:45.255 --> 00:14:47.380
So we'd still have the
illumination current, right?

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.590
And we, through superposition,
shift this entire curve down,

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.200
we'd be operating somewhere
in this quadrant right there,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.090
right?

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.990
So this we call IV quadrant,
typically I, II, III, IV, IV

00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.790
quadrant.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.720
This is where power is coming
out of the solar cell device.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.053
Because if we imagine instead
of having a battery there,

00:15:05.053 --> 00:15:06.960
we have a resistor,
the electrons

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.850
will travel from
the n-type material

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.816
through that external load to
get work the p-type material

00:15:11.816 --> 00:15:13.690
where the chemical
potential is lower, right,

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.010
because they'll desire to
minimize their free energy.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.550
And as a result, they'll
deposit that power

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.215
across that resistor,
across that external load,

00:15:22.215 --> 00:15:23.840
in order to get back
to this other side

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.821
because that's the only path
that they can travel easily,

00:15:26.821 --> 00:15:27.320
right?

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.170
And so this entire
curve shifts down.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.030
You have your red x somewhere
in the quadrant over here.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.840
And power is flowing
out of the solar cell

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.590
across that external load.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.500
So in the next slide,
pretty much everything

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.754
is right, except
that, mea culpa,

00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:43.420
I forgot to replace
the battery up there

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.420
with a little resistor.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.170
So you'll want to correct
that in your notes.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.190
Instead of having the
little batteries up there,

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.800
you can replace
those with resistors

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.360
or a resistor in series with
a battery, if you prefer.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.840
Since depending on the
illumination condition,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.290
the intensity we may have
natural for a bias condition,

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.101
we may need to apply
a bias voltage.

00:16:02.101 --> 00:16:02.600
OK.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.200
So we have our IV
characteristic like this.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.750
We have our red x under
forward bias conditions

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.310
in the IV quadrant,
denoting that power

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.690
would be flowing out of
this solar cell device

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.480
under these conditions.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.420
And now the bias is inverted.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.230
We have reverse bias conditions.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.760
And notice that the current
still has the same sign.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.440
So the current is negative
here, negative here,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.300
and negative here.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.070
So the net current is always
flowing in the same direction

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.190
in all cases because we have
this illumination current,

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.290
because we have this
generation of carriers

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.860
inside of the material.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.990
That's pretty cool.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:41.250
That wasn't the case when we
had the device in the dark.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.740
Here, in the forward
bias conditions,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.690
we're actually forcing carriers
from the n-type material

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.930
into the p-type material.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.060
But under illumination,
now we have

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.650
all of our carriers
traveling from the p-type

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.100
into the n-type.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.270
What's varying is the potential
that the carriers have

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.140
and, of course, the
total amount of current.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.940
As you forward bias
more and more and more,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.170
this downhill slope
here decreases, right?

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.200
So there's less of a driving
force for the carriers

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.410
to be going from the
p-type to the n-type,

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.400
and that's why the
current approaches 0.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.859
Eventually at some point, if
you keep forward biasing here,

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.500
the current will be 0.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.740
There will be no
net current flow

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.357
because there will be no
driving force for the carriers

00:17:25.357 --> 00:17:26.940
to go from the p-type
into the n-type.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:31.110
There will be no
more built-in field.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.870
Kind of cool.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:32.570
OK.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.950
So now we're beginning to
wrap our heads around what's

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.450
happening to the
electrons and holes

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.530
during solar cell operation.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.490
Let me put a little bit
of mathematics to this.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.220
These are your IV curves.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.730
The blue is in the dark, and
the red is under illumination.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.915
And we're focused
on this IV quadrant

00:17:50.915 --> 00:17:53.165
right here because this is
the quadrant in which power

00:17:53.165 --> 00:17:55.070
is coming out of our
solar cell device,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.880
which usable power
is coming out that we

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.160
can power an external load.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.360
Why?

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.520
Well, first off,
the voltage is such

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.979
that we can power
an external load.

00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:05.061
We have charge separation.

00:18:05.061 --> 00:18:06.790
The electrons are
accumulated over here.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.456
And they have higher
potential than they

00:18:08.456 --> 00:18:10.490
do on the other side,
which means that there's

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.865
an incentive for them to go
through the external circuit,

00:18:12.865 --> 00:18:15.780
deposit the power across
that external load

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.670
to get back to this other side
where their potential is lower,

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:19.170
right?

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.560
So the voltage is favorable.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.000
And the current
is also favorable

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.670
because now we have
light coming in.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.732
And this generation current is
driving the carriers-- well,

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.690
or is creating carriers
here in the p-type that

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.523
can then be driven
toward the n-type because

00:18:31.523 --> 00:18:33.260
of the built-in field.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.480
So the conditions are just right
under illuminated forward bias

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.310
conditions to drive power
through our external load.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.910
Under all other conditions of
operations of the solar cell,

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.970
we're putting power into the
device, not getting power out

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:46.990
of it.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.700
This IV quadrant over
here, this forward bias

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.670
illuminated case is the only
case in which power is coming,

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.190
usable power is coming out of
our solar cell that we can use.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.440
So that's why we focus on
this IV quadrant right here.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.340
The illuminated IV curve
is, to the first order,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.860
is just your dark IV curve
with a superposition, which

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.380
we call the illumination
current, I sub L.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.980
And that's what shifts our
entire curve down by this I sub

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.380
L right here, so this I sub L,
that one right there or that

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.220
right there.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.730
Kind of cool.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.870
All right.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.450
What do we think will happen if
our light intensity goes down

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.410
by a factor of 2?

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.870
So now if the amount of sunlight
falling on our solar cell

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.860
drops by 1/2, what will happen?

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.526
What do we predict will happen
based on this right here?

00:19:40.526 --> 00:19:41.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.010
PROFESSOR: The curve will shift,
the red curve will shift up

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:47.660
by about 1/2, right, because
the illumination current is now

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.610
cut in half.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.000
What will happen to the
voltage intersect right here?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.480
What is the relation
between voltage and current?

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.260
It's the logarithmic
relation, right?

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.590
So it won't necessarily
be cut in half, right?

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:08.450
But it'll be cut by whatever
this would be here, a log of 2.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.230
So OK.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.340
So we're beginning to develop
an intuitive understanding

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.950
of where electrons
are flowing inside

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.420
of our solar cells in the
dark and under illumination.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.950
In the dark is
important because we

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.740
can test our
devices in the dark,

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.200
and we can still learn a lot
about our solar cell device

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.070
characteristics in the dark.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:31.000
As well, we can, under forward
bias conditions in the dark,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.460
we can force carriers from
one side of the junction

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.416
to the other the wrong way
and probe for weaknesses

00:20:37.416 --> 00:20:38.540
in the pn-junction regions.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.660
That's helpful.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.480
And in the
illumination condition,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.820
obviously we're testing the
total amount of power that's

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.570
coming out of our device.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.354
So again, this is very
useful because It's

00:20:48.354 --> 00:20:49.770
off of this red
curve here that we

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.222
defined the efficiency or the
performance of the solar cell.

00:20:53.222 --> 00:20:55.170
So what I'll ask
folks to do now is

00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:00.860
to-- we'll begin passing
around these little tools.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.440
And I'll ask David
Berney Needleman

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.630
to come up to the front.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.230
David is our lab guru.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.180
He's the one who
helped build these,

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.650
really was the driving force
behind getting them built.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.777
These are IV testers
that will allow

00:21:11.777 --> 00:21:13.860
you to measure the current
voltage characteristics

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.600
of solar cells
right here in class.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.937
And he's going to--
well, we'll pass them out

00:21:18.937 --> 00:21:20.520
while maybe he comes
to the front here

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.645
and explains how they work.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.000
So now that we have the
basic IV curves rolling in,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.050
what I'd like you to
do is modify the height

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.330
or the intensity of the light.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.496
And the easiest way to
modify the intensity of light

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:40.600
is to move the light
position up and down.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.120
So modify the
intensity of the light

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.730
and see how this
IV curve changes.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.650
Note the y-axis scale,
which might change as well.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.110
It might rescale depending
on the condition.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.730
But note the y-axis
scale and see

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:59.000
how the intercept of
the y-axis is changing

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.682
with illumination intensity.

00:22:00.682 --> 00:22:01.390
Give that a shot.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.380
All right, folks.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.680
Why don't we circle
back real quick.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.180
This has been a good experiment.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.230
I am very much in favor of
multitasking and browsing.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.459
So if you want to keep your
experiment running over

00:22:21.459 --> 00:22:23.250
the course of the
remainder of the lecture,

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.791
I will certainly
have nothing opposed

00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:27.101
to testing a few different
illumination conditions.

00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:29.100
And if there's anything
really, really important

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.558
I'm going to emphasize, this
is a really important wake-up,

00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:32.740
folks.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.870
The I sub L, just to
really recap here,

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.560
we have this ideal
diode equation,

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.450
the illumination current coming
in from our light source.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.850
And in our little set-up,
how many batteries

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.995
did you see there?

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:43.892
AUDIENCE: One.

00:22:43.892 --> 00:22:44.850
PROFESSOR: Look closer.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.239
How many batteries do you
see total in our set-up?

00:22:47.239 --> 00:22:48.780
Look especially at
that light source.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.571
Two of them, right?

00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:51.930
There's a 9-volt and
a 1.5-volt. All right.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.290
So one of them is
powering the light source.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:58.860
And we have, as well, bias to
the solar cell device, right?

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.380
So we have a bit of a
combination of the last two

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.060
slides, right?

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.830
In this case, in the dark, we
were biasing our solar cell

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:07.920
using the battery.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.220
And in the illumination
conditions, the light

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.860
itself was causing the solar
cell to become forward biased.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.629
But we can add a battery
to sweep the bias

00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:17.920
condition of the device, right?

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.530
So even though we have a natural
biasing of the solar cell

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.080
by the light, we can
force the solar cell

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.462
under different operating
conditions with the battery.

00:23:25.462 --> 00:23:27.670
And so that's effectively
what's happening right here

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.175
is you have a combination
of both simple scenarios

00:23:31.175 --> 00:23:33.720
that we just looked
at, and we're

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.400
building on those components
to really understand

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.520
the larger system.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.550
Why might that be important,
or why might that be realistic?

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.450
Well, the light
itself is biasing

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.180
that particular
solar cell device.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.940
But that solar cell
might be connected

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.755
in series with a bunch of other
solar cells in a module, right?

00:23:51.755 --> 00:23:53.130
And those other
solar cells might

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.370
be biasing that one solar cell.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.530
So that's why we have to think
about the solar cell device

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.700
both from the perspective
of what bias condition is it

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.220
under, what illumination
is it under,

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.970
and of course, what's
happening around it.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.990
Is it just powering
an external load?

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.970
Is there a battery
connected in series to it?

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.550
Are there other solar cells
connected in series with it?

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.270
OK.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.780
Yes, Ashley?

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.920
AUDIENCE: So I don't understand
still why having a load

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.730
would bias the device.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.450
PROFESSOR: So let's imagine
under illumination conditions

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.280
right here, what I'm
going to do very,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.700
very quickly is replace this
battery manually in my slides,

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.460
if PowerPoint auto save will
allow me, with a resistor.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.680
So if you'll excuse my
quick introduction here

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.550
of the resistor.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:48.380
Now, sorry about the
little artistic license.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:48.880
OK.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.400
So now I have my resistor here.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.780
And my illumination is
coming into the device

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.880
from-- say one of the sides is
generating electron-hole pairs.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.260
I have a multiplicity of
electrons that have now

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.282
gone down the hill, right?

00:25:01.282 --> 00:25:03.490
It's more energetically
favorable for these electrons

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.630
to be on the other side.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:05.588
And what has that done?

00:25:05.588 --> 00:25:07.610
It's raised the chemical
potential of this side.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.616
It's difficult for them
to get back the other way.

00:25:10.616 --> 00:25:11.990
It's not impossible,
but it could

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.620
be more easy for them to flow
through an external circuit

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.032
to get back to the other side.

00:25:16.032 --> 00:25:17.990
And as they flow through
that external circuit,

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.620
they're depositing their energy
across that external circuit.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.670
What energy?

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.100
Well, it's the
potential difference

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.460
from this side to that side.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.470
So that's why the solar
cell can be thought of, as

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.650
in forward bias conditions,
under illumination

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.500
with an external
load attached to it.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.110
Of course, the load has to
be well-matched to the output

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.176
of the solar cell device.

00:25:39.176 --> 00:25:41.675
AUDIENCE: And is the biasing
because there is a voltage drop

00:25:41.675 --> 00:25:42.805
across the resistor?

00:25:42.805 --> 00:25:43.430
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.550
The biasing is because
you have a shift

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.970
in the chemical potential of
this side up relative to-- you

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.797
have a shift of the n-type side
higher than the p-type side.

00:25:51.797 --> 00:25:52.380
That's a bias.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.170
Anytime you have a difference
in the chemical potential

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.930
in one terminal versus the other
terminal of your solar cell,

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:58.774
you have a bias.

00:25:58.774 --> 00:26:00.190
Whether that's
generated by light,

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.260
whether it's generated
by a battery, right,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.030
whether it's the energy input
to create that bias is coming

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.050
from the sun or if it's coming
from an external battery,

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.410
that's a matter of detail.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.665
AUDIENCE: So is the sun
forward biasing the cell?

00:26:11.665 --> 00:26:12.290
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.664
One can think about this as--

00:26:13.664 --> 00:26:16.039
AUDIENCE: I thought you were
talking about the difference

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:17.460
between light and the LE-- OK.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:17.540
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.000
So the LED, in this case, could
forward bias your device, too.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.083
I mean, it's just photons.

00:26:21.083 --> 00:26:22.870
Photons are forward
biasing the device.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.127
AUDIENCE: So then can
some ever reverse bias?

00:26:25.127 --> 00:26:25.710
PROFESSOR: No.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.320
That would be very
difficult. What you could do,

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.320
though, is have a bunch
of solar cells connected

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.210
in series with this
one, right, that

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.449
are producing forward power.

00:26:33.449 --> 00:26:35.240
You could shade this
device, and then power

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.190
could be flowing backward
through it, right?

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.150
In other words, it could
be in the dark right

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.007
here, in a dark condition.

00:26:42.007 --> 00:26:43.840
And you could be in a
reverse bias condition

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.005
just because of the way the
other solar cells around it

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:49.533
are behaving, if you have a
shaded solar cell, for example,

00:26:49.533 --> 00:26:50.105
in a module.

00:26:50.105 --> 00:26:52.540
So imagine a seagull lands
and kind of covers up

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.280
one of the cells.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.460
That will be under reverse bias,
and that could present problems

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.580
if the solar cell can't
withstand the reverse bias.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.240
No, this is a very
ideal condition.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.859
What happens in the real world
is that at some reverse bias

00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:08.400
condition, you'll
just have biased it

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.390
so much that electrons will
be able to tunnel through

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.390
from the p-type into
the n-type right here.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.796
The electrons in the valence
band will be able to tunnel

00:27:14.796 --> 00:27:16.170
through into the
conduction band.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.710
And what happens to this
IV curve is it goes zoom,

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:19.960
begins dropping.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.280
So if the solar
cell reverse bias--

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.190
let's see, the
reverse bias current,

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.262
or the current at reverse bias
voltage, is not low enough,

00:27:30.262 --> 00:27:31.970
in other words, if
the pn-junction is not

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.630
strong enough, you could
have a catastrophic failure

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.487
of your module by just
shading one of your cells.

00:27:37.487 --> 00:27:39.320
Thankfully, this is one
of the testings that

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.800
are done with the
solar simulator

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.250
to prevent that failure mode.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.990
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.864
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:27:44.864 --> 00:27:47.091
I'll entertain deeper
dives with questions.

00:27:47.091 --> 00:27:48.590
I'll try to keep
the lecture focused

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.220
on the broader general topics.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.950
But if somebody is
interested in learning more,

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.901
I'm happy to kind
of dive into there.

00:27:55.901 --> 00:27:56.400
All right.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.220
So readings are
strongly encouraged.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.500
I have interacted
with several of you.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.930
Joe has interacted
with probably 3n,

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.680
n being the number of people
I've interacted with so far,

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.430
and really tried to impart
the wisdom of pn-junctions.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.917
So please, please, please
come to us if still

00:28:12.917 --> 00:28:14.250
things are going over your head.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.940
You should be able to explain to
your roommates exactly what is

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.430
going on in a pn-junction.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.144
Define parameters that
determine solar cell efficiency.

00:28:22.144 --> 00:28:23.560
So now we have a
qualitative sense

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.250
about where current is flowing,
where electrons are moving

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.585
around, what defines
the power output, how

00:28:29.585 --> 00:28:31.960
the power output is changing
with illumination condition.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.834
We're getting an intuitive
sense of all this.

00:28:33.834 --> 00:28:35.960
Let's start putting
some discrete variables

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.370
to all of that.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.880
And there are a bunch of
two-letter or three-letter

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.732
acronyms with some subscripts
here that we'll get to know

00:28:43.732 --> 00:28:45.190
and we'll become
very familiar with

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.120
over the next few lectures.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.640
So how is solar cell conversion
efficiency determined

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.280
from that illuminated IV curve?

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.770
That's our first question.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:59.380
And what I'm going to do
is start with our source

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.590
IV curve right here.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.330
This is just the IV quadrant.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.830
OK?

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.950
So notice the
current starts at 0

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.520
and goes to some negative value.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.170
So we're looking
in the IV quadrant.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.570
Voltage is going from
0 to a positive value.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:13.130
So again, IV quadrant.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:16.870
We have our ideal
diode equation here.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.450
And oh, notice one thing.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:22.230
I just changed I to
J. What just happened?

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.650
Well, I and J look very
similar, but they're, in fact,

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.460
two different variables.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.090
Most often, PV researchers
will report a current density,

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.990
in other words, a current
per unit area instead

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.780
of the actual current coming
out of a solar cell device.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.707
So what you've been
measuring here off of the DAC

00:29:38.707 --> 00:29:41.040
has been current, total current
output from that device.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.670
And it might be a
really tiny number,

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.170
and it might be
difficult to compare

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.644
against other-sized devices.

00:29:45.644 --> 00:29:47.310
And so what solar
cell researchers often

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.268
do is they say, OK, let's
normalize the current

00:29:49.268 --> 00:29:51.150
by the area to get
a current density.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.190
And we'll call
current density J,

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.210
and we'll call current I, right?

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.710
So for calculating
power, we'll have

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.830
to use I. We'll have
to multiply I times V.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:04.170
But if we're just looking at
one solar cell versus another,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.870
we can use J as a very
convenient way of comparing

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.270
one solar cell versus another.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.020
Cool.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.520
OK.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.380
So the illuminated IV curve
looks something like this,

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:13.880
right?

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.040
It's in the IV quadrant.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.206
It goes out a certain amount,
then it the curves up.

00:30:17.206 --> 00:30:20.020
We just determined
that here in class.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.420
And that's essentially
the ideal diode equation

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.240
with a superposition term,
this J sub L right there.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.650
So let's parse through this.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.040
We have the
y-intercept over here.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.060
At the y-intercept,
there is maximum current

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.510
flowing through the
circuit but no power

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.765
because voltage is equal to 0.

00:30:38.765 --> 00:30:41.140
So remember, the Fermi energy
is the same on either side.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.639
The chemical
potentials are the same

00:30:42.639 --> 00:30:43.860
on either side of the device.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.670
So there's no energy gain
of the electron traveling

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.757
through the external circuit,
but there's a maximum current.

00:30:50.757 --> 00:30:52.840
And no power flowing through
that external circuit

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.590
because there's no
potential to be dropped

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.870
across the external resistor.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.860
The opposite happens
over here at this point

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.660
called Voc, which we'll
call open-circuit voltage.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.670
The oc stands for open
circuit, V, voltage.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.130
Open-circuit voltage is just
as you would think it is.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.900
When your solar cell is in
an open circuit, when you--

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.290
say you took a
pair of scissors--

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.380
please don't this--
and cut the leads so

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.110
that your solar cell
wasn't outputting

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.770
the current through
an external load,

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:21.540
there would be a bias voltage
built up across the p and the n

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.810
side of the solar cell.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.249
And it would be
the maximum voltage

00:31:25.249 --> 00:31:27.290
that could be supported
by that solar cell device

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.539
under illumination conditions.

00:31:28.539 --> 00:31:30.690
That's the open-circuit
voltage, open circuit

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.010
because there's
no current, again,

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:34.810
traveling through
the external circuit.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.460
That's why current
is 0, open circuit.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.507
And voltage because
this is-- well,

00:31:40.507 --> 00:31:42.090
it's an interesting
point because it's

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.420
the maximum voltage here
represented in the IV quadrant.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.140
And somewhere in between the
point of open-circuit voltage

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.714
and short-circuit current--
short-circuit current,

00:31:51.714 --> 00:31:53.880
again, because you're short
circuiting your device--

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.395
current is flowing through,
but there's no resistor.

00:31:55.395 --> 00:31:56.436
There's no external load.

00:31:56.436 --> 00:31:58.810
There's no power being
deposited on external load.

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.380
Somewhere between these
two extreme conditions

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.879
where there's no power flowing
through the external circuit,

00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:04.440
you have a maximum
power point where

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.981
there is a power being deposited
across your external circuit

00:32:06.981 --> 00:32:08.510
and a lot of it, right?

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.160
That's the maximum power point.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.135
This is the point at
which the solar cell

00:32:12.135 --> 00:32:15.170
is producing the maximum
amount of power output.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.590
And to represent that
slightly differently, what

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.900
I've done-- so if I were
to take current times

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.870
voltage right here
using IV quadrant data,

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.921
my power would be
a negative number.

00:32:26.921 --> 00:32:27.420
Why?

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.220
Because voltage is
positive, but current

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.387
is a negative number, right?

00:32:30.387 --> 00:32:32.720
So I'd multiply a positive
and negative number together,

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.210
you get a negative number,
and that just sounds weird.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.210
Who talks about power
output from solar cells

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.270
being negative?

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.160
It almost sounds like power's
going into the device.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.330
So this is another
convention that you're

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.830
going to have to get used to
is looking at the IV curve

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.750
in the I quadrant.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.229
So all we've done
is taken the y-axis

00:32:50.229 --> 00:32:51.520
and multiplied by a negative 1.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.030
So we flipped it up, right?

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.235
So bear with me here.

00:32:56.235 --> 00:32:58.300
It's a bit tricky to keep
all this in your RAM.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.040
But here's our short-circuit
current point now.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.910
Here's our open-circuit
voltage point.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.180
Our IV curve now
is pointed down.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.640
Before it was going up because
we were in the IV quadrant.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.370
Now, we flipped,
essentially just

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:11.980
done a-- we've done a flip
vertical, if you will,

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:16.100
on our IV curve, and we have
our current increasing here

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.944
going to higher bias voltages.

00:33:17.944 --> 00:33:20.360
Now we can take the product
of the voltage and the current

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.309
to determine the
power, and we obtain

00:33:22.309 --> 00:33:24.350
a curve that looks very
much like this blue curve

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.200
right here that you can see.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.280
And the maximum power point
is truth in advertising.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.960
It's at the maximum power.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.390
It's where this blue
curve reaches a maximum.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.910
That is the maximum power
point of the solar cell device.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.070
That is where the solar
cell is outputting

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.720
the maximum amount of power.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.230
And so at this
maximum power point,

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.070
there is a voltage and a current
associated with it that you can

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.890
read right off the IV curve.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:51.310
And this we call Jmp, or current
density at the maximum power

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:55.500
point, and Vmp, which is the
voltage at the maximum power

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.310
point.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.490
So, so far, we've learned
essentially four variables

00:33:59.490 --> 00:33:59.990
here.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.130
We have our Jsc, our
Voc, and our Jmp,

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.830
and our Vmp at that
data point right there.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.286
Questions, since I
know you have them.

00:34:11.286 --> 00:34:13.436
AUDIENCE: To ensure that
the device is working

00:34:13.436 --> 00:34:17.808
in the maximum power point,
does an external voltage have

00:34:17.808 --> 00:34:19.659
to be applied to it?

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:21.469
PROFESSOR: So to ensure
that the solar cell

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:24.550
device is operating right
here, a couple of things

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:25.489
need to happen.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:27.659
You need to have the right
illumination conditions,

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:29.639
and you need to
have the right load.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:31.650
So the two need to be
matched to each other.

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:32.303
Absolutely.

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:34.219
And that's where some
of the power electronics

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.715
come into play.

00:34:36.715 --> 00:34:37.215
Yeah?

00:34:37.215 --> 00:34:39.171
AUDIENCE: So in the
last problem set,

00:34:39.171 --> 00:34:44.305
where [INAUDIBLE], we assumed
that output voltage would

00:34:44.305 --> 00:34:46.329
be [INAUDIBLE] volts.

00:34:46.329 --> 00:34:46.995
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:46.995 --> 00:34:49.790
AUDIENCE: Is that, in
general, a safe assumption

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.464
for [INAUDIBLE] solar cell?

00:34:51.464 --> 00:34:52.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.320
So it's a very interesting
question regarding the homework

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:55.820
question.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.540
Let me repeat it so that
the microphone can hear it.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.670
The homework question
in the last homework,

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.040
there was one question
that inquired,

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.160
assume that the voltage
at the maximum power point

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:12.130
is the band gap voltage
equivalent minus 0.5 volts.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.240
And the rationale for that
assumption is as follows.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.680
The open-circuit
voltage, this point,

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:23.290
is generally between 0.35 and
0.4 volts minus the band gap,

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:24.750
or lower than the band gap.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.150
So you have the band gap
energy minus 0.4 volts.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.820
And I can show you a
very nice little paper

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:30.995
that describes why that is.

00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:32.640
It essentially has
to do, in part,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.830
with losses inside of the solar
cell at thermodynamic limits

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.880
of conversion inside of
the solar cell device.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.560
Then what we've
done is we've done

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.090
another additional discounting
from the Voc to the maximum

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:47.310
power point, which we've assumed
is around 0.1, maybe 0.2 volts.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.507
Notice the shape of the
IV curve right here.

00:35:49.507 --> 00:35:51.090
The maximum power
point is interesting

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.006
because the voltage at
the maximum power point

00:35:53.006 --> 00:35:55.990
is almost the Voc,
in a good device.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.940
And the current at the
maximum power point

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.560
is almost Jsc, but not quite.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.380
All right?

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.335
So the discounting from the
Voc to the maximum power

00:36:04.335 --> 00:36:08.040
point voltage is not that
much, as is the discounting

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.480
from the short-circuit
current to the maximum power

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.640
point in a good device.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.850
In a bad device, this
maximum power point

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:17.710
here could be dragged
all way down here.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.335
You could have an IV curve that
looked something more like this

00:36:20.335 --> 00:36:23.310
instead, almost like a
resistor, at which point

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.699
the maximum power output would
be a lot less, a lot less

00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:28.240
than what's shown
here in blue curve.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.350
Cool.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:32.850
All right.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.010
So let's continue moving on.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.160
The efficiency of
the solar cell.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:42.290
Eta, this Greek letter eta, is
our power out versus power in.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.390
Our power in is the
illumination intensity

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:48.100
given in units of watts
per meter squared.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.140
So we calculated this in our
very first homework assignment

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.100
and realized that the AM
1.5 spectrum is around

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.560
1,000 watts per meter squared.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.980
So that's our input
power right here.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:05.840
Our output power is the
voltage at the maximum power

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.522
point times--
whoopsy-- times the

00:37:07.522 --> 00:37:08.980
current at the
maximum power point,

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.960
not the current
density, the current

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.232
at the maximum power point.

00:37:12.232 --> 00:37:13.940
So take this current
density and multiply

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.460
by area, and that's
effectively-- the units

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.040
work out better that way.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.960
So it would be either V times
I at the maximum power point

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.259
or V times J times the area,
the area of the device,

00:37:25.259 --> 00:37:27.550
the area of the solar cell,
at the maximum power point.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.870
And that's the total power out.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.130
Actually, yeah, yeah.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.412
So as long as the units are
in units of watts per meter

00:37:35.412 --> 00:37:37.870
squared-- yeah, down here-- if
this is not total watts but,

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:39.536
watts per meter
squared, you could still

00:37:39.536 --> 00:37:41.200
use current density.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.670
Those units would
still work out.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.890
So be very careful whether
you use total power in

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:48.650
or normalized by unit
area power, right?

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.440
Just keep track of your units.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.850
Don't do like the professor.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:53.410
OK.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:56.530
So we have efficiency here
as power out versus power in,

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:00.030
the power out being the maximum
power point power and the power

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.199
in being the illumination
from the sun.

00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:03.240
Now we're really talking.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.379
This is starting to get
interesting because it's

00:38:05.379 --> 00:38:06.170
beginning to click.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.050
Pieces from lecture
number 2 come together

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.314
with what we're seeing now.

00:38:09.314 --> 00:38:11.605
So this is solar cell output
power at the maximum power

00:38:11.605 --> 00:38:13.230
point and sunlight coming in.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.380
OK.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.850
So what I'm going
to do next is I'm

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.470
going to take this
maximum power point

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:23.050
and I'm going to draw a box
that starts at the origin here,

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:28.650
and the kitty-corner
corner of my box

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.160
is going to end at the
maximum power point.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.640
So it'll have some
rectilinear shape that

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.650
will comprise the
maximum power point

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:39.550
and 0, 0, the origin,
as two of its corners.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.030
And that box looks like
this blue one right here.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.120
The area of that box
is Jmp times Vmp.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.300
OK?

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.550
And notice I have
another box around here.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:54.780
I have this clear box
that starts at the Voc

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.120
point and the Jsc point.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:00.770
And now I have two rectilinear
shapes, this blue one

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:03.470
and the clear one right
here, the bigger one.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:08.820
The bigger one has an
area of Jsc times Voc.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.570
And I'm going to define
a parameter called

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.180
fill factor, which will be
the ratio of these two areas,

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.510
the ratio of those two boxes,
the Vmp times Jmp divided

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.470
by the Voc and Jsc.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.840
If this is 1, which is
virtually impossible to do,

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.840
but if this were 1, it
would mean that these two

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.510
boxes were the same size.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.840
And the current and voltage
at the maximum power points

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.530
would be the current
and voltage under

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.850
short-circuit and open-circuit
conditions respectively.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:41.840
In real life, this blue box
is smaller than the square box

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.860
right over here.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:48.120
And so the Jmp Vmp product is
less than the Jsc Voc product.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.310
And by consequence
as well, the Jmp

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.610
is less than the Jsc,
Vmp is less than Voc.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:58.470
So the ratio of the two boxes
is defined as the fill factor.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:02.550
The fill factor indicates
the quality of your diode.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.830
If your fill factor
is very poor,

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.565
that means that that sun right
over there at its maximum power

00:40:07.565 --> 00:40:10.060
point is being dragged
toward the origin.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.980
That means that the
area of this blue box

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.160
is growing smaller relative
to the area of this clear box.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.730
The fill factor is going down.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.900
That means you're filling less
of this maximum square box

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:27.340
function defined by the Voc Jsc.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.280
OK.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.950
So we have defined efficiency
as power out divided

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:36.120
by power in, power out
being the current voltage

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.180
product of the maximum
power point divided

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.820
by the solar
insulation, fill factor

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:46.320
being defined as the ratio
of Vmp Imp product divided

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.360
by Voc Ioc product.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.450
Notice that here I've written
this in terms of total current,

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.260
here in terms of
current density.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.064
The areas essentially
just cancel out

00:40:56.064 --> 00:40:58.480
because you have an area in
the numerator and denominator.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.000
They cancel.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.650
These ratios should
be identical.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.210
Thus we obtain an expression
for the efficiency in terms

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:09.280
of fill factor, Voc, and Ioc.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.430
Simply by using this fill
factor definition right here,

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.450
what I've done is
I've multiplied

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.650
this side of the
equation-- let's just

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.620
focus right here--
where we have fill

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:22.470
factor equals Vmp times Imp
divided by Voc times Ioc.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.070
I moved the denominator
up to the side

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.140
over here, multiplied it by fill
factor, and that's my Vmp Imp.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.100
Now, I go back to
that top equation

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.480
and say my Vmp Imp is now
going to be substituted

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.260
by fill factor
times Voc times Ioc,

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.853
and that's how I get to
this equation right here.

00:41:37.853 --> 00:41:38.719
Why?

00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:41.010
Why do I go through the effort
of this little numerical

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.050
manipulation?

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.900
I do it because these
parameters right here

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.790
are fairly easy to measure
using the solar simulator

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.580
that you just put together.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.440
So I can measure the point
at which my voltage is

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.530
at open-circuit condition.

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:59.000
I can measure the current
at short-circuit condition.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.670
And simply by taking the
ratio of those boxes,

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.160
I can determine what my
fill factor is as well.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:10.660
And these break down roughly
into the current is going

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.372
to be a function roughly--
again, I'm really painting

00:42:13.372 --> 00:42:15.330
broad brush strokes here--
the current is going

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.480
to be roughly a function of
illumination condition and bulk

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.380
material quality.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:23.690
The Voc will be roughly a
function of the interface

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.050
and the diode characteristics.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.809
And the fill factor
is going to be

00:42:26.809 --> 00:42:28.850
a function of the interface
diode characteristics

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.647
but also of the resistances
within the device.

00:42:31.647 --> 00:42:33.355
And so from an
engineering point of view,

00:42:33.355 --> 00:42:37.420
when we break the solar cell
output down into these three

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.280
parameters so that we can
better understand what's

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.040
going wrong with our solar cell.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.457
If we have everything
lumped in terms of Vmp Imp,

00:42:45.457 --> 00:42:47.540
it becomes a little bit
more obscure to figure out

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.290
what exactly is going wrong
with our solar cell device.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:51.607
Ashley?

00:42:51.607 --> 00:42:53.232
AUDIENCE: You said
the fill factor also

00:42:53.232 --> 00:42:55.162
an easily measurable parameter?

00:42:55.162 --> 00:42:57.620
PROFESSOR: So the fill factor
you would measure essentially

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.830
by doing the little analysis
we just did right here.

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:01.880
Yeah, exactly.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.560
So you'd have to do a
voltage current sweep.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.060
Mm-hmm.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:09.260
Coolness.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:09.890
OK.

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.840
So we have an expression
for efficiency

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.640
in terms of fill factor, Voc,
Ioc and our incoming power.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.000
So power out, this
right here again

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.910
is power out,
divided by power in.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.110
Why does efficiency matter?

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.140
Why do we care so
much about efficiency?

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.920
Well, the conversion
efficiency determines

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.910
the area of solar cells needed
to produce a certain peak

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.100
power, or to think
of it differently,

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.540
the area of solar panels
that is necessary to produce

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.010
a certain energy per unit time.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.815
And many costs scale with area.

00:43:44.815 --> 00:43:47.612
You have glass, encapsulants,
the absorbent materials

00:43:47.612 --> 00:43:49.320
within the solar cell
devices themselves,

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.300
the metals that are
used to make contacts,

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.365
the labor that's used
to install the panels.

00:43:53.365 --> 00:43:55.101
If you have a larger
panel area, you

00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:56.350
need more labor to install it.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:58.475
The aluminum and racking
and framing materials that

00:43:58.475 --> 00:44:02.380
go into holding the panels up
in the field either on a roof

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.620
or out in the field.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.710
So efficiency affects
pretty much everything

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.960
but the inverter and possibly
some of the soft costs

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.585
of the project.

00:44:09.585 --> 00:44:11.390
That includes the
architect and the people

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:16.030
who you pay to handle the money,
financing, and the lawyers

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.610
perhaps.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:20.050
So pretty much all of the
real material and labor costs

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.210
are scaling with area.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:24.970
And so efficiency determines
that to a large degree,

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:26.830
and hence it's a
highly-leveraged way

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.560
to reduce the costs
of solar energy.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.120
If you do a
sensitivity analysis,

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.000
which you will do in the second
and third parts of the class,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.610
and look at the costs
of solar and how

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:35.984
it scales with
efficiency, you'll

00:44:35.984 --> 00:44:38.890
see that efficiency is one
of the determining factors

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:41.090
for cost in a solar cell device.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:42.770
And that's why we
focus on it a lot.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:45.940
To put it into perspective,
if the efficiency up there is

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.500
determined by the output
power versus the input power,

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.770
if we had 100% conversion
efficiency, which is impossible

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:54.420
to achieve, thermodynamically
impossible to achieve,

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.117
we would produce a certain
amount of energy per unit time,

00:44:57.117 --> 00:44:59.200
or a certain amount of
peak power, with this panel

00:44:59.200 --> 00:44:59.970
right there.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:02.580
Say that's the size of
our field installation.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.830
If we had a 33%
efficiency cell, which

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.030
is closer to the
space-grade solar cells,

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:09.810
we'd need three times
that area, so three

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.380
times the encapsulants, three
times the glass, three times

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.260
the labor to install it.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:20.230
And if we had a 20%
efficiency, say, high end

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.311
but still commercial
solar module,

00:45:22.311 --> 00:45:24.060
not something you'd
need to get from NASA,

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.840
but something that you
could buy from a supplier,

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.050
you'd need five times that area.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:33.490
Whereas if you had a 10%
efficiency module, which

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.130
is more approaching the
area of some relatively

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:40.102
inexpensive solar cells, you
would need 10 times that area.

00:45:40.102 --> 00:45:41.560
So if you're doing
a cost analysis,

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.130
this is why efficiency matters.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.110
It might still be
cheaper to use this

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.230
instead of to use
this over here.

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:50.070
That might very well be more
expensive when you do the math

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.130
and figure out how much it
costs to deposit those materials

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:53.680
with a very low
throughput deposition

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.510
process and very high cost.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:57.190
It might still be,
but it might not.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:59.590
The material costs might
end up whopping you.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:02.980
And so a simple equation that
calculates all these parameters

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.830
in, the material costs,
the module efficiency,

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.830
essentially the material
[? and  labor ?] costs,

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.457
are being calculated in dollars
per meter squared, just saying,

00:46:10.457 --> 00:46:12.540
how many dollars go into
producing a meter squared

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.760
of this material?

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.490
And the efficiency is over here.

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:18.370
And this is just a very
simple back-of-the-envelope

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:22.020
calculation type of way of
estimating the cost of a solar

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:22.930
system.

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.410
So if you say, OK, I'm
willing to pay more

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:29.910
for a high-efficiency cell
because I'm using less area,

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.580
you can use this
type of calculation

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.397
to get to the answer quickly.

00:46:34.397 --> 00:46:36.480
It's not a levelized cost
of electricity analysis.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.560
It's not using
discounted capital flows

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.686
and so forth, which we'll
get to later on in class.

00:46:40.686 --> 00:46:42.601
This is a really
back-of-the-envelope envelope

00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:44.790
engineering approach to
estimating costs of a solar

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.060
system.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.220
So I think this is a
great place to stop.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.240
And if anybody has a pitch
concerning their project

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.550
ideas, class project ideas,
I'd like to invite them

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.980
to the front now.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.220
The class project, mind
you, is really the capstone

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.670
of this class, 2.626, 2.627.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.189
So if you have an idea, a fun
idea, for a class project,

00:47:07.189 --> 00:47:09.730
I'd invite you to give a pitch
up here at the front of class,

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:14.000
or you're welcome to send it on
an email to the class listserv.
