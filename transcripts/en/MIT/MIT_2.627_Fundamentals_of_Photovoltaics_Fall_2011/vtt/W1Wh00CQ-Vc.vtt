TONIO BUONASSISI: Why don't
we go ahead and get started,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.980
folks.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.700
Just some small talk
to get us started.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.980
I promise to tell you the
stories about contamination

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.800
and unintentional contamination.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.710
Before we dive in,
what a life, right?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.320
Steve Jobs.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.800
That was really something.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.210
Moments like that, I think
the best you can possibly do

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.900
is to celebrate the person.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.570
And well, in honor
of his inventiveness

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.440
and the way he really
turned Apple around,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.740
I just wanted to focus
a minute on that.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.490
Speaking of contamination and
unintentional contamination,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.200
the effect on processing,
the history books

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.130
are full of this
folklore, if you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.100
start talking to people
who grow crystals

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.310
and who manufacture solar cells.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.140
The growth of the crystals
that are used to actually make

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.060
the wafers that ultimately
wind up being solar cells

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.550
is a little bit of
a-- how would you

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.940
say-- a little bit of an art.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.320
It is being codified
rather well now.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.630
And there's some strong
science behind it.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.419
But by and large,
up to very recently,

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:37.960
it was more of an
art than a science.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.750
The best crystal growers are
people who are very observant

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.180
it and who are able to look
out and see correlations

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.470
where they weren't
immediately visible to others.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.850
So in one particular
factory, they

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.600
started noticing that they had
yield losses during the winter

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.380
time.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.690
And in particular they
had extreme yield losses

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.910
whenever there was
a big snowstorm.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.830
And it was somebody, one of
the shift leads, I believe,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.240
who traced it back
to the salt that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.170
was marching in
on people's boots

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.760
as they were coming
into the factory.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.180
And that sodium was
contaminating the silicon melt

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.670
and resulting in the poor
quality of the crystals that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.880
were being grown.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.020
Flash forward several years
at Fraunhofer Institute

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.680
for Solar Energy Systems
in Freiburg, Germany

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.360
where the observant cell
manufacture started noticing,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.760
well, gee, our efficiencies
are always lower on Fridays.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.830
Why is that?

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.470
And eventually, they traced
the problem down to the fact

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.700
that, on Fridays,
the technicians

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.630
would go out to lunch
at a Chinese restaurant.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.490
And they would come back, and
their breath and their hands

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.330
would be MSG.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.960
And that was, again,
the sodium was downing

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.670
performance of the devices.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.080
As so it's really interesting.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.640
This kind of sounds like
something you might see in a TV

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.990
show where that scientist in
the lab coat waltzes into a room

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.910
and says, it must be the sodium.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.410
Right?

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.330
And then they test it.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.370
And oh, my gosh,
it's the sodium.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.885
Now, problem solving
the real world

00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:09.135
doesn't quite happen that way.

00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:11.650
It involves a very
methodical approach

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.670
to testing a variety
of hypotheses,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.690
first brainstorming in
a structured manner,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.430
identifying the most
likely candidates,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.010
and going about
solving the problem,

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.940
performing a series
of design experiments

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.140
to really get to the root cause.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.340
So it's an interesting story.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.770
It's an interesting aside.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.620
Solving contamination problems,
though, is very difficult.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.340
And the best thing
you can possibly

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.460
do if you're growing
crystals is to keep

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.770
your system more clean than
you think you need it to be.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.830
That's the best
advice I can give.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.390
I was just talking with some
folks in Caltech the other day.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.260
They were running into
contamination issues.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.320
And that advice goes a long way.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.820
OK.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.620
Well, let's go ahead and get
started in the topic today.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.030
Back from Phoenix and eyes are
red from irritation of having

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.630
been awake for too many hours.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.240
So that could only
mean one thing.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.047
Contacts, right?

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:06.130
So we're going to be talking
about contacts today,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.560
charge extraction, as well.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.940
And to situate us
on the roadmap,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.040
we have our
fundamentals right here.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.600
We're about to jump forward
into the technology, which

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.839
is really exciting.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.709
We're about out of
the woods here, folks.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.610
And finally, into the
cross-cutting themes.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.370
And so, again, every
photovoltaic device

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.346
must obey this general
equation right here

00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:30.220
where the output energy
over the input energy

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.910
equals a conversion efficiency.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.770
And for most solar cells, this
is represented by this right

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.270
here.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.550
And we have now tackled every
single one of those, at least

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.290
in a very fundamental way.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.510
And now, finally, we are focused
on the output, the charge

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.510
collection, in other words,
the contacting of the device.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.257
Again, the total
cell efficiency is

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:53.590
going to be the product of
each of these individual cell

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.470
efficiencies here.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.150
And contacts are a
very, very easy way

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.180
to kill your device
in a variety of ways.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.900
And we'll get to some of
these points right here.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.970
As a matter of
fact, this s back,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.820
this surface
recombination velocity

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.390
on the backside
of the device, is

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.347
a contact-related phenomenon.

00:05:12.347 --> 00:05:14.430
And that's exactly where
the water is spilling out

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.540
of this bucket right here.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.490
Learning objectives.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.920
The idea is to start
out with describing

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.750
the purpose of contacts,
and their most common types,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.526
then to describe the impact
of good and poor contacts

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:30.150
on I-V characteristics,
in other words,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.457
to describe the device
impact of contacts.

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.040
So we're convinced
that this is really

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.582
something we should be spending
a lot of time thinking about.

00:05:36.582 --> 00:05:39.164
Then we're going to sketch the
I-V characteristics of Schottky

00:05:39.164 --> 00:05:40.100
and Ohmic contacts.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.640
We'll learn what those mean.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.180
I hope you know
what ohmic means.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.410
Describe what fundamental
material parameters determine

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.430
I-V characteristics of a
contact/semiconductor junction,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.390
sketch common band alignments,
and sketch common solar cell

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.067
device architectures,
once we're done.

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:57.400
And then we can look back and
gaze over the fundamentals

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.620
and say, Ha, ha,
how far we've come.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.880
And now that you look
at a solar cell device,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.240
hopefully, you'll look at it
in a much more profound way

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.840
than you did in the
first day of class.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.110
The more you know,
the more you see.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.840
So contacts, why
do we need them?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.909
We need to extract the
carriers from the device.

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:15.950
We need to prevent the
back-diffusion of carriers

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.817
into the device.

00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:21.400
These contacts, in general, have
been studied very extensively

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.810
in the semiconductor industry.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.072
Why is that?

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:27.280
Why do we need contacts in
the semiconductor industry

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.850
to make integrated circuits?

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.990
Obvious answer.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.822
We need wires.

00:06:32.822 --> 00:06:35.280
We need to extract the charges
from our transistors, right?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.080
So we're injecting charge,
pulling out charge.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.380
So contacts have been
pretty extensively studied

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.630
in the semiconductor industry.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.620
And we're going to
leverage that a lot.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.740
We're not going to reinvent the
wheel where we don't need to.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.290
Contacts are
semiconductor-specific.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.380
Fundamentals apply
broadly, but the specifics

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.600
pertain to-- or the devil's in
the details, in other words.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.170
So there are very
specific effects

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.420
that occur, depending on the
precise semiconductor metal

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.890
combination.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.050
And lastly, the
contacts are heavily

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.590
influenced by the interface
between the semiconductor

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.780
and the metal.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.490
We're going to be talking
about that as well.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.450
So typical materials
used for contacts

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.620
include metals, transparent
conducting oxides.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.040
And also, we can find heavily
doped organic materials

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.390
as well.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.360
Metals, we understand.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.440
OK, they're optically opaque
and electrically conductive.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.770
That means they conduct
electricity very nicely.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.900
And so our series resistance
along the metal wire

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.775
should be low.

00:07:37.775 --> 00:07:39.650
But they're optically
opaque, meaning they're

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.150
resulting in a shading loss.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.004
So if we cover entire
front side with metal,

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.170
we're not going to have a
very efficient solar cell,

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.330
because our absorption of
light is going to be very poor.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.960
On the other hand,
transparent conducting oxides

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.800
are optically transparent and
electrically conductive, not

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.910
quite as conductive as
metals, but pretty close.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.990
So let me think about
that for a minute.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.570
A material that is
optically transparent--

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.410
that means it must have
a very large band gap

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.600
to let the light through,
does interact with it,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.170
but is electrically conductive.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.440
In other words, it has a high
concentration of free carriers

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.030
that can move around the
material and conduct charge.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.562
How is that possible?

00:08:18.562 --> 00:08:20.020
I hope you're asking
that question,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.810
because this perplexed me
for a long time as well.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.250
And we'll answer that
in a couple of slides.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.970
First, the properties of TCOs.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.080
What makes a transparent
conducting oxide a transparent

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.980
conducting oxide?

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.355
I figure I'll spend a couple
slides on this, since metals

00:08:34.355 --> 00:08:35.570
are pretty self-evident.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.240
But TCOs, this might
be the first time

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.409
you're encountering them.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.020
They're present in a
variety of devices.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.230
If you have an iPhone,
or if you've ever

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:49.140
seen certain types of military
aircraft, TCOs are involved.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.920
So the material is
very transparent.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.300
You can see the transparency
over quite a broad wavelength

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:01.160
range here, cutting off only
in the several eV range here.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.150
Transparency begins to
drop, because you're

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.510
able to excite carries
across the band gap.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.280
So it's a very large
band gap material,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.100
and yet, the conductivity
is very good.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.980
So here, we can see that the
conductivity of ITO, that's

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.420
indium tin oxide, that's a
particular type of transparent

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.720
conducting oxide, is
almost as good as silver.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.900
Not quite, but it's
approaching it.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.770
And so again, the conductivity,
which is 1 over the resistivity

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.400
is related to the carrier
concentration and the mobility,

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.880
as we've seen before.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.450
And therefore, there must
be a lot of free carriers.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.210
And they must be fairly mobile,
to move around the material.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.130
So how does that work?

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.350
Band gap greater than 3.1
eV, transmittance very high,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.760
as a result, but still a
large number of carriers.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.930
Well, if we consider our
band gap right here--

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.270
and we'll consider floating
Fermi energy right now,

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.600
we'll explain why that's
pegged there in a minute--

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.099
we assume that the
band gap is very large,

00:09:58.099 --> 00:10:00.640
so that light can go through,
and it's optically transparent.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.280
But now, by doping the material
with a specific type of dopant

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.150
that forms mid-gap
states, we're going

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.350
to create a new energy level
here that is partially filled.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.090
We can then excite, with
relatively little energy,

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.850
carriers into the excited
states within that orange band,

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.705
and they can transport charge
throughout the material.

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.830
On the other hand, if we
come in with a high energy

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.580
photon or a moderate
energy photo,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.240
let's say, in the
visible, it doesn't

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.520
have quite enough energy to
excite from that orange band

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.060
into the conduction band,
nor from the valence band

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.760
into the orange band, the
intermediate band there.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.960
And that's the general principle
of how transparent conducting

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.210
oxides function.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.930
You can have indium doped
tin oxide, for instance, ITO,

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.920
as a classic example.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.440
And this is the basic premise.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.570
Any questions so far, because
this is kind of important,

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.920
before we launch into-- yeah.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.552
AUDIENCE: So how big
are those, that E1, E2?

00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:00.510
TONIO BUONASSISI: Yeah.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:07.630
So this E3 right here is around
0.4 eV, for a typical TCO.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.660
And E1 and E2, the
sum of both of them

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.360
could be on the order
of three to four eV.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.020
Maybe higher.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.770
Well actually, no.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.842
Sorry.

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.300
Just one of these
transitions right

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.740
here could be on the
order of three eV.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.160
So the entire band gap
could be quite large.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.770
If you think of metal
oxides-- most metal oxides

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.660
have very large band gaps.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.610
And most TCOs fall
into that category.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.120
They could be tin
oxide or zinc oxide,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.960
but heavily doped
with an element,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.620
like indium, or
fluorine, or aluminum,

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.010
to provide that
intermediate band.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.570
AUDIENCE: What are the doping
concentrations required

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.504
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:47.420
TONIO BUONASSISI: Yes.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.530
So this is a deep dive,
and I'm happy to entertain

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.185
that question.

00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:55.060
For those who it kind
of goes over your head,

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.560
don't worry about it.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.530
We'll return, so plant
a flag post in your mind

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.850
where we're at.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.734
Remember the hydrogenic donor
model for a dopant atom.

00:12:01.734 --> 00:12:03.150
You introduce it
into the lattice.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.430
And that loosely bound
electron is there, kind of

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.710
like a hydrogenic donor.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.310
It has a certain radius.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.710
And if you begin doping at
a very high concentration,

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.001
those electrons will begin
interfering with each other.

00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:14.410
They'll begin interacting.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.300
And so instead of forming
one isolated defect level,

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.530
they'll start splitting
and forming a band.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.760
And the density at
which you have to dope

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.854
depends on that donor radius.

00:12:24.854 --> 00:12:27.270
So you're typically talking
about concentrations in the 10

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.380
to the 20 per cubic centimeter,
or one atomic percent

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.502
or higher.

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:33.960
So that's the dopant
density that's

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.450
required to force
this transition.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.190
It's pretty cool.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.880
I mean, there are people who
do their PhDs on transparent

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.630
conducting oxides.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.849
Maybe some of you are.

00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:45.140
You could probably come up
and give a lecture about it.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.800
So it's a fascinating subject.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.230
And because ITO, or
indium tin oxide,

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.860
is just so amazing in
terms of its conductivity--

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.760
it's almost up there
buttressing again

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:01.210
silver-- it's very difficult
to replace with something else.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.100
Zinc oxide and its
variants get pretty close,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.290
like aluminum dope zinc
oxide, sometimes called

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.927
AZO in the PV community.

00:13:07.927 --> 00:13:09.510
They get pretty
close, but they're not

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.580
quite as good in terms
of optical transparency

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.260
and conductivity as ITO.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.400
Now ITO is a problem.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.610
It contains indium.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.900
And the world supply
of indium is limited.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.810
It's not the most abundant
element on the Earth's crust.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.410
If you look at a periodic table,
it's pretty far down there.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.610
And as you know, the
elemental abundance,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.590
it has a relative decay
from-- a power law

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.570
decay-- from light
elements to heavy elements

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.780
with some fluctuations
in between.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.360
But in general, the star
dust that we have here

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.440
is less abundant in
the heavier elements.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.620
And indium is one
of those elements.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.210
And so people are searching
for alternatives to ITO.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.311
And it's an active area
of research right now.

00:13:47.311 --> 00:13:47.810
OK.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.970
So for now, let's go
back to the flag post

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.520
that we planted just
a few minutes ago.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.050
For everyone who
didn't quite follow

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.591
the detailed explanation, the
important thing to keep in mind

00:13:57.591 --> 00:14:00.440
is that TCOs are
conductive and transparent.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.650
And they are so, because of
the unique band structure.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.410
So we can create contacts
to semiconductors

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.520
and extract charge using
either a metal or a TCO.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.890
And right now,
we're going to dive

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.620
into the impact of good
and bad contacts on device

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.830
characteristics.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.064
So during our last-- I believe
it was two lectures ago,

00:14:20.064 --> 00:14:21.980
we talked about the
equivalent circuit diagram

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.500
of a solar cell, this being the
simplest case, now corrected

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.640
with our minus 1
term right here.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.380
And we can see our I-V curve in
linear, linear scale and log,

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.220
linear scale there, log
current linear voltage.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.906
And because this
is an exponential,

00:14:36.906 --> 00:14:38.280
you would expect
a straight line,

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.230
and you do see that indeed.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.365
Now the I-V curve,
in the upper part,

00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:44.990
you can really see
has a very nice fill

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.260
factor as a very sharp kink.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.240
Pops straight up.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.330
And so the fill factor of that
I-V curve, when illuminated,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.760
will be very high.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.250
And hence, the solar cell
efficiency will be high.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.880
Not so when you introduce
a series resistance.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.540
So when you have that
series resistance component,

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.100
now, at higher
bias voltages, you

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.250
begin to be series
resistance limited,

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.337
which causes the fill
factor to decrease.

00:15:08.337 --> 00:15:10.170
And you can see that
by going back and forth

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.030
between these two slides.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.570
High fill factor, no
series resistance.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.907
Lower fill factor,
higher series resistance.

00:15:16.907 --> 00:15:19.490
Especially, if you focus right
here at this point right there,

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.130
you can really see the
decrease of fill factor

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.710
as a result of adding a
series resistance component.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.332
So contacts, when
improperly performed,

00:15:29.332 --> 00:15:31.790
can add a series resistance
component, a rather significant

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.790
one, and drop the
performance of your device.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.140
Likewise, shunt resistance.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.730
We saw a simple effect right
here of shunt resistance.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.050
If the shunt resistance
goes down further

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.990
and the saturation current
goes up even higher,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.140
it begins to affect the
fill factor as well.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:53.480
And so shunting can also
be impacted by contacts.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.760
Particularly when you fire your
contacts, in other words when

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.060
you heat your sample up,
or you heat your stack up

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.270
to create good contact between
the metal and the semiconductor

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.310
underneath, or the TCO and
the semiconductor underneath,

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.330
a couple of things can happen.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.430
If you don't get the chemistry
just right at the interface--

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.490
maybe didn't clean
your sample properly,

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.570
maybe you didn't heat
it up high enough,

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.960
so that the atoms really started
to interdiffuse and interact--

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.880
you can under-fire your contact.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.820
And that results in poor
contact with your semiconductor

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.010
and large series resistance.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.560
So large series resistance
will, essentially,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:38.482
impede charge flow and
result in a fill factor loss.

00:16:38.482 --> 00:16:39.940
On the other hand,
if you over-fire

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.440
your contact-- let's
say you heat it up,

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.280
but fire it a little too long--
then the contact material

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.260
can drive too far into
your semiconductor,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.160
and you wind up
shunting your device.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.390
What does a shunt mean?

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.360
A shunt mean that the metal
goes straight through the PN

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.710
junction and contacts the base
material on the other side.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.955
So remember, the PN junction
region of the solar cell

00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:03.530
is only about a micron
away from the surface.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:04.930
It's really close.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.641
So if you have a fast diffusing
metal species and you heat it

00:17:07.641 --> 00:17:09.890
up too much, you get the
metal going straight through,

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.880
in this case, the
n+ layer into the P,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.650
you'll shunt your device.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.150
So this is the fine
balance that you

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.349
have to walk when
you're putting contact

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.810
metallization on the device.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.630
You can't over-fire it,
because we wind up with shunts.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.640
You can't under-fire
it either, because you

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.640
might wind up with a very
large contact resistance.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.020
So it's a very tricky
thing to get right.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.780
We just finished installing a
contact metallization printer

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.350
in our lab.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.560
And Joe, how many
human hours total

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.036
have been spent trying to
optimize the firing process?

00:17:41.036 --> 00:17:43.270
JOE: Probably
about 30 or 40 now?

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.990
TONIO BUONASSISI: 30
or 40 human hours?

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.602
So it's still a
work in progress,

00:17:46.602 --> 00:17:48.310
but it takes a while
to really nail that.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.530
Yes, Ashley?

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.190
ASHLEY: So would
you want your TCO

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.003
to melt at a lower temperature
that your semiconductor?

00:17:58.003 --> 00:18:01.190
Is that another consideration?

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.500
TONIO BUONASSISI: So
let's back up a step.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.010
For the metal case, it's
pretty straightforward.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.610
This is a homogeneous element.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.750
Let's call it a unary material,
meaning one element comprising

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.900
that metal, typically.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.270
And it's very simple for us
to see, OK, if we keep it up

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.610
and it reacts with our
material, it drives in.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.590
For a TCO, it's a little
less straightforward,

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.420
because you typically
have a multinary compound,

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.350
meaning several elements
comprising your TCO.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.060
The formation of this
intermediate band

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:34.300
right here that forms, really,
the conductivity of the TCO,

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.920
is predicated upon
the principle that you

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.070
have these dopant atoms
homogeneously spaced

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.350
throughout your material.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.460
If you heat it up
too high and they

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.834
begin to cluster,
in other words,

00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:44.910
precipitate out of
phase, you can wind up

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.970
destroying your TCO, or
increasing the resistivity,

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.690
maybe even decreasing
the optical transparency.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.440
And so it really is
material-specific

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.815
when we start
talking about TCOs.

00:18:55.815 --> 00:18:57.356
I'd rather not
generalize about them.

00:18:57.356 --> 00:18:58.975
About metals is more
straightforward.

00:18:58.975 --> 00:18:59.474
ASHLEY: OK.

00:18:59.474 --> 00:19:02.286
I guess then, for
metals, you would

00:19:02.286 --> 00:19:07.064
have to choose a metal that
melts before your semiconductor

00:19:07.064 --> 00:19:07.980
melt-- or [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.896
TONIO BUONASSISI:
Typically, you wouldn't have

00:19:09.896 --> 00:19:12.470
your mental melting, per se.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.150
What you're looking for is
a chemical reaction here

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.780
at this interface.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.080
You're looking for
the metal, most often,

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.460
to form a binary compound
between your metal

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.490
and the semiconducting
material underneath.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.889
Let's say you have
nickel and silicon.

00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:29.930
You'd be looking for it
to form a nickel silicide

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:30.700
at that interface.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.230
ASHLEY: OK.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.620
TONIO BUONASSISI:
And that's where

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.453
you go to your phase
diagrams and figure out

00:19:33.453 --> 00:19:38.120
what temperature those, say,
intermetallics should form.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.450
And then you're targeting
that particular temperature

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.600
during your ramp.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.100
ASHLEY: OK.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.670
TONIO BUONASSISI:
And of course, it's

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.044
not only phase
diagrams which are

00:19:44.044 --> 00:19:47.310
under equilibrium conditions,
kinetics are involved as well.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.920
So it becomes a
rather tricky process.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.238
Yeah, question in the back.

00:19:51.238 --> 00:19:53.150
AUDIENCE: This
picture is drawn where

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.580
it says doping is concentrated
underneath [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.496
TONIO BUONASSISI: Yep.

00:19:56.496 --> 00:19:58.204
AUDIENCE: How do we
manage to concentrate

00:19:58.204 --> 00:20:01.419
the dopant in just that
certain section [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:01.419 --> 00:20:02.960
TONIO BUONASSISI:
Very good question.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.457
So we'll explain toward
the end of lecture

00:20:05.457 --> 00:20:07.290
why dopant is concentrated
underneath there.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.770
For those who are a
little bit more advanced,

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.160
it relates to a tunneling
junction effect or a field

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.430
emission effect.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.740
But we'll explain what
that is for everyone else.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.880
The way you typically get an
enhanced dopant concentration

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.579
right underneath the
metal, first, let's

00:20:20.579 --> 00:20:22.370
appreciate the length
scales involved here.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.340
The width of that
contact metal is probably

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.920
on the order of
somewhere between,

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.220
let's say, 80 and 120
microns, maybe a little more.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.590
And so, at those
length scales, we

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.810
don't need photo
lithography to really nail

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.200
a particular location.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.230
We're not talking about
tens of nanometers.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.390
It's really something
more macroscopic.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.660
So we can do it in a few ways.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.040
On the high end, we could
use an ion implantation tool

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.050
to pattern our
material with a mask.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:56.970
On the low end, we might diffuse
in the emitter very deeply,

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.900
to create a highly doped
region everywhere, and then

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.420
create a mask using not exactly
a photo lithography process.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.170
It could be a much simpler
contacting process,

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.890
and then etch away some of
the emitter in other regions

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.190
to make it more lightly doped
or, even in silicon's case,

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.700
create a poor silicon
layer and etch that off,

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.000
to distinguish between
the heavily doped

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.420
and the lightly doped regions.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.130
There are a few different
ways to skin that cat.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.430
And that's one of the beauties
of solar cell processing

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.880
is that it really pertains
to the specific material

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.109
system involved.

00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:33.150
But the length scales are
such that you're really

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:37.900
not typically limited
by photolithography.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.440
You can probably get around
that and use other techniques

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.672
for masking it off.

00:21:41.672 --> 00:21:43.440
Mm-hm.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.840
Great.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.710
I see folks are awake today,
despite the P-set due.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:52.820
Sketch the I-V characteristics
of Schottky and Ohmic contacts.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.650
OK, so what we're
going to do here

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.885
is talk about how Schottky and
Ohmic contacts come into being.

00:22:00.885 --> 00:22:02.090
And first off, define them.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.640
So let's define them.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.530
An Ohmic contact is one in
which I sweep my voltage,

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.650
and I obtain a linear
current response.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.410
So this is pretty
straightforward.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.680
It's Ohm's law, follows
Ohm's law, so V equals IR.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.480
This is a linear
relationship then

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.730
between voltage and
current, the slope of which

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.160
is dictated by the resistance.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.490
A Schottky contact,
on the other hand,

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.480
follows this beautiful
exponential curve

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.180
that we've come to know and love
from our ideal diode equation.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.900
As a matter of fact, it
follows that same expression

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.880
rather nicely.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.110
There's an exponential relation
between voltage and current.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.994
So whenever we have an
exponential relation

00:22:39.994 --> 00:22:41.660
between voltage and
current, now that we

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.740
know how a PN
junciton works, and we

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.430
recall that it's really that
diffusion current that's

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:50.110
driving the forward
current right here

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.780
under forward bias conditions.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.710
We've learned that, when
the barrier's too large,

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.700
the electrons just
can't make it over.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.900
But as a barrier
begins dropping,

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.100
an exponentially increasing
number of electrons

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.630
can jump over that
barrier and move

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.662
from the region of
high concentration

00:23:05.662 --> 00:23:07.120
to the region of
low concentration,

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.050
or from the n-type material
to the p-type material.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.250
So when we see an exponential
current voltage response,

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.170
we should immediately think
about some barrier involved

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.460
in our system.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.510
And as we begin
biasing this device--

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.170
in this case, a semiconductor
metal junction--

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.510
as we begin biasing the
semiconductor versus the metal,

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.210
we begin seeing an
exponential current response.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.680
We should imagine
that there must

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.560
be some barrier in between the
metal and the semiconductor.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.150
And we'll explain how that
barrier comes into being.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.250
So again, just to recap, making
sure we hit all the points.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.960
Ohmic, a linear I-V curve.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.570
And Ohmic contacts
are typically used

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.800
when charge separation
is not the goal

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.040
for your metallization.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.380
Let's say you've already
achieved your charge separation

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.160
through the PN junction,
and now, you just

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.576
want to contact
your semiconductor

00:23:56.576 --> 00:23:59.160
to extract the charge,
you'd use an Ohmic contact.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.100
But you would use
a Schottky contact

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.350
when you want to enforce
some charge separation.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.320
Typically, not quite
as good as, say,

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.080
a PN junction for
separating charge,

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.780
not quite as high voltage.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:16.890
But it's a useful tool,
for example, in research.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.430
So we're going to describe
what fundamental material

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.640
parameters determine the
I-V characteristics of both

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.830
the Ohmic and Schottky
junctions, more generally,

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.650
a contact
semiconductor junction.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.160
And this dives into
Schottky band theory.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.240
This is a very idealized
version of the real world.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.790
It's an idealized
version, because it

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.690
gets us started and points
us in the right direction.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.630
Then we'll add
layers of complexity,

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.300
until we build up
to really understand

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.050
what's going on inside
of these devices.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:48.883
So let's start here.

00:24:48.883 --> 00:24:55.410
This is a very nice, elegant
view of contact theory.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.910
We have our
semiconductor over here.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:57.650
Let's walk through this.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.270
So this is our
energy band diagram.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.130
We have E on the
vertical axis that

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.260
represents the energy
of the electron,

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.250
versus X, some real
space parameter.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.924
We have our semiconductor
material here.

00:25:07.924 --> 00:25:09.840
We have our valence band,
our conduction band,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.880
and our Fermi energy.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.630
This looks to be an n-type
semiconducting material.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.950
And we have our vacuum level.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.700
The vacuum level is
essentially the energy

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.010
at which we remove an electron
from the semiconductor.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.750
If the semiconductor were
placed, let's say, in a vacuum,

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:29.700
and we were to excite an
electron out of the material

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.730
through some, let's say,
a photoemission effect,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.270
we would have to overcome
the energy between the Fermi

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.850
energy and the vacuum level.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:40.430
This xi right here is
essentially the electron

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.280
affinity of the semiconductor.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.100
That's the delta in
energy, or q times xi

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.980
is the delta in energy
between the vacuum

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.990
level and the conduction band.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.740
So we have all of the
variables mapped out

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.820
for the semiconductor.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.920
Most of them should be
familiar for us already.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.600
We've added the vacuum
level for completeness.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.910
The metal, we also
have a Fermi energy,

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.530
we also a chemical
potential of the metal.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.030
And we have a work function
of the metal, right here.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.550
So this work function
is defined as the energy

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.850
necessary to remove an
electron from the metal.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.780
Say again, by if you shined
a light on the material,

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.670
it has a high enough energy,
you can begin exciting electrons

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.070
off of the metal with
a photoemission effect.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.030
And so we have our vacuum levels
in this particular diagram

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:28.790
lined up.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.690
And our chemical
potentials are a little bit

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.520
different between the metal
and the semiconductor.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.580
So what do you think will happen
when we put the two together?

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.680
If we put the two together,
the chemical potential

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.570
throughout the entire system
has to be the same, right?

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:47.136
Because now, they're in good
contact with one another.

00:26:47.136 --> 00:26:48.510
But what about
that vacuum level?

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.070
What's going to happen?

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.820
Will there be
discontinuity, first of all,

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.929
in the vacuum level?

00:26:53.929 --> 00:26:55.970
Can there be a discontinuity
in the vacuum level?

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.670
If I move one little delta
x from the semiconductor

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.350
into the metal,
do I expect there

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.170
to be a discontinuity
in the vacuum level?

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.680
No, probably not.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.930
So there has to be some smooth
change in the vacuum energy,

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.570
relative to the Fermi energy.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.337
And if the vacuum
level changes, that

00:27:12.337 --> 00:27:14.670
means that the conduction
band and valence band energies

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.800
are also going to change,
relative to the Fermi energy,

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.810
because the valence band
and conduction band energies

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:25.650
track with the vacuum level--
the vacuum level being defined

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.810
as the amount of energy
necessary to remove

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.220
the electron from the system.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.470
So what you get when you
put these two materials

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.820
together is something
like this right here.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.029
This dashed blue line
representing the Fermi energy,

00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:40.320
or the chemical potential
throughout the entire system,

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.870
is the same.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.690
In this particular case,
we didn't bias our device.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.600
We're not applying a
battery or some bias voltage

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.500
between one side and the other.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.750
So we have the same chemical
potential throughout.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.940
If we have the same chemical
potential throughout,

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.550
notice that we had
to push this up,

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.639
or push the Fermi
energy up, to reach--

00:28:01.639 --> 00:28:04.180
and of course, the work function
in the metal's not changing,

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.990
and so the vacuum
energy also goes up.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.240
But since there can't be a
discontinuity in the vacuum

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.700
energy, you see a little
bit of a rise of the vacuum

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.290
energy in the semiconductor.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.430
And of course, the valence band
and conduction bands follow.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.540
And that results
in this little rise

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.380
right here, right
next to the interface

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.950
between the semiconductor
and the metal.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.530
Any questions so far?

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:25.970
AUDIENCE: Is there
a discontinuity

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.370
in the first derivative
of the vacuum level?

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.330
Is there a kink in it?

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.300
TONIO BUONASSISI: Ha.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.466
A very interesting question.

00:28:31.466 --> 00:28:34.650
So typically, we draw it
as having a discontinuity

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.750
in the first derivative.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.820
We would draw a very sharp
interface right there.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.405
But in a practical sense,
I'll reserve judgment

00:28:41.405 --> 00:28:43.780
on that, until I think a little
bit more deeply about it.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.380
It's difficult for me to
believe that there would be,

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.010
if you zoom in very, very
closely, very finely.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:56.050
The bending, let's think
about it from another way,

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.460
from what we already know.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.060
This is essentially
the second integral

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.450
of the charge distribution
across that interface.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.310
And if the charge distribution
is sharp enough, sure,

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.870
I suppose you could
get some difference.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:15.210
But I think-- I'll have
to research judgement,

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.400
but my gut is telling
me that there would not

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.280
be at a very fine
microscopic level.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.970
In general, though, we draw
it looking much like this.

00:29:26.814 --> 00:29:28.710
OK?

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.740
Any other questions about this,
about how we constructed it,

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.720
using the Anderson method?

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.220
No?

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.090
OK.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.990
Why don't we continue?

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.804
What we've done
right here is fill

00:29:40.804 --> 00:29:43.220
in those diagrams, the same
ones that you were looking at,

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.410
with many more variables.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.180
The purpose of this
is to get to the point

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:52.330
where we can describe
the built-in voltage.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.840
Remember, we
mentioned that, if we

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.040
have some exponential
current voltage response,

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.140
there should be some barrier
embedded inside of our system.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.320
And this right here
is that barrier.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.390
So these series of
variables are teaching us

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.490
how to derive it,
how to discover

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.990
how large that barrier is.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.700
And this other
component right here,

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.866
which is the width of the
space charge region, which

00:30:14.866 --> 00:30:19.750
is the width of this, so-called,
curved region, if you will,

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.950
is also going to
be of importance.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.250
So first off, let's
think about it this way.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.980
If we are looking at this
system from the electron's

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.720
perspective, we have
an n-type semiconductor

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.070
right here coming up
against the metal.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.620
If our work function
of the metal

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.870
is larger than the
work function--

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.170
or the so-called work
function of the semiconductor,

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.282
which is really the
electron affinity

00:30:46.282 --> 00:30:48.240
plus the delta in energy
between the conduction

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.660
band of the Fermi energy.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.300
But if the work function of
the metal is larger than that,

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.430
we can see that the electrons
should very easily plop down

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:56.650
into the metal.

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.774
And there shouldn't be-- let's
see, in that particular case,

00:31:00.774 --> 00:31:02.190
work function of
the mental should

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.360
result in an Ohmic contact
for the minority carriers,

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.550
in that case.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.150
But in terms of
the barrier height,

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.690
this barrier height right
here would be determined

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.830
by that equation there.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:19.280
The contact potential,
the built-in bias voltage

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.280
would be here, and the
barrier height there.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.550
And the width of the space
charge region, once again,

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.450
is dependent on
the dopant density

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.890
inside of the semiconductor.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.920
Here, we've defined it
as Nd, because we're

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.050
assuming that this is an n-type
semiconductor with donor atoms.

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.175
But of course, if this were
a p-type semiconductor,

00:31:35.175 --> 00:31:38.360
we'd just replace this with
Na to determine the width.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.500
And if the dopant
density is small,

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.690
this means that the width
of the space charge region

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:43.642
is going to be large.

00:31:43.642 --> 00:31:45.100
And that makes
sense, because there

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.210
has to be an equal
amount of charge

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:48.630
on either side of the junction.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:51.910
And if there is less charge
per unit volume here,

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.310
you need a larger volume
to compensate the charge

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.760
on the other side.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.910
So this is, again, a similar
expression to the one

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:02.990
that we saw when we were
studying the PN junctions.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.860
Now, the important
thing to recognize here

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.250
is that, if we have the bands
bending this way, for electrons

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:12.190
in our system, there may
be a barrier to hop out.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:15.010
For holes in the
system, though, this

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.479
could be a favorable
exit strategy,

00:32:18.479 --> 00:32:19.770
if the bands are bent that way.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.310
If the bends are
bent the other way,

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.640
electrons can rather
easily roll down.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.070
But holes will have a barrier
to go out of the material.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.790
So the same type
of metal that might

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.620
make an Ohmic contact
for an n-type material

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:36.510
might make a Schottky contact
for a p-type material.

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.480
Yeah, that's about it.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.740
So we have to be very careful
in terms of our matching

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.560
or pairing between the
specific type of metal

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.870
and the specific
semiconductor involved.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:52.400
Let me put that into
perspective here with something

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.220
we've already seen.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.990
Again, the Ohmic contact is one
in which we have a linear IV

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.950
characteristic.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.310
And the electron barrier
height has to be less than

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:05.320
or equal to 0, to have the
electrons very easily pop down

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.257
into the contact.

00:33:06.257 --> 00:33:07.840
Whereas, for a
Schottky contact, there

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.090
should be some barrier height.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.190
It should be finite.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.320
And we should have a difficulty
of moving the electron

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:18.100
from the semiconductor into the
metal, in that particular case.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:23.850
So the natural question is,
what metals should we use?

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.020
Or what is the range of
metals that are available?

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.540
If the barrier height is a
function of the work function

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.590
of the metal, what is the
range of work functions

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:32.260
that are available to us?

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.430
On this green arrow right
here, which is Q times the work

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.180
function of the metal, we have
a range of different metals,

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.010
from aluminum to platinum,
and titanium, zinc, tungsten,

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.219
molybdenum, copper,
nickel, gold, in between.

00:33:45.219 --> 00:33:47.010
And of course, there
are other metals, too,

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.450
in the periodic table that
you can add to this chart.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.350
But this gives you
a sense of where

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.270
the Fermi energy of
the metal would lie,

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.280
relative to the
vacuum level, and how

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.190
that would match up against
your arbitrary semiconductor.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.790
This one here happens to be
a silicon carbide material.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.290
But if you happen to be working
on a different semiconductor

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.790
and place it right here, you
can see where your Fermi energy

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.620
would lie, relative to the
work function of the metal,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.274
if you line up
the vacuum levels.

00:34:11.274 --> 00:34:12.690
And this gives you
an idea already

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:16.949
of how the bands
will bend, once you

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:22.580
adjust the position of the metal
to match up the Fermi energy

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.532
inside of your
semiconductor material.

00:34:24.532 --> 00:34:25.032
Yeah.

00:34:25.032 --> 00:34:28.364
AUDIENCE: So on the left is
an intrinsic semiconductor?

00:34:28.364 --> 00:34:29.320
Is it?

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.494
TONIO BUONASSISI: Yeah, it's
pretty close to intrinsic.

00:34:30.494 --> 00:34:31.993
It's a little n-type,
it looks like.

00:34:31.993 --> 00:34:33.650
But it's pretty
close to intrinsic.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:38.066
This, in this case, just a
variant of silicon carbide.

00:34:38.066 --> 00:34:39.940
There are many polymorphs
of silicon carbide,

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:44.896
meaning same composition,
same silicon carbon ratio,

00:34:44.896 --> 00:34:46.270
but different
crystal structures,

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.190
depending on how it was grown.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.691
Yep?

00:34:49.691 --> 00:34:51.606
AUDIENCE: Do you know
where silver would fall?

00:34:51.606 --> 00:34:52.830
TONIO BUONASSISI: Silver?

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.150
AUDIENCE: It's not
listed [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:54.840
TONIO BUONASSISI:
No, it's listed.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.702
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
a lot for [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:56.702 --> 00:34:57.660
TONIO BUONASSISI: Yeah.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.160
I'm going to have
to guess that it's

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.640
going to fall around here,
just from a similarity

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.110
of other elemental
species in that list.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.600
Do you happen to remember the
work function of silver, Joe?

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.035
Been working with
it a lot lately.

00:35:08.035 --> 00:35:08.534
JOE: Yeah.

00:35:08.534 --> 00:35:09.075
I don't know.

00:35:09.075 --> 00:35:11.200
TONIO BUONASSISI: OK.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.800
Quick, interesting
aside about silver,

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.170
since it was brought up.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.220
It is used very often in contact
metallization in solar cells.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.080
As a matter of fact,
a bit too much now.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.780
So much so that it's driving
up the price of silver

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.342
on the market.

00:35:24.342 --> 00:35:26.800
We talked about this, I think,
in a few classes ago, right?

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.684
10%, approximately,
of all silver

00:35:28.684 --> 00:35:31.100
worldwide is currently being
used in contact metallization

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.670
in solar cells.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.720
That's a pretty high number.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.480
OK, so we have a variety
of metals to choose from,

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.310
almost like a menu.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:44.080
And then the semiconductor
here, and we can see, OK,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.840
if we make contact-- and
let's say we pick nickel,

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.220
in this case-- if the
Fermi energies line up,

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.540
that means we shift
the metal down.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.030
That means that our vacuum
level is going to fall down here

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.190
in the semiconductor.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:59.390
And for electrons, at least,
will be very easily contacting

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:02.180
this silicon carbide material.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:07.010
So from a simple energy
band diagram point of view,

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.824
we can begin to see which
contacts will create

00:36:09.824 --> 00:36:11.240
Ohmic contacts,
and which contacts

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.470
will create Schottky contacts.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.950
That's in the ideal world.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.970
In reality-- well, let me
make sure that we grasp this

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:22.960
before we move on.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.224
Any questions
concerning this so far?

00:36:30.224 --> 00:36:31.637
Yeah?

00:36:31.637 --> 00:36:33.220
AUDIENCE: How would
we be able to tell

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.382
if it's Ohmic or
Schottky in this sense?

00:36:35.382 --> 00:36:36.340
TONIO BUONASSISI: Sure.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:36.700
Sure.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.570
TONIO BUONASSISI: Absolutely.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.420
So from this diagram right
here, let's walk through it.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:45.549
So if I, say, have a
semicondting-- let's first line

00:36:45.549 --> 00:36:47.590
up the vacuum levels, like
we've done right here.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.290
That's a good first
step on, what we call,

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.010
the Anderson method
of identifying

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.470
with the band diagram or band
structure will look like.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.240
We start with the
vacuum levels lined up.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.321
I'm going to write
to this vacuum.

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:06.520
And I'm going to dray my
semiconductor on one side.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:11.920
So let's say I have conduction
band and bands bent like so.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.749
And I have my Fermi
energy like so, Ef.

00:37:15.749 --> 00:37:16.915
So this is my semiconductor.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:25.817
And then I have an
imaginary barrier,

00:37:25.817 --> 00:37:27.400
and I have my metal
on the other side.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.380
So now, let's say we have
a metal that has a work

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.480
function somewhere up here.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.640
So this is the work
function of the metal.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.890
We'll call it the Fermi
energy inside of the metal.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.790
What happens when I put
these two materials together?

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.835
Well, step one is to remove
that imaginary barrier

00:37:49.835 --> 00:37:51.014
in between them.

00:37:51.014 --> 00:37:52.430
And now, you begin
to look at this

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.225
and say, well, if
they're in contact,

00:37:54.225 --> 00:37:55.940
in good electrical
contact, and there's

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.830
no resistance
throughout the material,

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.380
the chemical potential
should be identical

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.210
all throughout the material,
from left to right.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:07.045
And so now, I merge into
phase two, which is to say,

00:38:07.045 --> 00:38:08.920
I've removed this barrier
here in the middle,

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.400
and now my Fermi energy is going
to be equilibrated throughout.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.320
So my Ef is going to
be the same throughout.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.280
And so, far away from
the junction region here

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.220
in the middle, I'm going to
draw my conduction band here

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.550
and my vacuum level here.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.017
And now, far away
from the junction

00:38:28.017 --> 00:38:30.100
on the other side in the
metal, if my Fermi energy

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.770
is here and my vacuum
energy is going

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:35.710
to be somewhere
down around here.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.002
So semiconductor and metal.

00:38:42.002 --> 00:38:43.960
Now, what happens closer
to the interface right

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.140
here-- this is the Fermi energy.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.570
This is the conduction band.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.130
This is the valence band.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:52.110
This is the vacuum level in
the semiconductor, the vacuum

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.060
level in the middle.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.970
And like we just
described, the vacuum level

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:59.430
has to be continuous.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.840
There has to be a
continuity throughout.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.950
And so what we see
here at the interface,

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.620
since the density of charge
is very high in the metal,

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.920
but lower in the
semiconductor, there's

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.760
going to be band bending
at the interface.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.300
And there's going
to be a lot more

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.450
bending on the bands
in the semiconductor

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.170
than there will be in the metal,
as a result of the difference

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:19.670
in charge densities.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.790
And so what you'll see is
something that looks like this.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:27.630
The vacuum level will drop as
it reaches that semiconductor

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:32.040
metal interface, in order
to match either side.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.530
And the conduction
band and valence bands

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:39.320
will track the vacuum level on
either side of that junction.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.470
So this is the junction
right here, in between.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.660
And now I look at this
situation right here,

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.500
and I say, OK, if I have
an electron approaching

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.360
this junction right
here, there is

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.840
no barrier to going from the
semiconductor into the metal.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.570
As a matter of fact, there's
almost an energy gain

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.410
to be had from going from the
semiconductor into the metal.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.520
But now, from the
hole's perspective,

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.740
if I'm a hole right
here in the valence band

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.650
and approaching this
junction, there's

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:08.980
actually a repulsion away from
that interface, if I'm a hole.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.460
And so this particular junction
here allows electrons to pass,

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.860
but repels holes.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.660
This is looking an
awful lot like a diode.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.160
So it's this
construction right here

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.940
that allows you to tell--
asterisk, tell, asterisk,

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.220
according to the
Schottky band diagram--

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.460
whether or not
this should behave

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.760
in an Ohmic fashion
or a Schottky

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.690
fashion for the particular
karyotype that you're probing.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.890
And I say asterisks,
because, in real life,

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:42.020
contacts are never that simple.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:46.744
This is an example right
here of the calculated-- make

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:48.160
sure I get all my
variables right.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.220
Yeah.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.511
So work function in the middle.

00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:52.710
The calculated barrier height
for different metal species

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.040
here on a certain type, a
certain polymorphous silicon

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:55.880
carbide.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:00.260
And these are the major barrier
heights for different metals,

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.000
titanium, nickel and
gold, at different faces

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.240
of the silicon carbide.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.990
So if you have a
binary semiconductor,

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:11.150
meaning a semiconductor
comprised of two elements,

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:14.250
if you terminate at a surface
and you cut the plane just

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:20.010
right, you could wind up
exposing a plane of silicon

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.680
atoms or of carbon atoms,
if you have silicon carbide,

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.150
let's say, depending
on where you cut.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:26.980
So if you cut right
here, you might expose

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.140
a plane of silicon atoms.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.060
You cut one atomic
layer above, you

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.920
might expose a row
of carbon atoms.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.920
Cut a row above that,
it's silicon again.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.420
And so depending on
what face you expose

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.580
and depending on the
orientation of that face,

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:43.830
your barrier height, relative to
the metal, could be different.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.040
So, hm.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.050
You glance at that, and you
begin thinking to yourself,

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.640
OK, this is
macroscopic right here.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.910
This tells you, kind of
from a continuum point

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:56.000
of view, what the interface
should behave like,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.800
what the context should be.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.340
But what I'm seeing
right here from the data

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.840
is that the atomic
configuration at the interface

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.280
really matters.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.710
So there must be something
going on in an atomic level,

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:10.880
as well, that's determining
the barrier at that interface.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.300
In fact, there is.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.070
The dipole at the
interface between the metal

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.770
and that last layer of
semiconductor, in other words,

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.940
the distribution of charge
between those two sets of atoms

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.610
that are meeting at an
interface determines, in part,

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.930
the barrier height.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.340
We'll get to that in
a few slides, as well.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:32.800
So this is meant to shine light
on a much broader picture,

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.260
which is to say
that there can be

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:37.290
substantial deviations
from Schottky theory

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:38.330
at the interface.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:41.080
And some of the effects are
due to orientation-dependent

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.640
surface states.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.355
It could be due to the
specific elemental nature

00:42:46.355 --> 00:42:48.600
of the terminated
surface, as we just

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.500
discussed, whether you're
terminating at the silicon

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.200
plane or the carbon plane.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.250
Orientation-dependence
means, gee,

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.430
if I have an
anisotropic crystal,

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.300
meaning a crystal that looks
a little bit different, if I

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.140
rotate it around in
different orientations,

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.160
if I make cuts in different
directions exposing

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.630
different planes, they're
going to be a different density

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.120
of atoms in that plane.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.080
There's going to be
a different charge

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.960
distribution in that plane.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.150
And hence, I would
expect there to be

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:17.540
some different interaction
between the semiconductor

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.490
and the metal at that interface.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:24.410
And finally, interface
dipoles, this relates back up

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.090
to the first one in part.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.440
This just goes to
say that, if I have

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.480
an ionic material or an element
there at that interface that

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.790
is grabbing charge,
I could result

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:38.680
in a small region
of negative charge

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.920
and positive charge
forming a dipole right

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.070
there at the interface.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:45.430
And if I have a buildup
of charge, I have a field.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.040
If I have a field,
I have a potential.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.540
And if I have a
potential, I'm going

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.082
to be disrupting this
precise interface right here.

00:43:52.082 --> 00:43:54.540
And we can, as well, vary the
density of interface states--

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.456
I got you, Ashley, I'll
be there in a second--

00:43:56.456 --> 00:43:59.920
so we can, as well, vary
the density of defect states

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.830
here at this interface
that can trap charge.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:06.040
And again, with the accumulation
of charge, comes a field.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.650
With a field comes a
deviation of the potential.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.030
So what we've done for
ourselves is, effectively,

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:17.910
using the Schottky model,
we've set up for ourselves

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:24.020
the energy band diagram of a
metal semiconductor contact

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.000
in its simplest case.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.160
And what we're going to do
over the next few slides

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.340
is explore some of
the more complexity

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.770
behind what goes into a
semiconductor metal contact.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:35.140
Ashley?

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.860
ASHLEY: So going back
that with the green line,

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.260
so these metals,
given some [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.335
up there on the left, would all
result in Schottky contacts?

00:44:45.335 --> 00:44:46.610
Is that right?

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:48.090
Because all of
their work functions

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:51.902
are above the Fermi level?

00:44:51.902 --> 00:44:52.860
TONIO BUONASSISI: Yeah.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.529
ASHLEY: Assuming [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:54.529 --> 00:44:56.070
TONIO BUONASSISI:
So yeah, it depends

00:44:56.070 --> 00:45:02.540
on what is the minority carrier
in this particular junction

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.330
that's driving it.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.080
Because this is intrinsic,
it's a little difficult to say,

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:06.820
actually.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.210
But if it was clear
there was n- or p-type,

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:14.420
and the minority carrier
density at that interface

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.156
was determining the
current flow across it,

00:45:17.156 --> 00:45:18.780
then we'd be able to
say with certainty

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.960
whether it was one
type or another.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.435
ASHLEY: OK.

00:45:20.435 --> 00:45:20.910
TONIO BUONASSISI: But, yeah.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.166
ASHLEY: So if it were--

00:45:22.166 --> 00:45:24.290
TONIO BUONASSISI: So in
this case right over here--

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.248
let's make it specific.

00:45:25.248 --> 00:45:25.770
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:27.728
TONIO BUONASSISI: In this
case right over here,

00:45:27.728 --> 00:45:30.890
let's make this an
n-type material.

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:34.500
So my Ef is now higher.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.240
Ew.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.760
OK.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.660
That actually had
the opposite effect.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.000
Let's exacerbate this a bit.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.750
I'm actually going to
invert that and make

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.960
this a p-type material.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.920
The reason is I want a big
delta in my Fermi energies

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.510
right here, if my vacuum
level is constant,

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:53.480
so to exacerbate that band
bending at the interface.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.240
And so now, I'm going to get
a pretty drastic band bending.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.650
It'll be even more extreme
than what I drew here.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:05.254
But let's say it's fine.

00:46:05.254 --> 00:46:09.860
So what we would have to do
is we would have to move this

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:13.549
down further, right?

00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:14.090
Actually, no.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:14.590
Sorry.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:17.010
This wouldn't change, because
this is still the same.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.468
What we've done
here is essentially

00:46:18.468 --> 00:46:20.570
shifted everything up further.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:25.540
So to be more precise, we'd have
to move this up, move this up.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.120
And we'd have to move
this up, as well.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.590
Again, p-type material.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:30.620
Excellent.

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.090
And now, again, just
going through the logic

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:39.590
of the process here, we have to
make the vacuum levels match.

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:43.670
And there's going to be
an equal amount of charge

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:45.670
on either side of that junction.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.900
Now, when there's a
charge, there's a field.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.649
When there's a field,
there's a potential.

00:46:49.649 --> 00:46:53.670
And the potential
will be manifested

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.535
in the bending of those bands
approaching the interface.

00:46:56.535 --> 00:46:58.660
The bands will bend a lot
more in the semiconductor

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.516
than they will in the metal,
because the free charge

00:47:01.516 --> 00:47:02.890
density here in
the semiconductor

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.870
is a lot less than
it is in the metal.

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:08.710
And going back to this
equation right here,

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:12.660
the width of the
region of bent bands

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.040
is going to depend inversely
on the dopant density

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.500
or the amount of
charge in that region.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.170
So this is to say
that we'll have

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:23.670
a much more extreme bending
here in the semiconductor

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.092
than we will in the metal.

00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:27.462
Virtually imperceptible
there in the metal.

00:47:27.462 --> 00:47:29.300
And we drop this down, as well.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.630
And we drop this down, as well.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:33.890
So some really
interesting things

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:38.420
have happened right here to the
position of the Fermi energy

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.280
in the band gap, right?

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.970
Over here, we have
a p-type material.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:46.030
And over here, at
the surface layer,

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.443
it almost looks like this
material is going n-type.

00:47:48.443 --> 00:47:49.039
ASHLEY: Right.

00:47:49.039 --> 00:47:51.330
TONIO BUONASSISI: Let me
pause right here, because this

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:53.038
is just utterly
fascinating, and tell you

00:47:53.038 --> 00:47:54.982
the story about indium nitride.

00:47:54.982 --> 00:47:56.690
It's a common material
that many people--

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:59.420
I see a few knowing nods
here in the audience.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.140
So indium nitride was a
semiconducting material

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.200
that people really didn't
have a good handle on

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.590
for a variety of reasons.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:08.220
And there was a
renewed interest in it,

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.060
because people finally started
to understand why the band

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.790
gap was the way it was.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.440
And many groups
started studying it.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.170
And they also reporting
this n-type indium nitride

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.920
behavior, very highly
n-type material,

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.550
highly doped n-type material.

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.170
It turned out that there
was this band bending here

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:27.230
at the surface.

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:30.790
And they were measuring a
high electron concentration

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:33.540
at the surface, because
of the bending of bands.

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.390
It was in reality the intrinsic
material deep in the bulk

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:37.367
was p-type.

00:48:37.367 --> 00:48:39.450
But they just couldn't see
it because their probes

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:42.610
were touching the
semiconductor at the surface.

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:47.220
It took a certain scientist
by the name of Becca Jones

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.050
in Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley
Lab, I believe, at the time.

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:53.030
She immersed the sample
into a liquid solution

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.420
of an acid-- I believe it
was hydrofluoric acid--

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.010
and managed to relieve
the pinning of the bands

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.860
at the surface.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.151
And so they returned to normal.

00:49:00.151 --> 00:49:03.030
And she was able to probe
using a semiconductor liquid

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:06.940
junction, the true
conductivity type

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.670
of the bulk of the material.

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:12.675
Becca Jones then went on to
produce what is now the-- oh,

00:49:12.675 --> 00:49:14.050
she was on the
team that produced

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.050
one of the highest
efficiency cells

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.863
on the efficiency
versus time plots.

00:49:19.863 --> 00:49:23.410
So she's doing well for
herself there in the PV world.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.115
Yeah.

00:49:24.115 --> 00:49:25.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:25.780
TONIO BUONASSISI: Sorry.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:26.120
Sorry.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.260
So let me get back to that.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.670
What would happen if you
were an electron right here

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:32.790
and you were approaching
this junction?

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:36.820
This is E. This is the
energy of electrons.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:39.350
So the electron will
seek to minimize,

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:41.721
it will seek to encounter
a lower energy state.

00:49:41.721 --> 00:49:43.970
So if you're approaching
this junction as an electron,

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:44.720
what would happen?

00:49:47.034 --> 00:49:47.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:48.250
TONIO BUONASSISI: Zoom.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:48.790
Yep.

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:49.520
So it's go down.

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.794
And there wouldn't be any
barrier for it to do so.

00:49:51.794 --> 00:49:52.460
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:52.800
TONIO BUONASSISI:
It would just go,

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.258
[MAKES WHOOSH SOUND]
straight down.

00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:56.140
Now, let's inverse the
situation and imagine,

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.190
what if you're a
hole right here?

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:00.940
What now?

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.810
If you think of electrons
as bowling balls

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:04.550
that want to roll
down hills, holes

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:06.350
would be the opposite,
which would be like balloons

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.420
that want to rise, right?

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:07.770
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.960
TONIO BUONASSISI: And so this is
actually a barrier for a hole.

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.640
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.848
TONIO BUONASSISI: You need
a certain amount of energy

00:50:12.848 --> 00:50:14.550
to get the hole across.

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.490
And so the hole naturally will
be repelled by this junction.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:18.906
The hole will want
to go this way.

00:50:18.906 --> 00:50:21.049
The electron will
want to go that way.

00:50:21.049 --> 00:50:21.590
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:25.106
So this is Schottky for
electrons, but Ohmic-- sorry,

00:50:25.106 --> 00:50:26.980
Schottky for holes and
Ohmic for [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:27.630
TONIO BUONASSISI:
Let's imagine we

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:30.451
have a device that is driven
by the minority carrier flux

00:50:30.451 --> 00:50:31.700
here at this interface, right?

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.310
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:33.580
TONIO BUONASSISI: And so
what is the minority carrier

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.470
in this particular case?

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.610
AUDIENCE: So the left is p-type,
and so the minority carrier

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:39.550
would be electrons?

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:40.110
TONIO BUONASSISI: Yep.

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:40.750
Exactly.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:44.793
So what would you expect
this contact to behave like?

00:50:44.793 --> 00:50:48.982
AUDIENCE: So it'd be Schottky
for-- no, Ohmic for electrons.

00:50:48.982 --> 00:50:50.690
TONIO BUONASSISI: So
this one right here,

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.940
the electrons would be able
to flow over quite easily.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.490
So in the illuminated case
where the current would

00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:58.800
be driven by the
minority carrier flux,

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.915
you would expect to see a
behavior without a barrier.

00:51:01.915 --> 00:51:02.456
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:02.456 --> 00:51:03.524
So Ohmic for--

00:51:03.524 --> 00:51:04.440
TONIO BUONASSISI: Yep.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.240
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.750
TONIO BUONASSISI: Now, it
can become a little bit more

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.742
complicated, but let's
leave that right there.

00:51:11.742 --> 00:51:12.408
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:51:12.408 --> 00:51:13.336
OK.

00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:16.520
AUDIENCE: If you have a
Schottkys barrier like

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.495
that, it's just extracting
electrons or holes,

00:51:19.495 --> 00:51:22.800
then is the relevant quantity
on the left a quasi-Fermi

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.680
energy for electrons or holes?

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.822
Or is it it's always the
overall Fermi energy?

00:51:26.822 --> 00:51:27.780
TONIO BUONASSISI: Yeah.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.380
So you raise an
interesting point,

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.030
which is the question
of quasi-Fermi energy.

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:37.110
So if you illuminate your
device or you forward-bias it,

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:37.920
what happens?

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.540
Now, you start
injecting carriers.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.570
And as we discussed
during class the time,

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:44.020
the total carrier
density is going

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:47.600
to be equal to, let's call
it, the intrinsic carrier

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.070
concentration plus
the dopant density,

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:53.250
if this n would be
the density of donors,

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:58.080
plus my delta n, which is the
injected carrier concentration.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:02.290
So in this particular case--
let's parse this through-- this

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:04.150
is going to be small,
so we can ignore that.

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:05.515
Well, actually, no.

00:52:05.515 --> 00:52:07.420
For the electrons
in this case, this

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.530
will actually be quite big.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:13.350
This is going to be
smaller, rather negligible.

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:18.250
And let's think this
through carefully here.

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:21.890
So under equilibrium conditions,
under equilibrium conditions--

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:25.110
let's describe this
as an n0, briefly.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.870
So under equilibrium
conditions, my n0

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.620
is going to be rather
small because, if I

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.490
have a high dopant density
of p-type material,

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:35.740
that means that my
electron and my n0

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:39.610
is going to be equal to
ni squared divided by p0.

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:43.300
And if p0 is in the order
of, say, 10 to the 16,

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.240
ni would be nearer
to 10 to the 10.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:49.000
We'd have something in the
order of 10 to the 4 for n0.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.700
That would be a
rather small number.

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.780
Now, if I inject light
on it, I could have, say,

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.020
10 to the 14 electrons
being created.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.090
So this drowns out
everything else.

00:52:57.090 --> 00:53:00.180
So now, my electron
concentration

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.000
is going to be driven
by the free carrier

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.180
concentration, the photo-excited
carrier concentration.

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.580
Now, on the p, on
the other hand,

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:12.800
this is going to be
equal to p0 plus delta p.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.710
So let me drag this over here.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:18.370
The delta p is still on the
same order as the delta n,

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:20.930
let's say, 10 to the 13,
somewhere in that range.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:26.130
But my p0 is equal to the dopant
density, acceptor density,

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.420
which could be on the
order of 10 to the 16.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:32.620
So this will be somewhere in
the range of, say, 10 to the 16,

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.450
driven by the acceptor
concentration.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:38.560
And so now, I have a
situation in which I have 10

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.740
to the 13 electrons and
maybe 10 to the 16 holes.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.205
And if I multiply
the two together,

00:53:44.205 --> 00:53:46.330
I'm not getting the intrinsic
carrier concentration

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:49.630
squared, because I'm not
under dark conditions.

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:51.310
I'm not under
equilibrium conditions.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:53.070
I'm in a steady state condition.

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:53.900
I'm shining light.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:54.982
I'm exciting carriers.

00:53:54.982 --> 00:53:56.690
They're recombining,
but at steady state.

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:59.290
I'm shining light,
generating the carrier again.

00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:02.180
And we reach this
quasi-equilibrium.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.440
And so what we have,
at the end of the day,

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.690
is a separation of
the Fermi energy

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:08.130
between electrons and holes.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:09.600
The Fermi energy
for holes is going

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.750
to be relatively constant.

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:12.541
But the electrons for
the minority carrier,

00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:15.010
you'll have a rise of
that quasi-Fermi energy,

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:18.120
because now you're filling in
more of your electrons up here.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.230
And so the Fermi
energy, as defined

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:25.860
as the energy state that has
a 50% occupancy probability,

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.730
is now at a different energy
for electrons or for holes.

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:29.510
Awesome.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:31.280
It's really one of
those things that

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.592
takes a while to really
wrap your mind around.

00:54:34.592 --> 00:54:36.970
And so now, we might
have a situation

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:42.430
which my electron quasi-Fermi
energy is somewhere up here.

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.200
Let's make it a
little bit-- I don't

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.250
want to get into what's called
a two-dimension electron gas.

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.510
I'll draw it
somewhere down here.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.090
So now, I have
this distance here

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.310
is defined by the minority
current diffusion length,

00:54:58.310 --> 00:55:00.924
typically, from the junction.

00:55:00.924 --> 00:55:02.667
AUDIENCE: And as
the electrons drop

00:55:02.667 --> 00:55:05.904
from that quasi-Fermi
energy to the Fermi energy

00:55:05.904 --> 00:55:07.404
of the metal, what happens?

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:09.070
TONIO BUONASSISI: So
the important thing

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:13.640
to think about is current flow
can be reduced to electrons

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.960
within the conduction
band, discrete particles

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.380
that are seeking to
minimize their free energy.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.680
The voltage or the
potential across

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.994
is dictated by the ensemble.

00:55:21.994 --> 00:55:24.118
And that's where the Fermi
energies come into play.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.990
So in that particular case,
it might even cause the Fermi

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:33.930
energy over here to rise a bit.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:36.480
And then you have
a potential across.

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.830
If you had a wire connecting
this to an external load,

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:40.350
you'd actually be
able to power it.

00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:41.850
The electrons would
be photo-excited

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:46.180
in here, would be driven
over into the metal,

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.744
because of the built-in field.

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.910
And then they'd be able to
power an external circuit

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:51.480
and come back into the back.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.580
So you're beginning
to see something that

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:53.871
looks a lot like a PN junction.

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:04.260
And in this particular case,
the dark current for electrons

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:07.042
would be dictated by their flow
back into the semiconductor.

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:14.982
So yes, in this
particular case here--

00:56:14.982 --> 00:56:16.940
let me correct myself--
in this particular case

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.540
here, for the
electron, you would

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.410
have a barrier for the
diffusion current, which

00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:27.550
would be driven from the metal
into the base right here.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.040
And so the diffusion
current of the electrons

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.780
would be facing
this barrier here.

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.540
And this would be
Schottky-like in nature.

00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.530
If you illuminate it,
your illumination current

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:41.460
would-- so let me back
up one step right here.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:47.730
So in the dark, a completely
dark sample right here,

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:49.157
that I-V characteristic
is driven

00:56:49.157 --> 00:56:51.240
by the diffusion current
of electrons to the metal

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.470
and to the semiconductor.

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:56.370
And that is, in this
case, with the barrier.

00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:57.870
And as you begin
forward-biasing it,

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:00.180
you would have more and
more carriers coming across.

00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:03.370
And that would drive the
diffusion current forward.

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:06.284
The illumination current would
be driving the opposite way.

00:57:06.284 --> 00:57:08.200
And so, if you illuminated
this entire system,

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.894
your blue curve
would shift down.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.750
Let's say, if you're
photo-exciting carriers

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:20.150
within the base right
here, they can very easily

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:21.380
reach the metal.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:25.110
But if you're putting contacts
and probing the total current

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:28.030
flowing through your
system, in the dark,

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.230
you would be measuring
the diffusion current

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:33.410
from the metal into
the semiconductor.

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:36.140
There's some positive
electrons over here.

00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:39.140
And so the electrons will
be driven from the metal

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.360
into the semiconductor.

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.210
And they would be
facing this barrier.

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:44.600
And hence, you would see
a Schottky-like behavior.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:45.141
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:45.141 --> 00:57:48.438
So in the dark, it would be
Schottky-like for electrons.

00:57:48.438 --> 00:57:49.840
And in the [INAUDIBLE]--

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.340
TONIO BUONASSISI:
So you think of it

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.782
in terms of total current.

00:57:52.782 --> 00:57:53.990
Yes, you're absolutely right.

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.410
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:56.910
TONIO BUONASSISI: And the holes
would be equal and opposite.

00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:58.470
Then, when you
illuminate it, current

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:01.710
would start flowing
the other direction.

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:04.790
So in the dark, the
current is flowing, say,

00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:07.295
in the positive direction.

00:58:07.295 --> 00:58:08.920
And let's define the
positive direction

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:12.420
as electrons flowing
from here to here,

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:16.540
which means that positive flow
is going from left to right.

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:17.790
So that makes sense.

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:20.540
And when we illuminate it,
now, instead of the electrons

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:22.490
flowing from the
right into the left,

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:25.930
we have the illumination current
driving electrons from the left

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:27.210
and to the right.

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:29.220
So the direction of
current is reversed,

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.750
when we illuminate this.

00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:32.330
And that's the same
thing as saying,

00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:35.950
I'm going to shift this
down under illumination

00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:40.170
and wind up with something that
behaves very similar to a PN

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.296
junction.

00:58:42.296 --> 00:58:42.920
AUDIENCE: Wait.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:47.338
I thought we said that, under
illumination conditions,

00:58:47.338 --> 00:58:49.306
this situation is
Ohmic for electrons.

00:58:49.306 --> 00:58:50.290
Or is that not true?

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:51.290
TONIO BUONASSISI: Sorry.

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.350
The electrons have no
barrier to travel over here

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:54.385
for the illumination current.

00:58:54.385 --> 00:58:54.760
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:54.980
Oh, so this--

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:55.940
TONIO BUONASSISI: So the
illumination current's

00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.020
going to be constant throughout.

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.353
AUDIENCE: So it's-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:58.353 --> 00:59:01.250
TONIO BUONASSISI: But for
the diffusion current--

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:04.004
the net current behavior, the
net I-V characteristic of this

00:59:04.004 --> 00:59:04.920
will be Schottky-like.

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:05.909
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:07.700
TONIO BUONASSISI: But
the diffusion current

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:11.080
is the one that's driving
the current in that case.

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:14.520
And the illumination current
is being driven by the minority

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:18.210
carrier flow right here at the
edge of the metal semiconductor

00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:19.364
contact.

00:59:19.364 --> 00:59:19.906
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:59:19.906 --> 00:59:21.822
TONIO BUONASSISI: Joe,
why don't we flag this?

00:59:21.822 --> 00:59:24.250
I sense this is going to
be an item for discussion

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:27.167
during the recitation session.

00:59:27.167 --> 00:59:28.960
JOE: Sorry. [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.440
TONIO BUONASSISI: Just the
metal semiconductor interface,

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.540
I think, we're going to
have to go through it

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.440
from scratch again.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.790
This is very, very
similar to a PN junction.

00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:37.380
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:37.860
TONIO BUONASSISI:
So I think where

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:40.290
folks are getting tripped
up is thinking about--

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:42.050
and even I sometimes
get tripped up--

00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:44.540
is thinking about what happens
to the illuminated current

00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.980
and what happens to the drift
current and the diffusion

00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:48.803
current.

00:59:48.803 --> 00:59:49.790
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:50.780
TONIO BUONASSISI: So
it's all very similar.

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.770
It's all stuff
we've seen before.

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:53.630
We just have to think
through it step by step

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:55.796
and make sure we don't get
tripped up along the way.

00:59:55.796 --> 00:59:56.910
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:57.785
TONIO BUONASSISI: OK.

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.590
So let's talk about some
of the non-idealities

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:06.390
because this is where
the fun stuff lies.

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:10.670
When we have a metal
on a semiconductor,

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:13.410
a lot goes into it.

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:16.160
For example, if we have
interface states or surface

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.040
states, we can form band
bending there at that interface.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.500
Let me demonstrate how.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.150
This is an article that everyone
should have read already.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.270
It was part of the
assigned reading today.

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.994
And if my past
experience is a guide,

01:00:28.994 --> 01:00:30.410
there is a fixed
percentage of you

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:31.951
who haven't seen it
yet, so I'm going

01:00:31.951 --> 01:00:34.750
to pass around the article
that you should have read.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:38.710
So this is something-- feel
free to skim through it,

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:42.390
gain an appreciation for,
really, the spectacular nature

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:43.230
of that article.

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:44.896
And then pass it
around your colleagues.

01:00:44.896 --> 01:00:48.350
Make sure everybody
gets to see them.

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:51.850
On the left-hand side, we have
an example of a semiconductor,

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.420
let's say, surface.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.240
The surface is represented
by this really large band gap

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.720
material right there, that
box, that rectilinear box,

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.550
very thin and skinny.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:04.560
It's thin because the
surface layer is very thin.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.102
It's maybe a few nanometers,
typically, in a semiconductor.

01:01:07.102 --> 01:01:08.560
And it's very large
and band gapped

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.800
because we formed a
semiconductor and oxide,

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.890
let's say, a silicon oxide, a
silica layer at that surface.

01:01:14.890 --> 01:01:17.190
So if we have pure silicon
and we expose it to air,

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:21.070
the silicon will react with air
and form a very thin SiO2 layer

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:22.447
or silicon oxide layer.

01:01:22.447 --> 01:01:23.780
And that's what this represents.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.790
This is a very large band gap
material, and it's very thin.

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:28.800
And so if there are
no interface states,

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.530
if we have an ideal material,
we have our semiconductor

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:34.390
over here and our
surface layer there.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.180
And at that interface, boom.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:40.290
You just have a discontinuity
in the conduction bands.

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:43.350
And of course, the vacuum
levels are matching up.

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:47.580
But in the case where
you have surface states

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.050
at that interface, what happens?

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:51.490
Well now, those
surface states can

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:56.480
be filled by electrons in
the neighboring region.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.630
And as a result, you'll
have a natural band

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:01.360
bending at that interface.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.267
So as you begin filling
in those states,

01:02:03.267 --> 01:02:05.100
another way to think
about it is that you're

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.440
pulling the Fermi
energy toward mid-gap,

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.990
because now, as the
electrons are depleted

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:13.770
from that near-surface region,
as they fall into those surface

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:16.979
states, the Fermi energy is
going to shift towards mid-gap.

01:02:16.979 --> 01:02:19.270
And if you indeed look at
the semiconductor, right here

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:21.620
at the surface, you'll see
the Fermi energy is almost

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.450
at the mid-gap.

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:26.060
And so this is a very
curious phenomenon that

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.740
occurs in many semiconductors.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.840
There's a natural band
bend toward the surface,

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.010
depending on the
surface chemistry.

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:36.424
If you have a semi-conducting
oxide forming at the surface,

01:02:36.424 --> 01:02:37.840
or if you happen
to be exposing it

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.080
to a sulfur based gas
right after you grow it,

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.170
and you form some
sulfide at the surface,

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:46.827
the surface chemistry is
very important for dictating

01:02:46.827 --> 01:02:48.160
the band bending at the surface.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.429
Why is that important?

01:02:49.429 --> 01:02:51.720
That's important because,
when you go ahead and deposit

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.770
a metal on top of
it, now, you not only

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.730
have to contend with what
the semiconductor is doing,

01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:00.700
but what that semiconductor
surface layer is doing.

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:03.970
Now, the situation is
really becoming complex.

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:07.900
So this is meant to
represent right here what

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.760
happens when you have
a metal-- in this case,

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.550
a semi-conducting oxide
semiconductor interface,

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:18.870
also known as a MOS, metal oxide
semiconductor-- what happens?

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:22.680
Well, in an ideal case,
you would have the bands

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.850
bending a certain way.

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:28.000
And then, with the metal
oxide layer in between,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.960
you can have a definite shift.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.550
So what this is meant
to represent right here

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:35.120
is a metal with a
work function that

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.520
is larger than the
electron affinity,

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.730
and a work function that is
smaller than the electron

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:40.620
affinity.

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.960
And so, given what
we've seen before,

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.110
given the Schottky method
of producing the band

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:50.790
diagrams here, we would
expect that, in this case,

01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:52.920
we would see bands
bending, say, down.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.450
And in that case-- let's see.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:54.590
No.

01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:55.920
In this case, we'd
see bands bending down

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.690
in the semiconductor.

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.398
And in this case, the
bands would bend up

01:03:58.398 --> 01:04:00.420
in the semiconductor as
we reach that interface.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:05.080
But because the Fermi energy is
pinned by these surface states

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:11.460
here, we have very little
motion of those bands.

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:14.270
And so we wind up in a
case where we pin the Fermi

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:17.100
energy at the surface
and, pretty much,

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.710
no matter what metal we
deposit on top of our sample,

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:21.240
we can wind up
with a certain type

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.150
of behavior of
the semiconductor,

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:25.360
a certain current
voltage response.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.381
And this can drive
someone absolutely insane

01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:29.880
when you're in the
laboratory trying

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.910
to get a repeatable
contact and everything

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.450
is changing all the time.

01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:35.190
And you walk through
the math, and you

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:38.420
know that you should be getting,
let's say, an Ohmic contact.

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:41.970
You walk through the math,
and you derive the energy band

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:43.020
diagram of the interface.

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.769
And you go to the lab,
and over, and over,

01:04:44.769 --> 01:04:46.920
and over again, you
obtain a Schottky contact.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.920
And it just drives you insane.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:55.160
The trick is to always use
repeatable surface preparation.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.900
Always prepare
your surfaces using

01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:01.630
the same chemistry, the
same way, every single time.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:05.130
And if you do that, most
likely, in many cases,

01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:07.630
you can get rid of this
native surface oxide

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.080
on your semiconducting sample.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.400
But if you take your sample
out of the growth chamber

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.099
and move it around
in air and then

01:05:13.099 --> 01:05:14.640
put it into the
metallization chamber

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.340
where you evaporate
your contacts,

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:19.110
you're exposing your
sample to the air.

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:21.040
You'll form some
surface layer on it,

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.590
and your contacts
will be different.

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:25.610
There was a colleague
of mine, who's now

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:27.075
a professor at a university.

01:05:27.075 --> 01:05:31.090
And during his PhD, I
think he spent about a year

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:34.550
on a problem like this,
trying to make good contacts.

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:37.460
And unfortunately,
contacts, it's

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:41.990
such a basic thing that
it's one of the first skills

01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:45.024
to go when the field moves on.

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:46.440
So for example,
people really knew

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.230
how to make good contacts
at MIT 30 years ago,

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:53.240
when the IC industry was
the hot topic of the day.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.860
Then, as that phased
out, the knowledge

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:59.920
of how to make good contact
onto silicon disappeared.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.700
There was maybe one
or two professors

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.980
who really had that knowledge
embedded in their minds.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.360
And so, when a new
PhD student came along

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.790
at Harvard University
trying to make

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:10.640
Ohmic contact into
silicon, there

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.615
wasn't anybody he could
go to and talk to.

01:06:12.615 --> 01:06:14.670
He didn't know where
to start or who

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.970
to talk to, because this
is kind of base knowledge.

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:20.860
It's really fundamental,
instrumental knowledge

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.960
that is going to be
infinitely useful.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.330
But it quickly gets lost
when a field moves on,

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.650
when the next material
system becomes hot,

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:33.030
or the next topical area is the
key research area of the day.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:36.110
If you know how to make good
contacts onto a semiconductor,

01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:38.070
I guarantee you, you
will find someplace

01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:39.662
in industry or
someplace in academia

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.620
where you'll be well-sought
out, and that skill

01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:43.452
will be put to good use.

01:06:43.452 --> 01:06:45.410
Let's talk about this
space-charge region width

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:48.510
very briefly, because
we're running out of time.

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:50.230
We've talked about
this barrier as being

01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:52.450
this insurmountable
barrier, let's say,

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:55.300
for an electron to travel
over, in this case,

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.660
to get to the metal.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:00.260
But what happens if we
increase the dopant density

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.819
within the semiconductor?

01:07:01.819 --> 01:07:04.110
If we increase the dopant
density in the semiconductor,

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:08.330
then the amount of charge per
unit volume at that interface

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:11.840
or per unit thickness at
the interface increases.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.400
So to compensate some buildup
of charge in the metal,

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.640
we would need a thinner
region of the semiconductor,

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.470
because it's more heavily doped,
because there are more dopants

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:22.136
per cubic centimeter.

01:07:22.136 --> 01:07:24.635
And hence, there are more free
carriers per cubic centimeter

01:07:24.635 --> 01:07:26.060
as well.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:28.600
And as a result, the width
of this space-charge region

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.521
will decrease.

01:07:30.521 --> 01:07:32.770
And if the width of the
space-charge region decreases,

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:33.730
what happens?

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:36.750
This barrier height
still stays the same.

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:39.520
The barrier height doesn't
change, but the width changes.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.320
And what do we know
from quantum mechanics,

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.390
if our barrier is very,
very thin or very narrow?

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:45.110
What happens?

01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:45.752
Electrons will?

01:07:45.752 --> 01:07:46.460
AUDIENCE: Tunnel.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.501
TONIO BUONASSISI: Tunnel.

01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:49.390
And that's exactly what
happens right here.

01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:53.310
So if we have a very
narrow space-charge region,

01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:56.850
we'll have a tunneling
junction, field emission effect,

01:07:56.850 --> 01:07:58.090
it's also known as.

01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:01.150
And irrespective of
the barrier height,

01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:04.330
you will get electrons
moving straight across.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:09.247
Now, if we have a wide barrier--
represented there at the top--

01:08:09.247 --> 01:08:11.080
there is an energy
barrier for the electrons

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:15.210
to overcome before they reach
the metal on the other side.

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:17.779
And so there, we have
a thermionic emission,

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:21.729
which means that you need
to have an excited electron,

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:24.250
thermally excited-- that's
where the name therm comes

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.359
from-- so thermally
excited electron,

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:28.130
before it manages to hop across.

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:29.939
And because there's
and exponentially

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.064
decaying number of electrons
with higher and higher

01:08:32.064 --> 01:08:34.830
energies, we'll get a very
small number of electrons

01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:36.300
that can actually make it.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.490
So the thermionic emission
case will, in effect,

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:43.470
manifest itself as a
higher series resistance

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:45.090
than the field emission case.

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:48.870
You can have the same metal
contacting a semiconductor.

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:52.870
But if the dopant
density is changing,

01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:55.180
you will make a
better Ohmic contact.

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.470
And of course, when
you're actually

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:01.140
trying to measure the contact
resistance here or measure

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.649
the barrier height,
you really have

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:06.040
to know this interface
really, really well.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.990
You can measure experimentally.

01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:09.890
But to determine
from theory, you

01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:12.090
get a good start by
using the Schottky

01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:13.459
models we described right here.

01:09:13.459 --> 01:09:16.000
But to really nail it, you need
to perform density functional

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.833
theory and determine
the charge distribution

01:09:17.833 --> 01:09:19.709
across that interface.

01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:22.729
It's really the best
way to go about it.

01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:24.779
So in terms of
experiment, thankfully,

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:27.220
there are big tables
that we can look up.

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.140
If we have a particular
semiconducting material that's

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.410
well-studied, we can look
up the contact materials

01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:35.930
that would make the best
contacts, and what techniques

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:39.040
we can use to deposit them, what
temperature we should anele at

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.359
to form that alloy.

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:42.229
These are very
practical look up tables

01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:45.670
that exist in reference
books, trusted websites-- not

01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:48.635
any website, but the trusted
ones-- review articles.

01:09:48.635 --> 01:09:51.010
But let's say you're working
on a semiconducting material

01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:52.529
that's not on this list.

01:09:52.529 --> 01:09:55.220
Let's say you're working on
cuprous oxide, for instance,

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.940
and you have to
start from scratch.

01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.610
The best way to go
about it would simply

01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:01.580
be to measure the contact
resistance using the techniques

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:04.360
that we described two lectures
ago where we described the TLM

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:13.240
method or the-- sorry, not
much sleep-- the Transfer Line

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:13.940
Method.

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:16.897
So the important
thing here is to know

01:10:16.897 --> 01:10:19.230
that you do have a few tools
at your disposal to measure

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:21.330
barrier heights experimentally.

01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:26.290
And at the end of the day, you
can obtain precise numbers.

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:29.420
Just going quickly
into heterojunctions.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.055
This is similar to
the Schottky junctions

01:10:32.055 --> 01:10:34.430
we've been talking about so
far, Schottky, Ohmic contacts

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.750
between metals and
semiconductors.

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:39.100
This, very, very
briefly, is what

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.810
happens when a semiconductor
meets a semiconductor.

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:45.720
Not always can you form
a homo-type junction,

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.160
meaning not always can you
have n- and p-type dopants

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.290
in a semiconductor like silicon.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:54.160
Sometimes, it just won't
dope both n- and p-type.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.180
And so you have to make contact
with another semiconducting

01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:57.920
material.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.090
And for that, we call
it a heterojunction.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:02.649
And there are three general
types of heterojunctions.

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.190
One in which you
have a wide band gap

01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:07.390
material on the left, a narrow
band gap material on the right.

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:09.040
The two are in contact
with each other.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.630
And the vacuum levels
line up into such a way

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:15.060
as to wind up with
this band alignment.

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.060
Now, let's say I excite
an electron hole pair

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.520
in this wide band gap material.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.550
The hole will be
able to move across.

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:22.449
The electron will be
able to move across.

01:11:22.449 --> 01:11:24.990
So both the electron and hole
have moved across the junction,

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.960
and we have not
separated charge.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.400
So type one, very bad from the
photovoltaic point of view.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.150
Type two, this is more
similar to the PN junction,

01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:34.990
what we've seen so far.

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.880
And in this particular
case, if you

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.850
excite an electron-hole
pair, the electron

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:40.630
will move across
because of the field,

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.456
but the hole will be repelled.

01:11:42.456 --> 01:11:44.580
And so the type two junction
is actually preferred,

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:47.150
from a photovoltaic
point of view.

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:50.180
Type three junction will
still separate charge.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.312
The electron will move
from the left-hand side

01:11:52.312 --> 01:11:53.270
to the right-hand side.

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:54.750
And the hole will be repelled.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:57.480
But now that the electron has
moved to the right-hand side,

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.450
it actually has a lower energy
than on the right-hand side.

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.050
So there is no driving force.

01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:04.050
There's no voltage built
up for the electron

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:06.280
to go across, outside
of an external circuit

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.070
and power and external load.

01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:09.940
And so, from a
photovoltaic point of view,

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.330
the type three, unless
under very high illumination

01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:16.220
conditions, is generally
considered not desirable,

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:16.860
as well.

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:20.510
So the type two junction is
the preferred junction type

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:22.670
for photovoltaic devices.

01:12:22.670 --> 01:12:26.000
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.270
So you can go through the
exercise shown right here

01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:31.790
on your own and determine,
for this particular system

01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:34.250
right here, what will
happen at that junction.

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:35.960
How will those bands align?

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.150
You have the cheat
sheet shown right after.

01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:41.540
But an open question
for you is, using

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:44.600
what you know from today where
we first lined up the vacuum

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:48.080
levels, drew out the band
diagrams independently

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.850
for material one
and material two,

01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:52.270
just like we've done there,
now we eliminate that barrier

01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.936
in between them.

01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:55.890
We put them together, and
we match the Fermi energies.

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:59.540
In other words, this Fermi
energy, Ef 1 has to equal Ef 2.

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.180
So there has to be this
shift going on like that.

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.730
What happens then?

01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:06.210
How will the bands align?

01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:07.380
Follow the vacuum level.

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.860
That's my best advice
I can give you.

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.890
Let the conduction
band and valence

01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:15.890
bands follow the bending
of the vacuum level.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:17.400
And then, from
there, you should be

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.720
able to determine the
final structure that'll

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.140
look something like that.

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.400
But that's a
take-home assignment,

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.380
just to see if the concepts
really jelled today.

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.440
So what did we learn how to do?

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.610
Or at least, what do we have
a greater appreciation for?

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.340
We have a greater
appreciation for all

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.970
of these different
components, how

01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:41.290
to make different
types of contacts

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:44.300
on a material, what they're
good for, and ultimately, how

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:48.630
this band alignment that we've
learned in our PN junction

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:52.040
expropriations can be applied
as well to metal contacts,

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.910
and ultimately,
how this can also

01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:56.550
be applied to semiconductor,
semiconductor contacts where

01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:58.674
we might have two different
types of semiconductors

01:13:58.674 --> 01:14:00.770
coming together and
forming a junction.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:03.200
How do we predict what
the energy band diagram

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.700
is going to look like, once
we have our final junction

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:07.520
right here?

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.110
And what do we expect that
to mean, in terms of charge

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:12.140
transport across that layer?

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.390
So those are the building
blocks, the basic building

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:18.840
blocks that you will need
to be able to predict how

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.230
two materials will behave
when they encounter each other

01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:24.010
and so that you can
make solar cell devices.

01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:27.180
And I think, with that,
we can pretty much wrap up

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:29.650
our fundamentals
portion of the class.

01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:30.530
Woo-hoo!

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:33.390
We get to talk about
technologies next.
